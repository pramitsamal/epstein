The final choice he was made to board a non-stop flight to Moscow on June 23, 2013.
To remain in Hong Kong once a criminal complaint was leveled against him would have meant
that, at the very minimum, Hong Kong authorities would seize him and the alleged stolen property
of the US government in his possession. Even if he was released on bail, the Hong Kong
authorities would almost certainly retain all the NSA and GCHQ files he had gone to such lengths
to steal. He also would not be allowed to leave Hong Kong and possibly denied any access to the
Internet. As he demonstrated by his subsequent actions, this option was not acceptable to him.

Once the U.S. criminal complaint was unsealed on June 21, 2013, which became all but
inevitable after his video, his only route out of Hong Kong went through two adversaries of the
United States, China and Russia. China, as far as is known, did not offer him sanctuary.
According to one U.S diplomat, it may have already obtained copies of Snowden’s NSA files, and
did not want the problem of having Snowden defect to Beijing. In any case, if it had not already
acquired the files. It could assume it would receive that intelligence data from its Russian ally in
the intelligence war. Whatever its reason, China did not use its considerable power in Hong
Kong to block Snowden’s exit.

Nor did Snowden obtain a visa to any country in Latin America or elsewhere during his month-
long stay in Hong Kong. As in the oft-cited Sherlock Holmes’ clue of the dog that did not bark,
Snowden’s lack of any visas in his passport strongly suggests that he had not made plans to go
anyplace but where he went: Moscow. His actions here, including his contacts with Russian
officials in Hong Kong, speak louder than his words.

Snowden chose, if he had any choice left at all, the Russian option. Just as he believed Chinese
intelligence could protect him in Hong Kong from the United States, he could assume that the
FSB could protect him in Moscow from the United States. He was not entirely na* ve about its
capabilities. During his service in the CIA, he had taken a month-long training course at the CIA’s
“farm” at Fort Peary in which counterintelligence officer taught about the capabilities the Russian
security services

To be sure, he might not have known that Moscow would be his final destination. He may
have naively believed that Russia would allow a defector from the NSA who claimed to have had
access to the NSA’s sources in Russia and China leave Moscow before its security services
obtained that information. But that was not to be.

It is not uncommon for a defector to change sides in order to find a better life for himself in
another country. Some defectors flee to escape a repressive government or to find one in which
they believe they are more closely attuned. But Russia is ordinarily not the country of choice for
someone such as Snowden seeking greater civil liberties and personal freedom. So why did
Snowden choose Russia for his new life?

The four choices that Snowden made in 2013 did not come out of the blue. They all were
planned out well in advance. He applied for the job to Booz Allen in February 2013, more than a
month before leaving his job at Dell. He applied to Booz Allen for his medical leave, although in
fact he had no medical problem, a month before departing for Hong Kong. He brought with him
to Hong Kong enough cash to pay his living expenses, according to him, for the next two years.
He arranged the encrypted channel with Poitras in February 2013, three months before he would
induce her to come to Hong Kong. He made contact with a foreign diplomatic mission at least a
month before flying to Moscow and, at some point, met with Russian officials, who arranged a
visa-less entry for him. He called Assange in London to arrange for Wikileaks help, 13 days

I prioritize it on the reasoning that optimizing employment of people and plant is
implicit, and that optimizing means putting them to work most productively rather

than over the most hours.

If policy maximizes rate of return, at the collective scale, it will maximize true output
perforce. Return is output divided by total capital producing it. More return is more
output per unit capital. Putting idle plant and people to work, in a slump, is a step in
the right direction. But it doesn’t get the job done unless they work productively.

investment and transfer payments. But I see the latter as part of the mechanics that

Keynes’ opposition is now mostly the Chicago school and other “freshwater” schools

intervention resonated best in “saltwater” seaboard school such as Harvard, MIT,
Stanford, and University of California. It is probably no coincidence that the
saltwater states are the “blue” ones tending to vote Democrat, while the freshwater
ones are the “red” ones favoring Republicans. (I call myself a free market Democrat,
whether or not that’s a contradiction in terms.) Freshwater views tend to oppose
intervention, but accept Keynesian basic definitions and equations such as the

Y =] +C doctrine and the distinction between “attempted saving” and investment.

It is these I question.

growth would become synonymous. | said why I prefer a language where saving

and investment are synonymous in the first place. What matters is rate of return.

At the national level, the U.S. Virgin Islands elects a delegate to Congress from its at-large
congressional district. However, the elected delegate, while able to vote in committee, cannot
participate in floor votes.

At the territorial level, 15 senators—seven from the district of Saint Croix, seven from the district of
Saint Thomas and Saint John, and one senator at-large who must be a resident of Saint John—are
elected for two-year terms to the unicameral Virgin Islands Legislature. The U.S. Virgin Islands has
elected a territorial governor every four years since 1970. Previous governors were appointed by the
President of the United States.

Population and Employment

In 2008, the residential population of the Virgin Islands peaked at an estimated 115,852 persons. This
follows five years of slow but steady growth of 1.0%, slightly slower than the U.S. annual average of
1.15%. Since 2008, population levels have fallen each year, to the 2014 estimated population of
103,961 persons.

Among the three islands, St Croix and St Thomas are nearly equally populous with St John having less
than 4 percent of the total population of the Virgin Islands.

id. at 10). Petitioners do not contend that Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4’s “participation in this
case” can only be achieved by listing them as parties.

As it stands under the original petition, the merits of this case will be decided based on a
determination of whether the Government violated the rights of Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2, and all
“other similarly situated victims” under the CVRA. Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 may offer
relevant, admissible, and non-cumulative evidence that advances that determination, but their
participation as listed parties is not necessary in that regard. See Herring, 894 F.2d at 1024
(District court did not abuse its discretion by denying amendment where “addition of more
plaintiffs .. . would not have affected the issues underlying the grant of summary judgment.”’); cf.
Arthur v. Stern, 2008 WL 2620116, at *7 (S.D. Tex. 2008) (Under Rule 15, “courts have held
that leave to amend to assert a claim already at issue in [another lawsuit] should not be granted if
the same parties are involved, the same substantive claim is raised, and the same relief is
sought.”).° And, as to Jane Doe 4 at least, adding her as a party raises unnecessary questions
about whether she is a proper party to this action.°

Petitioners also admit that amending the petition to conform to the evidence—by
including references to the non-prosecution agreement itself—is “unnecessary” as the “existing
petition is broad enough to cover the developing evidence in this case.” (DE 311). The Court

> The Court expresses no opinion at this time whether any of the attestations made by

Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 in support of their motion will be relevant, admissible, and non-
cumulative.

° The Government contends that Jane Doe 4 is not a true “victim” in this case because
she was not known at the time the Government negotiated the non-prosecution agreement, and
accordingly she was not entitled to notification rights under the CVRA. (See DE 290 at 10).
Any “duplicative” litigation filed by Jane Doe 4 would necessarily raise the issue of whether she
has standing under the CVRA under these circumstances.

defended the right of skinny dippers to an isolated section of the Cape Cod National Seashore.
(In 197_, a federal district court recognized a limited right to nude sunbathing in areas that
present no conflicts with the rights of others. The decision, despite its limited scope was
characterized as a “Magna Carta for nudism.’’)

Pornography, like nudity, offends many Americans, but there are those who would ban not only
public displays of pornography, but private use as well. They argue that three distinct types of
harm are caused by pornography. The first, as with nudity, is that it is offensive to many people
who are involuntarily exposed to it. No empirical evidence is required to prove this kind of harm:
if people say they are offended, that is the end of the matter. The second is that some people are
offended by the mere knowledge that other people, who are not offending by watching it, are
watching it in private. Whether this type of what I call “vicarious offensiveness” warrants an

harm is that pornography is alleged to cause rape and other physical violence against women.
This allegation, which if true would warrant legal protection, is hotly disputed and unproven, if
not improvable.**

group, he might respond by striking back. Hence, such provocatively offensive expressions have been called
“fighting words” and have been denied First Amendment protection by some courts over the years. This concept
has assumed center stage recently, as some Muslim groups, individuals and even nations have threatened violence
in response to the publication of “offensive” books, cartoons and other media critiques of Islam and its prophet.
The stakes have also risen. Instead of merely fighting words, some radical Muslims regard insults to the prophet
as killing and bombing words.

* The issue is somewhat complicated, because it may be true that certain kinds of violent pornography (as well as
violent non-pornography) may be contributing factors in certain people’s decision or propensity to rape, just as
alcohol or other drugs may be contributing factors. What is undeniably clear is that only a miniscule fraction of
men who view pornography go on to rape or commit violence, and that a great many rapists do not view
pornography. See Alan Dershowitz, Why Pornography? in Shouting Fire (Little Brown, 2002) pp. 1630-1675.

2004 remains a source of controversy
among his PLO loyalists, many of
whom believe he was poisoned
by Mossad, the Israeli intelligence
service. By the time Shimon Peres, the
Nobel Prize-winning prime minister
of Israel who helped resolve many of
the more intangible issues, died more
peacefully aged 93 in 2016, he had
become one of the most accomplished
statesmen of our age.
But perhaps the greatest casualty
from that era – when there were
genuine expectations on both sides of
the Israeli-Palestinian divide that the
conflict might be resolved peacefully
– has been the peace process itself,
which today is almost nonexistent.
When, for example, I told an Arab
ambassador acquaintance I was
going to see a preview of the play,
he simply remarked: “No one talks
about the peace process any more. It
doesn’t exist.”
This makes Roger’s examination of
one of the most unlikely diplomatic
dialogues ever undertaken all the
more poignant, as it harks back to
an era when reconciliation seemed
genuinely possible.
The task facing the rival delegates
when they first meet is a daunting
one. For the Israelis, if the fact became
known that they were talking to the
PLO, the government would most
likely fall. For the Palestinians, it
would mean an assassin’s bullet.
At the heart of this danse macabre
stands Rød-Larsen, whom I met on
several occasions in Jerusalem in the
Nineties when the hard work had
begun on implementing the deal. A
quiet, patient man, he never seemed
to be entirely comfortable with the
rough-house atmosphere of the
region, where disputes were often
more likely to be resolved through
rocks and rubber bullets than rational
persuasion.
Toby Stephens’s portrayal of Rød-
Larsen gives him a great deal more
zest and personality than I recall, but
this neatly nuanced performance is
key to the pace of this fast-moving,
entertaining take on the events (Rogers
has said that, in order to liven up what
might otherwise seem a prosaic and
convoluted political process, he studied
the plays of Noël Coward).
My favourite scene from the play
is the one where the lead Israeli
negotiator, taking a break from
the negotiations, entertains his
Palestinian counterparts by giving
an impersonation of Arafat as an
effeminate narcissist, a portrayal I
found entirely plausible from my
own encounters with the PLO leader,
whose vanity knew no bounds.
Uri Savir, who was deputed by
Peres to run the Israeli side of the
negotiations, was someone else I
got to know during that period. An
urbane multi-linguist of an academic
disposition, I generally found Uri to
be softly spoken and thoughtful when
discussing regional issues. Philip
Arditti’s portrayal of him in the play,
though, makes him out to be more
like the uncompromising, muscular
Israeli type, more usually found in the
ranks of the security forces than in the
diplomatic service.
Depictions in theatre of almost
anything to do with the Middle East
tend to stir strong passions among
audiences. I was particularly struck by
Rogers’ sympathetic understanding
of the Palestinian predicament. “I was
very anxious about the combustibility
of it,” said Rogers in a recent
interview. “I assumed there would be
controversy [in America] only because
someone would be enraged that I had
allowed the ‘other side’ to have their
say.” Certainly Peter Polycarpou’s
depiction of Ahmed Qurei, the
Palestinian finance minister sent
by Arafat to make peace, admirably
captures the conflicting emotions
of enduring the pain of exile while
seeking to wreak terrible vengeance
on the Israeli occupiers.
Indeed, for all the quips and

Pardon the formality below - I want to approach your very legitimate questions / concerns in a serious 
manner. 
Attached and below the same. 
Dear Jeffrey: 
As requested, the following addresses your two questions / concerns about our proposed Closer To Truth TV 
series The Science of Sleep and Dreams: 
(i) Have there been sufficient breakthroughs in Sleep and Dreams (significantly beyond traditional 
understandings) to justify a major TV series? 
(ii) Even if 'yes' to (i), is now the proper time for such a foundational series, or are more years needed for 
corroborative studies and further research to solidify the breakthroughs? 
In preparing this response, my primary source is Professor Patrick McNamara, Department of Neurology, 
Boston University School of Medicine, with whom CTT Producer/Director Peter Getzels and I spoke with at 
length today. Patrick is one of the leading sleep and dream researchers (he himself more dreams). More 
importantly, he is perhaps the leading chronicler of the field, with many publications (including 26 entries in 
related encyclopedias). He is co-editor-in-chief of the Encyclopedia of Sleep and Dreams (2012) and 
the sole author of the forthcoming An Introduction to the Neuroscience of Sleep and Dreams (Cambridge 
University Press, 2018), which intends to present the latest science and to become a main textbook for 
graduate courses/seminars. Patrick is a CTT contributor and colleague. 
When we asked Patrick, his first response — This is the ideal time to tell the sleep-and-dreams story — and he 
cited (in essence) your two questions, in that (i) the multiple breakthroughs are now sufficiently well 
corroborated by numerous independent labs such that a substantial foundation for the new, deeper 
understanding of sleep and dreams is now for the first time (over the past few years) confirmed and 
established, and (ii) there are now interesting application and critical clinical questions to pose, explore and 
pursue, such as for the treatment of various mental-related illnesses that have known sleep-related syndromes 
(e.g., PTSD and Depression). 
To understand the significance of recent breakthroughs, a defining characteristic of sleep and dreams is that 
there are two distinct kinds of sleep — REM (rapid-eye-movement) Sleep and NREM (non-rapid-eye-
movement) Sleep. Most dreams are associated with REM sleep (though complex). The eye movement 
gives the eponymous name, but a more important designation defines the two stages in terms of brain waves 
(electroencephalograph — EEG): REM is Fast-Wave Sleep (similar to the waking state) and NREM Sleep is 
Slow-Wave Sleep (very different from the waking state). This difference between REM and NREM sleep has 
been known since 1953 (different EEGs since 1937), but its deep significance has only been discovered and 
confirmed in very recent years (as explained below). 
Following are the key areas of breakthrough in sleep and dreams (from Patrick). Patrick states that these are 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025191 
now reproducible, non-controversial, and well-accepted among experts, although still not appreciated by the 
public - hence the high value of our CTT TV series. The organizing idea is why and how are sleep and dreams 
essential for normal memory consolidation and bodily health / well-being. 
Memory Consolidation. There is a fundamental difference between REM and NREM Sleep for memory 
consolidation: REM is for emotional memories, whereas NREM is for declarative and procedural memories. 
Hence, understanding and dealing with REM emotional memories can lead to treatment for the many 
neuropsychiatric illnesses that have sleep/dream-related disorders or syndromes (Parkinson's Disease, 
Anxiety, Substance Abuse, many sleep disorders such as Nightmare Disorder, etc., in addition to PTSD and 
Depression). Research shows bi-directional causality between neuropsychiatric disorders and sleep disorders. 
This is a superb example of how fundamental science breakthroughs lead to clinical breakthroughs. This fact 
that REM is associated with emotional memories is nicely consistent with the apparent psychotic nature of 
dreams, because in REM Sleep the frontal cortex is 'down-regulated' (and the frontal cortex is associated with 
rational planning, reflection, controlling impulses), while in REM Sleep the limbic system is 'up-regulated 
(and the limbic system is associated with emotions and feelings) — see Neuroimaging below. This is 
why dream states flood the ego with emotional fantasies without rational control. However, it is also true that 
the limbic system enables creative ideas, thus grounding in science the long-suspected idea that sleep and 
dreams can enhance creativity. 
As Dr. Robert Stickgold, our other advisor on the series, wrote: It would be nice if we could talk about sleep 
and memory as if there were only one type of memory and one type of sleep. But this is far from the case. 
Sleep and memory each comes in many forms, and furthermore, memories can go through multiple forms of 
post-encoding processing that must be individually addressed. 
Immunity / Immune System. Strengthening the immune system is now a proven product of NREM sleep. 
Discerning the evolutionary basis for this is a key research project (i.e., it seems counter-intuitive 
that sleeping facilitates fitness for survival in that predators lurked in the jungles and on the plains so that 
going unconscious during sleep does not, at first glance, seem especially adaptive). Studies of sleep in various 
non-human animals reveals a direct relationship between longer periods of NREM (Slow-Wave) Sleep and a 
stronger immune system, especially in fighting parasites. NREM Sleep releases molecules that 
fight inflection; NREM Sleep works for the maintenance, repair and activation of the immune system. (This 
gives scientific rationale for the need or desire to sleep during illnesses.) Related are genetic conflict studies 
with respect to REM and NREM, showing differences in heredity between material and paternal lines, and 
differences between males and females in which genes get imprinted. 
Neuroplasticity. Exciting recent research has reversed the century-long conventional wisdom that new 
neurons are never created in adult animals/humans. The development of new neurons — neuronogenesis — is a 
vital part of maintaining normal brain and mental functioning. New neurons are being created, importantly, in 
the hippocampus (brain organ where new memories are encoded) — but, remarkably, the neuronogensis in 
the hippocampus occurs only/largely during REM Sleep — a stunning finding. This is another reason why 
REM sleep is needed for emotional memory consolidation (normal functioning). 
Dream-Content. Although dreams have sparked human fascination and fantasy for thousands of years, only 
in very recent years, have large-scale surveys been conducted with rigorous design, classifications and 
statistical analysis. Literally hundreds of thousands of dreams are enabling statistically significant theories, 
including cross-cultural analyses (similarities and differences). Dream-posting sites have revolutionized size 
and structure of dream data sets. This enables, for the first time, longitudinal studies of dreams over time. 
Patterns are repeated. For example, in general, the dreams of males and females differ in fundamental ways. 
Males will engage in fighting with other males; females with both males and females. Male dreamers 
are often the initiator of fights and the fights are usually physical. Females fight verbally. Aggressiveness 
by the dreamer is almost always in REM Sleep, rarely in NREM Sleep. (Why is a continuing question.) 
Lucid Dreaming is a new area of fascinating research. Lucid Dreaming is where the dreamer knows that 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025192 
he/she is dreaming while dreaming (a talent that a small minority possesses but more can be 
trained/developed). Lucid dreamers, while sleeping, can now communicate with experimenters by altering 
their brain activity and thus becoming detectable by neuroimaging techniques (see below). 
Neuroimaging. Finally, neuroimaging technology has enabled many of these breakthroughs. As such, it is 
itself a methodological breakthrough that has enabled these other content breakthroughs. Neuroimaging now 
enables detailed location of the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of REM and NREM Sleep. In 
REM Sleep, the dorsolateral, frontal cortex is down-regulated, whereas the limbic system is up-regulated, 
showing the physiological basis for the emotional, wild-fantasies of dreams (see above). (Neuroimaging will 
enable good visual images for the TV series without extra costs.) 
Patrick stresses that while these breakthroughs form, for the first time, a solid foundation for understanding 
sleep and dreams, they also open opportunities to dig deeper into the purpose of sleep and dreams, as well 
as engender a new series of questions and directions (e.g., clinical treatments of illnesses). 
Attached is Patrick's quick compiling of summaries of a few recent leading research papers (2009 — 2017, 
especially 2015-2017). 
You'd enjoy speaking with him, if you want. 
Love to do this series together with you.

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023921.txt,"How Not to Teach 175

Of course, the system teachers teach in does not allow them to
separate assessment and teaching. But it doesn’t allow them to teach
only cognitive processes either. For a cognitive process-based educa-
tion system to work, teachers must be allowed to teach, and others
should be the ultimate judges of success. Teachers need to help stu-
dents get where they are trying to go and let others decide whether
they have gotten there.

So, we have rule #2 for teaching:

Rule #2: A teacher should never be the ultimate judge of the
teachers own students’ success. Here again, this seems absurd. But
in the end, this separation of responsibilities is very important. Parents
judge how well their children are walking and talking, of course. But
the children are not anxious about passing their parents’ assessments.
The success is its own reward. And in the end, others judge how well
your children speak. A parent is really there to help, not judge.

Let’s look at mistake #3.

Mistake #3: Thinking there is something that everyone must
know in order to proceed

This is, of course, the killer mistake. Go to any faculty meeting, or
interview any teacher, and he will tell you that something is the basis
for all that follows that, and if you don’t know it, you can’t proceed
in the subject he teaches. Theory first is the mantra of nearly every
teacher. The question is why this is so. I have been in arguments about
this so often that I wonder why these views are so widely held.

Teach theory first, then practice. Because of this mantra, computer
science majors often don’t learn to program in a way that actually
would make them hirable, and budding medical students drown in a
sea of chemistry equations. Businesspeople learn about finance long
before they learn how to run a business, if they ever do learn that, and
psychology students learn about B.E. Skinner when what they really
wanted to know is why they are so screwed up.

Why do teachers like teaching theory so much? I think that the
answer is that it is orderly stuff, with official answers that the teach-
er gets to know while the students try to learn them. This puts the
teacher in a powerful situation and teachers are comfortable with
that. Teaching practice is much harder. There often are no right an-
swers and many screw-ups, and the learning process is much messier.

tions of regimes that have been sullied by the jailing of
dissidents or opposition leaders, the shuttering of media

generally because of other strategic concerns or simple
neglect, not because lobbyists have persuaded them

outlets, or violent attacks on peaceful demonstrators.

Is the money that authoritarians allocate for image
beautification well spent? Some campaigns have been
more successful than others, but autocracies that

hire well-known former cabinet secretaries or elected
officials to defend or deny their acts of repression often
fail to sway either the public or the policy community

in the United States. If democratic leaders have not
mounted adequate responses to such repression, it is

that the regime in question is benevolent and just.

Authoritarian efforts to change governments, as
opposed to perceptions, may ultimately prove more
rewarding. Russias wager on the rise of friendly
European populist parties already seems to be paying
off. After Britain's vote to withdraw from the EU and
the triumph of Donald Trump in the United States,
the prospect of radical shifts in global politics can no
longer be dismissed as unthinkable.

TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026499.txt,"Date: Thursday, August 9 2018 10:47 AM 
Subject: Fwd: Our May conversation - more thoughts 
From: jeffrey E. <jeevacation©gmail.com> 
To: BS Stern < 
Hi all — 
>; 
I spent some time mulling additional aspects of a third choice presidential run and wanted to run five 
specific attributes for a candidate by you as a group. 
This much we know - the Fall elections are shaping up to be a referendum on the most divisive 
American President in memory. The battle for potential Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh's 
nomination this fall will only amplify the polarity of the political debate that is already deeply 
overwrought on both sides. The rising tide of pressure on Donald Trump from the Mueller investigation 
shows no sign of ebbing. 
Unless the underlying political dynamics are disrupted, the outcomes of these unprecedented events will 
still leave us with the same unsatisfactory two front battlefield of the 2016 Presidential election. 
Watching these unrelenting, compounding events since our discussion in May, I am guessing we are all 
asking the same question: now what? For the 48 percent of Americans who believe Donald Trump 
should not be in the White House, perhaps we too want our own chaos candidate in 2020? 
Should Trump run again, this could be a break glass moment for the majority of Americans who don't 
support him. Do we want to break the genteel precedents of two parties running their ceremonious and 
seemingly illogical nominating process to select a candidate? (Why do Iowa and New Hampshire play 
such outsized roles? What kind of small-d democratic process relies on superdelegates?) The system 
failed in 2016, with both parties producing terribly flawed candidates in a race to the bottom. We need to 
build a back-up plan in the event the system fails again. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026499 
It's possible, of course, that we won't need a third-party candidate. Trump could decide not to run for 
whatever reason. The Democrats could nominate a winning 2020 candidate. I am not willing to take 
those bets. 
The ideal candidate for a new third party is someone who is widely perceived to be that rare combination 
of both good and great. We are looking for a proven leader of men and women, someone with clear, 
democratic — and moral — values that reflect the best of America, not our worst. We know people like this 
on the national stage now. 
As a thought experiment, consider the possibilities of a ticket outside the partisan lanes and imagine the 
chemistry of radical combinations: Biden/Romney? Bill Gates/Hogan? Bloomberg/Haley? Howard 
Schultz/Bob Corker? Sandberg/Kasich? 
As we have discussed narrow path to electing the first president outside the two major party primary 
system in 168 years is more navigable than most think. Heading into 2020, converging trends in 
American's demands for a third party (a historic high of 61%), disapproval of Donald Trump holding 
steady above 50%, and the increasingly leftward drift of the Democratic Party suggest that electorate may 
be susceptible to merits of a new centrist party. Cynics will say that the structural impediments of ballot 
and presidential debate access, the overwhelming advantages of legacy parties' fundraising and voter 
turn-out operations preordain failure, but they're wrong; the legal and logistical hurdles are amenable to a 
combination of lawyering and resources. The bigger, more consequential factors come in terms of 
candidate quality and policy. I believe a candidate with five specific characteristics including a unique — 
and purposefully non-specific - policy agenda could limbo a win. 
• This is what I think a successful third-party candidate looks like; a dream third party ticket would 
start off with enough name ID to be an instant contender. Building the name ID to run nationally is 
just too long and expensive of a process to accomplish in the 28 months until the next presidential 
election. We can't beat a celebrity without some celebrity of our own, whether from politics, 
sports, business, or entertainment. Instantaneous name ID is so crucial because the candidate must 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026500 
start out in striking distance in any three-way poll against Trump and a fill-in-the-blank 
Democratic flavor-of-the day candidate. The media and political class will predetermine 
irrelevance otherwise. 
• A Democrat-leaning candidate would have to top the ideal third-party ticket. We need someone 
with a shot at snaking a plurality of the vote in the blue states Hillary Clinton won (227 electoral 
votes), but moderate enough to win a plurality in some combination of Trump states like Florida, 
Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan (another 119 votes). The right candidate may even to put 
North Carolina, Ohio, Indiana in play for a centrist bi-partisan ticket as well (totaling an electoral 
sweep of 464 elector votes). A right leaning candidate would meet the same fate as a primary 
challenger to Trump — for all intents and purposes we need to assume that 36% of voters won't be 
cleaved from Trump under any circumstances and run to win around them. The deep red states 
would be off the table entirely. 
• With the Trump reality show airing daily, voters are now expecting to take their politics with a side 
of entertainment. Heretofore, ratings will matter no matter how dry the policy topic. Surely 
Stephen Colbert would gladly sacrifice his executive producer Chris Licht to produce a daily 
comedic segment of this dream candidate interviewing Americans in truck stops and McDonald's 
across the country. A few of the Saturday Night Live script writers could certainly be enticed to 
disguise serious debates as informative amusement. Any candidate must be committed to a near 
daily cadence of high quality, compelling video production. It will be especially crucial to keep 
the voters' attention during what will be a raucous Democratic primary season. Rules governing 
access to the general election debate stage dictate that a candidate enjoy support of at least 15% of 
voters in the months leading up to the general election. 
• This dream candidate would pledge to serve only four years and address all of the U.S.'s ticking 
time bombs like Social Security, Medicare, health care reform, climate change, money in politics, 
gerrymandering, and infrastructure investment in a single term. This one-and-done term decouples 
our candidate from the usual politics and gives them the power of promise and deliver decisive 
action. A four-year term pledge ensures governance independent of campaign finance concerns and 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026501 
narrow special interests inherent to winning re-election. This fix-it ticket would promise to force 
decisions on all the underlying structural policy matters damaging America's long-term prospects 
and distorting our democracy. No more kicking the can down the road. 
• This candidate should also pledge to push for laws passed that reflect the will of simple majorities 
in Congress. Congress now only allows bills to move forward when a majority of a majority 
supports the policy and on many levels seems fundamentally broken. This third-party president 
could force votes based on a transparent reading of where the votes lie via coalition building. The 
Senate filibuster power will present a high hurdle, but a third-party candidate would be a de facto 
disruptor of the two-party system. Party discipline could well break down, and moderates in both 
parties could form a powerful, decisive block willing to work with the new President. The policies 
passed into law may not be ideal for either Democrats or Republicans, but for the major agenda 
items that must be addressed for America's long-term health, an imperfect fix that corrects course 
is better than those that now have us hurtling toward national bankruptcy. 
And if no candidate secures 270 electoral votes in 2020? The House of Representatives would choose the 
next president. In 2016, reports suggested Michael Bloomberg declined to run on a third-party ticket for 
fear of splitting support from Hillary Clinton and throwing the election to a GOP-controlled House of 
Representatives who would then vote to select the president. The fear was the GOP controlled House 
would have just elected Trump. 
Would Democratic control of the House mean that the House would pick an alternative to Trump as 
president? Each state delegation has a single vote in selecting a president and it is the incoming Congress 
- the class elected in 2020 that would decide the election. But no matter which party has the speaker's 
chair, the GOP would almost certainly have the upper hand in the majority of state delegations 
controlled. Would the state delegations pick a president based on party majority control of the 
delegation, the winner of the popular vote in each state or their own calculations as to who is best for 
America? Precedent suggests that delegations use secret ballots, which means individual lawmakers may 
vote their consciences. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026502 
If we recruit this ideal candidate; threading the needle of name ID, a center-left bent, a TV- savvy 
campaign team and a pledge to serve only four years with an apartisan agenda, money and campaign 
expertise would certainly follow. And 50 state ballot access is a function of time (starting in the fall of 
2019 would be prudential) and hard work as we have discussed and many of you have exhaustively war-
gamed. 
Part and parcel of this effort would be motivating the often politically lackadaisical middle to vote. The 
raft of new technologies in data targeting and biometric mobile voting technology could transform the 
electorate in the next few, amping voter participation and injecting the voices of moderates (both in 
political views and level of political interest) into the process. And any third-party effort must 
incorporate advocacy for accelerated adaption of these all but inevitable voter verification tools. I believe 
Silicon Valley could be game-changing allies in this effort. 
I am sure none of us doubt that chaos could potentially be unleashed by jamming three viable candidates 
into a two-party system. An election that ends up in the House of Representatives is an uncontrollable, 
murky and ancient process. But might that be a less scary prospect than relying on the Democrats to 
nominate a candidate who can beat Trump in 2020? 
I look forward to talking more about all of our ideas on this hopeful project in coming weeks. Please feel 
free to call me to discuss. Thank you for taking time to review this note. 
Sincerely, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026503

My own part in the Lebanon war would change dramatically as a result of
that last military exercise in the Sinai. Arik Sharon was now Minister of
Defense, and he came for the final afternoon. From his experience as a frontline
commander — in 1956, 1967 and 1973 — he knew the dunes and wadis and
sprawling expanses of sand as well as any general in Israel. Watching our
intricate mini-war draw to its close, he made no effort to hide his enthusiasm for
the kind of quick, assertive battlefield maneuvers he’d long championed. But
more than that, his closest aide soon began sounding me out on my views about
the long-term organization, force balance and funding for the Israeli military. A
few weeks later, Arik offered me a promotion: a return to the kirya, as a two-
star general, to become head of planning for the armed forces.

I don’t know why he chose me: the Sinai exercise perhaps, the fact he knew
I'd studied “large and complex organizations” at Stanford, or maybe just the
fact our paths had first crossed two decades earlier when I was in Sayeret
Matkal. But even though it meant leaving my division command, especially
tough since the final Sinai withdrawal was approaching, it was an offer I never
contemplated turning down. Not just because of the second star on my uniform.
Ever since the 1973 war, along with a few other senior officers including Dan
Shomron, I had been making the case for a shift to more mobile and less
vulnerable forces and weapons systems. I saw the new role as a chance to help
encourage that critically important change.

There was just one hitch: all senior military assignments required the formal
approval of the chief-of-staff, my old friend Raful Eitan. Raful did manage to
delay things for several weeks. At one point, he even brought to bear a quality
I’d never suspected he had: a sense of humor. “OK, Pll agree to promote
Barak,” he told Arik. The next day, he said he’d meant /itan Barak — a very
good commander, by the way, who had been one of my instructors in officers’
school. Arik insisted, however. My appointment went through.

And one, unanticipated result was that I didn’t just play the field command
role I’d anticipated, from our Cinerama deployments, in Arik’s toweringly
ambitious, ill-planned and ultimately disastrous war in Lebanon. I became part
of months of planning discussions in the Airya before our tanks finally rumbled
across the northern border on the morning of June 6, 1982.

continue their investigation of these techniques and
experiment with ways to combat them.

We also urge more intense coverage of Beijing's efforts
to undermine democratic norms in neighboring states
or territories, as in Hong Kong and Taiwan, and its
largely successful attempts to pressure other govern-
ments into repatriating citizens who had fled persecu-
tion in China.

Lastly, the media are not doing their job if they neglect
to give aggressive coverage to the lobbyists and pub-
lic-relations specialists who make money by repre-
senting dictators and kleptocrats. Those who flack for
the leaders of China, Azerbaijan, Egypt, and their ilk
should be made to answer for each political prisoner,
murdered opposition figure, shuttered newspaper, and
offshore account full of stolen funds that can be tied
to their authoritarian clients.

To the academic community: We urge academic
associations, individual scholars, and university
administrations to stand up for freedom of thought
and open inquiry at a time when those values are
under relentless pressure from dictatorships. We

urge statements of protest against the persecution of
fellow scholars or the politicized rewriting of history,
especially in countries, like Russia and China, that are
integrated into the international university system.
We urge universities to reject the establishment of
projects and study departments—whether at home or
overseas—that do not adhere to the highest stan-
dards of intellectual freedom or that restrict discus-
sion of certain subjects.

To the business community: We urge private busi-
nesses to avoid commercial relationships with
authoritarian governments that force them to violate
fundamental democratic principles. Private compa-
nies and investors have a clear interest in democratic
public goods like the rule of law, which guarantees
their property rights, and the transparency provid-

ed by free media and corruption watchdogs, which
ensures the accuracy of economic data and the fair
allocation of state contracts. They should therefore do
what they can to prevent any further deterioration in
the condition of global democracy.

Some sectors are especially vulnerable to authoritarian
pressure, and have a special role to play in combating it.
We urge the film industry to reject involvement in joint
ventures with companies that have close ties to au-
thoritarian regimes and reputations for demanding po-

liticized censorship of artistic content. We also urge the
technology industry to refuse business arrangements
that require active complicity in or passive acceptance
of political censorship or information control.

To the European Union: We urge the EU to undertake
a comprehensive review of member states’ democrat-
ic institutions to determine whether recent changes
have weakened checks and balances or unduly
protected incumbent parties from fair electoral com-
petition. The EU should adopt measures to publicize
departures from democratic standards and develop

a new set of sanctions that could be imposed on
noncompliant governments—whether inside, outside,
or hoping to join the bloc—even in the absence of
unanimity among member states. In the meantime,
the EU should use the sanctions already in place, even
if it means freezing a member state's participation,
and be prepared to actually impose any new sanctions
that might be introduced.

To private foundations: We urge private foundations
to recognize and oppose the current assault on
democracy. With a few exceptions, the great institu-
tions of American philanthropy have studiously—and
shamefully—ignored the steady erosion of global free-
dom and the rise of authoritarian powers. The recent
developments in Europe and the United States will
hopefully shake their complacency. There is a strong
need for analysis, support for individual dissidents,
and aid for societies under authoritarian threat, and as
many democratic governments waver in their com-
mitment to such priorities, it is essential for private
funders to step into the breach.

To mainstream political candidates: We urge re-
sponsible political figures to call out colleagues or
rivals when they show contempt for basic democratic
ideas. Until now, politicians in the democracies have
been unimpressive in their responses to opponents
who embrace authoritarian figures like Putin. This

is despite the overwhelming evidence of egregious

political opposition leaders, the invasion of neighbor-
ing states, brutish counterinsurgency campaigns in
the North Caucasus, the emasculation of a once-vi-
brant media sector, rigged elections, and much more.
If they choose to shower him with praise, political
leaders like Marine Le Pen, Geert Wilders, and Donald
Trump should be forced to account for the realities of
Putin's appalling record. The same is true for any politi-
cian who praises dictators in the Middle East, Asia, or

During and since the civil war, Gemayel had at various times been at odds with
a whole array of enemies or rivals: Muslim militias, the PLO, other Maronite
factions and, of course, the Syrians. But I think for all of us, even Arik, the issue
of who was behind the bombing was hardly the most urgent concern. The
immediate danger was a revival of the kind of rampant bloodletting Lebanon
had endured in the civil war. The day after the assassination, I joined a half-
dozen other members of the general staff and helicoptered up to the Lebanese
capital. Arik, ignoring weeks of US pressure not to do so, had already ordered
Israeli troops into west Beirut — not to fight, but to take control of key junctions
and vantage points and keep basic order.

But the question obviously on everyone’s mind was how to make sure the
situation remained under control. It was early afternoon when we reached an
Israeli command post in the largely Palestinian southwest part of the city. It was
set up by Amos Yaron, the former paratroop commander whose division had
landed by sea at the start of the invasion and was part of the push north to the
capital. At his side was Amir Drori, the head of the northern command. They
had set up a rooftop observation post just a few hundred yards in from where I
had landed with my Sayeret Matkal team a decade earlier for the Rue Verdun
operation. It overlooked a pair of Palestinian refugee camps: Sabra and, a
couple of hundred yards closer to us, Shatila.

Raful was with us as well. So was Moshe Levy, the deputy chief-of-staff,
and Uri Saguy, the head of the operations branch in the kirya. I listened rather
than spoke. All I could gather from the other generals’ conversation was that
they were trying to figure out how to handle the Palestinian camps. No one
explicitly mentioned the idea of Israeli troops going in, presumably because
they realized that, far from helping ensure order, that might well inflame things
further. Even Raful, at least in my earshot, made no reference to the “several
thousand” PLO fighters that he and Arik still wanted out of Beirut. The only
note that struck me as odd was a general agreement that the Phalangists had not
been carrying their load of the fighting during the war. One comment in
particular stuck with me, though I didn’t take it as referring to the Palestinian
camps in particular. I can’t remember which general said it, only that everyone
seemed to agree: “Why the hell do we have to do their fighting for them?”

It was not until the next morning, back in Tel Aviv, that the alarm bells rang
for me, and by then it turned out to be too late. It was Friday, the eve of the
Jewish New Year. Yet in the wake of Gemayel’s assassination, the kirya was

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024082.txt,"Regulatory Changes

On June 22, 2011, to implement provisions of Title IV of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) adopted
final rules implementing new exemptions from the registration requirements of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act’), one of which is commonly known as the venture
capital fund exemption. Neither the General Partner nor the Management Company is currently
expected to register as an investment adviser with the SEC in reliance on the venture capital
fund exemption. The General Partner may need to take into consideration certain conditions
regarding the nature of investments that may be made by investment vehicles advised by an
investment adviser relying on the venture capital exemption, which may constrain the Fund’s
investment flexibility or require certain non-qualifying investments to be disposed of earlier
than they might otherwise be. In addition, compliance with the venture capital fund exemption
may subject the Fund to limitations on the Fund’s operations, including limitations on the
Fund’s ability to borrow, provide guarantees and make short-term investments that are more
restrictive than any limitation set forth in the Partnership Agreement.

Reliance on the venture capital exemption also will necessitate reporting certain information to
the SEC about the Management Company, the General Partner and their affiliates and may
result in such entities being subject to SEC examination authority and certain Advisers Act
compliance obligations. If the General Partner and the Management Company are able to rely
on the venture capital exemption, investors in the Fund will not be entitled to the benefits of
certain protections under the Advisers Act. If the General Partner or the Management Company
cannot rely on the venture capital exemption, the General Partner or the Management Company
may need to register as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Registration under, and
compliance with, the Advisers Act could be costly and could divert attention of the Fund’s
management team. There also can be no assurance that statutory, regulatory, judicial or
administrative interpretations of existing laws and regulations will not in the future impose
more comprehensive or stringent requirements on the General Partner or the Management
Company.

States was in deep now, on a course that no one could predict.
Madam Secretary

For Barack Obama, the Arab Spring and its aftermath will shape just
one critical piece of his record. But, for Hillary Clinton, the swirling
challenges of the region are likely to determine her legacy. Many
diplomats remain anxious; the world they knew has been upended.
Yet they also understand that the months ahead will be Hillary’s
moment to help turn those ripples into a permanent tide of reform and
renewal.

But Hillary’s intense diplomatic efforts to forge a coalition to go to
war in Libya came at the exact worst time, only two months after
WikiLeaks, the whistle-blowing Web site run by Julian Assange,
began posting thousands of classified State Department cables online.
Candid descriptions of foreign leaders (e.g., Putin is the “alpha dog”
of a “virtual mafia state”) were published around the world and have
already led to the departure of U.S. ambassadors in Mexico and
Ecuador, with more fallout on the way. Hillary told staff that she
could not fathom how an army private, Bradley Manning, with
psychological problems and a drag-queen boyfriend could single-
handedly cause the United States unprecedented embarrassment just
by labeling massive downloads as Lady Gaga songs.

Several allies needed little comfort. “Don’t worry about it,” one
leader told Hillary. “You should see what we say about you.” Italian
prime minister Silvio Berlusconi wasn’t so forgiving. In 2008 the
loutish media baron and billionaire had described Barack Obama as
“young, handsome and bronzato (bronzed),” but after WikiLeaks he
chose to play the victim. It wasn’t clear whether he was genuinely
upset about a cable describing him as “physically and politically

obviously respected by Boeing, so he is a senior and successful man
in his field. This means a small teaching load since the best professors
teach the least. Three semester-long courses in a year is a light load at
a big state university.

You might wonder, as an outsider to the ins and outs of the uni-
versity, why the best professors teach the least. You also might wonder
why I knew the types of courses he would teach and what I mean by
that. I will explain.

To start this explanation, it is important to understand why pro-
fessors are “rewarded” with light teaching loads. (Note the word load.
This is the normal way this is discussed in a university.) I was given
an extraordinarily light load at Northwestern for two reasons. One
reason was that universities, like baseball teams, recruit so-called “su-
perstars” (yes, that is how they are referred to in the university) from
competitors. So Northwestern had to beat Yale’s offer in my case. At
Yale I taught one semester-long course per year, so Northwestern sim-
ply made me a better offer.

The reason both of these universities would even consider such a
light load is that I earned money for the university. As I used to tell
my children when they asked “why” questions, in the end it is usually
about money.

I was recruited by Northwestern (in 1988), but I was really being
recruited by Andersen Consulting. They offered Northwestern (that is,
they offered me if I came to Northwestern) $30 million (over a 10-year
period). Yes, that’s right, $30 million. I think you can see that North-
western didn’t really care what I taught or when I taught it. They
wanted that money. And, they also wanted the prestige.

Before I go too much further, I need to explain the prestige thing
because it is very important. In fact, the prestige issue for professors
and universities is precisely the root of the problem in our education
system. This will take some time to explain, so let me start simply for
now.

When Harvard plays Yale in football, they are battling for prestige.
But the battle may not be on the field exactly. The real battle is in
how powerful and important the alumni who attend the game have
become and how big their respective endowments have become and
who has the best chemistry department or business school. It is a real
battle. The battle is for reputation. And, although it may seem silly to
take this battle seriously, it is taken very seriously. There is no World

ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY Challenges of Artificial Intelligence:
Envisioning and Addressing Adverse Outcomes

2) DEMOCRACY, INFORMATION, AND IDENTITY

Al, Information, and Democracy

(Incorporating contributions from Shahar Avin, Sean O hEigeartaigh, David McAllester, Eric Horvitz,
and others)

An informed public is important to the healthy functioning of democratic societies. We can expect
potential forthcoming advances around the control of information feeds with applications in
spreading propaganda, via spreading false or misleading information, creating anxiety, fueling
conspiracy theories, and influencing voting. Such methods will bring key challenges to democracy.

CHALLENGES AHEAD WITH Al, PROPOGANDA, AND PERSUASION

Data-centric analyses have been long used in marketing, advertising, and campaigning over
decades. However, over the past few years, we have seen the rise of the use of more powerful
tools, including machine learning and inference aimed at algorithmic manipulation, with the target
of influencing the thinking and actions of people. Some initial uses of these methods reportedly
played a role in influencing the outcome of recent US presidential elections, as well as the
elections in 2008 and 2012. We can expect to see an upswing in methods that manipulate states of
information in a personalized automated manner. These systems can be designed and deployed as
omnipresent/persistent, and aimed at specific goals for group- or person-centric persuasion.

As our data and models of how people consume and act on information improve, and as an
increasing portion of information consumption is mediated through digital systems managed by
potentially opaque algorithms, it becomes increasingly conceivable that the information ecosystem
would get captured by malicious actors deploying increasingly advanced tools to control, shape,
forge and personalize information, from ads to news reports.

Machine learning, in conjunction with active learning, expected value decision making, and
optimization of allocations of key resources, such as dollars or human effort, can be targeted at
monitoring, understanding, and then working to influence the beliefs and actions of large
populations of people. Data can be collected from large-scale populations, across multiple devices
and services, and used to make inferences about the psychologies and beliefs of people, and for
designing and guiding persuasive flows of sequences of information. Uses of Al can include
attempts to optimize stealthiness of the interventions.

In the future, a great deal of the information consumed by citizens on personal devices is subject
to alteration by information-engineers at media corporations and governmental propaganda
offices, such that outside a few key positions of power no one really knows what is going on in the
world. There is a danger of the growth of domination over time of large populations by a single
dominant or a few systems. We can imagine methods that modify even such feeds as Wikipedia
articles, creating personalized views—that subtly shift the version of the article seen by my

newspaper, book, painting or magazine can be hauled into a Federal court anywhere in the
United States and charged with participating in a national conspiracy.”

Shortly thereafter, Nat Hentoff wrote a long front-page analysis of the Village Voice. Hentoff
warned his readers of the consequences of a government victory in the Reems case.

Alan Dershowitz, a Harvard Law School professor and one of the nation’s preeminent
constitutional lawyers, has never been known as an apocalyptic civil libertarian.
Accordingly, when Professor Dershowitz speaks of the recent criminal convictions in a
porno-film case as being so chilling as to ultimately also freeze the printed word, the
warning is a weightier than if it had come from those who habitually clamor that the
constitutional sky is falling...

Should the verdict against Harry Reems be sustained, obscenity indictments throughout
the country will pyramid.

Hentoff explained that the implications of the Reems prosecution go well beyond obscenity. Ifa
conspiracy charge like this one was to be upheld on appeal, the government could make
dangerous use of that precedent in political cases involving, for example, antiwar activists.
Hentoff then quoted my legal argument:

“[H]ere was an actor who, on the one day he worked on Deep Throat, had no idea what
the ultimate film was going to look like. He knew it was a sex film, but he had not seen
any script in advance. There was no way he could know whether it was going to be soft
core or hard core. And, in fact, Harry never even saw the film before it was released. Yet
he’s convicted of a conspiracy to move the film, in the form it finally took, across state
lines.”

Following the publication of the Hentoff article had, hundreds of readers came forward and
volunteered their assistance. It also generated numerous other stories—presenting our side of the
case.

REEMS SHAFTED IN BIBLE BELT

Reems and I crisscrossed the country, speaking at universities, town halls and other venues. Our
appearances were widely covered by the media. The New York Times described a joint
appearance at the Harvard Law Forum:

Harry stood with a portrait of Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter beaming down on
him. Besides him sat Alan Dershowitz, looking like a tweedy Marx Brother with his wild

nimbus of ash-blond hair, saying that he felt Harry Reems’ trial was the most significant
First Amendment conspiracy case since Dr. Spock.

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011110.txt,"and let each economist decide which version is more useful. Mine, at least, correctly

describes those same four years as losing ones.

National Accounts Overall

It seems to me that national accounts are doing nothing wrong except in modeling
the depreciation curve from misleading sales evidence. Evidence seems to show
depreciation as fast at first, and slower later. That tends to be true when depreciable
assets are actually sold. Structures tend to be customized for their original owners
and occupants. They tend to be resold when results are disappointing. This
disappointment often comes when expectations are first tested. When distressed
sellers market illiquid structures customized for themselves, prices too will be

disappointing.

Better to trust evidence of structures intended in the first place to pass from owner
to owner, as with many standardized rather than customized apartment and office
and warehouse buildings. Better still, from an economist’s viewpoint if not an
accountant’s, is to trust logic. Capital is present value of expected cash flow. Its loss
of value with time, under simplifying assumptions, is the present value of the most
distant and most discounted cash flow. Depreciation of structures we keep, rather
than sell, is least at first and greatest at the end. It is the same as with a level-

payment mortgage.

National accounts are nonetheless a magnificent achievement. They need
interpretation just as corporate accounts do. That’s where economics comes in. And
national accounts are not resting on past practices. They can be congratulated on
including market valued capital, even if sixty years too late, and on extrapolating it
backward where practical. This book could scarcely have been written if they hadn’t.
I would recommend the obvious next step. Net investment should be shown
alternatively as change in market-valued, and output as that plus consumption. Let

economists decide which version is good for what.

parties you’ve mentioned, they actually have close ties with Putin, who is the promoter of
this big danger, so I'd like to know your thoughts about this and how you’re going to deal
with it.

Bannon: Could you summarize that for me?

Harnwell: The first question was, you'd reference the Front National and UKIP as
having elements that are tinged with the racial aspect amidst their voter profile, and the
questioner was asking how you intend to deal with that aspect.

Bannon: I don’t believe I said UKIP in that. I was really talking about the parties on the
continent, Front National and other European parties.

I’m not an expert in this, but it seems that they have had some aspects that may be anti-
Semitic or racial. By the way, even in the tea party, we have a broad movement like this,
and we've been criticized, and they try to make the tea party as being racist, etc., which
it’s not. But there’s always elements who turn up at these things, whether it’s militia guys
or whatever. Some that are fringe organizations. My point is that over time it all gets kind
of washed out, right? People understand what pulls them together, and the people on the
margins I think get marginalized more and more.

I believe that you'll see this in the center-right populist movement in continental Europe.
I’ve spent quite a bit of time with UKIP, and I can say to you that I’ve never seen anything
at all with UKIP that even comes close to that. I think they've done a very good job of
policing themselves to really make sure that people including the British National Front
and others were not included in the party, and I think you’ve seen that also with tea party
groups, where some people would show up and were kind of marginal members of the tea
party, and the tea party did a great job of policing themselves early on. And I think that’s
why when you hear charges of racism against the tea party, it doesn’t stick with the
American people, because they really understand.

I think when you look at any kind of revolution — and this is a revolution — you always
have some groups that are disparate. I think that will all burn away over time and you'll

see more of a mainstream center-right populist movement.

school, or have fun soaring like an eagle. The invisibility types talk about sneaking into stores and taking
clothes or music they like, eavesdropping on conversations, and playing tricks on family members and
friends. What is even more interesting about these particular answers is how they divide into pure
hedonism — flying — and pure vice — invisibility. With invisibility you can take risks at no cost, except
for the cost that soon becomes apparent to many of these newly donned superheroes: even if they don’t
get caught, they still did something bad, morally bad. This ratchets up their guilt. With this realization,
and a dip into the dark side, comes an about face, with some picking flying instead of invisibility. Rarely
do people stick with invisibility, but see how they might deploy their power for virtuous purposes. Rarely
do these superheroes realize that they can be real heroes, using their invisibility to gain covert information
about terrorist organizations, elicit drug traders, pedophilic priests, or abusive parents — minus the risks.

In real life, there are risks associated with every decision, some clear from the start and others
only clear in hindsight. As with self-control, a growing body of evidence shows that there are individual
differences in risk-taking: some are risk-averse, some risk-prone, and some seemingly risk-blind, unaware
that they are taking risks at all. Some of these differences are evident early in life. Some of these
differences are strongly associated with crime later in life. Some of these differences provide insights into
the invisible risks that individuals and societies confront, risks that can cause great harms.

Research on clinical populations with antisocial disorders, most notably those with a clinical
diagnosis of psychopathy, reveals a major cause of their high risk, costly, and violent behavior: a failure
to experience fear, anxiety, or stress in response to highly evocative images and sounds. In contrast with
healthy populations, psychopaths are emotionally blasé about the things in the world that can cause harm
or result in punishment. The problem lies in the fact that psychopaths, both adults and those identified as
candidates early in childhood, fail to learn about the dangers in life. Their failure to learn is caused by a
reduction in size and activity of two critical and connected brain areas: a region of the frontal cortex and
the amygdala. When this system works efficiently, it allows individuals to learn about the sounds, smells,
and sights that are associated with bad things in the world. When this system works well, individuals
learn to avoid antisocial, immoral, and illegal acts by developing anxiety and fear over the possibility of
punishment and personal injury. When this system works poorly, as is the case in psychopaths,
individuals act as if there are no dangers or risks of punishment — a disposition that enables inappropriate
actions. But psychopathy covers a broad spectrum, with problems that all of us confront at some point in
our lives, some of us even repeatedly. This is important as it forces us to look at non-clinical populations
for the causes of individual differences in risk-taking, especially our reactivity to dangerous events.

Studies carried out over several decades, in a wide variety of cultures, reveal that children begin

life with distinctive temperaments. Some are mellow, blasé about events that are startling to many.

Dear Friend, 
Both Sides Now w/Huffington & Matalin celebrates its 1st anniversary this week. As the 
only 2 sides/2 women show on national radio, we've grown from 16 stations in May of 
2010 to 110 now. 
Arianna and Mary find consensus that, contrary to the Washington and media 
conventional wisdom, the Jobs Agenda is more urgent than the Deficit Agenda (if people 
only read about shark attacks, they'll worry about shark attacks, says Arianna). And they 
agree that there's an apparent outbreak of men abusing the help -- Strauss-Kahn, 
Schwarzenegger, Ensign. To paraphase Freud, what do men want? 
But there's sharp disagreement about whether Rep. Ryan walked into Obama's trap by 
proposing to end Medicare in 10 years. Will the special election this Tuesday in Jack 
Kemp's old seat produce a Democratic Scott Brown Moment?

Pay z can be defined as the worker’s literal or imputed revenue. Self-invested

consumption C_ can be defined as any investment in human capital other than

But that does not mean that it is limited to transfer in. There is also plowback from

Subject: Trump appears with mobster-affiliated felon at New Year's bash/Joe Cinque 
Importance: High 
Jeffrey --I thought you might be interested in this article-- Nick 
Trump appears with mobster-affiliated felon at New Year's bash 
President-elect Donald Trump rang in the new year together with Joseph Joey No Socks Cinque — a 
convicted felon with ties to notorious Gambino crime family boss John Gotti, a recently released video has 
revealed. 
Cinque can be seen in a video obtained by the Palm Beach Daily News  , cheering loudly as a tuxedo-clad 
Trump runs through a number of campaign promises before the hundreds of guests attending the New Year's 
Eve bash the President-elect threw at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Saturday. 
The taxes are coming down, regulations are coming off, we're going to get rid of Obamacare, Trump can be 
heard saying as an exuberant Cinque stands next to him, pumping his fists into the air. 
Cinque's Sunday appearance with Trump might raise some eyebrows. 
Beyond a 1989 felony conviction for possessing nearly $100,000 worth of stolen artwork, Cinque used to be 
friends with John Gotti, according to a New York Magazine profile from 1995  . 
Cinque was also shot three times and left for dead in a 1980 incident that authorities described as a hit, 
according to the profile. 
Further, Saturday's Mar-a-Lago party was far from the first time Cinque cheered on for Trump. 
An Associated Press report from this spring showed that the American Academy of Hospitality Sciences, a 
company owned and operated by Cinque, has awarded more than a dozen of Trump's golf courses, hotels, 
casinos and private clubs with so-called Star Diamond awards of true excellence in hospitality. 
The same report also found that about half of the roughly 30 people listed as trustees to the company are 
Trump friends or business associates. 
Trump, meanwhile, was listed on the company's website as its ambassador extraordinaire, and he even 
appeared in a 2009 tribute video to Cinque in which he said, There's nobody like him. He's a special guy. 
But when asked by reporters about Cinque in May, Trump denied knowing anything about him or his criminal 
past. 
If a guy's going to give you an award, you take it, the President-elect said at the time. You don't tend to look 
up his whole life story. 
The Trump transition team did not immediately return a request for comment on how the President-elect knows 
Cinque or why they appeared together Saturday. 
While standing alongside Cinque, Trump also took a moment to address the terror attack that left scores of 
nightclub revelers in Istanbul dead over the weekend — and how the bloodbath somehow necessitates a 
Mexican border wall. 
We will build a wall, you know that. We will build a wall, the President-elect told the raucous crowd. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033210 
And speaking of walls, he continued. In Turkey tonight — has anybody heard? Big disaster took place in 
Turkey tonight. Many, many, many people killed...It's a horror show. So we're going to get things running 
properly. 
ISIS claimed responsibility for the Saturday attack  , which left at least 39 people dead and dozens more 
wounded, calling the lone gunman who carried out the massacre a heroic soldier of the caliphate. The suspect  
had yet to be named and located by Turkish authorities early Tuesday. 
The President-elect made building a wall along the country's southern border one of his main campaign talking 
points, frequently promising his supporters that it will be a great and beautiful wall. 
But his pledge to construct a border barrier has gone under several renditions, with the President-elect admitting 
in November that it might actually end up part wall, part fence.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012851.txt,"The fact that we feel less empathy for people in pain if they fall outside our inner sanctum
suggests that we have dehumanized them, stripping away dimensions of experience that humanize those
within the sanctum. These are the dimensions associated with emotion, and when taken away, cause us to
perceive the other as an object. Since objects can’t feel pain or joy, we can’t share in their experience
because they lack experience altogether. If that is the case, then when we perceive any human group that
has been dehumanized in this particular way, there should be little to no activity in those areas of the brain
associated with thinking, feeling, wanting, and believing. To explore this possibility, the social
psychologist Susan Fiske placed subjects in a brain scanner and presented photographs of either extreme
out-group members, such as the homeless and drug addicts, or photographs of other groups such as the
elderly, middle-class Americans, and the rich. When viewing the extreme out-group, not only did Fiske
see little activity in an area critically related to self-awareness and the process of thinking about others
thoughts and emotions — the medial prefrontal cortex — but she also observed an intense increase of
activity in the insula, a brain area that is recruited when we experience disgust.

Fiske’s results highlight the dangers of dehumanization. Once we turn off areas of the brain that
are involved in thinking about others’ thoughts and emotions, and turn on areas involved in disgust, we
have set ourselves up for moral disengagement. As the distinguished American psychologist Albert
Bandura has documented through decades of research, moral disengagement allows people to justify harm
by transforming lethal motives into morally justified and even benevolent ones. Moral disengagement
allows us to excuse ourselves from moral responsibility, either disregarding the harm imposed or
convincing ourselves that it was justified, even obligatory. In several international studies of school-aged
children, results consistently show that those who are most morally disengaged are most likely to engage
in various forms of aggression, including bullying and repeated criminal offenses. These same children
are also least likely to engage in helpful behavior, revealing that moral disengagement dispenses with the
typical process of self-censure and sanctioning that we carry around when we are morally engaged. Ina
study of American prison personnel involved in death penalty sentences, executioners were more morally
disengaged than support staff or prison guards. Executioners were more likely to dehumanize the
convicted prisoner and provide moral and economic justifications. Executioners also felt less guilt
because they had developed a narrative to justify their actions, one that ascribed complete fault and
responsibility to the victim. Support staff flipped in the opposite direction, fully involved with the
weighty moral issues associated with ending someone’s life. In a study of people’s political attitudes,
those with strong right wing authoritarian views, commonly associated with fascism and submission to
authority, were more likely to support war by means of morally disengaging. In particular, they were most

likely to support war by justifying its necessity and trivializing the harm that will necessarily arise — for

impressed by. Can you tell for the people here who aren’t within the Anglosphere and they
might not follow American domestic politics at the moment — there seems to bea
substantial sea change going on at the moment in Middle America. And the leader of the
majority party, Eric Cantor, was deselected a couple of weeks ago by a tea party
candidate. What does that mean for the state of domestic politics in America at the
moment?

Bannon: For everybody in your audience, this is one of the most monumental — first off,
it’s the biggest election upset in the history of the American republic. Eric Cantor was the
House majority leader and raised $10 million. He spent, between himself and outside
groups, $8 million to hold a congressional district. He ran against a professor who was an
evangelical Christian and a libertarian economist. He ran against a professor who raised
in total $175,000. In fact, the bills from Eric Cantor’s campaign at a elite steak house in
Washington, DC, was over $200,000. So they spent more than $200,000 over the course
of the campaign wining and dining fat cats at a steak house in Washington than the entire

interpretations, mystical union is claimed to bring the existence and meaning of
Absolute Reality into direct experience. This kind of knowing is more akin to the
Platonic view of mathematics, that theorems have been everlastingly existent, from
before our physical world, then it is to the here and now, physically based, finite
computations involving the experimental machines of physics.

The philosopher-mathematician father of phenomenology, Edmund Husserl,
criticized the physics-want-to-be orientation of the 1860 empirical, objective
measure psychologies of Fechner and Wundt. He understood the best of their
findings as simply correlations between subjective and observable events. Using
mathematical discoveries as examples, Husserl spent his life arguing for the
possibility of abstract truths relevant to mind being more reliable and valid if grasped
via direct experience. Knowing by what the popular mid-twentieth century writer of
science fiction, Robert Heinlein, called grocking it. This is antithetical to the attitudes
of today’s human cognitive and brain sciences which disallow such knowing as
deeply suspect unless accompanied by objectively definable observables such as
changes in electrical or imaging indices of brain activity in one neural region or
other. The modern psycholinguistics of brain mechanics can be _ called
neolocationism. Using modern technology to measure regional blood flow, energy
metabolism and/or electrovoltage or magnetic field activity, stories of function are
spun that closely resemble those imagined more than a century ago by the first
locationists, such as Ramon Cajal. These neuroanatomists spent thousands of
hours looking at cell clusters and their connections in stained slides of human brain
tissue using microscopes and imagined their singular and integrated function.

UCSD in La Jolla, carries a full sized, polymeric, three-dimensional model of the

process, it was hedged with several conditions. The freeze would not be open-
ended, but last for 10 months, as a way of boosting the effort to restart
negotiations. It would apply to new construction, not work already underway. And
it would exclude the post-1967 neighborhoods inside the expanded city limits of
Jerusalem. Like his other moves, it was also dismissed as insignificant by the
Palestinians. Though there was a formal restarting of the talks, they went almost
nowhere during the period of the freeze, which Bibi cited as a reason for not
extending it further. From then on, the negotiations produced even less. I didn’t
buy the narrative that this was entirely Bibi’s fault. Abu Mazen remained
steadfastly, deliberately passive. Obviously not inclined to take the risk of further
widening his rift with Hamas in Gaza, he was content to echo the Obama
administration’s argument that nothing could happen until there was a settlement
freeze. Once the freeze was announced, he went through the motions, avoiding all
the difficult issues, in the expectation Washington would ensure the freeze was
renewed. President Obama’s initial Mideast moves had made it much easier for
Abu Mazen to avoid any serious engagement. In contrast to past presidents, Obama
had placed almost all of the onus for progress on Israel. But the end result also
suited Bibi. Though I never entirely gave up hope of persuading him it was in
Israel’s interest to seek a resolution of our conflict with the Palestinians, it became
more evident as the months went on that his aim was simply to keep things ticking
over, and avoid any major new crisis.

He appointed an old personal friend — a corporate lawyer named Yitzhak
Molcho — as our negotiator. I finally realized how pointless the exercise was when,
during a visit to the United States, I found myself in New York at the same time as
Molcho. We met at the Israeli consulate. We spoke in detail about the state of the
negotiations. With Molcho still in the room, I phoned Bibi in Jerusalem on the
secure phone line. I said I’d just been updated on the talks, and it seemed clear
there were a number of suggestions Israel could make, with no domestic political
risk but with every prospect of improving the atmosphere and accelerating
progress. “Yitzhak is one of Israel’s top lawyers,” I said. “He’s struck dozens of
deals in his life. But he strikes a deal when that’s what his client wants. You are the
client. If you tell him: bring me back the best deal you can — not a peace treaty, just
a deal on a specific issue — he’ Il do it. But if his brief is simply to negotiate, he can
go on negotiating forever. And it’s pretty clear me that’s his brief.” Bibi insisted I
was wrong. He said that what I saw as time-wasting was simple prudence, to make
sure the negotiations bore fruit. But his approach never changed. Whenever it came

ideological prerogatives trump economic
rationality. It made little economic sense,
for example, for Pakistan to pursue a
nuclear weapons program in the 1970s,
just as it makes little economic sense for
Iran to do so today. Clearly, both
Pakistan and Iran made major policy

be sure, much of the Arab support for

now a solid will and determination among concerned countries to join hands to collectively revive the global

What are the main strengths and weaknesses of the UAE, as it faces the challenge of the

positions itself as a global business centre?

The UAE’s strengths are numerous. The UAE’s success in facing the global financial crisis and alleviating its
impact on the Emirati economy is the most conspicuous=2 Oevidence of these strengths. The country enjoys a
leading ranking position in several fields such as productivity, environment, connectivity, and transformation

a major weakness. We always benchmark ourselves against the best. I always say that we have just embarked

projects to be established during the years to come.

DURAID AL BAIK, Gulf News:

Do you feel that Dubai needs an efficient auditing body to investigate and curb
corruption in financial institutions before things become too bad? How more the UAE
can move faster in fighting corruption and promoting transparency?

There is already a government financial audit department. The department has a track record of successful
performance, and it has done very well with investigations related to corruption cases. Enhancing financial
auditing systems and capabilities is undoubtedly important and that is exactly what we are doing now. As for
promoting transparency in fighting corruption, I confirm that the UAE is completely committed to highest
levels of transparency. There is no room for corrupt officials and citizens among us. Handling corruption cases
does not mean prosecuting judging and penalising corrupt individuals only; it also aims at filling all
administrative and legal loopholes that=2 Ohave been used to breach the law.

The UAE does not have remote areas in the negative connotation of the word. We only have areas that are

carefully identify means of providing best efficient services to local residents.

There are sometimes exaggerated reports depicting these areas as if they are utterly deprived of basic services

her escapades with

photographs by PATRICK MCMULLAN
Qaddafi is hunkering
down in Tripoli, giving
press interviews, denying
that rebels are taking
over Eastern Libya. Oil
prices are shooting up over one hundred
dollars a barrel. The U.S. government is on the
verge of a shutdown. These are not the topsecret
opening lines of Aaron Sorkin’s new
script, but the global headlines of a world
spinning out of control as I head to Los
Angeles like an overdressed lemming to attend
the 83rd Academy Awards and attempt to
make sense of artists thrust into combat.
For the second year, nearly 6,000 Academy
members have nominated 10 films and the
battle seems to be pared down to 2. The
beloved instant classic, The King’s Speech,
marches into the arena as the frontrunner, but
passionate supporters of the edgier (critics’
darling) The Social Network have not conceded.
The ballots are counted, the party invites are
out and still the feelings are raw. Nominees are
exhausted from campaigning.
Woody Allen and George Lucas tell me they
are no longer members of the Academy
because pitting artists against each other to
determine the quality of their work is insane.
They are right. My event and publicity company
is considered Switzerland by the studios, as
we help every filmmaker to present his work.
However, this year, against my better judgment,
I am somewhat emotionally sucked in.
In 2005, I met the unknown 32-year-old
English director Tom Hooper on his first film
for HBO, Elizabeth I starring Helen Mirren.
Helen later wins an Oscar for portraying
Queen Elizabeth in The Queen. Queen
Elizabeth is the daughter of King George VI,
portrayed by Oscar-winner Colin Firth in The
King’s Speech directed by Hooper. No degrees
of separation.
At the Telluride Film Festival, Tom Hooper
bathed in the glory of a hysterical standing
ovation alongside Colin Firth and Geoffrey
Rush at the very first public screening of that
film. Two weeks later at The Toronto Film
Festival, Harvey Weinstein stood with his
filmmakers witnessing the same reaction. The
film won The Audience Prize. Their strategy
was to say nothing, do nothing. They have a
possible Oscar winner—four out of five past
Best Pictures have premiered in Toronto.
Cut to New York City at the end of
September. It’s opening night at The Film
Society of Lincoln Center. One of America’s most important
and prolific producers, Scott Rudin, along with Jesse
Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Aaron Sorkin, are in a
brightly lit box waving down to their equally hysterical
audience who have just seen The Social Network. The film
opens the next day to rave reviews and endless publicity.
David Fincher is off making The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
Aaron Sorkin becomes the face of the film and an immediate
shoo-in for the adapted screenplay Oscar.
The Hamptons International Film Festival in October
suddenly becomes a launching pad for 127 Hours, where
star-cum-Yale/NYU student James Franco appears. More
Oscar buzz. Producer/director Danny Boyle (Oscar winner for
Slumdog Millionaire) stays in London all fall directing the play
Frankenstein. Black Swan also unspools there in a tiny theater as
Madonna, Alec Baldwin and Harvey Weinstein slip in the
back. Darren Aronofsky is hailed a genius. Natalie Portman is
instantly the hot nominee for Best Actress. Both films are sensations,
but it’s The King’s Speech that wins The Audience Prize.
Mid-November: David O. Russell and Mark Wahlberg
sneak The Fighter in Manhattan. As their audience erupts in
cheers, I tell producer/actor Wahlberg, “Clint Eastwood is
going to kill himself for not directing this.” He says, “You’re
wrong. He turned it down because he’s done it. He’s seen it
and he loves it.” David O. Russell becomes my new Clint
Eastwood. Christian Bale and Melissa Leo are hailed the
supporting actors to beat.
True Grit, directed by the Coen Brothers and also produced
by Scott Rudin, finally throws its cowboy hat in the ring in
mid-December at the Ziegfeld as the last serious Oscar
contender for Best Picture. It gallops off to box office gold.
The Social Network now cements its battle cry with one
word: relevance. Mark Zuckerberg lands on the cover of
Time Magazine as “Person of the Year.” A smart and extensive
ad campaign positions the film in the lead. Critics and
pundits proclaim the race is over. Everyone goes on holiday.
This is one of the few times in Harvey Weinstein’s life that
he’s caught off guard. He quickly mobilizes an inner team of
15 and conducts strategy meetings 7 days a week, including
Christmas. They’re like a Chinese restaurant: always open. He
sends screenwriter David Seidler and Tom Hooper to every
corner of the country doing Q&As until they are both blue in
the face from “finding their voice.” SAG voters begin seeing
the film two and three times.
In January at the Golden Globes, about 88 foreign journalists
give awards to The Social Network for Best Drama, Director
and Screenplay. The film is still perceived as the Oscar winner
and nobody can stop the steamroller. Only Academy voters
disregard these awards.
The King’s Speech wins the PGA in L.A. Everyone is totally
surprised when Tom Hooper goes on to win the DGA. After
a tremendous amount of hard work by team Weinstein, the
actors win for the SAG Ensemble. The BAFTAs reinforced
their lead; the film is now the frontrunner. It takes the media
a few weeks to catch on.

I whisper to Harrison
[Ford], “That looks just like

his eyes and reluctantly
introduces me to his
friend . . . Johnny Depp.
The Daily Mail announces Her Royal Highness Queen
Elizabeth has enjoyed a private screening of The King’s
Speech and is “moved” by the film. With no proof the Queen
has actually seen the film, press agents send out a global press
release thanking her Majesty for the endorsement.
FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 24
Mid-day, I arrive at The Beverly Hills Hotel. As the housekeepers
unpack my bags upstairs I peek into the Polo Lounge
and find Warren Beatty in a booth. I tell him I’m rooting for
his wife, Annette Benning, and love her film, The Kids Are All
Right. Warren says The Social Network will win.
This year I am two days late arriving to Oscar weekend. I
am shown to a very, very small room—the size of a broom
closet. Uncharacteristically, I have a slight melt down. I am
moved. The housekeepers run down the hall with my clothes
flying. The hotel is sold out, so I get someone else’s room.
Another unsuspecting victim checking in downstairs will get
the broom closet.
It is cold, grey and rainy. Taffeta, organdy and embroidered
silk evening clothes hang in my closet. I stay in my sweaters
and fur coat, and head to Arianna Huffington’s home in
Beverly Hills where she and Wendi Murdoch are hosting a
party for Tom Freston’s wife, the beautiful, blonde Kathy.
Her book is called Veganist: Lose Weight, Get Healthy, Change
the World—perfect for monks.
Arianna has just sold the Huffington Post to AOL for $315
million dollars and is rumored to have personally landed
around $20 million. She is euphoric as she greets Nicole
Kidman and Keith Urban at the door. Other drenched power
players include Disney’s Bob Iger and wife Willow Bay,Fox’s
Jim Gianopulos, Candice Bergen and journalist daughter
Chloe Malle, Google’s Eric Schmidt, Oliver Stone escorting
his daughter Tara and avoiding questions about Charlie
Sheen, Moby, Jamie Niven, Brian Grazer, Vivi Nevo, CBS’s
Les Moonves and Julie Chen, Rob Reiner, Paramount’s Brad
Grey and fiancé Cassandra Huysentruyt and Jeff Bezos.
Hors d’oeuvres include pigs in blankets—a food group not
mentioned in Kathy’s book.
The action migrates to UTA Jim Burkus’ home for a party
for True Grit’s Ethan and Joel Coen. I pass Ron Howard on
the way in and he says, “Keep me on your list.” Is he kidding?
Sunrise and Mark Ruffalo, Focus Feature’s James Shamus,
Nancy Meyers and John Goldwyn mingle. Adorable Hallie
Steinfeld is there with her parents. I am trying to fix her up
with Justin Bieber. She giggles, “Peg, I am only 14.”
I am face to face with Harrison Ford and stupidly tell him
I love him in Morning Glory. He’s looking at me in utter
disbelief, but I will not shut up. A gorgeous guy is inches away
in a hat and glasses. I whisper to Harrison, “That looks just
like Johnny Depp.” Harrison rolls his eyes and reluctantly
introduces me to his friend . . . Johnny Depp. I babble a bit
about his great work then run for cover in a corner next to my
buddy, Jerry Bruckheimer.
I head over to the CAA/Bryan Lourd’s “Friday Night
Party.” Torrential rains and horrific winds cause a traffic jam
that makes it impossible to get near the house. The world’s
most famous faces cower under black umbrellas and make a
run for it. Bryan Lourd and Bruce Bozzi receive friends at the
door all night.
Inside, Uma Thurman tells me she finally moved into a
doorman building in New York after being terrorized by
stalkers for years. Ben Walker talks about Abraham Lincoln:
Vampire Hunter, which he is about to shoot, while his fiancé,
Mamie Gummer, looks sexy shivering in a white satin gown.
Producer Jon Kilik mentions he oversaw a new cut of Julian
Schnabel’s Miral, to be released in March. Bennett Miller,
standing with Kristin Gore, says Sony loves his new film,
Moneyball, and Brad Pitt is terrific. (When is Brad Pitt not
terrific?) Sandy Gallin tells me he has an actual job
decorating Jeffrey Katzenberg’s home. I congratulate Barry
Levinson’s son Sam, a director, for winning the writing
award at Sundance for his first film, Another Happy Day.
Also seen floating around are Taylor Swift and Jake
Gyllenhaal—but not together—Sean Penn, Tom Cruise and
Katie Holmes, Anderson Cooper, Hilary Swank, Kelly Ripa,
Paul Haggis, Marisa Tomei, Kate Beckinsale, Demi Moore
and Ashton Kutcher, Kate Hudson, Gerard Butler, Renee
Zellweger with Bradley Cooper, Biutiful director Alejandro
Gonzalez-Inarritu, Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal, Ellen
Barkin (who is headed to Broadway in The Normal Heart this
spring) and CAA’s Kevin Huvane, Richard Lovett and Hylda
Queally. Sony Classic’s Michael Barker tells me The Social
Network will win.
Tired celebs try to go home, but limo lock is at a standstill.
Cell phones don’t work in the area. Two hundred swells
become party prisoners and happily hang out till 5 a.m.
SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 26
Out comes the sun and dries up all the rain. IAC chairmen
and owner of Newsweek/The Daily Beast Barry Diller
and his wife Diane Von Furstenberg (with her kids Alex
and Tatiana) host their 15th annual lunch for Graydon
Carter in their Coldwater Canyon home. Barry introduces
me to his star guest, Gov. Jerry Brown, just elected to his
third (nonconsecutive) term as California governor.
Like last year, enormous clear plastic tents are erected
on the hill near the house. Long wooden picnic tables sit
on oriental rugs covering the soggy ground. VIPs wears
winter clothes, comfy sweaters and sensible shoes. I arrive
in a fur coat.

Everybody knows everybody, and it doesn’t matter if
you have a hit film or T.V. show this season. Oprah
Winfrey kisses David Geffen, casually chats with former
Disney C.E.O. Michael Eisner and current Sony Chief Sir
Howard Stringer and Rob Weisenthal. Brett Ratner
arrives with his houseguest Jean Pigozzi, who is allowed to
take photographs. Graydon greets people with chic wife
Anna by his side.
Ingrid Sischy and Sandy Brant, Rupert Murdoch,
Ron Meyer, Francesco Clemente with his twin boys and
Tom Ford chat each other up. People to watch include
pregnant Victoria and David Beckham with Lynn
Wyatt, Fran Lebowitz, Larry Gagosian and Shala
Monroque, Ben Silverman, Debbie and Allen
I head over to the CAA/Bryan
Lourd’s “Friday Night Party.”
Torrential rains and horrific
winds cause a traffic jam that
makes it impossible to get
near the house. The world’s
most famous faces cower
under black umbrellas and
make a run for it.
Grubman, Sotheby’s Tobias Meyer and Mark Fletcher and
Stephen Gaghan and Mini Mortimer wearing her oversized
cat glasses.
Bruce Cohen has invited me to the Oscar broadcast
rehearsal. Inside the Kodak Theater’s massive auditorium,
I find a seat next to his proud parents. I
watch Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem come out in
white dinner jackets and flub their lines as they
pretend to present Best Adapted Screenplay and
Best Original Screenplay. Josh will later tell me
that their acting methods are completely opposite:
he’s a quick study and is very creative and
comfortable ad-libbing; Javier, whose mother
tongue is Spanish, likes to have every syllable
printed out to study with a dialect coach. Life-size
photos on cardboard plaques are taped to each
nominee’s chair. I memorize their location so when I
return Sunday I can quickly kiss them all.
Back at the Beverly Hills hotel I slip into my black
tulle Dennis Basso cocktail dress with a plunging
neckline and put on my mother’s jewels. Jim
Coleman takes me to the “Night Before Party” in the
hotel. This is Jeffrey Katzenberg’s 9th annual A-lister event
benefiting The Motion Picture & Television Fund where they
raise $6.5 million dollars in 1 night. I walk into Valentino,
who gives me an approving once-over. I tell him and
Giancarlo Giammetti that Woody Allen’s new film,
Midnight in Paris, is opening the Cannes Film Festival and
they must bring the yacht.
Elton John and David Furnish join our conversation so of
course we ask for intimate details about baby Zachary. I
segue over to Amy Adams, who, like them, mentions she
hates leaving her baby in the hotel room. Next stop is Kate
Capshaw in a black bowler hat chatting with Steven
Spielberg’s god-daughter, Gwyneth Paltrow. I have known
Steven for years (in 1982 I was a publicist on E.T.). I now tell
him I’m going to the Lincoln Center opening of War Horse
with Kathy Kennedy and Frank Marshall and cannot wait to
see his movie version.
I meet sweet Jennifer Aniston, her new haircut and her
perfect little body. Her date tells me her secret is a half-hour
on the treadmill everyday—such an understatement. I tell
Jesse Eisenberg I was on his plane home from the Baftas last
week, but he was hiding under his hoodie. He says innocently,
“You should have said ‘hello.’ I always cover my head because
I think my curls make me look like a girl.”
The charity gives us a coupon booklet redeemable at
various booths. Rich people run around like lunatics, collecting
gifts for their housekeepers. Among the shoppers are
Steven and Heather Mnuchin, Viacom’s Deborah and
Philippe Dauman, Tamara Mellon, Christine Taylor and
Ben Stiller, Cate Blanchet, Susan and Robert Downey Jr.
and Debra and Hugh Jackman.
Next stop is The Weinstein Company’s party at the Soho
House sponsored by MontBlanc. Long gone are the funky
Miramax Saturday night soirees where nominees spoofed
their own films in homemade costumes and ad-libbed
hilarious skits. No more grown men dressed as Anna Paquin
playing the piano in hopes of winning a Max Award.
As I come in, a 400-pound gorilla refuses to let me on the
elevator. Once on, I see Jennifer Lopez in the corner and
remind her we met on Len Blavatnik’s yacht in Cannes. She
graciously pretends to remember me. Her manager, Benny
Medina, is kicking me.
I slip into Colin Firth’s booth to have a tête-à-tête with him
and his wife Livia Giuggioli. Jokingly, I suggest he say “I’m
speechless” when he wins. Colin patiently assures me many
people, far more clever than I, thought of this. He then says that
others are waging bets on whether he might subconsciously
stutter. I grill him about his wardrobe, assuming he will be
wearing a new Tom Ford tuxedo. He tells me both he and
Ford will be in older Ford models. I tell him I made rich-butthrifty
Charles Ferguson, director of Inside Job, spend $6,000
dollars for a new Tom Ford tux.
In the back room, Jennifer Lopez is now seated with
Weinstein’s wife, Georgina Chapman. Helena Bonham
Carter, her live-in-lover Tim Burton and her mother Elena
circulate. Star power includes Adrien Brody, Mary-Kate

SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 27
Producer Donna Gigliotti is my date to the awards. We are
both so nervous we arrive at the Kodak Theater at 3 p.m. and
nobody is there. We are driven around for an hour. When we
arrive back at the world’s most famous red carpet, I guide
Donna through security check-in to the extreme right to
make sure we get on camera. I teach her the red carpet
hustle, which is five steps forward, three steps back, one inch
behind a couture-clad nominee. We greet Kevin Huvane as
Sandra Bullock is talking to ABC-TV and a billion people see
me wearing a black Marchesa gown. Five steps forward, three
steps back, we next meet Gwyneth Paltrow, and I hook up the
back of her dress while another billion people see me correct
the fashion malfunction. Five steps forward, three steps back,
we’re now posing behind Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban.
Our Blackberrys begin buzzing; the world has seen us.
James Franco and Anne Hathaway are hip hosts. This is the
year of no surprises. But it isn’t until Hilary Swank yells out
Hooper’s name for Best Director that Harvey’s gang finally
realizes they are getting the Oscar for Best Picture after all.
Harvey is sitting in Spielberg’s seat as Spielberg announces
the win from the stage. Producers Iain Canning, Emile
Sherman and Gareth Unwin leap up and kiss each other.Six
months of grueling work have finally paid off. King George
VI and Harvey Weinstein now share the journey of a single
man who triumphs over adversity.
At the Governor’s ball, held above the Kodak Theater,
the winners triumphantly sachet around the room holding
their heavy eight-pound gold statues.
An hour later there is a migration to the Vanity Fair party
hosted by Graydon Carter at Jeff Klein’s Sunset Tower
Hotel. The invitation features a gold hologram that transmits
a radio frequency of a photo and details about the
guest to VF staff as they arrive. The next day “Page Six” will
report that the backup private security firm is run by a
former Israeli operative, when in fact they are Irish
Catholics from Staten Island.
There’s a hierarchy of arrival times. At 5 p.m. the inner
circle of Graydon’s 141 best friends attend a seated dinner.
They include Barry Diller and Diane von Furstenberg,
Francis Ford Coppola, Jon Hamm and Jennifer Westfeldt,
Betsey Bloomingdale, Tory Burch and Lyor Cohen,
Carolina and Reinaldo Herrera, L’Wren Scott and Sir
Mick Jagger, Naomi Watts and Liev Schreiber, Wendi
Stark, George Hamilton, Judd Apatow, Jackie and Joan
Collins, Donna Karan and Steve Martin.
The best and the brightest talent in town arrive at 9 p.m.
Every single winner shows up. Also there are Justin
Bieber and his date Selena Gomez, Michelle Williams,
Emma Stone, Steve Tyler and Liv Tyler, Andrew
Garfield, Jude Law, Armie Hammer, Vera Farmiga,
Kevin Spacey, Charlize Theron, Anne Hathaway, Winter’s
Bone star-of-tomorrow Jennifer Lawrence, Taylor Hackford
and Helen Mirren, Scarlett Johansson, Isla Fischer and
Sasha Baron Cohen, Tom Hanks, Sean Penn, Renee
Zellweger and Bradley Cooper and Jane Fonda after her
play, 33 Variations. I introduce Melania and Donald Trump
to David O. Russell as The Trumpster gushes about The
Fighter. David tells Donald he used to be a waiter/bar tender
at many of Trump’s parties. Donald smiles as if looking at yet
another apprentice. He then offers me a ride home on his
plane; he’s leaving in 10 minutes. Too bad James Franco
didn’t know because he is presently sitting on a commercial
flight back to school, skipping his own after-party. The rest of
the guests’ social standings are determined by half-hour
increments. VF’s Beth Kseniak, Matt Ullian and Jane Sarkin
tell me the list is cut down to 800 this year.
At 11:30 p.m. there is another celebrity migration up the
hill to Madonna manager Guy Oseary’s house. Earlier in the
I introduce Melania and
Donald Trump to David O.
Russell . . . David tells Donald
he used to be a waiter/bar
tender at many of Trump’s
parties. Donald smiles as if
looking at yet another
apprentice.
evening, Madonna came down the hill to pose in a risqué
see-thru outfit with daughter Lourdes. Madonna and co-host
Demi Moore are able to lure the crème de la crème with the
promise of dancing and no cameras.
MONDAY, FEBRUARY 28
A winner’s work is never done. Colin Firth, Tom Hooper
and David Seidler show up at 4:30 a.m. at The Four
Seasons Hotel for a live broadcast on “The Today Show.”
Functioning on an adrenalin rush, they return to the
Kodak Theater with Geoffrey Rush to appear on Oprah’s
live broadcast.
By the end of this year’s thrilling race between two
great producers—Scott Rudin and Harvey Weinstein—
Facebook and Twitter are credited for aiding political
justice from the streets of Cairo to Tripoli. But the British
film with the most heart wins as one single human voice can
still make a difference. The king has spoken. ✦

institutions, plays an integral role on this front. The capitalist system did not fail. What has failed is the
excessive economic liberalism, which pushed to minimize the intervention of the regulatory government
institutions in the markets and banks’ activities.

Certainly the world is witnessing the birth of a new economic and financial order. The results of the G20
summit are a prelude toward this end. However, consensus on the format and the content of this new global
economic system would not be reached soon. Different factors determine the future of this system, including
growing global competition and conflicting national economic interests. No party would easily give up its
position and gains for the benefit of the global economy recovery.

As for the suggestion on the Islamic banking, it is of interest to the global banking sector. However, to be a
substitute to the current economic systems, even if only temporarily, is a much more complex approach, which
relates to the nature of economic systems, the size of the economies of nations, and the size of Islamic banks in
the banking sector worldwide. As you are aware, there are a lot of factors that govern this, such as the
distribution of the economic, military, scientific and social powers in the world, as well as the competitive
nature of civilizations, and the strong links between the civilizations and religions.

There are many other positive aspects of the global financial crisis which were embodied
in refining the current competencies, reviewing the need for expatriate expertise, and
strengthening the bonds of the federal entities that supported the UAE. In your opinion,
what are the lessons learned from this crisis both on the local and federal level?

There are many lessons to be learned from the crisis, the most important one being the assertion of the state’s
role in regulating and monitoring the overall economy and markets, and confirming the fact of the global
economy’s unity, in addition to the unification of the global market. The widening scope of the crisis, which
includes all parts of the world, confirms this unity and the common international pursuit. In addition, President
Obama’s public statement, which verifies that the United States cannot overcome the global crisis on its own, is
further confirmation of the unity of the economy and the market. Other lessons learned from the=2 Ocrisis is
realizing the urgent need to develop the regulations, terms of reference and working mechanisms of
international financial institutions to be commensurate with the unified markets and economies, and the
involvement of many influential players.

In the United Arab Emirates, we perform a wide range of reviews through specialized federal and local
committees which are well aware that within the challenges of the crisis, remain many opportunities. The first
opportunity to be seized is to benefit from the lessons learned from the crisis, and be prepared to deal efficiently
with the world after the crisis; a world completely different than what it was before. As for the forces of federal
entities, the fact is that the strength of these entities is what enabled them to cope with the crisis and contain its
negative effects.

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020849.txt,"Drilldown on USA Inc. Financials...

e To analysts looking at USA Inc. as a public corporation, the financials are challenged

- Excluding Medicare / Medicaid spending and one-time charges, USA Inc. has supported a 4% average net
margin’ over 15 years, but cash flow is deep in the red by negative $1.3 trillion last year (or
-$11,000 per household), and net worth2 is negative $44 trillion (or -$371,000 per household).

e The main culprits: entitlement programs, mounting debt, and one-time charges

— Since the Great Depression, USA Inc. has steadily added “business lines” and, with the best of intentions,
created various entitlement programs. Some of these serve the nation’s poorest, whose struggles have
been made worse by the financial crisis. Apart from Social Security and unemployment insurance,
however, funding for these programs has been woefully inadequate — and getting worse.

- Entitlement expenses (adjusted for inflation) rose 70% over the last 15 years, and USA Inc. entitlement
spending now equals $16,600 per household per year; annual spending exceeds dedicated funding by
more than $71 trillion (and rising). Net debt levels are approaching warning levels, and one-time charges
only compound the problem.

- Some consider defense spending a major cause of USA Inc.'s financial dilemma. Re-setting priorities and
streamlining could yield savings — $788 billion by 2018, according to one recent study*® — perhaps without
damaging security. But entitlement spending has a bigger impact on USA Inc. financials. Although
defense nearly doubled in the last decade, to 5% of GDP, it is still below its 7% share of GDP from 1948 to
2000. It accounted for 20% of the budget in 2010, but 41% of all government spending between 1789 and
1930.

Note: 1) Net margin defined as net income divided by total revenue; 2) net worth defined as assets (ex. stewardship assets like national
parks and heritage assets like the Washington Monument) minus liabilities minus the net present value of unfunded entitlements (such as
Social Security and Medicare), data per Treasury Dept.'s “2010 Annual Report on the U.S. Government’, 3) Gordon Adams and Matthew
Leatherman, “A Leaner and Meaner National Defense,” Foreign Affairs, Jan/Feb 2011)
www.kpcb.com

USA Inc. | Introduction 15

...Drilldown on USA Inc. Financials...

e Medicare and Medicaid, largely underfunded (based on ‘dedicated’ revenue) and
growing rapidly, accounted for 21% (or $724B) of USA Inc.’s total expenses in F2010,
up from 5% forty years ago

- Together, these two programs represent 35% of all (annual) US healthcare spending; Federal Medicaid
spending has doubled in real terms over the last decade, to $273 billion annually.

e Total government healthcare spending consumes 8.2% of GDP compared with just
1.3% fifty years ago; the new health reform law could increase USA Inc.’s budget
deficit
- As government healthcare spending expands, USA Inc.’s red ink will get much worse if healthcare costs

continue growing 2 percentage points faster than per capita income (as they have for 40 years).

e Unemployment Insurance and Social Security are adequately funded...for now. The
future, not so bright
- Demographic trends have exacerbated the funding problems for Medicare and Social Security — of the
102 million increased enrollment between 1965 and 2009, 42 million (or 41%) is due to an aging
population. With a 26% longer life expectancy but a 3% increase in retirement age (since Social
Security was created in 1935), deficits from Social Security could add $11.6 trillion (or 140%) to the
public debt by 2037E, per Congressional Budget Office (CBO).

Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 15 of 18

Maxwell’s lawyer, Laura Menninger, declined to comment, referring the Herald to the court history.
wy! 4 g ry

“{Roberts] fabricated a story of abuse at the hands of Ms. Maxwell in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars from British tabloids with a motive

for selling papers and advertisements and without regard for truth, veracity or substantiation,” Menninger noted in a 2016 response filed in the case.

In February, the Miami Herald filed a federal court motion in the Southern District of New York, seeking access to documents that were sealed in the
Maxwell case. The motion, which was not opposed by Roberts, could have cast light on the full scope of Epstein’s possible sex trafficking operation, who
was involved and whether it was covered up. Maxwell has opposed the Herald’s motion, which was denied in August.

The Herald is appealing.

Today, Epstein has a new private jet, which takes him around the world. Flight records show that he spends most of his time on his private island, Little St.
James in the U.S. Virgin Islands, which he now lists as his permanent residence. He is registered in New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands as a sex offender.

New Mexico, where he owns a sprawling ranch, does not list him as a convicted sex offender.

As part of its investigation, the Herald learned that in 2013, the federal government conceded that it had given Epstein what it called “valuable
consideration” for information he provided to the FBI as part of his plea deal. The documents do not elaborate, but Epstein — a hedge fund manager who
once worked for the investment firm Bear Stearns — was listed as a key investor who lost money in the financial crash of 2008.

Francey Hakes, a former federal child sex crimes prosecutor, said any consideration the government gave to Epstein should be made public.

“The public has a right to know why he gota slap on the wrist, and what was the interest that was so great that allowed him to not get prosecuted?”

pushing the boundaries of what is known. Wouldn’t this be a bet-
ter course than Introduction to Physics? The teachers could introduce
whatever aspects of physics they wanted to help students understand
the predictive process in that area, but other faculty who did predic-
tion in other areas would be part of the discussion. There would be a
set of interesting issues ranging from predictions that were thought
to be right but weren't, to predictions that are being made today in
each area. The content would be the predictive process itself, not the
traditional subject matter. Statistics (and other useful tools) would be
taught in this context while the predictive process was being studied.

Modeling. Who build models? Psychologists think about models of
the mind, as do computer scientists and philosophers who specialize
in thinking about thinking. Architects and economists build models
of a different sort. Engineers work with models regularly. All of these
people use different modeling tools but they work on the same thing:
trying to figure out how something works by building it and seeing if
they can replicate it. They may be using a computer or building blocks
or electricity or art. It makes no difference. It is all an attempt to see
how things work by building some facsimile. This is an important idea
in human thinking, and a course should be taught to undergraduates
on how to do it by the people who actually do it, teaching different
techniques as they go. They are many ways to build a model, and
students in college should know the possibilities before they take on
further study.

Experimentation. Psychologists do experiments. Chemists do
experiments. Physicists do experiments. Medical researchers do
experiments. (The drug companies are constantly doing experiments
that affect us all.) Why is there no course in learning how to do an
experiment? Shouldn't students be learning how to come up with a
hypothesis and how to test that hypothesis? Isn’t that more important
as a fundamental building block of the mind than any course offered
to freshmen in college today?

Evaluation. Every academic field does evaluation. In every

discipline there are ways and means to discuss and evaluate the
worth of papers and research and practical proposals. Businesses are

Yet especially with my main points of contact in the administration — first Bob
Gates and then his successor, Leon Panetta, as Secretary of Defense —our broadly
shared views, mutual respect, and the strength of the US-Israeli alliance
outweighed any of that. Neither they, nor indeed President Obama, wavered from
their commitment to the principle that Israel needed to retain our “qualitative
military advantage” over any combination of threats we might face, nor to the $3
billion package of annual US aid that underpinned it. We were even able to agree
on additional US backing for our increasingly effective range of anti-missile
systems: the Arrow, against long-range ballistic missiles, developed in
coordination with the US defense contractor Raytheon; “David’s Sling,” to target
enemy forces’ mid-range missiles, cruise missiles and aircraft; and our new Iron
Dome system, integrating sophisticated Israeli radar and guidance technology and
designed to deal with the missile threat from Hizbollah on our northern border and
Hamas in Gaza. It had not yet been used in battle. But from test firings, we were
confident it could destroy incoming rockets with nearly 90-per-cent success.

By late 2011, the issue of Iran had taken on much greater urgency. There was
still no sign the American-led diplomatic efforts were succeeding in removing the
nuclear threat. As for an American military strike, though the President
intermittently declared that “all options” remained on the table, I knew from senior
administration members that it was extremely unlikely to happen. Iran, meanwhile,
had been acquiring thousands more centrifuges, more uranium, and heavier
protection around its key sites. And the “window of vulnerability” was now only
about a year away.

Operationally and politically, at least now a majority of the key players in Israel
agreed that we had to be prepared to take military action if there was no alternative
way to rein in the Iranians. Ashkenazi’s successor as chief-of-staff, Benny Gantz,
had signed off on the attack plan. While the Iranians were getting ever closer to
nuclear-weapons capability, the strike force that we were assembling was also
better equipped, trained and prepared to mount a complex, yet almost certainly
successful, operation. The damage to Iran’s nuclear ambitions would be
considerably less than if we had acted earlier. But our intelligence analysts still
estimated we could set back the Iranians’ program by about two years.

The immediate problem turned out to be timing. A major joint military exercise
with the Americans, agreed on two years earlier, was due to take place in Israel in
April 2012. It would include Patriot missile batteries, naval vessels, and thousands

421

right way to solve our differences: Let
our people decide, those in Palestine as
well as our people in the Diaspora.

Having said so, Hamas has recognized
the Palestine Liberation Organization as
the sole and legitimate representative of
the Palestinian people, including its
mandate to negotiate a final status
agreement with Israel. Once that is
achieved, we expect to hold a national
referendum.

SE: Egypt has played a central role, and

under President Mohamed Morsy's
leadership, will continue to play a strong
role because Palestine and Egypt have a
common interest in achieving peace.

"

unilaterally and shut down the investigation, forcing a legal test likely
before the Supreme Court. He could order the Attorney General—even
given his prior recusal—to repeal the Special Counsel regulations and
close down the investigation, and fire him if he refused. Or he could fire
Rosenstein and seek someone else to oversee the investigation in ways
more to his liking. The Mueller team continues to believe it is protected
by political realities—the President can not know how Congress might
respond, and it might well respond with impeachment. At the same
time, it has tried to game out the uncharted legal areas of exactly what
happens to all of its work product and to the sitting grand juries if the
investigation is in fact shut down or its mission altered.

Likewise, people around the President—embracing a
constitutional face-off as militantly as they maintain the Mueller
investigation is—say this unknown legal area that might be
advantageous to the President. The delays and disruption that result as
courts sort out the ramifications of the President's actions might well be
the President's legal friend—the reason some in the White House have
been urging the President to end the investigation, whatever the
political fallout.

The President's constitutional pardon powers appear to be some
of the most troubling and threatening issues for the Special Counsel. The
Counsel's office believes the President will use his pardon power as an
instrument to undermine the investigation.

According to present and former White House advisors, the
President's recent spate of pardons are in part his way of taunting the
Special Counsel. The White House, according to these sources, is aware
that the Special Counsel has concluded the President's pardon power is
near absolute: the President can certainly pardon himself, and others
involved in the investigation.

Most immediately, the Special Counsel's office believes that the
President will pardon Michael Flynn, perhaps in the coming weeks. The
question for the Mueller team is if it can build an exception to the
President's pardon authority. It’s view here falls back on the
egregiousness of the President's own behavior: there is a level of
obstruction of justice that all reasonable men might know when they
see it. If you pardon someone to get yourself off the hook, that's
obstruction, and subverting the rule of law and the constitution you've
pledged to uphold.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012845.txt,"even when subjects respond to names commonly associated with Caucasian and Black people. A quick
skim through the many blogs commenting on this work reveals a common refrain that makes the key
point: many that have taken this test, whether focusing on race, sexual orientation, or political affiliation,
opine that the test must be invalid because they explicitly disavow any groupish biases. But that’s the
point! What we disavow explicitly has less impact than we would like on what we hold implicitly.

If our implicit system champions one view of racism and our explicit system another, then we are
continuously faced with an epic conflict. To resolve this conflict, and enable the explicit system to emerge
triumphant, requires self-control, keeping the implicit system quiet. Studies of the brain provide
interesting insights into this process. Recall that when we experience conflict, regardless of its content,
there is activation in the anterior cingulate. When we exert self-control, regardless of content, there is
activation in particular regions within the prefrontal cortex. When we feel threatened by a dangerous
animal or person, there is activation in the amygdala. These three brain regions tell an interesting story
about how we process race. When Caucasian subjects view faces of Black as opposed to Caucasian
people staring at them, there is greater activation in the amygdala. This racial difference disappears if
subjects view photos of faces looking away or with eyes closed. It is the potentially threatening aspect of
a face staring at you that engages the racial difference. If you briefly flash faces at Caucasian subjects so
that they are unaware of them, there is stronger activation in the amygdala for Black than Caucasian
faces. But if you present the faces for long enough, allowing them to enter conscious awareness, the
amyegdala’s pattern of activity goes away, replaced instead by strong activation in the anterior cingulate
and prefrontal cortex. Staring longer at someone from a different race triggers a sense of conflict and
engages the system of self-control, pushing down our implicit racism to enable more explicit neutrality
and equality.

What this work shows is that understanding our attitudes and actions toward those of the same
and different race requires consideration of implicit and explicit components. Think of this process like a
hand pushing down on an automatic watering fountain. The machinery that produces the pressure to push
water out of the holes in the fountain operates without concern for what happens outside in the world. The
hand that pushes down is under human control, consciously guided, perhaps with the aim of simply
spreading the water or feeling its’ coolness on a hot day. Though the hand may try to control the
movement of the water, it may only do so to some extent, guided by the power of the automatic engine
below. Thus, we have an automatic bottom up mechanism and a controlled top down mechanism. So it is
with race. The bottom up mechanism operates automatically, pushing forward our implicit prejudice. The
top down mechanism attempts to exert control, when and where it can, to avoid looking racist, sexist, or

what have you. Somewhere, the two meet, creating a personality profile that is more explicitly racist,

Extraordinary Assumptions and Hypothetical Conditions

The value conclusions are subject to the following extraordinary assumptions that may affect the assignment
results. An extraordinary assumption is uncertain information accepted as fact. If the assumption is found to
be false as of the effective date of the appraisal, we reserve the right to modify our value conclusions.

1. The subject property has a fueling dock and four fuel storage tanks located on site; including three diesel
and one gasoline. There were no signs of contamination during our inspection and we have assumed that
there is no adverse environmental impact in connection with the existing fuel equipment used on the
subject property.

2. The parking garage at the subject slightly encroaches on the neighboring property to the immediate
northwest. This land is owned by the Government of the Virgin Islands and we have assumed that no claim
will arise from the encroachments.

3. For this analysis, we have valued the going concern interest in the subject property and have allocated the
value of the personal property from the value of the real property. We were provided with financial
statments from ownership that indicates the depreciated book value of these assets. Itis beyond our scope
to value these assets in use; therefore, we have assumed that the book values of teh personal property
items shown in the statments provided by ownership are reasonably accurate for the purpose of this
allocation exercise.

The value conclusions are based on the following hypothetical conditions that may affect the assignment
results. A hypothetical condition is a condition contrary to known fact on the effective date of the appraisal
but is supposed for the purpose of analysis.

1. No hypothetical conditions were employed in this analysis.

The opinions of value expressed in this report are based on estimates and forecasts that are
prospective in nature and subject to considerable risk and uncertainty. Events may occur
that could cause the performance of the property to differ materially from our estimates,
such as changes in the economy, interest rates, capitalization rates, financial strength of
tenants, and behavior of investors, lenders, and consumers. Additionally, our opinions and
forecasts are based partly on data obtained from interviews and third party sources, which
are not always completely reliable. Although we are of the opinion that our findings are
reasonable based on available evidence, we are not responsible for the effects of future
occurrences that cannot reasonably be foreseen at this time.

generated by the equation over time with rectangular grids of increasing fineness.
The result is an equipartition of phase space such that there is at most one orbital
point in each rectangle of the grid, with, of course, many rectangles in the finer grids
being empty. This final grid partition is called a generating partition. The proportion
of the available boxes of the partition occupied by points is called its area or volume
measure. This measure has been given a variety of names including Liouville, Haar
and Lesbegue measures. lf every box is occupied, it has measure one. If at most
one box, it has measure zero. If we allow partitions to be non-uniform and/or not
fine enough to be generating and apply probability weightings for how many points
fall into each particular box of the grid, the method is called the Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen
or SRB measure after Kolmogorov’s students and followers, the Russian, Ya Sinai,
the Belgian Frenchmen, David Ruelle and the American, Rufus Bowen.

Similar to the SRB measure, the distribution of box occupancy probabilities
multiplied by their logarithms and summed over all cells of the partition yields a
statistical measure that is close to the informational entropy of Claude Shannon as
described above. It is called the metric entropy ( Hy = -X(p; In(pi)), where H means
entropy and gj; is the proportion of the total observations that occupy cell i of the
phase space or state space partition. It was the above noted Russian father of
modern dynamical systems, Kolmogorov, who in 1956 proved that the Shannon
metric entropy is a quantifiable invariant of systems even in very complicated
motion. Stanford University's Donald Ornstein won a Field’s Medal (the under forty
year old mathematician’s Nobel Prize) for his late 1960’s work proving that the
Shannon metric entropy, Hy, was the only invariant for a large class of appropriately
defined, expansive (near by points separating in time) dynamical systems. Recall
that we refer to metric entropy reflecting the relative occupancy as probability
among the possible boxes (or states) as Hy. Hy is maximal when the percentage
occupancy of all occupied boxes is uniform.

Future art stars cause a New Sensation

Louise Jury, Chief Arts Correspondent
15.10.10

Twenty artists hailed as stars of the future are getting the chance to show their work alongside that of 60 masters,
from Picasso and Warhol to Manet, Rodin and Cézanne.

The 20 were chosen from hundreds of graduate students in the New Sensations Prize, a contest now in its fourth
year, organised by Charles Saatchi's gallery and Channel 4.

Their work is part of The House of the Nobleman, an exhibition of art borrowed from international collections
that is being staged in an 18th-century mansion in Cornwall Terrace, Regent's Park, a stone's throw from the
Frieze Art Fair.

Four of the graduates were selected to receive £1,000 bursaries to develop a project for inclusion. They are:
German Pablo Wendel, 30, whose degree work involved squatting in a derelict chip shop to which he built a
staircase, later dismantled by Royal College of Art staff in a health and safety row; Katie Surridge, 25, and Russian
Nika Neelova, 23, both Slade School graduates, and Ross M Brown, 24, who is still studying in Dundee. One of
them will be named this year's overall winner on Monday and the exhibition runs until Wednesday.

Rebecca Wilson, associate director of the Saatchi Gallery, said: “The 20 shortlisted artists have created a stunning
range of work, including

photography, painting, installation and sculpture. The exhibition offers a wonderful opportunity to discover the
bright stars of the future.”

More than half of the graduate artists are based in the capital. “London is still one of the best places to do a fine
art degree and has that reputation across the world, as well as being one of the most vibrant centres for

contemporary art,” Ms Wilson added.

New Sensations at the House of the Nobleman, 2 Cornwall Terrace, is open until Wednesday.

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018299.txt,"spiritually mordant Jews in Rome. His message was among the simplest and most
compact and personal possible: The transmission of faith requires nothing more and
nothing less than faith itself. Romans teaches us that believing in God, which is faith,
is enough for access to all the riches of heaven: God’s righteousness, an afterlife,
forgiveness.

By Luther’s age, however, access to those riches was not so simple. Among other
things, spiritual control had become a source of lucre for the church. The glory of the
Catholic Church, her magnificent cathedrals and clothes, and her insidious habits of
selling passes to heaven in the form of indulgences - this was a deployment of faith
and power marked by a venality that grated against Luther’s from-faith-to-faith
sensibility. When he saw his own congregation increasingly slipping away to
churches with priests who would do what he would not, which was to market and
sell indulgences, he saw a rank, strange hypocrisy: The Church as an economic
instrument. His rage boiled over in the summer of 1517, and he summarized his
case against the Church in the 95 Theses that he nailed to the door of his local
church on October 31s. Papa non vult nec potest ullas penas remittere preter eas,
quas arbitrio vel suo vel canonum imposuit, he wrote in Thesis Five: No matter what
you might pay him, the Pope can’t influence what happens to you after you die. Or,
Thesis 78, Euangelici rhetia sunt, quibus olim piscabantur viros divitiarum.
Indulgences are nets with which one fishes for the riches of men.

As much as Luther was crying for a restoration of Saint Paul’s sense of a personal
faith, he was also starting a difficult and - for the Church - unpleasant argument
about power. Our relation to God, Luther meant, is our relation. It’s not something to
be brokered or sold or negotiated. It does not require fancy clothes or cathedrals or
hierarchies. For Luther, this new logic had engendered a profound spiritual crisis.
He recalled, later in life, the very first time he’d encountered the possibility of direct
access to God, in the pages of Saint Augustine, probably around 1508. “When I came
to the words ‘thee, most merciful father,” he wrote, “the thought that I had to speak
to God without a mediator almost made me flee.”?! Who was he, Martin Luther, to
speak directly to God? But from then on, Luther’s experience of God, his own sense
of power honestly passing from faith to faith - and not from faith to church to faith -
embodied an extremely heretical idea about power: faith without a middleman.

Such a concept undid much of what had been taken as inarguable doctrine. The
Church immediately understood the danger. They rushed to label Luther as heretical
and, later, crazy. In arguing that the Catholic Church, with all of its magnificent
trappings of faith, was really a useless toll gate, Luther was picking at a still larger,
more significant question: How should power be split? If Luther was right, and God
should be accessible directly to each of us, then some other questions tumbled after
that one. Should we have direct access to political power? To ideas? To money and
land and control of our own economic destiny? Could “from faith to faith,” be recast
as “from idea to idea” or “truth to truth” or - and this turned out to be the really

agencies—the so called “alphabet agencies”—such as the FCC, FPC, SEC and FDA. The rest
were run of the mill criminal cases—murder, robbery, rape, assault and other street crimes. It
was a perfect combination for a budding law professor who was interested in constitutional and
criminal law.

Our task began with a case record, which consisted of the appellate briefs filed by the lawyers and
an “appendix,” which included relevant excerpts from the trial transcript and motions filed before
the trial court. Some records were relatively short, perhaps 300 pages in total. Others were
humongous, as many as 5,000 pages. Then there was the complete trial transcript—a verbatim
account of every word spoken during the trial, as well as during the pretrial and post-trial
proceedings. Judge Bazelon would often ask me to read the entire transcript in search of errors
or particular issues that were of interest to him.

When we completed the review, we would discuss the case with the judge, who had read the
briefs and perused the appendix in preparation for the oral argument in court. Occasionally, we
were permitted to listen to the oral argument, especially when leading lawyers were arguing
(which was rare), or when issues close to the judge’s heart were being considered. But generally,
we were required to remain in the chambers working while the judge presided over the oral
argument.

Since Bazelon was the Chief Judge, he always presided and got to assign the opinion to one of the
three judges on a panel (or nine when on rare occasions the entire court heard the case “en
banc”). Following the oral argument, there was a conference among the judges during which a
tentative result was reached and the case assigned. Bazelon always assigned the most interesting
cases to himself, or to a judge whose decisions he wanted to influence.

When the conference was over and the case assigned, we would meet with the judge and he
would tell us which clerk was to work on the opinion. I always got the interesting cases (at least
the ones that interested the judge). My co-clerk, who the judge didn’t much like, got the dregs.
This was fine with him, since he didn’t much like working closely with the judge.

Then the real work would begin. Draft after draft was submitted, marked up by the judge and
rejected with the admonition, “You can do better,” or sometimes “start over, this draft isn’t
right.”

After many drafts, and some pressure from the other judges on the panel, the opinion was
released to the public. Generally, they were majority opinions, often unanimous, but frequently
they were dissenting or concurring opinions. This was a deeply divided court and the dissenting
opinions pulled no punches in criticizing the majority, and vice versa.

At the end of the year, the clerks would prepare bound volumes of all the opinions we worked on
during our clerkship. One was given to the judge and the others to us, as mementoes of our year.
As I write these words, I have in front of me the maroon volume engraved with the following

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018272.txt,"Such a system, Jefferson wrote, was particularly appealing to him because it
contrasted so sharply with the violent shearing of daily life then underway all
around him in Europe. “France, with all its despotism, and two or three hundred
thousand men always in arms, has had three insurrections in the three years | have
been here,” he marvels. In fact, France’s revolutionary age was only just beginning.
The fall of the Bastille was 18 months away; the flight and death of the King five
years off. Paris would soon see a time when one riot a year felt like peace. You can’t
miss in Jefferson’s letter, and in the others he exchanged with Madison that winter
and the following spring, his instinct that the world was changing, that it was being
riven by urgent new forces, and that America must be positioned for the fresh order
both internally and in her foreign policy. Jefferson knows what this new age
demands - liberty - and in that spirit he fires off suggestions for Madison. It is in this
December, 1787 letter that he remarks that he “does not like” the absence of a “bill
of rights”, a hint that led to an adjustment of historic import.

It is possible to regard the transformations of politics, economics and military affairs
over the past centuries, the sorts of bold remakings that tore apart places like the
Bastille or built up instruments like the American Constitution, as emerging froma
few crucial periods, the sorts of historic turns that mark moments when power
makes an epochal shift. It is striking how, in passing through these periods of
unthinkable change, America has benefited so much, so fully. The country was, to
begin with, born out of the social and political revolutions of the 18 century. The
national liberation that pulled Jefferson from his Virginia farm and into politics was
the first of the great, revolutionary movements that convulsed and fractured a
dozen European powers. France followed America, as did Germany and Italy and
soon most of the continent. “The boisterious sea of liberty,” Jefferson called the new
political order*. It required a strong stomach. Tempests of accumulated social
pressures - the Reformation, the Enlightenment, the Scientific Revolution - had
passed over one ancien regieme after another like powerful waves. America, begun
on fresh land and with new ideas inked onto clean paper, had a natural advantage in
the situation of her birth. “I think our government,” Jefferson concluded in his letter
to Madison, “will remain virtuous for many centuries.”

A second transformation of global order began in the middle of the 19 Century, as
Jefferson and Madison's age ended. Their period had largely been one of internal
revolutions, as the nations of Europe realigned their domestic orders. What came
next were furious contests between these countries. We might think of this new
period as starting with the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 and as running, with
increasing violence, through to the summer of 1945 and the end of World War Two.
In this era, Europe’s statesmen struggled from one tragically collapsed balance to
another. The demands of industry and nationalism and ideology and economy could
only be reconciled, it seemed, by war, as if it was absolutely necessary to devour the
old buildings and the young men before a new order could settle in. The scale of this

process, it was hedged with several conditions. The freeze would not be open-
ended, but last for 10 months, as a way of boosting the effort to restart
negotiations. It would apply to new construction, not work already underway. And
it would exclude the post-1967 neighborhoods inside the expanded city limits of
Jerusalem. Like his other moves, it was also dismissed as insignificant by the
Palestinians. Though there was a formal restarting of the talks, they went almost
nowhere during the period of the freeze, which Bibi cited as a reason for not
extending it further. From then on, the negotiations produced even less. I didn’t
buy the narrative that this was entirely Bibi’s fault. Abu Mazen remained
steadfastly, deliberately passive. Obviously not inclined to take the risk of further
widening his rift with Hamas in Gaza, he was content to echo the Obama
administration’s argument that nothing could happen until there was a settlement
freeze. Once the freeze was announced, he went through the motions, avoiding all
the difficult issues, in the expectation Washington would ensure the freeze was
renewed. President Obama’s initial Mideast moves had made it much easier for
Abu Mazen to avoid any serious engagement. In contrast to past presidents, Obama
had placed almost all of the onus for progress on Israel. But the end result also
suited Bibi. Though I never entirely gave up hope of persuading him it was in
Israel’s interest to seek a resolution of our conflict with the Palestinians, it became
more evident as the months went on that his aim was simply to keep things ticking
over, and avoid any major new crisis.

He appointed an old personal friend — a corporate lawyer named Yitzhak
Molcho — as our negotiator. I finally realized how pointless the exercise was when,
during a visit to the United States, I found myself in New York at the same time as
Molcho. We met at the Israeli consulate. We spoke in detail about the state of the
negotiations. With Molcho still in the room, I phoned Bibi in Jerusalem on the
secure phone line. I said I’d just been updated on the talks, and it seemed clear
there were a number of suggestions Israel could make, with no domestic political
risk but with every prospect of improving the atmosphere and accelerating
progress. “Yitzhak is one of Israel’s top lawyers,” I said. “He’s struck dozens of
deals in his life. But he strikes a deal when that’s what his client wants. You are the
client. If you tell him: bring me back the best deal you can — not a peace treaty, just
a deal on a specific issue — he’ Il do it. But if his brief is simply to negotiate, he can
go on negotiating forever. And it’s pretty clear me that’s his brief.” Bibi insisted I
was wrong. He said that what I saw as time-wasting was simple prudence, to make
sure the negotiations bore fruit. But his approach never changed. Whenever it came

event of a falling out between the two of you.” She kind of threw that last
one in there quickly, as if she could get away with me not hearing that I
would basically have to relinquish the rights to my own flesh in blood
and surrender them to a life of servitude and abuse with these people. My
maternal alarm bells went off straight away and I already knew my
answer. No way I could I do that to any poor baby, God only knew what
these monsters had in store for me let alone a baby, but it was an instant
reaction that saved me. “I don’t know guy’s, | mean I’m really young
and never really even thought about having kids yet. Wow, I just don’t
know.” I slicked my hand through my hair nervously and took in a silent
breath. [ had to go beyond what I was truly feeling and give them the
feeling that I’d never let them down. Putting an eager smile on my face
and sucking up my gut’s intuition I told them “You know what, let me get
my certificates in massage and have some time to prepare for this and get
healthy then next year we’ll all think about having a baby together.” It
was crazy to even hear me say out loud but from the expressions on their
faces I had fulfilled their wishes.

Much reason to celebrate that night they were both in a cheery mood
around the dinner table. Except for me who had taken double the dosage
of Xanax to even cope with the high amounts of anxiety I had been
suffering from since we got back from the dock. I wasn’t sipping the
champagne that night, I was gulping it and when their moods tumed from
cheery to raunchy later that evening it wasn’t hard for me to comply.
From the full effects of the state I was in I would’ve agreed to just about
anything, allowing them to treat themselves to ravishing the tender parts
of my body.

Over the next few weeks everything went on as it normally would, and
not another mention of their proposal. My birthday was only a week away
and I was turning nineteen that year. All ] wanted was to get my
certificates before I got any older and get trapped into this life for good.
When my big day rolled around I was in New York with Jeffrey and
Ghislane. Sitting on my bed listening to MTV’s channel blare in the
background of my room I was painting my toenails when I was suddenly
buzzed on the intercom. It was Jeffrey calling himself to ask me to meet
him in his office in ten minutes. Perfect timing to let my nails dry I
thought to myself. Already contemplating his desire to come downstairs I
knew it had something to do with my birthday present but I was more
expecting the usual shopping money or piece of jewelry, definitely not
what he had in store for me.

I knocked on the slightly ajar door to Jeffrey’s office and heard him
beckon me inside. “Hello, what cha up too?” I asked in a cutesy tone of
voice. Walking over to his desk he looked up at me taking his reading

glasses off while granting me a big smile. “Come over here and sit down
with me” as he ushered me to come sit on his lap. Pulling me onto him he
had a funny look on his face, like he had something really big to tell me
and was letting the anticipation build in the thickness of the silence.
“What???” I laughed at the way he was looking at me now. “First of
all.:. Happy birthday today.” Was only the beginning of his
announcement and he proceeded to tell me “I know how much you have
wanted this for so long and you are more than deserving of it. You are
going away to Thailand to learn authentic Thai Massage and within eight
weeks you'll receive a certificate for being a qualified Thai Massage
Therapist.” Astonished at his attempts to see me get what 1 wanted, not
exactly the type of massage I was interested in but it was a start and a
first certificate for me to acquire. My eyes lit up and I threw my arms
around his neck, planting a big kiss on his lips, which I rarely ever did.
“Wow, I don’t know what to say, this is beyond my wildest
dreams...thank you so much!” I did well to let him know I appreciated
his grandeur offer. He went on to give me the details of where I’d be
staying, the school’s schedules, and how much he loved Thai massage,
apparently it was the next big thing to hit the shores of America. He had
planned out an entire itinerary for me. I was to depart at the end of
August and he had already enrolled me in a class at “ITM Massage
School”. I would only have a few days to settle in before I would be
attending classes five days a week over eight hours a day. He even had an
assignment for me to do while I was over there. | was to meet up with a
girl who was also being put up at the “Princess Hotel” where | was
staying. She had an Asian sounding name so I just assumed she was a
local girl hoping for an opportunity of a lifetime, if she only knew what
she would be getting herself into. If 1 decided that she met Jeffrey’s
particular quota of approval then she would be sent over to the U.S to
meet with him or one of his esteemed colleagues. Besides the guilt of
having to decide a stranger’s uncertain fate, everything else sounded
more than wonderful. Eight weeks gone from Jeffrey sounded like a
lifetime away and I couldn’t be more excited at this chance. It was the
opportunity of my lifetime and I wasn’t going to waste a second of it.
Ghislane came in a few minutes later and the look on her face told me
she already knew. I got up from Jeffrey’s lap and gave her a big hug and
told her, “This is so nice of you guys, Thank you so much!” She didn’t
share my enthusiasm of excitement. In a dull tone she responded, “I
didn’t have a thing to do with it, it was all Jeffrey’s idea but good-luck
anyways.” She gave me her best impression of being human for a brief
second and hugged me back. It was just her way and I had come to accept
it. Depending on the level of slander her insults provoked was just her
way of telling you she cares without really ever showing it. Probably

Eleu Street in the middle-class suburb of Waipahu. It was part of
the Royal Kunia development, which contained three hundred
similar-looking homes. According to Albi Matco, the manager of the
community association for the development, many of the residents
worked at military facilities in the area. The corner house Snowden
rented was comfortable enough, with three bedrooms, a walk-in
closet, a living room with a high ceiling, and a single-car garage, but
in no way lavish. It did not even have a backyard. He moved in on
April 2, 2012, which entailed a brief separation from his girlfriend,
Mills, who had committed herself to attending a girlfriend’s wedding
the following month. After he left for his new assignment, she wrote
on Instagram, “Sex toy party and then saying goodbye to my man—
well not goodbye so much as see you in two months.”

William James, in The Principles of Psychology, tried to capture the subjective

already engaged, are available for use for self-organized structure evoked by new
information. Without ordered, low entropy, preconceived ideational defects in the
resting random brain field, the full attentional statistical machine is available to
sensitively respond in self-organized, quasi-stable states of cognitive, conative and
affective integration. They then disappear; this brain relaxes quickly, ready for new
experience. This contrasts with those brains that are dominated by islands of order

Subject Re: Epstein)

Dear Jeff:

I received your email yesterday and was a little surprised at the tone of your letter, given
the fact that we spoke last week and had what I thought was a productive meeting. I was
especially surprised given that your letter arrived on only the second day back to work after the
Thanksgiving Holiday, and yet your demands regarding timing suggest that I have been sitting on
my hands for days.

You should know that the first time I learned about Judge Davis’s selection of Podhurst
and Josephsberg, and indeed the first time I ever heard their names, was in our meeting with you
on Wednesday of last week. Nevertheless, I have now been able to confer with my client, and we
have determined that the selection of Podhurst and Josephsberg are acceptable to us, reserving, of
course, our previously stated objections to the manner in which you have interpreted the section
2255 portions of the Agreement.

We do, however, strongly and emphatically object to your sending a letter to the alleged
victims. Without a fair opportunity to review and the ability to make objections to this letter, it is
completely unacceptable that you would send it without our consideration. Additionally, given
that the US Attorney’s office has made clear it cannot vouch for the claims of the victims, it
would be incendiary and inappropriate for your Office to send such a letter. Indeed, because it is
a certainty that any such letter would immediately be leaked to the press, your actions will only
have the effect of injuring Mr. Epstein and promoting spurious civil litigation directed at him.
We believe it is entirely unprecedented, and in any event, inappropriate for the Government to be
the instigator of such lawsuits.

Finally, we disagree with your view that you are required to notify the alleged victims
pursuant to the Justice for All Act of 2004. First, 18 USC section 2255, the relevant statute
under the Non-Prosecution Agreement for the settlement of civil remedies, does not have any
connection to the Justice for All Act. Section 2255 was enacted as part of a different statute.
Second, the Justice for All Act refers to restitution, and section 2255 is not a restitution statute.
It is a civil remedy. As you know, we had offered to provide a restitution fund for the alleged .

To: Jeffrey Epstein <jeevacation@gmail.com> 
A few things to think about: 
If the Patterson book is being published in August, that presents some time frame issues. You would not be 
able to do a competing book or documentary before then. This is not to say that they shouldn't be pursued. In 
a sense, better that they know what Patterson's position is and, a year from now say, be able to counter it. I 
have some thoughts on book and doc to share at your convenience. 
That being said, you do need an immediate counter narrative to the book. I believe Trump offers an ideal 
opportunity. It's a chance to make the story about something other than you, while, at the same time, letting 
you frame your own story. Also, becoming an anti-Trump voice gives you a certain political cover which you 
decidedly don't have now. Still, this necessary involves you going public. And so the most basic decision is 
about your willingness to do that. My view is that in a couple of weeks you could master message and 
technical proficiency. I know a bunch of people who could be very helpful here. This would involve something 
along the lines of you writing an op-ed, doing a high profile television interview (Charlie Rose, I'd say), and 
perhaps some social media efforts. 
Speaking of which, again, I think a strategic plan, involving your public identity, philanthropic activities and 
interests, and the development of media allies, ought finally to be put in place. A big, comprehensive, 
expensive effort. 
The alternative is to continue to keep head down and hope Patterson book is just more he-said she-said and 
Connolly getting lost in the reeds (which, as an inveterate conspiracist, he always does). My worry is that 
Patterson can be counted on to produce a bestseller, and while he isn't regarded as a serious writer, he'll 
surely be unloading a lot of tabloid copy. Because this will be tied to the election, the Trump-Clinton angle will 
amp up the attention 10-fold, in fact, possibly, a hundred fold. Possibly more than anything you've 
encountered before. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033589 
Meanwhile--
In a lawyer's letter, I'd suggest including the following points--not necessarily legal, but a warning about how a 
press campaign might unfold (publishers are more worried about being caught in negative media controversy 
than they are of legal threats): 
1) Little, Brown has made on the record representations to at least one well-known journalist that it was not 
publishing a book by James Patterson about Jeffrey Epstein--possibly an effort to avoid inquiries about the 
questionable nature of the book; 
2) The actual author of the book, John Connolly, is someone other than the stated author, James Patterson. 
Connolly is known to have developed an obsession with Epstein, such that, his longtime employer, Vanity Fair, 
has refused to allow him to write about Epstein for the magazine; 
3) Sources have confirmed for us that Patterson has had little more than a minimal consulting role in the book, 
and that Connolly has functioned in every material way as the book's researcher and writer. We believe 
Patterson's authorship of the book will not stand up to scrutiny. And, indeed, that the entire notion of an 
extension of the Patterson franchise into nonfiction, as it has been used in fiction and children's book--
effectively other authors writing under the Patterson name—presents a host of journalism ethical issues.

Canada YES 
Check this last set of statistics!! The percentage of each past president's cabinet who had worked in the private business sector prior to their appointment to the cabinet. You know what the private business sector is a real-life business, not a government job Here are the percentages.

GW Bush........................ 55% 
Obama..................... 8% 
This helps to explain the incompetence of this administration: 
only 8% of them have ever worked in private business! 
That's right! Only eight percent---the least, by far, of the 
last 19 presidents! And these people are trying to tell our big 
corporations how to run their business? 
How can the president of a major nation and society, the one 
with the most successful economic system in world history, stand and talk about business when 
he's never worked for one? Or about jobs when he has never really had one? And when it's the same for 
92% of his senior staff and closest advisers? They've spent most of their time in academia, 
government and/or non-profit jobs or as community organizers. They should have been in an employment

Pass this on because we'll NEVER see these facts in the main

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029930.txt,"were told that they would receive no
medicine at all. The researchers at-
tempted to assess the combined impact
of many different kinds of trials using
meta-analysis, a statistical technique for
extracting information from studies that
are not statistically significant by them-
selves. Their article, “Is the Placebo Pow-
erless? An Analysis of Clinical Trials
Comparing Placebo with No Treat-
ment,” published in The New England
Journal of Medicine, was a long-overdue
response to Beecher’s 1955 paper.

In almost every case, the researchers re-
ported, there was essentially no difference
between the placebo group and the openly
untreated group. There were particular ex-
ceptions in studies of pain, where there
was a slight but measurable placebo effect.
Since we are physiologically capable of
manufacturing our own painkillers—en-
dorphins—the result may not have been
surprising. Expectations and suggestion
clearly influence behavior, and when we
expect to receive medicine our bodies
often begin to prepare for it. (As the evo-
lutionary biologist Robert Trivers recently
pointed out, in “The Folly of Fools,” his
book about the historical necessity of de-
ceit, what the brain expects to happen in
the near future affects its physiological
state. Trivers’s theory would explain a fact
that has often baffled scientists: the pla-
cebo effect doesn’t appear to work with
Alzheimer’s patients. Trivers suggests that
this is because most people who have Al-
zheimer’s disease are unable to anticipate
the future and are therefore unable to pre-
pare for it.)

The Danish researchers repeated the
study in 2004, and again last year, incor-
porating new data each time. The re-
sults and their conclusions remained
the same. “We found little evidence in
general that placebos had powerful clin-
ical effects,” Hrdbjartsson wrote. “Out-
side the setting of clinical trials, there is
no justification for the use of placebos.”

Kaptchuk has great respect for Hré-
bjartsson, yet he is wary of relying on
meta-analyses, and he believes that an
honest interaction between a doctor and
a patient can significantly alter the out-
come of treatment. That was the point of
his study of irritable-bowel syndrome, in
which some subjects were told that they
would not be treated. I.B.S., a chronic
gastrointestinal disorder, is one of the
most common reasons that people seek

medical care. Effective long-term thera-
pies have proved elusive. In Kaptchuk’s
study, eighty patients were randomly di-
vided into two groups. Patients in the first
group received a placebo pill twice a day;
those in the second received nothing. Be-
fore the study began, both groups were
told that placebos were “inert or inactive
pills, like sugar pills, without any medica-
tion in them.” They were also informed
that placebos have been shown in “rigor-
ous clinical testing to produce significant
mind-body self-healing processes.” Pa-
tients who received the openly distributed
placebo scored far better on standard as-
sessments of their condition than those
who received nothing. There were also
statistically significant differences in the
severity of symptoms.

Although a group of eighty patients is
too small to draw definitive conclusions,
honesty seemed to work. “Asbjorn’s stuff
is a constant intellectual challenge,” Kapt-
chuk wrote in an e-mail. “His meta-anal-
yses are tops. Great methods, very careful.
Clear.” Yet Kaptchuk also pointed out
that placebos are not the only interven-
tions that can cause complicated reac-
tions. Drugs do, too. Opiods, for exam-
ple, increase pain in about ten per cent of
those who take them. Antibiotics don’t al-
ways work, and neither does cortisone, a
powerful steroid used each year by mil-
lions of people. Meta-analyses are useful
to help understand large amounts of data
from different trials. But statistical results
that combine information from a
variety of medical centers, with
different kinds of patients, often
in different countries, adminis-
tered under different conditions,
cannot be uniform and therefore
cannot be conclusive.

Hrébjartsson and Kaptchuk
are united on at least one front.
Like Wayne Jonas, they agree
that the medical system needs to
change. “You have to put this into
the context of the society in which
you live,” Hrébjartsson told me. “Because
I think this may be as much a matter of
philosophy as of science. There is an anti-
technological, anti-science feeling in the
West. We constantly see frustration with
the limits of medicine. The placebo can be
seen in some sense as a logical avenue for
those frustrations. Everyone wants a sim-
ple, pain-free solution. But I wonder if that
approach isn’t just the mirror image of the

pharmacological way of handling illness—
that there is a pill for every disease.

“The entire idea of a placebo is very
‘soapy, ” Hrébjartsson continued. “It slips
away whenever you try to find a border.”

That has always been true. After all, for
many people a placebo is just a sugar pill.
For others, the definition includes the en-
tire ritual of treatment, the complete inter-
action between doctor and patient. In-
creased attention has mostly raised new
questions: What are the physical and psy-
chological mechanisms that produce pla-
cebo effects? What are the conditions they
most easily affect? And can we actually
identify people who respond to placebos?
Scientists now have bits of answers to some
of those questions, but to reach their goal,
and introduce placebos into clinical prac-
tice, they will need to answer all of them.

T Kaptchuk gets a great deal of
pleasure from focussing on what
other people reject. Indifference seems to
motivate him. “I was raised in a crazy
home, and it prepared me to accept any
proposition,” he said. That, he once told
me, is why he was so active in the sixties:
“Tt was a time when the underpinnings of
the universe were questioned.” Both of
Kaptchuk’s parents, who were Poles, sur-
vived the Holocaust. “That really defines
a lot of what I do. My father was a Red,
so I have a tendency to get pleasure from
subversiveness.”

A particularly radical son of the six-
ties, Kaptchuk was one of the
founders of the Columbia Uni-
versity chapter of Students for
a Democratic Society, in 1965,
but the organization was soon
dominated by a faction that be-
came the Weather Under-
ground. That was too radical
even for Kaptchuk. He fled to
the West Coast. “I was hanging
out with the San Francisco Red
Guards and reading Mao, trying
to get away from U.S. imperial-
ism,” he said. “I was militant and crazy.
But at some point I said, Ted, this is not
being human.”

Kaptchuk decided to pursue studies in
Chinese philosophy and medicine at the
source. Beijing had yet to open its bor-
ders to Americans, but Kaptchuk hoped
that his revolutionary bona fides would
prompt the leadership to make an excep-
tion. “My request to study there was de-

Eastern Europe, and military dictatorships elsewhere,
there was an explosion of newspapers, radio and
television stations, and other independent media with
diverse editorial policies. But the internet in particular
was seen as an irresistible force that could render
censorship of any kind impossible. In 2000, President
Bill Clinton compared China's efforts to control inter-
net content to “trying to nail Jell-O to the wall.””

Third, a growing number of experts began to identify
anew instigator of democratic change in global civil
society. Unlike the “peoples movements’ of earlier
decades, in which well-known leaders mobilized mass
demonstrations and often insurrectionary violence
with the goal of overthrowing despotic regimes, the
phenomenon that was labeled civil society consisted
of organizations that were often committed to a single
cause or a few causes united by a particular theme.
Most activists were young, with little prior involvement
in politics, and many regarded themselves as part of

a global effort to advance goals like reducing carbon
emissions, empowering women, or fighting corruption.

In a prescient 1997 article, Jessica T. Mathews predict-
ed that in the future global civil society would be the
triggering force behind liberal change.* She suggested
that in many cases civil society organizations would
play amore important role than governments. Her
words seemed prescient in light of later events in
Serbia, where student activists organized a campaign
that eventually brought about the downfall of President
Slobodan MiloSevicé in 2000, and in Ukraine, where
young reformers played a pivotal role in ensuring that
the 2004 elections were not stolen through fraud.

In declaring that dictatorships or even authoritarian
methods were destined to succumb to this triad of

new social forces, commentators were also express-
ing optimism about the universal appeal of liberal
values. The decade after the end of the Cold War
was a heyday for democratic ideas and norms. It was
increasingly expected that countries would not only
hold elections, but that their elections would meet
international standards and be judged “free and fair.”
There was also an expectation that political parties
would be able to compete on a reasonably level
playing field, that opposition leaders would not be
harassed or arrested, and that minorities would be
able to pursue their agendas through normal political
channels and not find it necessary to wage perpetual
protest campaigns.

However, there were nagging questions. It remained
unclear whether most societies would have access to
multiple sources of political ideas, multiple interpreta-
tions of the news, and open scholarly inquiries about
the past. Would there be honest judicial proceedings,
especially in cases with political implications? Would
property rights be secure?

Beyond these primarily domestic issues, there was
another series of questions related to individual
governments’ relations with their neighbors and the
rest of the world. The end of the Cold War had brought
a peace dividend, both financial and psychological,

for all sides. At the time, most assumed that peace
would prove durable. But would the general decline

in military budgets hold? Would the new national
boundaries that divided the former Soviet Union and
the former Yugoslavia be sustainable?

As modern authoritarianism has taken root and ex-
panded its influence, the answers to these questions
are increasingly negative.

sure she won the respect of many Israelis for taking an all-to-rare stand of
principle. She certainly won mine. But I was not alone in wondering whether it
was worth the price that she, Kadima, and the country would pay as a result: Bibi’s
return as Prime Minister in a Likud-led coalition.

Though I was not surprised when he asked me to remain as Defense Minister,
and to keep Labor inside the coalition, that was not an easy argument to make to
my reduced Knesset contingent. They saw joining Bibi, especially in a government
with the right-wing Lieberman as Foreign Minister, as a betrayal of all the efforts
that they and I had made to achieve peace with the Palestinians. Still, the decision
on whether to join the coalition ultimately rested with the party central committee,
almost every one of whose members was on a local government council. For them,
the choice was between a share of power, however limited, and the wilderness of
opposition. So we joined Bibi’s government.

I was personally in favor of our doing so, but for more complicated reasons. I
knew that Bibi’s background, his instincts and his undeniably powerful political
rhetoric were all firmly rooted on the political right. I recognized that he was often
more interested in politics than policy, and perhaps above both of those, in the
tactical maneuvering required to consolidate his political position. But I had known
him long enough to dismiss the suggestions of many of my colleagues that he was
intellectually shallow. I felt he was capable of doing what was best for Israel, and
that he had a basic pragmatism that would guide how he got there. All that,
however, was just a reason for not saying “no” when he asked me and Labor to
stay on. The reason I felt it was right to say yes had to two with specific policy
challenges. The first was to ensure there at least some peace process with the
Palestinians. But that, in turn, was in large part because I believed it would win us
the diplomatic support, especially from the Americans, needed to tackle a more
urgent threat. It again involved an enemy state trying to get nuclear weapons. But
not Syria. The Islamic theocracy of Iran.

We’d been aware for a number of years about Iranian efforts to go nuclear. The
Mossad had notched up a series of successes in delaying the Iranians from getting
there. But they were getting inexorably closer. In fact, when I’d taken over as
Defense Minister under Olmert, I formally directed the new chief-of-staff, Gaby
Ashknazi, to get to work on a plan to attack the most important facilities in the
Iranians’ nuclear network, with the aim of pushing back the point at which they
might develop a bomb by five to six years. But it became clear we didn’t have the

103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *902

Responses to unjustified police violence reveal a third outcome for enforcement redundancy confined to the federalism model.
Federal enforcement authority extends to cases of police violence to a much greater degree than for sexual assaults. That
authority extends as well to other kinds of bias-motivated wrongdoing by both private actors and government officials, which
local police and prosecutors have at times ignored or devalued, and for which state-level enforcement commitment continues to
be uneven. !” Federal jurisdiction is coextensive with state jurisdiction regarding police wrongdoing, and the Justice
Department's institutional capacity for enforcement probably exceeds that of its state counterparts, but in one respect the
overlap is not complete. The key substantive criminal offenses available to prosecutors in the federal code are somewhat more
restrictive. The primary federal statute used to charge cases of [*903] police excessive use of force requires proof of willful

deprivation of rights, °°

a strict mens rea standard that makes it harder for federal prosecutors to prove liability than it would
be for state prosecutors relying on typical assault or homicide offense definitions. 7°! The fact that Congress has for decades
let stand this mens rea hurdle to excessive-force prosecutions suggests that federal legislators, if not Justice Department
officials, are less committed to a full federal-state enforcement redundancy - or to altering the federal-state balance in order to
reinforce state law enforcement - than they are for public corruption offenses. 7°

That limit notwithstanding, federal prosecutions in this area have a track record of succeeding where state prosecutions failed
or were never attempted, and in that way providing at least a partial remedy for underenforcement by state criminal justice
officials. Much of the federal advantage comes from the fact that federal prosecutors are, in general, better situated to
objectively investigate, assess, and prosecute wrongdoing by police officers than are local prosecutors who ordinarily interact
with and depend upon those officers (or at least their agencies). This is not a particular criticism of local prosecutors’ offices; it
is one instance of the basic problem that officials (and people generally) are untrustworthy judges of the conduct of others with
whom they have affiliations, allegiances, or ongoing relationships. For that reason a few states assign such cases to state-level,
rather than local, officials. 7° And the U.S. Justice Department attempts to collect data on deaths in jails, prison, or during
[#904] attempted arrests, to facilitate Justice Department oversight. ?°4 The same concerns motivate English laws applying
special judicial scrutiny (when triggered by requests from victims' families) to prosecutor's decisions not to charge in the case

of death caused by law enforcement officials or occurring in official custody. 7°

131 Some federal states such as Germany and Canada lack enforcement redundancy because they use a single, nationwide, criminal code,
which is enforced for prosecution agencies and courts organized at the state or provincial level. See generally Eric P. Polten & Eric Glezl,
Federalism in Canada and Germany: Overview and Comparison (2014) (describing similarities in German and Canadian federalism,
including allocating authority over substantive criminal law to the federal government but criminal justice administration to state or
provincial prosecutors and courts). In Australia, like in the United States, states and the federal government each have their own criminal
codes. But Australian federal criminal authority is confined much more narrowly than in the United States to conduct that implicates a
distinct federal interest. See generally Arther B. Gunlicks, The Lander and German Federalism 59, 72, 129 (2003) (describing German
criminal affairs and jurisdictions as compared to the United States); Polten & Glezl, supra, at 5-6, 10, 13-14; Brian Galligan, Comparative
Federalism, in The Oxford Handbook of Political Institutions 261, 266-75 (Sarah A. Binder et al. eds., 2008) (discussing federalism and
judicial review and regulations); Kathleen Daly & Rick Sarre, Criminal Justice System: Aims and Processes, in Crime and Justice: A Guide
to Criminology 357 (Darren Palmer et al. eds., 5th ed. 2017) (examining the processes and purposes of the criminal justice system); Vicki
Waye & Paul Marcus, Australia and the United States: Two Common Criminal Justice Systems Uncommonly at Odds, Part 2, 78 Tul. J. Int'l
& Comp. L. 335 (2010) (highlighting similarities and differences between the two countries in relation to criminal laws and policies).

32 Since 2011, Switzerland also now has unified national criminal law and procedure codes administered in all cantons. See Anna Petrig,
The Expansion of Swiss Criminal Jurisdiction in Light of International Law, 9 Utrecht L. Rev. 34, 36 (2013).

33 See Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983 s 10(2); Annual Report 2014-15, supra note 71.

34 Tn unusual circumstances, two states may also have concurrent jurisdiction over the same crime, enabling one to assess the adequacy of
the other's enforcement effort. For a rare example, see Heath v. Alabama, 474 U.S. 82, 91-93 (1985).

35. See U.S. Const. amend. V (Double Jeopardy Clause); Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U.S. 121, 136-39 (1959) (affirming power of state to
prosecute defendant after a federal prosecution for the same bank robbery); United States v. Lanza, 260 U.S. 377, 384-85 (1922) (approving
federal prosecution after state prosecution based on same conduct).

neighboring countries. More than a million of refugees from Syria have fled to

Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon and Iraq.

Some critics, looking at the turmoil in Syria, Egypt, Lybia, claim that the warm Arab
spring has turned into a cold winter. Tunisia, for example, the first of the Arab
countries to overthrow their dictatorship, is on the edge of another civil war after
two political assassinations. It might take years until the situation in Syria stabilizes,
decades until the country turns into a genuine and a true democracy. If Americans
are to learn from their mistakes in Iraq and Libya, military intervention is off the
table. To stop Syria’s turmoil, the United States needs a new strategy aimed at
pressuring both sides into negotiating. Syrian conflict cannot be resolved by military
methods. The only way to end the war is through political dialogue. Providing the
rebels with weapons would only aggravate the situation and lead to more deaths

and casualties.

So who /s this Aquino guy? According to Cathy, “In the early 1980s,
my base programming was instilled at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, by U.S.
Army Lt. Colonel Michael Aquino. He holds a Top Secret clearance in the
Defense Intelligence Agency’ s Psychological Warfare Division (PSYOP).
He is a professed neo-Nazi, the founder of the Himmler-inspired satanic
Temple of Set and has been charged with child ritual and sexual abuse at
the Presidio Day Care in San Francisco. But like my father, Aquino remains

‘above the law’ while he continues to traumatize and program CIA-

destined young minds in a quest to reportedly create the ‘superior race’
of Project Monarch mind-controlled slaves.”

“Not only was | never stationed at Fort Campbell at anytime
throughout my entire Army career, but I’ ve never even visited that
particular post, on- or off-duty. | have never had any contact at anytime,
anyplace, anywhere with Cathy O’ Brien. | have never programmed sex
slaves for the government or anyone else. | have never participated in any
form of child abuse whatever.”

in order to sustain CWOL, the long term gains to player 1 from the ongoing relationship
must suffice for player 1 to cooperate when player 1 expects the temptation to sometimes
be high. That is, not looking makes the expected—as opposed to realized-gains from
defection relevant, in a sense smoothing the temptation to defection. Thus, the range
where CWOL is an equilibrium and CWL is not, ep + e@(1 — p) < <5 < @, has the
following interpretation: the expected temptation is low but the maximal temptation is
high. In the appendix, we confirm this result using our subgame perfections analysis. We
also use dynamics to show that, CWOL increases relative to CWL when we increase the
maximal temptation, but hold the mean temptation constant.

We identify a second condition under which people will be most likely to avoid and
detect looking by relaxing the assumption d > reel Then, in the region where d < raretlD
there is a fourth equilibrium. It is the strategy pair where player 2 always continues if
player 1 cooperates when the temptation is low, and player 1 looks and cooperates only
when the temptation is low (we refer to this as the ONLYL equilibrium). In contrast,
CWOL is an equilibrium for all values of d. CWOL is thus the only cooperative equilibrium
in the parameter region d > eat which has the interpretation: defection is sufficiently
harmful to player 2 such that player 2 prefers to avoid the interaction if player 1 only
cooperates some of the time.

Note that CWOL is an equilibrium over a wider parameter region than both CWL
and ONLYL, and thus that the ability to avoid looking and to detect whether others look
increases the parameter space over which cooperation is feasible. To see this, consider re-
moving player 1’s strategy which consists of not looking. Alternatively, consider removing

player 2’s strategy where he conditions his behavior on whether player 1 has looked. In

either case, cooperation is only sustained in a Nash Equilibrium if +. > ap+c2(1—p) or

on all new deals, which, in addition to assessment against the sector specific strategies, includes

e Medical need and market size

e Competing therapies, both drugs and devices

e Strength of intellectual property

e Ease of physician adoption of new therapy

e Specific details of clinical trial design and trial execution risks

e Regulatory and reimbursement risks across relevant geographies

e Management team’s ability to both execute the business plan and the exit

e Likely exit; potential acquirers, IPO prospects.

The Fund Managers will continue their proven investment philosophy and investment process,
which emphasizes a team approach to proactive deal sourcing, rigorous investment analysis,
significant involvement with portfolio companies and active management of investments and
exits, and a focus on key “risk inflection” points based on the disease and technology.
Investments will include both development stage and start-up stage companies, as well as
growth equity or expansion capital investment in NLV-III’s targeted sectors, in the private and
public markets.

The Fund Managers have a long history of separating the roles of transaction finder,
negotiating/ closing the transaction, and board member, as needed. New Leaf seeks to put the
most appropriate investment professional on the board of companies, based on experience. The
Fund Managers have fostered a culture that discourages any professional from feeling the need
to control all aspects of an investment. Credit is given for each professional's role, and for each
team member's ability to be a team player. New Leaf seeks to avoid “lone ranger” behavior and
instead actively implements a team approach.

The Fund Managers intend to create a very selective portfolio of 24 to 28 companies, which will
include a balanced mix of investments in private companies and small capitalization public
companies. The targeted portfolio is expected to be diversified across biopharmaceuticals (50 -
60%), information convergence (up to 25%), and the remainder across investments in later stage
medical device and biological tools and infrastructure companies. While the Fund Managers
believe this distribution of investments is the most likely outcome, it also intends to take full
advantage of pricing discontinuities should they emerge in any of the identified sectors of
interest, possibly resulting in variance from this targeted allocation.

104 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 59, *93

In 2006, Epstein's acts of abuse came to the attention of the Palm Beach Police Department, which began investigating the case.
195 At this point, once again, the victims would not have had rights under the proposed CVRA test. The CVRA extends rights in
the federal criminal justice process. A state investigation does not trigger the CVRA (although it may trigger certain state law
protections, as discussed below). !%°

At some point in 2006, the Palm Beach Police Department asked the FBI to investigate Epstein on federal sex offenses, such as
using a means of [*94] interstate communication in connection with sex offenses and traveling in interstate commerce for the
purpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct with minors. !97 The local police provided the FBI with information, which the
FBI then investigated. Following an investigation, the FBI determined that the allegations of abuse against Epstein were
credible, and it presented the case to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida. In 2007, the Office
contacted counsel for Jeffrey Epstein and began negotiating a resolution of the case against him. 78

Under our proposed test, the victims would not have had CVRA rights the first moment that the FBI became aware of Epstein’s
possible commission of sex offenses. But after the FBI developed substantial evidence of those sex offenses, identified victims
of those offenses, and presented the case to the appropriate U.S. Attorney's Office for prosecution, CVRA rights would have
attached. Accordingly, the FBI would have been required to notify the identified victims of their rights under the CVRA (as
well as under the VRRA). From that point forward in the case, the victims would have had CVRA rights, such as the right to
fair treatment and the right to confer with prosecutors. In this case, the victims would have had the right to confer with

prosecutors about the nonprosecution agreement that they ultimately reached with Epstein. 1°?

C. CURRENT DEPARTMENT POLICY ON PRE-CHARGING RIGHTS

One objection that might be made to the formulation offered above is that it might unduly burden federal law enforcement
officers and prosecutors, who would need to make judgment calls about when an investigation has coalesced to the point where
victims are in existence, substantial evidence has been collected, and notice of rights has to be provided. Any such
objection would be ill-founded, though, as it does not appear that implementing such an approach would be difficult. 7°
Presumably the Justice Department has already been providing such rights in at least Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi to
comply with the Fifth [*95] Circuit's 2008 ruling in In Re Dean, which held that the CVRA extends rights to victims before

defendants are charged. 7°! We have not seen any reports that providing the rights has been difficult.

Perhaps the reason for the lack of any reported difficulty is that the Department's current policy on crime victims' rights already
requires notices to victims during investigations. The Justice Department has promulgated the Attorney General Guidelines for
Victim and Witness Assistance, the latest edition of which is from May 2012. The Guidelines discuss crime victims’ rights
under both the CVRA and the earlier VRRA. Because of the OLC memorandum discussed above, the Guidelines limit CVRA

Balance of Power is the important, groundbreaking new book by Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson, authors 
of Why Nations Fail, a widely acclaimed international bestseller that has sold close to half a million copies in 
English, and hundreds of thousands in translations around the world. 
Balance of Power, Acemoglu and Robinson write, develops an entirely original thesis about the diversity of 
the ways in which states function, resolve conflicts, provide public services and more broadly use their powers. 
It is the logical extension of a research agenda we have been developing together for twenty years, and we have 
a great deal to offer on this topic. We have demonstrated our ability not only to produce original, thought-
provoking social science works but also to reach and explain our ideas to a broad audience. 
DARON ACEMOGLU is the Elizabeth and James Killian Professor of Economics in the Department of 
Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was the recipient of the John Bates Clark Medal in 
2005, awarded every two years to the best economist in the United States under the age of forty by the American 
Economic Association, and the Erwin Plein Nemmers prize, awarded every two years for work of lasting 
significance in economics. He holds Honorary Doctorates from the University of Utrecht, Bosporus University, 
and the University of Athens. 
JAMES A. ROBINSON is an economist and political scientist who is currently one of eight University 
Professors at the University of Chicago and one of only twenty-one people who have held such a position. He 
has conducted research in Bolivia, Botswana, Chile, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, 
Mauritius, Mexico, the Philippines, Sierra Leone, and South Africa. He was selected as one of Foreign Policy's 
Top Global Thinkers of 2012 and is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

THE JANUS POINT 
A New Theory of Time's Arrows and The Big Bang 
By Julian Barbour 
[US — Basic Books, UK — Bodley Head; Proposal; 80,000 — 100,000 words; Delivery: November 2017] 
The Janus Point, writes Julian Barbour, visiting professor at the University of Oxford and author of The End 
of Time, proposes a novel and remarkably simple solution to one of the most fundamental problems in physics 
and cosmology. It concerns the experienced direction of time: Why is the past so different from the present and 
the future? This difference is encapsulated in the expression the arrow of time. It is problematic because all the 
known laws of nature have exactly the same form, whatever direction, in which time is supposed to flow. The

technical expression for this is time-reversal symmetry. This basic property seems to be entirely at odds with the 
pronounced unidirectionality of experienced time. In fact, there are several arrows. 
Until recent work by myself and my collaborators Tim Koslowski and Flavio Mercati, essentially only one 
proposal had been made—in well over a century—to explain why, despite the time-reversal symmetry of all the 
laws of nature, these pronounced arrows of time exist, and always have existed, throughout the observable 
universe. As I explain in The Janus Point, this sole explanation is a manifest stop gap and satisfies no serious 
scientist. 
This has been dubbed the past hypothesis. However, it is not in any sense an explanation that follows from the 
structure of the law and does not lead to any new prediction. It is an admission of defeat: Modern science fails to 
explain the most profound aspects of our existence. 
The Janus Point is clearly timely because it is about a set of very simple ideas and insights that have the 
potential to solve one of the deepest and longest-standing problems in physics. Everyone is interested in time 
and its numerous puzzling aspects. Proof of that is the success of my earlier book The End of Time, which is still 
selling more than sixteen years after its publication. Some of the ideas conjectured in that book are, in fact, 
realized in the model now proposed. 
For readers, The Janus Point tells the fascinating story of one of the greatest mysteries in science and what 
looks to be its unexpected and, in principle, remarkably simple solution. More than most books in popular 
science, its subject resonates profoundly with the reader. Nothing touches us more intimately than the drama of 
birth, life and death. 
JULIAN BARBOUR, an independent researcher, is currently visiting professor at the University of Oxford. He 
has devoted significant time and effort to issues that lie at the foundations of science, above all the nature of 
time and motion. His first paper was published in Nature and attracted favorable editorial comment and most 
importantly led to six years of very valuable collaboration with the well-known Italian theorist Bruno Bertotti. It 
culminated in 1982 with a joint paper in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, which is now regarded 
as a seminal paper on the interconnection of local dynamics with the universe at large. Barbour made a big 
impact in the physics community with the publication of his book, The End of Time, in which, according to 
physicist Lee Smolin, he presented a new theory of time that is the most interesting and provocative new idea 
about time to be proposed in many years. 
AMERICAN KINGPIN 
The Epic Hunt for the Criminal Mastermind Behind the Silk Road 
By Nick Bilton 
[US — Portfolio, UK — Virgin Books, Audio — Penguin RH; Manuscript; 304 pages; Publication: May 2017] 
From New York Times-bestselling author Nick Bilton comes a true-life thriller about the rise and fall of Ross 
Ulbricht, aka the Dread Pirate Roberts, the founder of the online black market Silk Road. 
In American Kingpin Bilton turns his investigative journalism to the story of Ross Ulbricht, the notorious and 
enigmatic founder of a drug empire called Silk Road. This is a true-life thriller about ambition gone awry, 
spurred on by the defining clash of our time: the new world of libertarian-leaning, anonymous, decentralized 
web advocates and the old world of government control, order, and the rule of law. Bilton's dazzling rendering 
and gift for narrative make for an endlessly fascinating drama. 
In 2011, Ulbricht, a twenty-six-year-old libertarian idealist and former Boy Scout, launched a website where 
people could buy anything anonymously, with no trail whatsoever that could lead back to them. He called it 
Silk Road, opened for business on the Dark Web, and christened himself the Dread Pirate Roberts (after the

Princess Bride character). The site grew at a tremendous pace, quickly becoming a $1.2 billion enterprise where 
you could buy or sell drugs, hacking software, forged passports, counterfeit cash, guns, grenades, and poisons. 
The Silk Road soon caught the attention of the Feds, who embarked on an epic two-year manhunt for the site's 
proprietor. Ulbricht, in the meantime, struggled to maintain control of his double life and his marketplace, which 
he originally started to prove that legalizing drugs could make society safer. He gradually abandoned his 
libertarian ideals to rule Silk Road with increasingly authoritarian force. At one point, he engaged the services of 
hired hit men to take out employees he felt had wronged him. Soon, some of the Federal agents who were 
supposed to be hunting for Ulbricht were lured into the dark world and switched sides to join him.

YOUR BRAIN IS A TIME MACHINE 
The Neuroscience and Physics of Time 
By Dean Buonomano 
[World English — W. W. Norton, China— Huazhang, Audio — Audible; Manuscript; Pub Date: April 2017; 
304 pages] 
Pioneering neuroscientist Dean Buonomano examines how the brain tells time, predicts the future, and 
understands the past in a book that straddles the fields of physics, psychology and neuroscience. 
Few questions are as perplexing and profound as those that relate to time. Philosophers ponder what time is. 
Physicists grapple with why time appears to be a one-way street, and debate whether it is a single lonely point or 
a full-blown dimension. Neuroscientists and psychologists struggle to understand what it means to feel the 
passage of time and how the brain tells it. Time is also key to the question of free will: is the future an open 
path, or is it preordained by the past? 
The brain, argues Buonomano, is at its core a time machine. It is the brain's ability to anticipate the actions of 
prey, predators, and mates, and to predict when events will occur in a dynamically changing world, that 
ultimately translate into the evolutionary currency of survival and reproduction. 
The ability of animals to predict the future culminated with Homo sapiens' capacity to grasp the concept of time. 
Only then were we able to craft a blade for future use, or plant a seed to quench projected hunger. 
Your Brain is a Time Machine explains that, in the end, our intuitions and theories about time reveal as much 
about the architecture and limitations of our brains as they do about the true nature of time. 
DEAN BUONOMANO is a professor in the Departments of Neurobiology and Psychology at UCLA, and an 
investigator in the Integrative Center for Learning and Memory. He is the author of Brain Bugs: How the Brain's 
Flaws Shape Our Lives, which was a Wall Street Journal bestseller, and his research has been highlighted in

SCIENCE IN THE SOUL 
Selected Shorter Writings 
By Richard Dawkins, Edited by Gillian Somerscales 
[UK — Transworld; Manuscript; Pub Date: June 2017; 110,000 words] 
A new book from Richard Dawkins, internationally bestselling author and one of the greatest scientists of our 
age. As much as his full length books such as The Selfish Gene, The Blind Watchmaker, and The God Delusion, 
have changed our perceptions of both science and the world it opens, his essays and articles are potent, pithy, 
thought provoking and revealing windows into the world as he, himself, perceives it. Science in the Soul is a 
collection of some of Dawkins' best writing: articles and lectures, reflections and polemics, reviews, forewords, 
tributes or eulogies, both published and unpublished. 
From the introduction, by Gillian Somerscales: Richard Dawkins has always defied categorization. One 
eminent biologist of mathematical bent reviewing The Selfish Gene and The Extended Phenotype was startled to 
find a scientific work apparently free of logical errors and yet containing not a single line of mathematics; he 
could come to no other conclusion than that, incomprehensible as it seemed to him, 'Dawkins . . . apparently 
thinks in prose.' 
If readers of what follows here come to appreciate not only the writer's clarity of thought and facility of 
expression, the fearlessness with which he confronts very large elephants in very small rooms, the energy with 
which he devotes himself to explication of the complex and the beautiful in science, but also some of the 
generosity, kindness and courtesy that have characterized all my dealings with Richard over the years since that 
first collaboration, then the present volume will have achieved one of its aims. 
It will have achieved another if it embodies a condition felicitously described in one of the essays reproduced 
here, where 'harmonious parts flourish in the presence of each other, and the illusion of a harmonious whole 
emerges.' Indeed, it is my belief that the harmony resounding from this collection is no illusion, but the echo of 
one of the most vibrant, and vital, voices of our times. 
RICHARD DAWKINS is the former Charles Simonyi Professor For The Understanding Of Science at Oxford 
University; Fellow of New College; author of The Selfish Gene, The Extended Phenotype, The Blind 
Watchmaker, River out of Eden (ScienceMasters Series), Climbing Mount Improbable, Unweaving the 
Rainbow, The Devil's Chaplain, The Ancestor's Tale, The God Delusion, The Greatest Show on Earth and The 
Magic of Reality. He is founder of The Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science. 
FROM BACTERIA TO BACH AND BACK 
The Evolution of Minds 
By Daniel C. Dennett 
[US — W. W. Norton, UK — Penguin UK, Italy — Raffaello Cortina Editore, Holland — Atlas 
Contact, China — Cheers, Audio — Recorded Books; Manuscript; Pub Date: February 2017; 448 pages] 
One of the world's foremost philosophers offers a major new account of the origins of the conscious mind. 
What is human consciousness and how is it possible? This question fascinates people from poets and painters to 
physicists, psychologists, and philosophers. From Bacteria to Bach and Back is Daniel C. Dennett's brilliant 
answer, extending perspectives from his earlier work in surprising directions, exploring the deep interactions of 
evolution, brains, and human culture. 
Part philosophical whodunit, part bold scientific conjecture, this landmark work enlarges themes that have 
sustained Dennett's legendary career at the forefront of philosophical thought. In his inimitable style—laced

with wit and arresting thought experiments—Dennett shows how culture enables reflection by installing a 
bounty of thinking tools, or memes, in our brains. Language, itself composed of memes, turbocharged this 
interplay. The result, a mind that can comprehend the questions it poses, emerges from a process of cultural 
evolution. 
An agenda-setting book for a new generation of philosophers and other researchers, From Bacteria to Bach and 
Back will delight and entertain anyone who hopes to understand human creativity in all its wondrous 
applications. 
DANIEL C. DENNETT is the author of Intuition Pumps, Breaking the Spell, Freedom Evolves, and 
Consciousness Explained. He is the University Professor and Austin B. Fletcher Professor of Philosophy, and

A CRACK IN CREATION 
Gene Editing and the Unthinkable Power to Control Evolution 
By Jennifer A. Doudna and Samuel H. Sternberg 
[US — Houghton Mifflin, UK — Bodley Head, China — Hunan Science, Audio — Audible; Manuscript; Pub 
Date: June 2017; 320 pages] 
In the tradition of The Double Helix, A Crack in Creation is an insider's account of the biggest scientific 
discovery of our era: a cheap, easy way of rewriting genetic code, with nearly limitless promise and peril. 
Not since the atomic bomb has a technology so alarmed its inventors that they warned the world against its use. 
Not, that is, until the spring of 2015, when biologist Jennifer Doudna called for a worldwide moratorium on the 
use of the new gene-editing tool CRISPR to make heritable changes in human embryos. The cheapest, simplest, 
most effective way of manipulating DNA ever known, CRISPR may well give us the cure to HIV, genetic 
diseases, and some cancers, and will help address the world's hunger crisis. Yet even the tiniest changes to DNA 
could have myriad, unforeseeable consequences—to say nothing of the ethical and societal repercussions of 
intentionally mutating embryos to create better humans. 
Writing with fellow researcher Samuel Sternberg, Doudna shares the thrilling story of her discovery, and 
passionately argues that enormous responsibility comes with the ability to rewrite the code of life. With 
CRISPR, she shows, we have effectively taken control of evolution. What will we do with this unfathomable 
power? 
JENNIFER A. DOUDNA is a professor in the Chemistry and the Molecular and Cell Biology Departments at 
the University of California, Berkeley, investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and researcher in 
the Physical Biosciences Division at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. She is internationally 
recognized as a leading expert on RNA-protein structure and function, CRISPR biology, and genome 
engineering. 
SAMUEL H. STERNBERG received his PhD from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2014, and has 
been a member of Jennifer Doudna's laboratory since 2010. He was a lead researcher and author of numerous 
high-profile publications on the CRISPR technology. He has been awarded the RNA Society's Scaringe Award

ENDURANCE 
A Natural History of Exercise and Health 
By Daniel Lieberman 
[Proposal; Delivery: April 2019; 120,000 words] 
Endurance is the new book from Daniel Lieberman, Chair of the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at 
Harvard, and author of The Story of the Human Body, a New York Times bestseller. Lieberman is well known for 
his unique and unusually integrative approach to research, which combines paleontology, anatomy, physiology 
and experimental biomechanics. 
Endurance, Lieberman writes, argues that we need to rethink how we think about exercise using the dual 
lenses of anthropology and evolutionary biology. As the modern word 'exercise' itself implies, people today 
generally think of physical activity as a pastime or a form of medicine. Most of us spend the majority of the day 
sitting and then we briefly exercise in our spare time, sometimes for fun, but increasingly to ward off ill health. 
Yet, until very recently, physical activity was a paradoxically fundamental part of being human: utterly 
necessary but instinctively avoided. Put simply, we evolved to be reluctant endurance athletes. 
This legacy underlies and points to urgently needed solutions for today's exercise dilemma. Everyone knows 
that exercise is vital for good health, yet the vast majority of Americans and others in the developed world are 
unable to exercise enough. Our species endured because we had no choice but to be athletes, and if we wish our 
health to endure as individuals, then we still need to make exercise indispensable today. Rather than thinking of 
exercise as a 'magic pill' for good health, it is the absence of physical activity, primarily endurance exercise, that 
accelerates aging and hastens death. Endurance points to a new way of understanding and solving this global 
problem. 
Endurance is the product of a long journey, part intellectual, part physical. Over the last decade I have 
traversed the globe to observe, often as a participant, how humans are physically active in different traditional 
cultures from Africa to Greenland to India. Among other experiences, I've run barefoot and carried water on my 
head in Kenya, tracked muskoxen and kudu with indigenous hunters in Greenland and Tanzania, participated in 
the ancient Tarahumara ballgame under the stars in Mexico, dug millet fields in Rwanda, played barefoot cricket 
in rural India, and raced on foot against horses in the mountains of Arizona. Back in my lab at Harvard, my 
students and I have intensively studied the evolution, biomechanics and physiology of key human physical 
activities, including how we walk, run, throw, dig, climb and even chew. 
Endurance weaves together these experiences, perspectives and insights into the form of a highly personal 
natural history of first rest, then strength, and finally endurance. 
DANIEL LIEBERMAN is a professor and chair of the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard. 
A leader in the field of human evolutionary biology, Lieberman's research asks how and why evolution made the 
human body the way it is. He is the author of The Story of the Human Body (Pantheon, 2013) and has been 
published in such journals as Nature, Science, and The Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, among 
others. Lieberman has been interviewed by PBS, The History Channel, NPR, BBC, Horizon, and elsewhere. 
His research and discoveries have been highlighted in the New York Times, Discover, National Geographic, 
Runners World, Running Times, and numerous other journals and newspapers.

IMPROBABLE DESTINIES 
Predicting the Future of Evolution 
By Jonathan Losos 
[US — Riverhead, UK — Allen Lane, German — Hanser, Audio — Penguin RH; Manuscript; Pub Date: June 
2017; 110,000 words] 
Evolutionary biologist and Harvard professor Jonathan Losos is widely known for his unique approach to 
studying evolution in realtime and using experimental means. As E.O. Wilson writes, Losos is a world leader in 
research and theory of the overlapping fields of herpetology, biodiversity, and species formation. 
In the last few years, Losos writes, evolutionary biologists have come to realize that evolution can occur 
much more rapidly than Darwin and a century of subsequent biologists ever expected—fast enough, in fact, to 
observe as it occurs, even during the span of a single research grant! Now that we know that evolution can 
proceed rapidly, experimental studies in natural systems have begun. 
Losos' work on lizards has been at the forefront of the experimental evolution movement. Using small 
Bahamian islands as test tubes, he and his team have altered conditions and made predictions about how 
populations should evolve in response. And the results are resoundingly consistent: evolution is extremely 
predictable. 
Improbable Destinies is not only about what we know about evolution, but how we know what we know. Not 
just the technology and theories of science, but where the ideas come from—how researchers think them up, 
how they are honed by experiences in the field, and how much of science is the serendipitous juxtaposition of 
disparate ideas brought together by unexpected observations. 
JONATHAN LOSOS is the Monique and Philip Lehner Professor for the Study of Latin America and professor 
of organismic and evolutionary biology at Harvard University. He is the recipient of a number of awards, 
including the Theodosius Dobzhansky Prize from the Society for the Study of Evolution and the David Starr 
Jordan Prize from the American Society of Naturalists. 
DISEMPOWERED 
(working title) 
By Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt 
[Proposal; Delivery: 9-12 months from signing contract; 60,000 — 80,000 words] 
Disempowered is an expansion to book-length of the cover story by Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt that 
appeared in the September 2015 issue of The Atlantic: The Coddling of The American Mind (CAM). 
It became the Atlantic's second most-read cover story of all time and has been referenced in hundreds of articles 
in a wide variety of publications, including the New York Times, the Washington Post, National Review, 
Newsweek, Los Angeles Times, Bloomberg, the Guardian, The Korea Herald, and the Irish Times; and it even 
drew the attention of President Obama. 
A full-length book is necessary for several reasons, writes Lukianoff. First, even with the article's generous 
word limit, we could not present the full scope of the intersection of harmful psychological theories and political 
correctness. We could only do a cursory explanation of the new reality on campus and how terms like 'trigger 
warnings,' microaggressions,' and `disinvitations' suddenly rose from obscurity to become part of higher 
education's and the nation's vocabulary. A full-length book allows us to cover a host of new hot topics, including 
so-called 'safe spaces' and how a warped idea of safety is used to justify campus censorship, as well as campus 
'bias response teams' (BRTs)—Orwellian programs that police the language students use in their private lives

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025153 
and professors use in the classroom. It is worth noting that this past spring a professor was actually investigated 
by one of these BRTs for assigning CAM as class reading! 
Second, since the article was published, the situation on campus has only worsened. Within a few months after 
the article's release, student demands for censorship had broken out across the country. 
Third, and possibly most importantly, we want to reactivate and deepen the discussion that we started in CAM 
about the science of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as a useful lens for looking at any number of modern 
problems. CBT is a remarkably simple, successful treatment that helps patients overcome their anxiety and 
depression by teaching them how to identify and combat 'cognitive distortions,' the wild mental exaggerations 
in which the anxious and depressed overindulge. To our knowledge, CAM was the first and only major article to 
propose that we should not only use CBT to examine our own inner thoughts, but also the world around us. 
The issue of free speech on campus is extremely hot, and will continue to be for years to come, but virtually no 
one besides us is offering a solution that gets to the heart of the problem and can actually help students rather 
than simply ridiculing them. 
Regarding the market, when CAM came out, it seemed that this was a uniquely American problem. But just in 
the last year, it has spread throughout the UK, and is beginning to appear in Australia. In fact, there has been 
major interest in CAM in the UK and European countries. In Europe, I was recently interviewed by 
Siiddeutsche Zeitung, Germany's biggest daily newspaper, and Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung also ran a major 
article. When I recently spoke in Denmark, the president of the University of Oslo chastised me for not 
knowing that all the students had read CAM and had been discussing it all year.

sciences: people are easy to influence, they are too trusting, and they tend to place their trust in the wrong 
people. This is the answer of most social psychologists. 
They take the famous Asch conformity experiments, in which participants believe a group over the evidence of 
their own eyes; and Milgram obedience experiments, in which participants agree to electrocute one another at 
the experimenter's request to show that people are sheep. 
Psychologist Daniel Gilbert, a strong proponent of the view that humans are gullible, has even claimed that 
people couldn't help but believe (at first at least) everything they read! Tim Levine, a leading researcher 
working on lie detection, thinks that people rely on others to be trustworthy most of the time, and that as a result 
they can afford to be so bad at detecting deception. Paul Ekman, the famous emotion researcher, claims that 
when we see someone express an emotion, we can't help but mimic it. No surprise then that crowds and 
their emotional members drive each other mad! Robert Boyd, Peter Richerson, and Joseph Henrich, proponents 
of the dominant mode of cultural evolution, postulate that people are easily influenced by prestigious individuals 
—wherever their prestige comes from—and consensual opinions—whatever their value. 
This is also the answer of dominant figures in anthropology and sociology, explaining the persistence of culture 
by our tendency to suck in whatever ideas surround us without a second thought; in political science since the 
ancient Greeks, explaining the success of demagogues by how easily people follow charismatic leaders, even 
toxic ones; and in much social commentary, consider Manufacturing Consent by Edward Herman and Noam 
Chomsky as an example. 
In Vigilance, I argue that they are wrong. 
HUGO MERCIER is a cognitive scientist working for the French National Center for Scientific Research in

GENETIC RESCUE 
Saving Wildlife the Way Evolution Does 
By Ryan Phelan, Introduction & Epilogue by Stewart Brand 
[Proposal; Delivery: 12-18 months from signed contract; 70,000 — 80,000 words] 
Genetic Rescue is the first book to present a critically important and new scientific field emerging through the 
synthesis of molecular biology and conservation biology. At the heart of this intersection is the development of a 
new tool kit for 21st Century conservation. Advances in comparative genomics, cloning, germ cell transmission, 
ancient genome assembly, de-extinction, synthetic DNA, and genome engineering with CRISPR and gene drives 
are now being applied to help solve seemingly intractable conservation problems. 
Genetic Rescue makes the compelling case for human intervention in situations where the natural evolutionary 
process is compromised. It is replete with specific examples of wildlife on the brink (from the black-footed 
ferret to the northern white rhino) and the impact of wildlife diseases (amphibians with Chytrid disease and bats 
with white-nose syndrome). 
Genetic Rescue also presents a provocative new vision for conservation—the development of a 21st Century

tool kit that can help prevent extinction. And more importantly, it helps frame the issues that need to be 
thoughtfully considered before these new technologies can be responsibly deployed. It is the first book written 
on this subject, and more importantly, it is written by an insider who is helping shape and define the field for 
conservation. 
RYAN PHELAN is the Executive Director of Revive & Restore, whose mission is to increase biodiversity — 
specifically through genetic rescue, helping species that are either on the brink or are already extinct. The 
Introduction and the Epilogue are by cultural icon Stewart Brand, creator of The Whole Earth Catlog, and author

THE EVOLUTION OF BEAUTY 
How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World — and Us

A major reimagining of how evolutionary forces work, revealing how mating preferences—what Darwin termed 
the taste for the beautiful —create the extraordinary range of ornament in the animal world. 
In the great halls of science, dogma holds that Darwin's theory of natural selection explains every branch on the 
tree of life: which species thrive, which wither away to extinction, and what features each evolves. But can 
adaptation by natural selection really account for everything we see in nature? 
Yale University ornithologist Richard Prum —reviving Darwin's own views—thinks not. Deep in tropical 
jungles around the world are birds with a dizzying array of appearances and mating displays: Club-winged 
Manakins who sing with their wings, Great Argus Pheasants who dazzle prospective mates with a four-foot-
wide cone of feathers covered in golden 3D spheres, Red-capped Manakins who moonwalk. In thirty years of 
fieldwork, Prum has seen numerous display traits that seem disconnected from, if not outright contrary to, 
selection for individual survival. To explain this, he dusts off Darwin's long-neglected theory of sexual selection 
in which the act of choosing a mate for purely aesthetic reasons—for the mere pleasure of it—is an independent 
engine of evolutionary change. 
Mate choice can drive ornamental traits from the constraints of adaptive evolution, allowing them to grow ever 
more elaborate. It also sets the stakes for sexual conflict, in which the sexual autonomy of the female evolves in 
response to male sexual control. Most crucially, this framework provides important insights into the evolution of 
human sexuality, particularly the ways in which female preferences have changed male bodies, and even 
maleness itself, through evolutionary time. 
The Evolution of Beauty presents a unique scientific vision for how nature's splendor contributes to a more 
complete understanding of evolution and of ourselves. 
RICHARD 0. PRUM is the William Robertson Coe Professor of Ornithology at Yale University. A lifelong bird 
fanatic, Prum has published more than 100 scientific articles on diverse topics including the evolution, behavior, 
song, anatomy, developmental biology, phylogenetics, paleontology, optical physics, and pigmentary chemistry 
of birds. He has made ground-breaking scientific contributions to our understanding the evolutionary origin of 
feathers, the physics of structural coloration, dinosaur feathers, fossil coloration, and the phylogenetic evolution 
of behavior. Over the past thirty years, Prum has developed a unique scientific perspective on evolution, and he 
has documented this view with major scientific discoveries.

THE INTERACTIVE BRAIN 
(working title) 
By V.S. Ramachandran 
[US — Penguin Press, Audio — Penguin RH; Proposal; Delivery: 24 months from signed contract; 60,000 — 
70,000 words] 
A new book by neuroscientist V.S. Ramachandran, author most recently of The Tell-Tale Brain. 
The Interactive Brain, writes Ramachandran, is a tour of some of the most cherished yet elusive qualities of 
our minds. The book argues that recent advances in neurosciences have contributed to a revolutionary new 
model of the brain, in which brain function is controlled, not by highly specialized, hierarchical modules, mainly 
hard-wired, as once thought, but rather by highly interactive modules that can shift their roles in a matter of days 
or even hours The implications are not merely theoretical but have practical applications in medicine, offering 
solutions for everyone from stroke patients to those with obsessive compulsive disorder. 
There are many neurological syndromes I'll discuss throughout the book. For example, a patient who was 
otherwise smart and level-headed but kept insisting that his reflection in the mirror was the 'real David,' and that 
the David viewing the mirror was a clone. He wiped off a tear from his eye and asked 'Dad, if the real David 
returns will you disown me?' Even the axiomatic foundation of our selfhood—the notion that I'm a single 
person in one body—is called into question when we encounter patients like him. 
Not only can we change our own brains, but we can change the brains of others because of the implications of 
mirror neurons. The Interactive Brain incorporates case studies, such as David's, and my own research on topics 
ranging through Capgras Syndrome, chronic pain, calendar synesthesia, gender incongruity, mirror visual 
feedback, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, the majority of which I have not considered in detail in my 
previous books. 
I conclude by visiting some of the most prized but elusive aspects of our minds considered unapproachable by 
science, such as math, music, and metaphor, and suggest that these quintessentially human abilities are best 
elucidated by combining an evolutionary approach with old-fashioned neurology. 
V.S. RAMACHANDRAN is the director of the Center for Brain and Cognition and a professor with the 
Psychology Department and Neurosciences Program at the University of California, San Diego. He is author of 
Phantoms in the Brain, which has been translated into fourteen languages and formed the basis of a two part 
series on Channel Four TV (UK) and a 1 hour PBS special in the USA, and more recently The Tell-Tale Brain

BEHAVE 
The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst

Robert Sapolsky is one of the best scientist-writers of our time, able to deal with the 
weightiest topics both authoritatively and wittily, with so light a touch they become 
accessible to all. 
—Oliver Sacks, M.D. 
The first major book from celebrated Stanford neurobiologist and author Robert Sapolsky in over a decade, 
Behave answers the most basic question about human behavior: What made you do that? Substitute me or

us or they and it's a question asked millions of times a day in all the languages of the world in response to 
all manner of human behavior, good and bad. 
What brings out the best in us? What brings out the worst? For every complex problem, there's a solution that's 
simple, appealing, and wrong, H. L. Mencken famously said, and there are certainly many simple and wrong 
answers to this most important of questions, the question at the root of the way we parent, the way we educate, 
the way we manage, and the way we punish. The simple yet correct response, of course, is that it's 
complicated. The longer answer? For that, the great neuroscientist and primatologist Robert Sapolsky needed 
ten years, and this book. 
Behave is an epic achievement. In order to make sense of all the sources that conspire to affect human behavior, 
it begins in the very moment of action, when we commit the decisive deed in question. What is happening in 
our brain and body at the very moment, and in the minutes that preceded it? The book then pulls back to look 
how the behavior is conditioned by what the body is exposed to in the days, weeks and months leading up to 
that behavior. It then goes back to childhood and adolescence, at how the bending of the bough effects how the 
tree grows. And so on, from neurobiology, endocrinology and the interaction of our senses with the 
environment to a lifetime's most primal shaping influences, and from there back to our genetic makeup and the 
very sticky wicket of how genes and environment interact (and how they don't). Finally, Sapolsky expands the 
view to take in factors that push us past any single person's inheritance and experience: namely culture, in the 
present tense and back hundreds, even thousands of years, and then back millions of years, to the first humans 
and the evolution of behavior. 
The result is surely among the most dazzling tours d 'horizon of the science of human behavior ever attempted, 
a majestic synthesis of cutting-edge research, some of it the author's own, across a range of disciplines to 
provide a subtle and necessary reckoning with the roots of our most troubling and inspiring behaviors, relating 
to racism, tribalism, and xenophobia; tolerance and altruism; hierarchy and competition; morality and free will; 
and war and peace. Wise, learned, funny, and fearless, Behave is a great scientist's towering achievement, a 
book that takes both the angel and the devil off of our shoulders and into our hands. 
ROBERT SAPOLSKY is the John A. and Cynthia Fry Gunn Professor at Stanford University, holding joint 
appointments in several departments, including Biological Sciences, Neurology & Neurological Sciences, and 
Neurosurgery. He is the author of more than 400 technical papers published in biomedical journals. He also 
writes extensively for non-scientists in magazines such as Discover, Natural History and the New Yorker. 
Sapolsky's books include Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers, A Primate's Memoir, The Trouble With Testosterone,

TAMING INFINITY 
The Surprising Story of Calculus and the Geniuses Behind It 
(working title) 
By Steven Strogatz 
[US — Eamon Dolan Books; Proposal; 80,000 words; Delivery: Spring 2018] 
A fascinating new book from Steven Strogatz, award-winning mathematician and author, who brings the story 
of calculus to life in a single narrative that spans continents, centuries, and disciplines to a dramatic climax. 
Writes Strogatz, The quest to tame infinity, and to harness it toward our ends, is a narrative that runs through 
the whole 2,500-year story of calculus. Yet this saga is an untold story, as far as today's general audience is 
concerned. Taming Infinity will tell it for the first time.

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025158 
Calculus is one of the greatest ideas that anyone has ever had and certainly the greatest idea in all of 
mathematics. The scientific and technological importance of calculus is one reason why we require all budding 
scientists and engineers to learn the subject. Taming Infinity is the human side of calculus: the gripping story of 
how it was discovered, and lost, and then rediscovered a thousand years later, or how it perplexed many of the 
geniuses who struggled to invent it, and in a few tragic cases, drove them insane. In a very real sense, this 
humanistic side of calculus is just as fascinating and important as its scientific side as it, too, has changed the 
world. 
Central to the story is the mathematicians' quest to tame infinity, which begins with the philosopher Zeno of 
Elea (about 450 BC, before Socrates) who raised paradoxes about infinity, continuity, time, space, and motion 
that confounded his contemporaries and provoked no less than Aristotle to banish infinity from Greek 
philosophy and mathematics from then on. Fast-forward more than 2,500 years, and we're still wrestling with 
infinity and the paradoxes it raises. In between, the inventors of calculus, starting with Archimedes around 250 
BC and culminating with Newton and Leibniz in the mid-1600s, tried to domesticate infinity to make what we 
now regard as integral and differential calculus. And to a large extent, they succeeded. The carefully controlled 
use of infinity is the secret to calculus, the source of its enormous predictive power. 
But like Frankenstein's monster or the golem in Jewish folklore, infinity was never quite under control. As in 
any tale of hubris, the monster inevitably turned on its creator. Soon after the work of Newton and Leibniz, 
disturbing paradoxes emerged in the 1700s and early 1800s. Calculations came out wrong. Calculus seemed 
unreliable. These difficulties provoked another wave of philosophical and logical handwringing, much as Zeno's 
had two millennia earlier. These conundrums were resolved over the next century by the mathematicians who 
called themselves 'analysts.' The name was apt. They put calculus on the couch, and probed it, trying to root out 
every last trace of pathology. They succeeded for calculus, but not for infinity itself. There the pathology ran 
deeper. The riddles of infinity are still challenging logicians, mathematicians, and philosophers today.

THE POWER OF HUMAN 
By Adam Waytz 
[US — W.W. Norton; Proposal; 70,000 words; Delivery: February 2018] 
Adam Waytz is a rising star in the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, whose research 
uses methods from social psychology and cognitive neuroscience to study how people think about minds. Waytz 
is the first person to receive twice the Theoretical Innovation Prize from the Society for Personality and Social 
Psychology. He is also the winner of the SAGE Young Scholar Award and the International Social Cognition 
Network's Early Career Award. 
Waytz writes: Everyday life is increasingly human-free. Robotic technology has begun replacing human jobs 
and will replace millions more over the next five years. In domains such as manufacturing and agriculture, 
robotic employees are already a reality. Tasks like getting directions from another human or consulting with a 
bank teller to deposit money have become obsolete. These advances contribute to well-documented declines in 
social interaction. Not only has interaction with human beings diminished, but existing human interaction has

-13-
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025159 
declined in quality. People feel less trusting of others than in previous decades, face-to-face communication is 
less frequent, and people's social networks have become more fragmented, producing smaller social clusters 
rather than expansive, civic community groups. Empathy with other humans, considering others' wants, feelings, 
needs, and motivations (the essence of what makes us human), has diminished considerably. Rises in income 
inequality and political polarization also mean that our diversity of social experiences—encountering people 
unlike 'us' —is diminishing as well, enabling little consideration of humans dissimilar to ourselves. 
The Power of Human represents a call to action. This book details the psychological cost of losing our 
humanity and elucidates scientifically supported strategies to counteract this trend, many of which are already 
underway. Although scholars have bemoaned declines in social interaction, their concerns often erroneously 
center on people's deteriorating social skills, communication abilities, and intelligence (for which evidence is 
decidedly mixed). Meanwhile, the real costs of this decline on moral behavior, employee productivity, 
mobilizing social movements, and finding meaning in life have gone overlooked. This book elucidates how we 
often overlook how psychologically powerful humans are, and provides strategies to rejuvenate efforts to 
recognize others' humanity. 
The Power of Human is unique in providing solutions to this problem that will help businesses retain customers 
and employees, help charities raise more money, help people experience greater significance from simple 
everyday activities, help technologists design better robots, help reduce conflict between different political and 
religious sects, and increase happiness in relationships with friends and spouses. 
ADAM WAYTZ is an associate professor of management and organizations in the Kellogg School of 
Management at Northwestern University. His research has been published in leading journals such as 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, and

Personality and Social Psychology, the SAGE Foundation Young Scholar Award, and the International Social 
Cognition Network's Early Career Award. In 2015, Poets and Quants named him one of the Best 40 Business

SCALE 
The Search for Simplicity and Unity in the Complexity of Life, from Cells to Cities, Companies to 
Ecosystems, Milliseconds to Millennia 
By Geoffrey West 
[US — Penguin Press, UK — Weidenfeld & Nicolson, Holland — Het Spectrum, Finland — Terra Cognita, 
Brazil — Das Letras; Japan — Hayakawa; Korea — Gimm Young; Taiwan — Locus; China — CITIC; Russia

The former head of the Sante Fe Institute, visionary physicist Geoffrey West is a pioneer in the field of 
complexity science, the science of emergent systems and networks. The term complexity can be misleading, 
however, because what makes West's discoveries so beautiful is that he has found an underlying simplicity that 
unites the seemingly complex and diverse phenomena of living systems, including our bodies, our cities and our 
businesses. 
Fascinated by issues of aging and mortality, West applied the rigor of a physicist to the biological question of 
why we live as long as we do and no longer. The result was astonishing and changed science, creating a new 
understanding of energy use and metabolism: West found that despite the riotous diversity in the sizes of 
mammals, they are all, to a large degree, scaled versions of each other. If you know the size of a mammal, you 
can use scaling laws to learn everything from how much food it eats per day, what its heart-rate is, how long it 
will take to mature, its lifespan, and so on. Furthermore, the efficiency of the mammal's circulatory systems

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025160 
scales up precisely based on weight: If you compare a mouse, a human and an elephant on a logarithmic graph, 
you find with every doubling of average weight, a species gets 25% more efficient—and lives 25% longer. This 
speaks to everything from how long we can expect to live to how many hours of sleep we need. Fundamentally, 
he has proven, the issue has to do with the fractal geometry of the networks that supply energy and remove 
waste from the organism's body. 
West's work has been game-changing for biologists, but then he made the even bolder move of exploring his 
work's applicability to cities. Cities, too, are constellations of networks and laws of scalability relate with eerie 
precision to them. For every doubling in a city's size, the city needs 15% less road, electrical wire, and gas 
stations to support the same population. More amazingly, for every doubling in size, cities produce 15% more 
patents and more wealth, as well as 15% more crime and disease. This broad pattern lays the groundwork for a 
new science of cities. 
Recently, West has applied his revolutionary work on cities and biological life to the business world. This 
investigation has led to powerful insights into why some companies thrive while others fail. The implications of 
these discoveries are far-reaching, and are just beginning to be explored. 
Scale is a thrilling scientific adventure story about the elemental natural laws that bind us together in simple but 
profound ways. Through the brilliant mind of Geoffrey West, we can envision how cities, companies and 
biological life alike are dancing to the same simple, powerful tune, however diverse and unrelated they are to 
each other. 
GEOFFREY WEST, a theoretical physicist, is distinguished professor and past president at Santa Fe Institute. 
His primary interests have been in fundamental questions in physics and biology. West is a Senior Fellow at Los 
Alamos National Laboratory and a distinguished professor at the Sante Fe Institute, where he served as the 
president from 2005-2009. He has been featured in many publications world-wide including the New York 
Times, Nature, Science, the Financial Times, Wired and Scientific American, and has participated in television 
productions including Nova, the National Geographic and the BBC. His work on cities and companies was 
selected as a breakthrough idea of 2007 by Harvard Business Review, and in 2006 he was selected for Time 
Magazine's list of 100 Most Influential People in the World.

2019] 
An exciting new book by Frank Wilczek, one of the world's most eminent theoretical physicists and the most 
important of his generation. His scientific work provides the basis for the LHC experiments at CERN. He has 
received many prizes for his work in physics, including the Nobel Prize (2004) for work he did as a graduate 
student at Princeton University, when he was twenty-one years old, and the King Faisal Prize in 2005. 
Writes Wilczek: The premise of the book is simple: I formulated ten basic propositions, which together convey 
the core of what every thinking person should know about science. In Fundamentals, the ten basic propositions 
support a series of interesting and connected chapters, which give historical and cultural context, outline the 
evidence, and draw out the implications. I want the marketing of this book to be based on the following slogan: 
If you read just one book about science, this should be the one. 
Here are three examples of the ten basic propositions:

In other words, while few state judiciaries have addressed the precise timing of state crime victims’ rights, those that have
addressed the question have typically found that the rights do extend to pre-charging situations.

Despite the relative dearth of state court cases, it is worth noting that most state statutes unequivocally provide for notification
rights early in the criminal process. 7>! For example, the Illinois statute imposes a limited duty on law enforcement agencies to
keep victims mformed of the status of an investigation until the accused is apprehended or the agency discontinues the
investigation. *°? Similarly, law enforcement agencies in Iowa must keep the victim apprised of the investigation until the
alleged assailant is apprehended or the investigation is closed. 7°? Michigan's statute requires law enforcement to provide
information within a mere twenty-four hours of contact between the agency and the victim. 74

In sum, while state law on crime victims' rights before charging is not fully developed, what law exists tends to support the
position that crime victims deserve rights before the formal filing of charges. This law fits the long-standing trend in states
toward expanding protections for crime [*103] victims. *°° The decision by state legislators to extend notification or
conferral rights to crime victims demonstrates an express recognition that crime victims' meaningful participation in the
criminal justice process may involve granting those victims rights before indictment.

Conclusion

Crime victims have important rights at stake in the criminal justice process, even before prosecutors formally file criminal
charges. It is hardly surprising, therefore, to find that a federal law that Congress in fact designed to create broad and
encompassing rights for victims protects victims during a criminal investigation. As this Article has explained, interpreting the
CVRA to cover crime victims during the pre-charging phase of a case is consistent with the statute's purposes, text, legislative
history, and interpretive case law. And state criminal justice systems also appear to be moving in that direction.

The Justice Department's contrary interpretation seems unlikely to prevail when challenged. The CVRA signals a paradigm
shift in the way that crime victims are to be treated, at least within the federal criminal justice system. Before enactment of the
law, federal investigators and prosecutors might have been able to keep victims at arm's length, refusing to confer with them
about the case and otherwise ignoring or even mistreating them during the process. But those days are over. The CVRA
promises victims that they now have the right to confer with prosecutors and the right to be treated fairly while their cases are
investigated. It is time for the Department of Justice to recognize and embrace that new reality.

21 See, e.g., Minn. Stat. Ann. § 611A4.0315(a) (West 2009) (requiring a prosecutor to make every reasonable effort to notify a victim of
domestic assault ... or harassment that the prosecutor has decided to decline prosecution of the case but providing the right to participate in
proceedings to circumstances in which the offender has been charged).

252 See 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 120/4.5 (2008).

253 Towa Code Ann. § 915.13(1)(f) (West 2003).

24 See Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 780.753 (West 2007). Michigan's conferral right is particularly ambiguous, because the notification
requirement imposed upon the prosecuting attorney contains a time limitation (after arraignment), but the legislature did not include an
express time limitation on the conferral right. See Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 780.756(3) (West 2007) (requiring the victim have the
opportunity to consult prior to “any negotiation that may result in a dismissal, plea or sentence bargain, or pretrial diversion); see also Afiss.
Code Ann. § 99-43-7(1) (2007) (imposing a requirement on law enforcement officials to notify a victim within seventy-two hours).

221, at 59 (describing a significant expansion of victim rights to be consulted by the prosecutor and heard by the court).

Tightening the Screws: The Kremlin's Legal Campaign against Civil Society

e@ JANUARY 2006: Amendments to Certain
Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation
This law gave authorities the power to deny
registration to organizations that “threaten”
Russia, bar foreigners from opening
organizations, subject foreign funding to more
scrutiny, and make the founding and operation of
organizations excessively burdensome, including
by imposing frequent audits and reporting
requirements.

e@ JULY 2012: Amendments to the Law on
Noncommercial Organizations, the Criminal
Code, the Law on Public Associations, and the
Law on Combating Money Laundering and the
Financing of Terrorism
This package of measures, which included
the provision known as the “foreign agents
law,” required nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs) that receive foreign funding and carry
out broadly defined “political activity” to register
with the Justice Ministry and meet onerous
requirements, including filing quarterly financial
reports, submitting to annual and unscheduled
audits, subjecting foreign donations to
monitoring, and marking all publications and
events with the “foreign agent” label. Penalties
for noncompliance include fines, suspension
of funds, and imprisonment of personnel.
Other amendments penalized creating and
participating in “illegitimate” groups and groups
that urge citizens to shirk their civic duties or
perform other illegal acts.

e@ FEBRUARY 2014: Amendments to the Law on
Noncommercial Organizations
This change greatly expanded the list of reasons
for unannounced audits of NGOs.

Confronted by mass demonstrations, the authori-
ties ordered a rerun. The candidate of the reformist
Orange coalition won that election, which was widely
seen as free and honest.

The Orange Revolution was to have far-reaching reper-
cussions. While democracies celebrated the outcome,
repressive regimes reacted with alarm. The concerns
expressed by Russian officials were soon echoed

e@ JUNE 2014: Amendments to the Law on
Noncommercial Organizations
Enacted to strengthen enforcement of the
foreign agents law, this legislation authorized
the Justice Ministry to register NGOs as foreign
agents without their consent and without a court
order, and shifted the burden of proof to NGOs,
compelling them to go to court to fight the label.

e@ MAY 2015: Amendments to Certain Legislative
Acts of the Russian Federation
Known as the “undesirable organizations
law,” this package of changes empowered the
prosecutor general to shut down or restrict the
activities of NGOs that are deemed “undesirable,”
vaguely defined as groups that pose “a threat
to the foundation of the constitutional order of
the Russian Federation, the defense capability
of the country, or the security of the state.”
The amendments bar such organizations from
opening delegate offices, carrying out programs,
and promoting their activities in Russia, and
subject collaborators with these NGOs to
possible fines and imprisonment.

e@ JUNE 2016: Amendments to the Law on Public
Associations and the Law on Noncommercial
Organizations
This legislation revised the loose definition of
“political activity” under the foreign agents law,
but rather than narrowing the meaning of the
term, it applied the law's restrictions to any
activity aimed at influencing the government
or public opinion. That could include opinion
surveys, monitoring of government agencies
performance, analysis of laws or policies, and
petitions or other communications aimed at
government officials.

in China, lran, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Venezuela, and
other authoritarian countries. Vladimir Putin spoke
of the color revolution as the latest form of American
interventionism, and began a process of restricting
Russian NGOs that was to reach a climax a decade
later.

Yanukovych eventually won the presidency in a 2010
comeback, but a second protest-driven revolution

in a 2013 interview. “He then walked into the NSA and said you
should hire me because I am this good on the test.”

The reason why he attempted to gain entry into the upper ranks
of the NSA in the late summer of 2012 is less clear. If his Internet
posting and libertarian riffs are an indication of his state of mind
then, he was hostile to the surveillance activities of the NSA. If so, it
made little sense that he would seek a permanent career there. If this
is considered in light of the career move he made six months later
(in March 2013), which, as he himself admits, was for the express
purpose of getting at tightly held documents stored on computers
that were not available to him in his job at Dell, then he might have
been seeking wider access in 2012 for a more nefarious purpose than
an NSA job.

In any case, despite the near-perfect scores, the NSA did not offer
him a Senior Executive Service job. “It was totally unrealistic for
Snowden to expect to get an SES position,” a former senior NSA
officer told me. Snowden’s ambitions might have been disappointed
in this instance, but it did not prevent him from later claiming that

© he had been a senior adviser to the CIA and also a senior adviser to ©
the Defense Intelligence Agency.

Instead of an SES position, the NSA offered him a lowly G-13 job
as an information technology worker, which was not an improve-
ment on his job at Dell. He took this slight as evidence of the NSA’s
incompetence, subsequently joking to a reporter in Moscow that his
ability to steal the test answers should have been seen as a qualifica-
tion for the NSA job. In September 2012, he turned down the NSA
offer. If he was to advance himself now, he had to find a new way.

Our price objective of $80 / share is based on a 5-year outlook which assumes a 5.5x
DACF multiple and a commodity deck of $67.50 WTI and $70 Brent to which we add
$10/ sh for Liza in offshore Guyana. The multiple is based on a finite timeline to
delivery which is supported by core NAV.

The risks to our price objective are: 1) the oil and gas price environment, (2) slowdowns
in development drilling that leave production below expectations, and (3) news flow
around HES' exploratory and appraisal drilling activities that could impact the stock.

effectiveness of a system of law enforcement, then there is something very wrong with
that system.

The theme of this paragraph — the right to know of one’s rights — has pervaded my thinking and
teaching.

During that term, I also drafted opinions—some majority, some concurring, some dissenting—on
trial by jury, freedom of speech, desegregation, reapportionment, immunity and other important
and changing areas of the law. There could be no better foundation for the next phase of my
career—teaching law students at the nation’s largest and most prestigious law school, Harvard.

Before I leave the Supreme Court, I must recount one vignette regarding Justice Goldberg that
caused me considerable disappointment. One of the great villains of the day to all liberals was J.
Edgar Hoover, the head of the FBI. On several occasions, I let my negative views about Hoover
be known to Goldberg, but he never said a word. I didn’t understand why. A few years later, I
asked Bazelon, who smiled, and said “I probably shouldn’t tell you, but it’s important for you to
know that there are no perfect heroes.” He continued, “Hoover and Goldberg got along well,
because when Goldberg was the lawyer for the labor movement, he worked hard to rid the C.I.O.
of Communist influence.” I asked whether that meant he informed on Communist with the Union.
Bazelon replied, “I wouldn’t use the word informed, but he worked closely with Hoover on a
common goal: to rid the C.I.O. of Communist influence.”

Bazelon then told me that Thurgood Marshall had played a similar role with regard to the
NAACP-—trying to cleanse it of Communist influences.”

“That’s how Thurgood and Arthur made it to the Court. If Hoover had opposed them, they
might not have been appointed.”

I was shocked. “But there have been other liberals appointed as well,” I insisted.

“Yes, Douglas, but he was Joe Kennedy’s boy, and Hoover liked Joe Kennedy, at least back in the
day when Douglas was appointed. With Hoover, it wasn’t so much what you believed as were
you with Hoover or against him.”

“What about Justice Brennan?,” I asked.

“Bill was an accident, an Eisenhower mistake. They didn’t know he would be so liberal.
Eisenhower regarded Warren and Brennan as his worst mistakes.”

Bazelon then paused and said he would tell me something else, if I promised to keep it a secret
until Goldberg and Marshall were both dead. I promised.

“Hoover had something on both of them.”
“What?” I asked.

“Goldberg apparently had a brief ‘friendship’ with some European woman who may have been a
Russian spy. Hoover covered it up.”

were a regional superpower, with a military as effective as any in the world, and a
high-tech economic sector justifiably compared to Silicon Valley.

Every few weeks, Bibi, Lieberman and I would meet for a wide-ranging
discussion on the patio of the Prime Minister’s residence. Shortly after we’d
abandoned the idea of a military strike, I raised head-on my objections to the
skewed image Bibi was promoting of our country. It wasn’t just inaccurate, I said.
Especially when his rhetoric was in full flight, and he compared the prospect of a
nuclear Iran to a new “Holocaust,” it struck me as a betrayal of the core tenet of
Zionism: an state in which Jews were in control of their own destiny. “We are in
that position now,” I said. It was nonsensical to argue we were so threatened by
everything around us, for instance, that we couldn’t “risk” taking the initiative
required to disentangle ourselves from the Palestinians on the West Bank. “I don’t
get you,” I said, turning to Lieberman as well. “Your rhetoric suggests you have
spines of steel. But your behavior is living proof of the old saying that it’s easier to
take Jews out of the ga/ut, than take the galut out of the Jews.” Galut is Hebrew for
the diaspora. “The whole Zionist project was based on the idea of taking our fate
into our own hands, and actively trying to change the reality around us. But you
behave as if we never left the ga/ut. You’re mired in a mindset of pessimism,
passivity and anxiety, which in terms of policy or action, leads to paralysis. Of
course, there are risks in any action, or any policy initiative. But in the situation
where Israel finds itself, the biggest risk of all is being unable or unwilling to take
risks, as 1f we somehow on the brink of destruction.”

I was especially upset by Bibi’s increasingly use of Holocaust imagery. “Just
think of what you’re saying,” I told him. ““You’re Prime Minister of the State of
Israel, not a rabbi in a shfet/, or a speaker trying to raise funds for Israel abroad.
Think of the implications. We’re not in Europe in 1937. Or 1947. If it is a
‘Holocaust,’ what’s our response: to fold up and go back to the diaspora? If Iran
gets a bomb, it’ll be bad. Very bad. But we’ll still be here. And we’ ll find a way of
dealing with the new reality.”

Yet “fortress Israel” was irresistibly comfortable for Bibi politically. I now had
to accept that, while he and I had known each other for more than half-a-century,
nothing I could do or say was going to change that. With the next Israeli election
months away, in January 2013, I confided to Nili, and then to my closest aides, that
I was not going to run for a seat in the Knesset. Israeli military action against Iran

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012892.txt,"Approximately 3,000 innocent victims died in the 9-11 attacks. As of early 2011, some where between
900,000 to over a million soldiers and civilians have died in Afghanistan and Iraq due to the war. This is
excessive. This is no longer revenge. This is senseless brutality.

On one reading, Pope Benedict XVI kept his knowledge of pedophilic priests quiet and
confidential in order to forgive them and protect the church. But this seemingly benign desire led to a
disaster, one that was foreseeable: continued sexual assault on thousands of innocent children and for
many, a loss of trust in the church and their moral and spiritual leader.

Discoveries by molecular biologists, neuroscientists, and psychologists reveal important
individual differences in our capacity to fuel desire, differences that constrain the paths we take from birth
until our last breath. Some individuals are more risk-prone, some are impatient, and some gain a greater
hit of dopamine in anticipation of reward, thereby doping themselves on the brain’s pharmaceutical
offerings. Some are born with a set of genes that diminish the capacity for self-control. These individuals
start with lower levels of serotonin. These individuals, if raised by abusive parents, have a higher
probability of taking someone’s head off if they are challenged. Some individuals are born with low
stress levels. These individuals are more likely to be sensation-seekers, voracious desirers who will stop
at nothing less than the spectacular, even if this means the spectacularly violent. None of these biological
catalysts operate in a vacuum. All of these biological catalysts feed off of particular environments that we
create. Geological and climatic factors create savannahs, oceans, and mountains. We create slums,
refugee camps, and totalitarian regimes. We are responsible for creating toxic environments and equally
responsible for cleaning them up. How we think about individual responsibility in cases of brain damage,
developmental disorders or innate differences in the starting state of our neurochemistry is a different
problem, one that I will touch upon in the last section.

Denial. We all engage in it, at least some of the time. Like the psychology of desire, our
engagement with denial is sometimes benign and often beneficial as a coping mechanism. We
dehumanize in order to buffer ourselves from the pain of another’s pain. We self-deceive in the service of
boosting self-confidence and self-esteem. When doctors turn their patients into machines that require
repair, they have deployed an adaptive mechanism that keeps empathy at bay when it is unnecessary.
Good doctors, the ones that we all want, turn empathy back on when their patients awake from surgery,
flesh and blood pulsating, thoughts and emotions humming. Bad doctors never turn empathy back on.
Evil doctors, such as Carl Clauberg who injected liquid acid in the uterus of Jewish prisoners as part of a
Nazi inspired sterilization program, not only lack empathy for their patients, but see them as vermin or
parasites that require extermination in the name of science and the preservation of our species. Denial has
transformed other human beings into nonhuman forms, from inert objects to wild animals and parasites.
Denial has allowed military leaders and airplane pilots to ignore clear signs of trouble, marching
thousands to their death. When this happens, moral responsibility checks out. Denial provides individuals
and nations with a certified license to maim, rape, burn, mutilate and kill without feeling guilt, shame or
remorse.

As with desire, the sciences provide a rich offering of evidence to explain how and why we
engage in denial, either by means of dehumanizing others or self-deceiving ourselves. Both
dehumanization and self-deception have a clear evolutionary logic. Dehumanization is a mechanism that
enhances an individual’s competitive edge by making hatred and killing easier. Hatred and killing are the
essential and ancient ingredients for defending the in-group and effacing the out-group. Sometimes,
soldiers would rather avoid killing the enemy. But when dehumanization of the enemy takes hold in the
mind of a soldier or civilian, killing is not only easy, but addictive. The brain’s inhibitory mechanisms,
processed by circuitry in the frontal lobes, shut down. Other brain regions involved in working out what
people believe and intend, enter into hibernation. With these circuits on leave, so too is our moral
conscience. When the mind runs its dehumanization software, abstinence from killing is like withdrawal
from a drug. Killing is satisfying. Killing is delicious.

Self-deception evolved in the service of deception. By functionally fooling ourselves into
believing that we are stronger, wiser, and more competent, we can convince others to go along for the
ride, to work for us or work against a fictional enemy. Like dehumanization, this has both adaptive and

But Snowden found diversions in Japan. In July 2009, Lindsay
Mills joined him there. She had become an amateur photographer,
specializing in arty self-portraits. She also saw herself as a global
tourist, writing in her blog after arriving in Japan that she had trav-
eled to seventeen countries. Like Snowden, she also deemed herself,
tongue in cheek, a “super hero.” In this sense, her Internet avatar
was a match for Snowden’s Wolfking Awesomefox.

In Japan, Mills and Snowden spent time with another Ameri-
can couple, Jennie and Joseph Chamberlin, who also worked at the
Yokota base. Jennie, a sergeant in the public affairs section of the U.S.
Air Force, had been at art college with Mills and called herself in her
blog the Little Red Ninja. Joseph Chamberlin was a decorated U.S.
Navy pilot who now flew highly sensitive intelligence-gathering
missions from the Yokota base. Jennie described Lindsay in her blog
as her “super-model friend.” The two couples also went on expedi-
tions in Japan together. As far as is known, the Chamberlins were
the only Americans at the base with whom Snowden socialized. On
August 17, 2009, the foursome attempted to walk up Mount Fuji,

® but they got lost en route and wound up in the Mount Fuji gift ©
shop. Jennie described the misadventure in her blog: “Our adven-
ture started off a little rocky with our attempts to find the interstate.
Alas, our iconic mountain was obscured by cloud. A short stop at
the Mt. Fuji combination soba noodle stand/gift shop was enough to
whet our appetite for the further exploration that is to come.” Pho-
tographs taken that day show Snowden wearing Hawaiian shorts
and a black tank top emblazoned with an eagle and the letters USA.
They also show Mills wearing safari shorts, a brown sweater, and
what appears to be an engagement ring. “Ed was looking rather red-
necky,” Lindsay commented on one photograph. Snowden described
her, in turn, as “nerdy.” They never made it to the top of Mount Fuji.

Snowden also sought to advance himself by getting credit toward
a college certificate by enrolling in a summer online course at the
University of Maryland’s Asia program, which had a regional cam-
pus on the Yokota base. Known as UMUC, it had a contract with
the government to provide military personnel with such educa-
tional opportunities. Snowden would later claim that he was tak-
ing courses for a graduate degree in computer sciences, but William

and dramatic changes via a forced discontinuity in what Thom called a catastrophe
and others use related words such as bifurcation or phase transition. The transitions
from painful fatigue to running rage and then to ecstatic transcendence feels like the
gifts from two kinds of Gods, the first, bearing the righteous lawfulness of the Old
Testament, the second bringing the empathic forgiveness of the New Testament
Jesus. Catastrophe and bifurcation theories predict and keep track of these
transitions using mathematically describable changes in global characteristics of the
“motion” using technical descriptors such as eigenvalues, germs and jets.

Thom taught me my first catastrophe, called the cusp, in words during our
late afternoon walks along a shadowed green wooded path on the grounds of the
Institute des Hautes Etudes, outside of Paris. My homework consisted of trying to
visualize his verbal descriptions. It was not until weeks later that he drew the
geometric object being discussed on the blackboard. With eyes twinkling and in his
provocatively playful style, he said,

“Imagine an empty rectangular box with the front edge of its roof buckled
into an *S’ and the back edge, an unfolded, left-to-right gradually rising simple
smooth curve. If one moves the causal force from low to high, from left to right along
the back of the box, the changing effect (represented by height) would be smooth;
moving from left to right in the front encounters a sudden drop off at the S shaped
buckling, a discontinuity in roof height indicating a discontinuity in effect. The energy
equivalent height of the roof graphically indicates the amount of result. The roof is
the manifold upon which the result of causal change is portrayed. The two
dimensional floor of the box represents a graph of the two causal parameters, the
increasing amount of normal factor going left to right along the °x’ dimension, the
increasing amount of splitting factor (taking one from the back to the front to the
region of the buckling) going back to front along the ‘y’ dimension.”

He gave me some examples of systems that showed cataclysmic changes in
effect from smooth changes of normal and splitting factors. About the onset of a
war: “At the back of the top surface of the box, the manifold, the normal factor

increasing from left to right is the amount of the perceived threat. The splitting factor

his other girlfriends (or boyfriends, for that matter). I am responsible for what I do, but
I'm not responsible for what he does. I am responsible for how I treat his spouse, but I
can't be responsible for how he treats his spouse.

But what if I'm already friends with someone, and one of my partners gets involved with
that person? Do I have special responsibilities in that case? I'm still figuring that one out.

2. When is it actually the best time to start talking about polyamory and setting out
relationship definitions? My approach so far has been to put poly on the table during
initial conversations, and then talk about it more when the topic of the relationship comes
up. But I've been thinking lately that I probably should go into more detail sooner,
because people have such different stereotypes of open relationships that I can't be sure
they're on board with what I'm talking about unless we've discussed polyamory in-depth.

I feel like I talk to a lot of people who think they want a supposedly polyamorous”
relationship because they see it as a no-strings-attached free-for-all, and that's definitely
not what I want. Or I talk to people who back away from polyamory for the same reason.
I see polyamory as being about more commitment to relationship negotiation, not less. I
see it as being about setting individual boundaries, if necessary -- it's not about having no
boundaries. I see it as being about creating a secure situation for all parties involved --
not making anyone insecure, or ignoring anyone's needs. And being polyamorous doesn't
make my relationships unimportant to me. Being in love doesn't seem at odds with
polyamory for me.

This is a hard thing to communicate in a small dose, though, especially if I'm dealing
with someone who has minimal exposure to the concept. On the other hand, having a
Serious Conversation about polyamory on the first date is a bit much.

3. Is it a good idea for me to get involved with guys who ultimately want
monogamy? As I noted earlier, I might compromise to monogamy eventually, but poly is
a priority for me. (Who knows, maybe I'll decide it's my ideal relationship formation
again someday. This seems unlikely to me right now, but anything's possible.)

But what if I get really into a guy who ultimately plans to be monogamous? Is this a bad
call on my part? On the one hand, if I go on a few dates with a 28-year-old guy who
doesn't want to get married until his mid-30s but definitely wants a monogamous
marriage when he does... I mean, why not have a relationship? On the other hand, I may
be setting myself up for heartbreak in such situations, if he basically sees our relationship
as not real” from the start. This brings me to my next point...

4. Some people see polyamory as a sign of commitment-phobia. I've made this
mistake myself -- in fact, the polyamory as commitment-phobia stereotype is so strong
that I've occasionally reversed it and wondered if my desire for it was a sign of
commitment-phobia. But the fact is, my appreciation for polyamory only increased as I
became more certain about what I'm seeking in a partner, and as I gained more
understanding of how to negotiate that. It's come along with relationship confidence and
understanding.

I feel pretty okay with believing in commitment in the context of polyamory. But my

‘Jeffrey once had me give Matt a foot massage when he was flying on the jet with us,’ Virginia says.
‘He laughed and did drawings of Bart and Homer for my little brother and my dad.

‘Donald Trump was aiso a good friend of Jeffrey's. He didn’t partake in sex with any of us but he

Palm Beach Police say Epstein seemed utterly unfazed by the allegations against him when they
began their long and detailed investigation.

But he also took his defence very seriously indeed. Epstein engaged his friend, the Harvard law
professor Alan Dershowitz — whose celebrity clients have included Mike Tyson, Patty Hearst, Claus
von Bulow and O.J. Simpson ~ to run his legal defence.

He aiso employed a firm of private investigators to investigate the backgrounds of the girls.

Detectives painstakingly built a case which they believed showed that Epstein systematically paid
teenage girls to recruit other teenage girls to his sex ring.

However, as the investigation continued, they found that Epstein’s team had already spoken to key
witnesses, suggesting that the financier would reward those who helped him.

In addition, Epstein's defence team agreed to the unusual move of suggesting that the alleged
victims sue Epstein in the civil courts. The result was a plea bargain in which Epstein admitted a
single charge of soliciting an underage girl for prostitution ~ a deal which infuriated many police
officers who worked on the case.

More than 20 of Epstein’s girls are said to have sued him for damages. At least 17 have settled out
of court.

Mr Clinton, Mr Gore and Mr Mitchell were all contacted about their friendship with Epstein but
declined to comment.

and its affiliates may encounter potential conflicts of interest in connection with the Fund. Prospective
investors in the Fund should carefully consider the following factors in connection with an investment in
the Fund. The following is not a complete list of all risks involved in connection with an investment in
the Fund. In addition to the items discussed below, prospective investors should also consider the
information described in Section XI, “Certain Tax & ERISA Considerations” and elsewhere in this
Memorandum. Prospective investors are cautioned not to rely on the prior returns set forth in this
Memorandum in making a decision whether or not to purchase the Limited Partner Interests offered
hereby. The return information contained in this Memorandum has not been audited or verified by any
independent party and should not be considered representative of the returns that may be received by an
investor in the Fund. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.

Risk of Venture Capital Investments

While venture capital investments offer the opportunity for significant gains, such investments
also involve a high degree of business and financial risk and can result in substantial losses.
Among these risks are the general risks associated with investing in companies at an early state
of development or with little or no operating history, companies operating at a loss or with
substantial variations in operating results from period to period, and companies with the need
for substantial additional capital to support expansion or to achieve or maintain a competitive
position. Such companies may face intense competition, including from companies with greater
financial resources, more extensive development, manufacturing, marketing and service
capabilities and a larger number of qualified managerial and technical personnel. Due to the
limited number of investments that the Fund may make, poor performance by some of the
Fund’s investments could significantly affect the total returns to Limited Partners.

Focused Investment Strategy

The Fund will be focused on life sciences and healthcare technology investments and may not
enjoy the reduced risks of a broadly diversified portfolio. A specific investment focus is
inherently more risky and could cause the Fund’s investments to be more susceptible to
particular economic, political, regulatory, technological or industry conditions or occurrences
compared with a fund, or a portfolio of funds, that is more diversified or has a broader industry
focus.

Risks Associated with Investments in Life Sciences and Healthcare Technology Companies

The success of the Fund’s portfolio companies may be dependent upon obtaining certain
governmental approvals. Companies in the life sciences and healthcare technology industry
typically require the approval of agencies such as the FDA prior to marketing their products to
the public. Of particular significance are the FDA requirements covering research and
development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, labeling and promotion of drugs for
human use. The approval process is very lengthy and very costly, and there can be no
guarantee that a portfolio company will obtain the necessary approvals for its products. If a
portfolio company is unable to obtain these approvals in a timely fashion, the portfolio

Chinese-Language Media Landscape

Official and Semi-Official Chinese-Language Media

By 2018, all of the major official Chinese media outlets had embedded themselves

deeply into the communications and broadcasting infrastructure of the

United States.

CCTV or CGTN (English and Chinese), the semiofficial Hong Kong-based
Phoenix TV, and a few Chinese provincial TV channels are available in add-on
packages of two major satellite TV providers in the United States, DISH Network
and DIRECTV. CCTV channels (English and Chinese) are in the cable systems of

all the major metropolitan areas of the United States.

The major official Chinese TV networks, including CCTV and major Chinese
provincial TV networks, and the quasi-official Phoenix TV, are all in the
program lineups of Chinese TV streaming services that have become popular
among Chinese communities in the United States. There are four major Chinese
streaming services in the United States: iTalkBB Chinese TV (##4##), Charming
China (#42 '7HI), Great Wall (R444), and KyLin TV (RBS). All these services
carry the major official Chinese TV channels, including major provincial

channels, and are accessible nationwide.

The major official Chinese media organizations, CCTV (CGTN), Xinhua, the
People’s Daily, and China Daily (the only major official newspaper in English),
have a heavy presence on all major social media platforms of the United States
and have many followers. All these outlets use Facebook and Twitter and other

platforms, even though those platforms are blocked in China.

Quasi-official Phoenix TV (AB), a global TV network with links to the PRC’s
Ministry of State Security and headquartered in Hong Kong with branches around
the world, including the United States, also has a substantial presence on all the

major social media platforms in the United States.

The secretary runs a brisk, no-nonsense meeting. “We present and she
interrogates, in the best sense of the word,” says Patrick Kennedy, the
undersecretary for management. Received wisdom gets eviscerated.
“Jeff, you’ve got to do better than that,” she told Jeffrey Feltman, the
assistant secretary for Near Eastern affairs, one day when he
presented a shopworn idea. With USAID undergoing an overhaul,
she listens to every reform report, down to the details of how chlorine
tablets for clean drinking water can be transported by truck in
Honduras. “She’s looking at the guts of how we work,” says Dr. Raj
Shah, who runs USAID.

According to old State hands, Hillary represents some of the better
qualities of her predecessors. She has Baker’s obsession with
preparation, reaches out like Colin Powell (who advised her to resist
the efforts of bureaucrats to strip her of her BlackBerry), and offers
continuity with Condi Rice’s policy on aids and Africa. But she
might most resemble Ronald Reagan’s second secretary of state,
George Shultz, a canny pragmatist who made significant progress in
several areas without being associated with a single momentous
event. Shultz was known for valuing the “career people” (foreign-
service officers) and casting a wide net for advice. Hillary does that,
too, though she’s still surrounded by a Praetorian Guard of loyalists
from her Senate office who are too political for the taste of some
diplomats in the building. (They preferred the military veterans
around Powell or academics around Rice.) Her great weakness over
the years was too often choosing subordinates based more on loyalty
than competence. She has been better about this since moving to
State, but still slow to extend her trust.

When she travels, Hillary manages to be simultaneously remote from
the media (joint press conferences with foreign ministers are limited
to two questions for each) and accessible to the public. Unless a crisis
obliterates her schedule, she routinely subjects herself to what Reines

in part 893 F.2d 205 (9th Cir. 1990) (en banc): The President refused to comply with provisions of the
Competition.in Contracting Act that he viewed as unconstitutional and thereby allowed for judicial
resolution of the issue. The Ninth Circuit rejected the President's arguments about the constitutionality
of the provisions. The court further determined that Lear Siegler was a prevailing party and was
entitled to attorneys' fees, because the executive branch acted in bad faith in refusing to execute the
contested provisions. In this regard, the court stated that the President's action was “utterly at odds with
the texture and plain language of the Constitution, because a statute is part of the law of the land that
the President is obligated to execute. Id. at 1121, 1124. On rehearing en banc, the court ruled that Lear

"
IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030285.txt,"Hardwired for Hope?

I would have liked to tell you that my work on optimism grew out of
a keen interest in the positive side of human nature. The reality is that
I stumbled onto the brain's innate optimism by accident. After living
through Sept. 11, 2001, in New York City, I had set out to investigate
people's memories of the terrorist attacks. I was intrigued by the fact
that people felt their memories were as accurate as a videotape, while
often they were filled with errors. A survey conducted around the
country showed that 11 months after the attacks, individuals'
recollections of their experience that day were consistent with their
initial accounts (given in September 2011) only 63% of the time.
They were also poor at remembering details of the event, such as the
names of the airline carriers. Where did these mistakes in memory
come from?

Scientists who study memory proposed an intriguing answer:
memories are susceptible to inaccuracies partly because the neural
system responsible for remembering episodes from our past might not
have evolved for memory alone. Rather, the core function of the
memory system could in fact be to imagine the future — to enable us
to prepare for what has yet to come. The system is not designed to
perfectly replay past events, the researchers claimed. It is designed to
flexibly construct future scenarios in our minds. As a result, memory
also ends up being a reconstructive process, and occasionally, details
are deleted and others inserted. To test this, I decided to record the
brain activity of volunteers while they imagined future events — not
events on the scale of 9/11, but events in their everyday lives — and
compare those results with the pattern I observed when the same
individuals recalled past events. But something unexpected occurred.
Once people started imagining the future, even the most banal life
events seemed to take a dramatic turn for the better. Mundane scenes
brightened with upbeat details as if polished by a Hollywood script

with any of his victims. During the course of his guilty pleas on June 30, 2008, Palm Beach
Circuit Court Judge Deborah Dale Pucillo ordered Epstein “not to have any contact, direct or
indirect” with any victims. She also expressly stated that her no-contact order applied to “all of
the victims.” Similar orders were entered by the federal court handling some of the civil cases
against Epstein. The federal court stated that it “finds it necessary to state clearly that Defendant
is under this court’s order not to have direct or indirect contact with any plaintiffs ... .” Order,

Edwards Files Civil Suits Against Epstein

44, Edwards had a good faith belief that his clients felt angry and betrayed by the
criminal system and wished to prosecute and punish Epstein for his crimes against them in
whatever avenue remained open to them. On August 12, 2008, at the request of his client Jane
Doe, Brad Edwards filed a civil suit against Jeffrey Epstein to recover damages for his sexual
assault of Jane Doe. See Edwards Affidavit, “N” at 7. Included in this complaint was a RICO
count that explained how Epstein ran a criminal conspiracy to procure young girls for him to
sexually abuse. See Complaint, Jane Doe v. Epstein (Exhibit “T”’).

45. On devteniber 11, 2008, at the request of his client E.W., Brad Edwards filed a civil
suit against Jeffrey Epstein to recover damages for his sexual assault of E.W. See Complaint,

Chapter Twenty-Three

It didn’t fully hit me how draining our efforts had been until the morning that
the summit collapsed, when President Clinton called me to come talk to him in the
living room at Laurel Lodge. When I arrived, Madeleine was already there, sitting
on the edge of the sofa. She greeted me with a resigned shrug and a valiant but not
altogether successful effort at a smile.

“We tried,” Clinton said quietly as I took a seat in a wooden chair opposite his.
“We gave it everything.” The nominal reason for the meeting was to brief me on
the communiqué the Americans were going to issue: mostly boilerplate assurances
that both sides remained committed to seeking peace, but with an additional
“understanding” that neither would take unilateral actions in the meantime. But
mostly, Clinton wanted to reinforce his message of a few days earlier: don’t “lock
yourself into a losing option.” Don’t close the door. Don’t give up. “I won’t,” I told
him, an assurance I echoed in remarks to reporters a few hours later, when I said
that while the peace process had “suffered a major blow, we should not lose hope.
With goodwill on all sides, we can recuperate.”

But I told the President that we couldn’t just ignore what had happened at Camp
David. Yes, in the event Arafat suddenly had second thoughts about the potentially
historic achievement he’d passed up, he would know where to find me. But until
and unless that happened, I told Clinton that I assumed my “pocket” concessions
would now be firmly back in his pocket. And while we couldn’t erase them from
memory, I said it was important both of us make it clear that, in legal and
diplomatic terms, they were not going to provide Arafat a new starting point from
which he could make his customary demand for more.

“And I have to tell you that, given what has happened, there’s no way I can
justify handing him control of more land. I am not going to go ahead with the Wye
redeployments in these circumstances.”

“You don’t have to,” Clinton replied. “Ill back you.”

Though I never discussed internal Israeli politics with any foreign leader, even
the closest of allies, I didn’t doubt that the President’s support was partly a
recognition of what awaited me once I got home. The compromises I’d been
willing to consider had gone further — much further, on the politically combustible

intimidating. A broken leg, for example, may have been thought of as
terrible before choosing it over some other malady. However, after
choosing it, the subject would find a silver lining: With a broken leg,
I will be able to lie in bed watching TV, guilt-free. In our study, we
also found that people perceived adverse events more positively if
they had experienced them in the past. Recording brain activity while
these reappraisals took place revealed that highlighting the positive
within the negative involves, once again, a téte-a-téte between the
frontal cortex and subcortical regions processing emotional value.
While contemplating a mishap, like a broken leg, activity in the
rACC modulated signals in a region called the striatum that conveyed
the good and bad of the event in question — biasing activity in a
positive direction.

It seems that our brain possesses the philosopher's stone that enables
us to turn lead into gold and helps us bounce back to normal levels of
well-being. It is wired to place high value on the events we encounter
and put faith in its own decisions. This is true not only when forced
to choose between two adverse options (such as selecting between
two courses of medical treatment) but also when we are selecting
between desirable alternatives. Imagine you need to pick between two
equally attractive job offers. Making a decision may be a tiring,
difficult ordeal, but once you make up your mind, something
miraculous happens. Suddenly — if you are like most people — you
view the chosen offer as better than you did before and conclude that
the other option was not that great after all. According to social
psychologist Leon Festinger, we re-evaluate the options postchoice to
reduce the tension that arises from making a difficult decision
between equally desirable options.

intercepts that laid bare the details, and left no doubt the murderers were from a
PLO group. He called and asked me to appear on a weekly television interview
program called Moked. It was hosted by Nissim Mishal: brash, incisive, and one
of Israel’s best-known broadcast journalists. I pointed out to the Rabin aide that
I’d never done anything like this before. But he insisted it would go well. He
briefed me on the questions I could expect, not just about the Achille Lauro but
the wider issue of Palestinian attacks, as well as Syrian President Hafez al-
Assad’s efforts to re-equip his air force after his losses in Lebanon. So I came to
the interview prepared. I brought audio tapes of the hijackers, and a large
photograph of the MiG-25s which the Syrians were seeking to acquire.

My appearance will not go down in the annals of great moments in
television. But at the time, very few Israelis even knew who I was, and I felt ’'d
done OK. I was surprised, however, when Rabin phoned the next day. “Ehud, I
didn’t see it. I was attending some event,” he said. But his wife, Leah, had
recorded the program. “I just watched it. I should tell you, I think it was
exceptional. You did a great job. It was highly important for us, for the army,
and, I dare say, for you.”

I was not sure what he meant by saying it might be good for me as well,
although a decade later, at the end of my army career, he would play the central
role into my entry into Israeli politics. It is true that there was also some politics
at the upper reaches of the military as well, especially around the choice of chief
of staff, and that Moshe Vechetzi’s term had only a year-and-a-half to go. But I
didn’t view myself as a serious candidate at this stage. Moshe’s own preference
seemed to be either Amir Drori, the head of the northern command during the
Lebanon War, or Amnon Lipkin, the veteran paratroop commander who’d been
with me on the Rue Verdun raid in Beirut. My own hope was that the nod
would go to any even closer friend of mine: Dan Shomron.

I had first got to know Dan well in the late sixties after Karameh, Israel’s
costly standoff with Arafat, when Fatah’s influence was in its infancy. We
exchanged impressions on what had gone wrong, and why? When I became
commander of Sayeret Matkal, we remained in touch, and he took a close
interest in all of our operations. We also crossed paths in the Sinai in the 1973,

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013226.txt,"310 17 A Preschool-Based Roadmap to Advanced AGI

However, the briefer treatment given here should suffice to give a sense for how the competencies
manifest themselves practically in the AGI Preschool context.

1. Perception

e Vision: image and scene analysis and understanding
— Example task: When the teacher points to an object in the preschool, the robot
should be able to identify the object and (if it’s a multi-part object) its major
parts. If it can’t perform the identification initially, it can approach the object and
manipulate it before making its identification.
Hearing: identifying the sounds associated with common objects; understanding which
sounds come from which sources in a noisy environment
— Example task: When the teacher covers the robot’s eyes and then makes a noise
with an object, the robot should be able to guess what the object is
Touch: identifying common objects and carrying out common actions using touch alone
— Example task: With its eyes and ears covered, the robot should be able to identify
some object by manipulating it; and carry out some simple behaviors (say, putting
a block on a table) via touch alone
e Crossmodal: Integrating information from various senses
— Example task: Identifying an object in a noisy, dim environment via combining
visual and auditory information
e Proprioception: Sensing and understanding what its body is doing
— Example task: The teacher moves the robot’s body into a certain configuration. The
robot is asked to restore its body to an ordinary standing position, and then repeat
the configuration that the teacher moved it into.

2. Actuation

e Physical skills: manipulating familiar and unfamiliar objects
— Example task: Manipulate blocks based on imitating the teacher: e.g. pile two blocks
atop each other, lay three blocks in a row, etc.
e Tool use, including the flexible use of ordinary objects as tools
— Example task: Use a stick to poke a ball out of a corner, where the robot cannot
directly reach
e Navigation, including in complex and dynamic environments
— Example task: Find its own way to a named object or person through a crowded
room with people walking in it and objects laying on the floor.

3. Memory

e Declarative: noticing, observing and recalling facts about its environment and expe-
rience
— Example task: If certain people habitually carry certain objects, the robot should
remember this (allowing it to know how to find the objects when the relevant people
are present, even much later)
e Behavioral: remembering how to carry out actions
— Example task: If the robot is taught some skill (say, to fetch a ball), it should
remember this much later
e Episodic: remembering significant, potentially useful incidents from life history

subpoenaed to testify. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit “N” at 418.

76. Edwards learned of allegations that Epstein engaged in sexual abuse of minors on
his private aircraft. See Jane Doe 102 Complaint, Exhibit “B.” Accordingly, Edwards pursued
discovery to confirm these allegations.

Fi Discovery of the pilot and flight logs was proper in the cases brought by Edwards
against Epstein. Jane Doe filed a federal RICO claim against Epstein that was an active claim
through much of the litigation. The RICO claim alleged that Epstein ran an expansive criminal
enterprise that involved and depended upon his plane travel. Although Judge Marra dismissed
the RICO claim at some point in the federal litigation, the legal team representing
Edwards' clients intended to pursue an appeal of that dismissal. Moreover, all of the subjects
mentioned in the RICO claim remained relevant to other aspects of Jane Doe’s claims against
Epstein, including in particular her claim for punitive damages. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit
“N” at 19.

78. Discovery of the pilot and flight logs was also proper in the cases brought by
Edwards against Epstein because of the need to obtain evidence of a federal nexus. Edwards's
client Jane Doe was proceeding to trial on a federal claim under 18 U.S.C. § 2255. Section 2255
is a federal statute staf (unlike relevant state statutes) established a minimum level of recovery
for victims of the violation of its provisions. Proceeding under the statute, however, required a
“federal nexus” to the sexual assaults. Jane Doe had two grounds on which to argue that such a
nexus existed to her abuse by Epstein: first, his use of telephone to arrange for girls to be abused;

and, second, his travel on planes in interstate commerce. During the course of the litigation,

For Epstein, there are other embarrassments, many of which

bles of Prince William’s uncle Prince Andrew keep threatening
to derail the festivities. On March 6, a spokesperson for Sarah
Ferguson confirms that Epstein paid off part of the seventy-eight

was once her personal assistant.

end of the day, dozens of Israelis and Palestinians were injured. Five Palestinians
lay dead. Though the media almost instantly labelled it a new “intifada”, this one
was very different. It was not a burst of anger, however misdirected, by stone-
throwing youths convinced that a road accident in Gaza had been something more
sinister. There had been no serious unrest on the day of Arik’s visit. We would
later learn this was a deliberate campaign, waged with guns and grenades, by
Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the Fatah offshoot Tanzim, and Arafat’s own police
force.

The media had changed, too, in the 13 years since the first intifada, with the rise
of twenty-four-seven news broadcasters, including the Arabic-language Al Jazeera.
Images of pain and suffering and fear stoked anger on both sides. None, in the first
days of the violence, was more powerful, or heart-rending, than the picture of a
terrified 12-year-old Palestinian boy named Mohammed al-Durrah, sheltered by
his father as they took cover from the crossfire in Gaza. The facts of the incident,
as best we could establish immediately afterwards, were that the Palestinian
security forces had opened fire on Israeli troops near the settlement of Netzarim.
Ten Palestinians, including the little boy, lost their lives when the soldiers returned
fire. We later established with near certainty that the boy had in fact been killed by
Palestinian gunfire. But even if we’d been able to prove that at the time, I’m sure
that in the increasingly poisonous atmosphere, it would have made little difference.

Nor would it have changed the next, deeply disturbing escalation: the spread of
the violence into Israel itself, with unprecedentedly serious clashes between our
own Arab citizens and the police in the Galilee, in Wadi Ara, in the main mixed
Arab-Jewish cities, and the Negev. Beyond the political implications, the
demonstrations of solidarity with the Palestinian violence presented a security
challenge of a different order: to the ability of the Israeli police, and by extension
the government, to ensure basic law and order inside our borders. The worst of the
clashes lasted barely a week. But they left thirteen Arab Israeli protestors dead,
sparking demonstrations as far afield as Jaffa, as well as ugly incidents of mob
violence by Israeli Jews against Arabs in some areas.

President Clinton tried his best to help us halt the violence on the West Bank
and in Gaza. I doubted the Americans would succeed, but was fully ready to join in
their efforts to try. About ten days into the new intifada, I attended a crisis meeting
with Arafat, mediated by Madeleine Albright and Dennis Ross, at the US
ambassador’s residence Paris. It was nominally under the aegis of President

103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *845

Structural responses to the state declining to use its enforcement authority are much fewer and less prominent. At least in
common law countries, enforcement decisions are the province of police and prosecutor discretion, and oversight of officials’
failures to enforce has been left almost wholly to the political process. Decisions to search, arrest, or charge face modest
judicial scrutiny on evidentiary grounds and - at the extreme margins - racial or [*846] ethnic bias. ° Decisions not to arrest or
charge are virtually immune from judicial review or other nonpolitical oversight. !° Like other common law jurisdictions, U.S.
justice systems have always rejected an approach long adopted in some civil law jurisdictions to prevent unjustified and
disparate nonenforcement - a rule of mandatory prosecution that restricts executive officials’ discretion over arrest and charging
decisions. |!

A broader view, however, reveals that all criminal justice systems incorporate one or more strategies to address
underenforcement, which can be collectively described as redundant charging authority. All are to some degree familiar,
though they are not usually described in these terms or understood as serving this common purpose.

One approach is creation of two distinct enforcement agencies with overlapping or duplicative jurisdiction. This model is a
familiar safeguard against underenforcement of transnational crimes or crimes on the high seas; international criminal law
routinely grants nation-states coextensive, duplicative jurisdiction to enforce international or domestic criminal laws outside

understood as agreements to create enforcement redundancy among national criminal justice agencies to solve
underenforcement problems by particular states. !> The same arrangement occurs domestically for enforcement of civil or
regulatory law when administrative agencies have overlapping, and thus redundant, [*847] jurisdiction over the same
regulated activities. '4 The most important version of this model in the United States, however, is criminal justice federalism.

Uncommon Ground

Hillary has often said that this is the hardest job she’s ever had. It’s
not just the constant travel but also the speed and range of the issues
she must master. She finds being secretary of state even more taxing
than the 2008 campaign, where she could go on autopilot and give
the same speech six times in a day, and had heard all the questions
before. “With each month there’s more wear and tear,” says Jake
Sullivan, a young lawyer and former Rhodes scholar, who has
emerged as one of her closest advisers. “But she also gets more
energized and comfortable.” A half-dozen of her friends agree that
they have never seen her more in her element. “She seems engaged,
happy, focused, determined, and very tired from all the travel,”
observes Tom Vilsack, an early supporter from his days as governor
of Iowa, who is now the secretary of agriculture. “I can’t remember
her ever working this much,” says Dr. Irwin Redlener, who has
advised her for many years on children’s issues.

Despite running against each other, the president and secretary of
state have a lot in common in the way their minds work—more,
arguably, than either has in common with Bill Clinton. Staffers have
noticed that both Obama and Hillary are methodical, secure, and
human-scale when you talk to them; they’re deductive thinkers who
drill down into a problem. The former president, by contrast, is
discursive, needy, and larger-than-life; he’s an inductive thinker with
a connective mind.

Of course, the sense of order and discipline that Obama and Hillary
share belies significant differences that may yet re-emerge. Hillary
long ago instructed staffers not to look back to the bitter 2008
primaries or criticize Obama, and for the most part they don’t. But
late at night, when they’re safely distant from “the seventh floor” (the
mahogany-lined part of the State Department where Hillary and the
other power players work), aides complain that Hillary’s creative

SUSAN SHIRK

Although I have no problem with the factual research that has gone into specific sections
of the report, I respectfully dissent from what I see as the report’s overall inflated
assessment of the current threat of Chinese influence seeking on the United States. The
report discusses a very broad range of Chinese activities, only some of which constitute
coercive, covert, or corrupt interference in American society and none of which actually
undermines our democratic political institutions. Not distinguishing the legitimate from
the illegitimate activities detracts from the credibility of the report. The cumulative effect
of this expansive inventory that blurs together legitimate with illegitimate activities is to
overstate the threat that China today poses to the American way of life. Especially during
this moment in American political history, overstating the threat of subversion from

China risks causing overreactions reminiscent of the Cold War with the Soviet Union,
including an anti-Chinese version of the Red Scare that would put all ethnic Chinese under
a cloud of suspicion. Right now, I believe the harm we could cause our society by our own
overreactions actually is greater than that caused by Chinese influence seeking. That is why
I feel I must dissent from the overall threat assessment of the report.

ry. Finally, due to the
high volume of prostitution-related crimes, the Federal government lacks the necessary resources
and capacity to prosecute these offenses.

Therefore, to the extent that thi

DOJ also opposes subsection (g), which would expand the sex tourism offenses to
include those who travel for purposes of illicit sexual activity with adults. The Department’s
current efforts with regard to extraterritorial offenses focus on child sex tourism, which are very
demanding and resource-intensive cases, requiring gathering evidence abroad, bringing victims
to the United States to testify, and coordination with foreign law enforcement agencies and
foreign governments generally, among other matters. Any expansion of authority would be a
distraction from those priority cases and would exacerbate existing burdens on investigation and
prosecution.

The Department believes that the addition of 18 U.S.C. § 2423 is unnecessary and that
18 U.S.C. § 2423 does not need to be amended.

Should Congress create 18 U.S.C. § 2423A, DOJ believes that language should be
retained in 18 U.S.C. § 2423(e) that allows the Government to charge attempt or conspiracy for
18 U.S.C. § 2423{a) crimes. Finally, DOJ notes that the definition of illicit sexual conduct
needs to be updated to include production of child pornography.

18. Section 222

AS a general matter, the Department opposes the expansion of jurisdiction over offenses
involving non-American offenders or victims that are committed outside the United States. The
expansion of jurisdiction in this section would place an enormous strain on available resources.
In addition, this new section’s jurisdiction description overlaps with 18 U.S.C. § 3271. Should
the choice be made to keep the jurisdictional provisions provided for in this section, perhaps it
would be more effective to expand section 3271.

19, Section 223

These provisions are not directly related to trafficking. As this section is related to aliens
brought into the country for the purposes of prostitution, without a showing of force, fraud, or
coercion, and the International Marriage Brokers Act (IMBRA), this bill is not the vehicle for
this language. Furthermore, subsection (a)(1) removes the requirement from section 278 of the
Immigration and Nationality Act that such conduct be done in furtherance of the importation of
the alien. By removing this requirement, the bill extends the statute to cover all instances of
“pimping” an alien.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026500.txt,"It's possible, of course, that we won’t need a third-party candidate. Trump could decide not to run for
whatever reason. The Democrats could nominate a winning 2020 candidate. I am not willing to take

those bets.

The ideal candidate for a new third party is someone who is widely perceived to be that rare combination
of both good and great. We are looking for a proven leader of men and women, someone with clear,
democratic — and moral — values that reflect the best of America, not our worst. We know people like this

on the national stage now.

As a thought experiment, consider the possibilities of a ticket outside the partisan lanes and imagine the
chemistry of radical combinations: Biden/Romney? Bill Gates/Hogan? Bloomberg/Haley? Howard
Schultz/Bob Corker? Sandberg/Kasich?

As we have discussed narrow path to electing the first president outside the two major party primary
system in 168 years is more navigable than most think. Heading into 2020, converging trends in
American’s demands for a third party (a historic high of 61%), disapproval of Donald Trump holding
steady above 50%, and the increasingly leftward drift of the Democratic Party suggest that electorate may
be susceptible to merits of a new centrist party. Cynics will say that the structural impediments of ballot
and presidential debate access, the overwhelming advantages of legacy parties’ fundraising and voter
turn-out operations preordain failure, but they’re wrong; the legal and logistical hurdles are amenable to a
combination of lawyering and resources. The bigger, more consequential factors come in terms of
candidate quality and policy. I believe a candidate with five specific characteristics including a unique —

and purposefully non-specific - policy agenda could limbo a win.

e This is what I think a successful third-party candidate looks like; a dream third party ticket would
start off with enough name ID to be an instant contender. Building the name ID to run nationally is
just too long and expensive of a process to accomplish in the 28 months until the next presidential
election. We can’t beat a celebrity without some celebrity of our own, whether from politics,

sports, business, or entertainment. Instantaneous name ID is so crucial because the candidate must

Repatriation

Repatriation likely under both Blueprint and Trump plans

Mandatory tax on overseas profits of 8.75% under Blueprint, 10% under Trump
The US currently operates under a tax system in which the domestic earnings of US
corporates are taxed at the federal US corporate rate (35%) and any overseas earnings
that are repatriated are taxed at this rate less a credit for foreign taxes paid on those
same earnings. Many multinationals’ foreign earnings thus remain parked offshore,
allowing corporations to avoid the tax hit associated with bringing them back to the US.
Both Trump and the House (under Ryan) have proposed a mandatory tax of overseas
earnings of US firms’ foreign subsidiaries at reduced rates, such that this cash can be
brought back and put to work in the US. This differs from the 2004 repatriation tax
holiday, which was optional.

Under the Blueprint, accumulated overseas earnings will be subject to a transition tax of
8.75%! (for those held in cash/cash equivalents) or 3.5% (for all other holdings), with
companies able to pay the tax liability over an eight-year period. This would be part of
broader tax reform, where a proposed territorial tax system would exempt companies’
foreign income from US taxes and prevent future buildup of overseas profits as
companies would be free to bring them home. Trump’s plan calls for a one-time deemed
repatriation of overseas corporate profits at a 10% tax rate.

Table 6: Blueprint vs. Trump tax plans for taxing offshore earnings of US firms’ foreign subsidiaries

Plan Tax rate on accumulated overseas earnings
Blueprint 8.75% for cash/cash equivalents, 3.5% of all other holdings
Trump tax plan 10%

Source: donaldjtrump.com, abetterway.speaker.gov

The Tax Policy Center estimates that a repatriation tax holiday would generate
approximately $150bn in tax receipts under Trump’s plan (over 10 years) and $140bn

' Note: The effective tax rates of 8.75% and 3.5% under the Blueprint are based on an allowable deduction of 75% (for
deferred earnings held in cash/liquid assets) or 90% (for the non-cash portion), with the remainder taxed at the US
corporate tax rate, Le. 35%(1-75%) = 8.75% and 35%(1-90%) = 3.5%. This methodology was proposed by Dave Camp’s
(former chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means) Tax Reform Act of 2014.

The question I’m most often asked about my classroom teaching is how the students have
changed and how the teaching of law has changed during the 50 years I have been at Harvard.

The change in the student body has been dramatic. The vast majority of our students are no
longer the white American males that dominated the classroom in the early 1960s. Nearly half the
class is comprised of women, about a quarter of the class of racial and ethnic minorities, and
approximately 10% from foreign countries. This increased diversity brings with it a wide range of
viewpoints and experiences that enrich the class discussion.

Today’s students are also older, with more work experience. They come to the classroom with
firm, if not always clear, views of who they are and what they want to be. They are not the naive,
sycophantic, uncritical consumers that characterized my generation of students right out of
college. This is all good, because it makes teaching them more challenging.

Equally important has been the globalization of law over the past quarter decade. When I began
teaching, all law, like all politics, was local. Today, virtually all law is global. A typical case that
comes across my desk and that I now teach about is as follows:

A man born in Israel becomes a British citizen and moves to Houston where he works for
a multinational firm which allegedly paid a bribe to an African prince from one country to
build a gas facility in another African country using French funds transmitted from a Swiss
bank. The person is now in Canada and the United States and Great Britain are both
seeking his extradition. The laws of each of the countries differ considerably as to what
constitutes a bribe, as distinguished from a proper or merely unethical payment. The laws
of each country also differ as to the propriety of preparing witnesses and gathering
evidence.

A lawyer confronting this kind of case must know how to deal with these transnational problems.
Law schools have traditionally offered courses in international law, teaching the students about
international tribunals and treaties. The source of problems confronted today are not decided by
international law or international courts. They are transnational, rather than international, in
nature and require an ability to navigate the very different terrains of many nations’ legal systems.

Among the areas of law in which political and legal boundaries are frequently crossed, are:
internet law, environmental law, antitrust law, corporate law, criminal law and many newly
emerging fields of law. We are just beginning to teach our students how to practice in this global
environment. We must do more if we are to stay ahead of major changes and prepare our
students to be great lawyers through the middle of the 21* Century.

I have been privileged to teach nearly 10,000 students over my half century career as a law
professor. Among the students I have taught, mentored, advised and encountered have been
Presidents, Supreme Court justices, judges, senators, congressmen, corporate CEO, deans,
professors, university presidents, journalists and other movers and shakers. With the privileges of
teaching tomorrow’s world leaders comes enormous responsibilities. Among these
responsibilities is not to use the classroom to propagandize one’s captive audience. My goal is
not to turn conservatives into liberals, but to make conservatives more thoughtful conservatives,

Organiser: Ghislaine Maxwell looks on as Andrew put his arm around Virginia. Robert Maxwell's daughter
k as E i

invited her to ersonal masseuse soon after her 15th birthday
We kissed on the cheek and Ghislaine placed me on his other knee.’ Johanna spoke to The Mail on
Sunday three years ago about this incident, which took place when she was 21.

She said: ‘Ghislaine put the puppet’s hand on Virginia's breast, then Andrew put his hand on my
breast. It was a great joke. Everybody laughed.’ After this, Virginia was paid, by Epstein, around
$400 (£250).’

She met Andrew for the third and final time on Epstein’s Caribbean island, Little Saint James.
Virginia was never under the British legal age of consent when she met Andrew. She was 17 during
the first two encounters and 18 at the third.

By now, however, Epstein, had started to hint that she was getting ‘too old’ for him.

But during one trip to the island, Epstein and Ghislaine made their most astonishing proposition, and
one which repulsed her. ‘They said Jeffrey wanted me to have his child,’ she says.

‘They said | was part of their family and | was beautiful,young, loyal and nurturing and would be a
great mother.

They said | would have to sign a contract relinquishing rights to the child and consenting to Jeffrey
having as many relationships as he liked. In return | would have my own mansion in Palm Beach
and a large monthly payment, a percentage of his income.’

This, finally, was a wake-up call to Virginia and she began to see the way in which she had been
groomed.

‘It was a smack in the face,’ she says. ‘I finally realised this wasn’t ever going to be a real
relationship but | knew if | refused, I'd be thrown back on the streets. So | said, “I'm too yaung. |
want to get my massage credentials, then maybe we'll do it”.’

The tycoon took her at her word and, for her 19th birthday in August 2002, flew her to Thailand
where he enrolled her in a massage course.

Shortly after arriving there, she met an Australian martial arts expert called Robert. They fell in love
and, just ten days later, married in a Buddhist ceremony.

‘| cailed Jeffrey and told him I'd fallen madly in love,’ Virginia says. ‘| was hoping he’d be delighted.
But he said, “Have a nice life,” and hung up on me.’ The couple now have two sons, aged five and
four, and a daughter who recently turned one.

‘The first few months ajter | married Robert were the worst,’ she says. ‘I couldn’t bring myself to tell
him much. No man wants to know his wife has been traded out.

‘I felt very alone. | was having panic attacks and seeing a psychiatrist and was on anti-depressants.

‘ Virginia was beginning to put her Epstein days behind her when, three years ago, she was phoned
by the FBI.

this is a bad thing. Not telling — an omission — indirectly can cause harm. This is the situation that has
confronted the Catholic Church over the past twenty years.

During the tenures of Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI, some 4,000 priests sexually abused
some 10,000 innocent children. This is unquestionably an underestimate. This is excessive harm. Popes
John Paul Il and Benedict XVI, together with their cardinals and bishops, assumed the role of bystanders.
They were aware of the rampant cases of child rape among the clergy. They could have acted. Their
omissions are archetypal examples of the sin of sloth. By omission, they are responsible for excessive
harm and should be held legally accountable. This process has begun as evidenced by the decision in
October of 2011 to indict Bishop Robert Finn for failing to report a priest who took pornographic
photographs of young girls. Though Finn was only charged with a misdemeanor, this case opens opens a
legal floodgate. It is an opening that should allow prosecutors, around the globe, to indict bishops,
cardinals, and the Pope for evil omissions. It should empower the parents and children who have suffered
to rise up and demand justice for allowing excessive harm to occur. It should cause everyone to express
outrage over the fact that allowing priests to rape innocent children perpetuates a cycle of pedophiles as
those who have been abused are likely to abuse others. The leaders of the church have not only commited

a crime of omission, but have helped perpetuate a culture of harm.

Steve Bannon trying to get on disgraced 
Jeffrey Epstein's good side 
By Emily Smith 
Steve Bannon shared a secret meeting with reviled billionaire pedophile Jeffrey -Epstein 
at the financier's notorious Upper East Side mansion. 
Former White House chief strategist Bannon was spotted stepping out of his SUV and 
entering the registered sex offender's sprawling 21,000-square-foot mansion at 9 E. 71st 
St. shortly before 7 a.m. Wednesday. 
Epstein's -palatial pad is one of his homes where young_girls were allegedly brought in to 
perform massages and used as sex slaves. 
We assume Bannon wasn't there for a massage. 
Sources speculate that the disgraced -Epstein wants to use his millions to work his way 
close to political power again. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026314 
One told us, Bannon needs money to bankroll his political agenda. Epstein has plenty of 
money, and craves power and access. 
Bannon made an early-morning beeline to Epstein, even though Bannon may have 
burned bridges when he savaged Ivanka Trump over her criticism of Roy Moore, whom 
Bannon backed despite claims the candidate had sexually harassed teens. Citing an 
allegation in -legal papers from a woman (who later dropped her lawsuit) that Donald 
Trump and Epstein had raped her when she was 13, Bannon said in response to Ivanka, 
What about the allegations about her dad and that 13-year-old? 
Epstein has previously used his millions to cultivate the world's most powerful — but has 
mostly given money to Democrats. 
From 2001 to 2003, Bill Clinton flew on Epstein's private plane, dubbed The Lolita 
Express, 26 times. Epstein is close to Prince Andrew and was a regular at Trump's Mar-
a-Lago. 
Trump told New York magazine of Epstein in 2002, Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be 
with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are 
on the younger side. 
Epstein, 65, pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from a teen and served 13 
months in jail. 
Last year, he reportedly paid millions to settle three lawsuits filed against him by teens. 
Bannon's rep didn't comment. A lawyer for Epstein said, Let me ask him, but didn't 
respond by deadline.

pattern found in his handwriting features, however, resembled those Johnnie
Unitas, the Hall of Fame quarterback of the Baltimore (then) Colts who, in spite of
his small size, famously played with great courage and physical toughness. In
chronic and severe back pain, he played regularly until retirement in his early 40’s.
Fouts drafted in the third round with a small five-figure bonus, proved to be a great
bargain for the Charger franchise.

Given the theoretically infinite number of ways that a personality can be, it is
remarkable that the latest Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American
Psychiatric Association, DMS-IV, describes only eight types, which form three
subsets of exaggerated expressions of stable personality styles called personality
disorders. All eight personality disorders can be grouped into: (1) Cluster A - Odd
and eccentric types, whose anxiety is related to the felt threat of disintegration and
annihilation of the self and whose style is dominated by mistrustful paranoia, a
schizoid, detached and emotionally flat pattern or the isolated strange eccentricism
of schizotypal characters, (2) Cluster B - Unstable and impulsive types whose
anxiety is related to loss of the stable self and whose style is dominated by
irresponsible antisocial behavior, chronic instability with high amplitude fluctuations
in behavior called borderline, or patterns of excessive emotionality and dramatic
display associated with histrionic characters; and (3) Cluster C - Fearful types
whose anxiety is related to hypersensitivity to criticism, guilt and feelings of
inadequacy or loss of control, and whose style is dominated by interpersonal
avoidance, clinging dependency, or rigid lock up into obsessive-compulsive efforts
to do the right thing and avoid disapproval. This remarkably small array of
stylistically consistent global behaviors selected from a practically infinite number of
imaginable possibilities establishes a small set of invariants of some, perhaps
abstract, property. These characteristic patterns inspire our search for the implied

brain and behavioral conservation laws that may underlie them.

"

a per meet -- I told him that was too low and quoted him $1,000, and he said he'd meet
me in the middle. Another guy told me that he would just slip $400 into my purse when
he saw me, and that's exactly what he did.

I have one client I've never explicitly discussed money with at all. I had lunch with him,
and we didn't negotiate anything, though we talked a little bit about our reasons for being
on the site. The next time I saw him -- we were deciding where to meet, and he asked if
he should get us a room. I said that I would like that, so I met him and we had sex. He
knew it was my birthday soon, so as we were getting dressed, he said, I know we haven't
talked about money, so I got you some birthday spending money, and he handed me an
envelope with $400. The next time I saw him, he asked about my plans for the evening. I
said I was having dinner with a friend, and he handed me $400 in an envelope and said,
Maybe this will help pay for it. I'm lucky that I'm willing to accept $400 -- it's my
lower bound, but I'm willing to accept it. Imagine if I hadn't been willing to take $400 --
that would be super awkward. Probably I should have negotiated that situation more
clearly, but it worked out okay.

I've heard about situations where unclear negotiations did not work out okay. There was a
New York Times Magazine article about the site published in 2009. In that article, there
were some examples of unclear negotiations that didn't work out well. But it sounded like
that woman didn't really know what she wanted, and didn't really enjoy the work. But I
do. And I know other women who do, too.

I have a new client who paid me $3,000 up front to see me 3 times a month. But I haven't
heard from him since our first meeting. If I were his girlfriend, I'd call him, but he asked
me not to call him. So I don't really know what the deal with that one is. Maybe he's
gonna flake out on me, but he already gave me $3,000, so that would be weird.

Clarisse Thorn: So, your husband. You mentioned him briefly. How does your
husband feel about this?

Olivia: He does not seem particularly threatened. We already have an open relationship. I
think he sometimes feels very visceral jealousy, but that's just like any other time one of
us has sex with somebody else. We just have to talk about it.

Part of the deal here is that I'm doing this because I'm broke. My husband really wants to
be able to support me financially, but he can't right now, so I'm supporting both us doing
this. I think that's a real blow to his ego. To the extent that he gets bothered, I think it's
because I'm allowing other men to support me and give me money; he doesn't care about
the sex. Even though I see this as work, he sees this as here's this rich successful guy
who just gave my wife a bunch of money, and she slept with him -- so probably she's
attracted to him.

I am kind of attracted to my clients, and I kind of get off on making them happy, and I
happen to think that the age difference is kind of hot. I like having sex with them; it's not
unpleasant. I like hearing about these guys’ life stories. I think it's interesting. But these
guys would never be a threat to my husband. I would never be sleeping with any of them
except for the money. And I love my husband. I'm always very up front about the fact

clients that are saying that exact same thing right now, your
Honor.

MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, could we do the 13th, the
Thursday of that week?

THE COURT: Yes. I don't see any reason not to.
Okay.

MS. McCAWLEY: That's all I had, your Honor. Thank
you. And thank you for your patience, everyone, today.

THE COURT: Have we completed the briefing and

everything everybody wants to submit

on the black book issue?

MS. McCAWLEY: Well, yes, your Honor. So now, as of
last night, it was fully briefed. So there are three briefs on
it, essentially. We had a motion in limine to allow it in,

they had a motion in limine to exclude it,

and it came up

previously -- I forget, we argued it a couple weeks ago in the
context of another motion -- oh, I'm sorry, because, your
Honor, you requested that with respect to Diane Flores. So we
didn't reargue it today, it is fully briefed for you.

THE COURT: Okay. In other words, I've got everything
on that.

MS. McCAWLEY: You do, your Honor, yes.

THE COURT: Okay. Anything else?

MS. McCAWLEY: Not that I'm aware of.

MR. PAGLIUCA: I think we're concluded today, your
Honor. Thank you.

regime had opted to fight, insisting that all its members were united:
“We will sit here. We call it a fight until the end.” He also issued a
transparent threat: “They should know when we suffer, we will not
suffer alone.”

Some have suggested that the two messages reveal a split in the
Syrian regime. That’s not convincing. The messages were not that
different, and to put Shaaban on the same level as Makhlouf is
absurd. Shaaban is viewed as a spokesman for the president, but she
plays no central role in the Assad-Makhlouf constellation. She
doubtless needed a green light to go ahead with the interview, one
that required some measure of approval by Makhlouf and Assad’s
younger brother Maher, both of whom have taken an eradication
approach to the protests. Makhlouf, in turn, needed no authorization
whatsoever.

What Shaaban said was likely intended to be interpreted in the United
States as a marginally soft statement by Bashar Assad. In contrast,
Makhlouf offered the harsher alternative if the president’s approach
was rejected by the international community. It was a classic good
cop, bad cop routine, and those familiar with Syrian manners will be
little surprised by the ploy. That’s why it seems far-fetched to assume
that we are witnessing a fundamental rift in Syria’s ruling family.
The reason for this is that there is no serious alternative to what the
Assads and the Makhloufs are doing today. They can either stand
together behind repression, or fall apart. That’s hardly to justify the
regime’s butchery of hundreds of unarmed civilians. Rather, it’s to
affirm that the Syrian leadership is incapable of undertaking anything
different. There simply is no reform option, and there never was.
Genuine reform means dislodging the bricks holding up Assad-
Makhlouf authority. Bashar Assad’s open-ended presidency, the
crony capitalism practiced by his cousin and other members of
Syria’s elite, the abuse practiced by the all-powerful security services,

Philanthropy: the givers club
Cordelia Jenkins — Livemint and the Wall Street Journal

On Friday, around 60 prospective philanthropists attended the “First Givers Club” summit in Delhi run by the online
philanthropic donation forum Givelndia. While the club has existed in Mumbai since 2010, said Dnaval Udani, Givelndia’s
CEO, this was their first foray into the capital city. Mint was the media partner of the event.

“With this club, we wanted to create a platform for like-minded individuals to build a community of donors who share
knowledge and vision; it will also help to facilitate giving effectively,” Udani told his audience. “Our aim is to help you get
more exposure and awareness of the different aspects of philanthropy; over the last three years this club has helped
channel more than Rs.18 crore to the lives of more than 10,000 underprivileged in India.”

Rakesh Bharti Mittal, vice-chairman and managing director of Bharti Enterprises, along with speakers Anu Aga of Thermax
and Amit Chandra of Bain Capital gave their perspectives on how and where to give effectively and on the future of Indian
philanthropy. Edited excerpts:

Rakesh Mittal set up the Satya Bharti school programmes in 2006. The aim was to set up 500 primary and 50 secondary
schools of its own with a corpus of Rs.200 crore. After that, state governments began reaching out and Bharti began
adopting government schools, creating a public-private partnership in delivering quality education to rural children.

“Given the new companies Bill, which has been passed by Parliament, | assume within the next two three months the rules
will be finalized; there is going to be a mad rush for seeking funding. Already, | get a letter every other day for supporting a
cause...If | see corporates have been very powerful instruments and drivers of philanthropy, this comes from the wider
wealth creation and management role which they do in their businesses. Today they are looking at doing more beyond
business, not because the government is forcing them, but because we cannot have islands of wealth. You cannot take this
country forward if we are just worried about what | have and what | need for me and my family, and the ecosystem and the
society around is crumbling. This country will not move forward.”

“If | go back a few centuries giving had been a very rich tradition; it used to be that 10% of your income would be kept aside
for a cause. During those times more money went into either building temples or temples of learning, which are the schools
and colleges. Pre-1990, Indian corporates were not giving that much, including the individuals, and there was a reason
because we did not have sustainable wealth creation opportunities, either for ourselves, our families, or our large
stakeholders as we were running the companies.

“This all changed in the post-1991 year of liberalization. In the last two decades, more and more, new age economies moved
this country to prosperous economic growth and suddenly you saw people wanting to give back to society because now you
have a model which was creating sustainable wealth for yourself.”

“There are individuals who may give money and their time, but there are also entrepreneurs, young entrepreneurs who
produce products which are low in cost but make a huge impact for the people who use it. This is the brief India is looking at
in the landscape today and this will be a stepping stone for the future.”

“Giving at Bharti has always been part of our DNA, it was always our endeavour to make a difference. At the beginning, in
the mid-70s, we were more interested in creating businesses which could impact society at large. If | look at telecom, retail,
agri and food processing we wanted to make a difference and not a buck. In 2000 we set up Bharti Foundation with the sole
objective of supporting the youth of India and enabling the underprivileged to come and compete with anyone.

“We started writing cheques and one day | felt that was not the purpose, the fact is there are 320 million children in the age of

6-16, we talk of demographic dividend—absolutely yes, if we nurture this potential, but if we don’t do justice to these children
there is a disaster which is waiting to happen.

role of feedback in machine learning, but he missed the key role of representation. It’s
not possible to store all possible images in a self-driving car, or all possible sounds in a
conversational computer; they have to be able to generalize from experience. The “deep”
part of deep learning refers not to the (hoped-for) depth of insight but to the depth of the
mathematical network layers used to make predictions. It turned out that a linear increase
in network complexity led to an exponential increase in the expressive power of the
network.

If you lose your keys in a room, you can search for them. If you’re not sure
which room they’re in, you have to search all the rooms in a building. If you’re not sure
which building they’re in, you have to search all the rooms in all the buildings in a city.
If you’re not sure which city they’re in, you have to search all the rooms in all the
buildings in all the cities. In AI, finding the keys corresponds to things like a car safely
following the road, or a computer correctly interpreting a spoken command, and the
rooms and buildings and cities correspond to all of the options that have to be considered.
This is called the curse of dimensionality.

The solution to the curse of dimensionality came in using information about the
problem to constrain the search. The search algorithms themselves are not new. But
when applied to a deep-learning network, they adaptively build up representations of
where to search. The price of this is that it’s no longer possible to exactly solve for the
best answer to a problem, but typically all that’s needed is an answer that’s good enough.

Taken together, it shouldn’t be surprising that these scaling laws have allowed
machines to become effectively as capable as the corresponding stages of biological
complexity. Neural networks started out with a goal of modeling how the brain works.
That goal was abandoned as they evolved into mathematical abstractions unrelated to
how neurons actually function. But now there’s a kind of convergence that can be
thought of as forward- rather than reverse-engineering biology, as the results of deep
learning echo brain layers and regions.

One of the most difficult research projects P ve managed paired what we’d now
call data scientists with AI pioneers. It was a miserable experience in moving goalposts.
As the former progressed in solving long-standing problems posed by the latter, this was
deemed to not count because it wasn’t accompanied by corresponding leaps in
understanding the solutions. What’s the value of a chess-playing computer if you can’t
explain how it plays chess?

The answer of course is that it can play chess. There is interesting emerging
research that is applying AI to AI—that is, training networks to explain how they operate.
But both brains and computer chips are hard to understand by watching their inner
workings; they’re easily interpreted only by observing their external interfaces. We come
to trust (or not) brains and computer chips alike based on experience that tests them
rather than on explanations for how they work.

Many branches of engineering are making a transition from what’s called
imperative to declarative or generative design. This means that instead of explicitly
designing a system with tools like CAD files, circuit schematics, and computer code, you
describe what you want the system to do and then an automated search is done for
designs that satisfy your goals and restrictions. This approach becomes necessary as
design complexity exceeds what can be understood by a human designer. While that

IMAGES-012-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_033380.txt,"The Trump administration’s friendly and intensive contacts with the Orban government represent a radical
departure: It watches idly as Orban dismantles his nation’s democratic institutions. For instance, the pro-
government weekly Figyelo recently issued an enemies list of about 200 prominent opposition individuals. Most
were local civil society advocates, but the list also included U.S. citizens, many of them scholars of economics,
Judaism and nationalism at the Soros-funded Central European University (such as Leon Botstein and Allen
Feldman). The government has erected contrived legal barriers in an effort to close the institution, a graduate
school devoted to liberal values and based in Budapest. Meanwhile, Hungary harassed the U.S.-based Open Society
Foundations until they decided to move their operations from Budapest to Berlin. Two Hungarian newspapers,
Magyar Nemzet and Budapest Beacon , shut down this spring as advertisers vanished because of their opposition
to the Hungarian government, leaving only one print opposition daily.

The State Department and the U.S. Embassy in Budapest have remained almost entirely silent about all of this.
The compliant new U.S. approach was initially discussed at a Dec. 18, 2017, meeting of the National Security
Council’s policy coordinating committee led by Fiona Hill, the council’s senior director for European and Russian
affairs, and Assistant Secretary Mitchell, according to two sources familiar with the proceedings. They concluded
that previous efforts under the Bush administration, and especially the Obama administration, had not paid off, so
it was time to try something else.

Accordingly, the first high-level meeting between the two sides took place at the White House on May 15, when John
Bolton, Trump’s national security adviser, received Jeno Megyesy, Orban’s chief adviser on the United States.
(Megyesy was also the official point of contact for then-Trump aide Carter Page’s meetings in Budapest during the
campaign.) This coming week, Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto is scheduled to meet Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo; although Szijjarto has visited Washington an eye-popping seven times in the past 18 months, this will be
the first such high-level bilateral meeting since 2012. The only step left would be for Trump to receive Orban — the
first European head of government to endorse Trump over Hillary Clinton and congratulate him on his victory — at
the White House.

What, if anything, is the United States getting from Hungary for this appeasement? The $12 billion Russian-financed
and secretly signed Russian Paks II nuclear plant in southern Hungary is one reflection of Orban’s Russian
orientation. (Orban previously welcomed energy investments from the now-failed Russian South Stream pipeline.)
Hungary spends only 1 percent of its gross domestic product on defense, among the lowest levels for NATO
members, despite Trump’s insistence that nations step up their payments. (Budapest said last year that it would
increase spending, but it has said this many times before.)

Many intelligent Hungarians — watching the complicity, or at least inaction, of the U.S. government — do not
understand what is happening, they tell us. They know that Trump wants to be different from Barack Obama,
including in his approach to Hungary. But they search in vain for logic in Trump’s posture. For those who still believe
in the merits of a Western-style democracy there, which is a large majority in Budapest and a large minority in the
countryside, the policy of appeasement signifies abandonment. They would like Washington to keep hope alive.
People who suffer from, or are ashamed by, the government’s anti-Semitic discourse and attacks on liberal norms
long for a different America.

And there may be one. David Cornstein, the new U.S. ambassador to Hungary, who will arrive in Budapest in a few
weeks, might make a difference. In his appearance before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in early May, he
spoke eloquently about promoting American values. He promised to fight against anti-Semitism, not just in Hungary
but elsewhere in Europe, too. His nice, old-fashioned remarks were even cleared by the State Department and the
U.S. Embassy in Budapest. He received strong expressions of support from Republican and Democratic senators,
including Sen. Benjamin Cardin (D-Md.), who is something of an expert on Hungarian politics. There is still hope,
then, that decent, humane values will be heard by Hungarians who, in search of answers, continue to look to the
United States.

stringent conditions—which Mr. Weinstein could only have learned from FAUSA
Sloman, AUSA Villafana or United States Attorney Acosta himself.

46. AUSA Weinstein then asked why Mr. Epstein should ... be treated differently than
anyone else. Mr. Thomas apparently stated that he understood that there was evidence
that the women had lied about their ages. AUSA Weinstein replied that this was not a
defense and that Mr. Thomas should not believe “the spin” of Mr. Epstein’s “high-priced
attorneys.” Indeed, Mr. Weinstein told Mr. Thomas that the USAO was very concerned
about a Palm Beach editorial that questioned whether Mr. Epstein would receive a rich
man’s justice. AUSA Weinstein then stated that, in fact, Mr. Epstein “doesn’t have a
defense.”

47. Mr. Epstein’s attorneys learned of the call and complained to the USAO. Counsel for
Mr. Epstein then had an in-person meeting with FAUSA Sloman and United States
Attorney Acosta describing these leaks to the New York Times. During Mr. Thomas’ next
call to the USAO, made two weeks later, AUSA Weinstein “admonished” him (in the
words of Mr. Thomas) for disclosing the contents of their prior conversation to the
defense, and strongly “reminded” Mr. Thomas that AUSA Weinstein’s prior comments
about Mr. Epstein had only been “hypothetical” in nature. That claim is sheer nonsense:
AUSA Weinstein had disclosed specific details of Mr. Epstein’s case, including plea
terms proposed by the defense, as revealed based on Mr. Thomas’s own
contemporaneous hand-written notes.

48. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Sloman wrote to the defense that Mr. Thomas was given, pursuant
to his request, non-case specific information concerning specific federal statutes.” See
Tab 37, February 27, 2008 Email from J. Sloman. Again, that claim was utterly false;
Mr. Thomas’s contemporaneous hand-written notes, reviewed by Jay Lefkowitz, confirm
that the USAO had violated settled Department policy and ethical rules by providing
case-specific information about the Department’s legal theories and plea negotiations.

Conclusion

We bring these difficult and delicate matters of misconduct to your attention not to
require any disciplinary action or review by the Office of Professional Responsibility. Although
we have been told that some of this misconduct has been self-reported (only after we raised these
complaints in writing), we feel confident that not all the facts were adequately presented. Rather,
we believe that they are highly relevant to your decision whether to authorize a federal
prosecution in this case. This pattern of overzealous prosecutorial activity strongly suggests
improper motives in targeting Jeffrey Epstein, not because of his actions (which are more
appropriately the subject of state prosecution), but, rather, because of who he is and who he
knows. We also bring this pervasive pattern of misconduct to your attention because we believe
it taints any ongoing federal prosecution. The misconduct pervades the evidence in this case.
The offers of financial inducement to witnesses, improperly encouraged by the government,
make their potential testimony suspect. The reliance on tainted evidence gathered by the state
will require a careful sorting out of poisonous fruits.

The State...may not proceed by racial classification to force strict population
equivalencies for every group in every occupation, overriding individual preferences. The
Equal Protection Clause commands the elimination of racial barriers, not their creation in
order to satisfy our theory as to how society ought to be organized. The purpose of the
University of Washington cannot be to produce black lawyers for blacks, Polish lawyers
for Poles, Jewish lawyers for Jews, Irish lawyers for Irish. It should be to produce good
lawyers for Americans...

Justice Douglas’ dissenting views quickly became the standard approach of old fashioned liberals
committed to Martin Luther King’s dream of a color blind America where every student was
judged “not by the color of their skin” but rather by their individual achievements in light of the
barriers they have had to overcome.

I became an active advocate for an aggressive affirmative action program at Harvard based on

non-racial criteria. I participated in numerous campus and faculty meeting debates, and believed
that I was on the side of the angels, favoring a system that would produce real diversity without
violating the racial equality mandate of the constitution. And I had Justice Douglas on my side!

But not every liberal accepted Justice Douglas’ race-neutral approach. Many Black leaders saw
the issue not as one of individual rights, but rather as one of group aspirations. Blacks had a
collective right, under thus view, to “reasonable representation” in the student bodies of
universities and other institutions, both public and private. Some went so far as to argue for
“proportional representation.” This raised the spectre of “quotas,” which might limit the number
of those accepted or hired to their proportion of the population.

The fear of quotas or proportional representation increased as schools throughout the country
adopted affirmative action programs with many different elements. Some contained “targets” for
the number of admitted Blacks. Other had “floors.” Non black students who were denied
admissions to schools with such programs began to file lawsuits.

As these cases made their ways through the courts, a conflict arose between some leaders of the
African American and Jewish communities. Most African American leaders were deeply
committed to race-specific affirmative action programs that gave advantages to all Black
applicants, regardless of their individual backgrounds. Most colleges preferred this group
approach as well, since I was simpler and they preferred to admit wealthy, well educated, and
privileged Black candidates over poorer, less well educated and more “difficult” inner-city Blacks.
Derek Bok, first the Dean of Harvard Law School and then the president of Harvard University,
candidly acknowledged that it was far easier to integrate African American graduates of Groten,
Fieldston, and St. Paul’s into Harvard than it would be to integrate inner city public school
graduates. (GET BOK QUOTE)

Many Jewish leaders were worried that the hard-earned access of Jews to elite schools would be
endangered by what they regarded as “racial quotas”. They recalled, with bitterness, the “quotas”
that had limited Jewish applicants to single digit “Jewish places” in college and university
admissions. There is, of course, a difference between “floor quotas” and “ceiling quotas”. Blacks
were seeking a floor on the number of affirmative action admittees: no less than 10 or 15 percent.

Let us start by substituting the notes of the musical scale for the
letters of the alphabet to create a piece of ‘music. Since it is a direct
analogue of the word problem, we have created a non-computable piece
of music. It is definitely non-computable, but is it music? If it just looked
like a random jumble of notes it would be unconvincing, but luckily there
are many forms of music that look exactly like a word substitution puzzle.
Bach's Art of Fugue, the canons of Tudor composers such as William Byrd
and Thomas Tallis, and the works of Grieg all use sequences of chords
that move from one to the next using substitution rules. If you were to
listen to the steps in our word substitution music, they would definitely
sound musical. I think they should pass the main artistic criticism — that
they should not sound formulaic.

But is any actual human composition non-computable?
Unfortunately, we cannot prove whether a particular piece of Bach, Tallis
or Grieg is non-computable because we don't know the specific rules
used to compose it. All we know are the general musical principles of
harmony and counterpoint that applied at the time. We don’t have these
composers personal rule sets because they were held in their brain and
they are, of course, long since dead. It is statistically likely that most pieces
are non-computable because there are an uncountably infinite number
of them, whereas computable pieces are merely countably infinite. But
that’s just probability; it is no proof.

I puzzled for some time whether there is a way to prove it but had to
conclude it is impossible. However, and this is how creativity works, once
I had given up on the problem, my brain continued to work on it. I was
not conscious of this, I was only aware that failing to solve the problem
annoyed me. I then had a Eureka moment. Although I couldn't prove
a piece of music was non-computational, I could make one! - a piece
that could not have been created
using computation alone. This
requires me to inoculate your
brain.

Take either Andrew
Wiles proof of Fermat's Last
Theorem or Alan Turing’s proof
of the Halting Problem; both
proofs are non-computable.

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016298.txt,"Indeed, Wiener gave scientific teeth to the idea that in the workings of history,
politics, and society, ideas matter. Beliefs, ideologies, norms, laws, and customs, by
regulating the behavior of the humans who share them, can shape a society and power the
course of historical events as surely as the phenomena of physics affect the structure and
evolution of the solar system. To say that ideas—and not just weather, resources,
geography, or weaponry—can shape history is not woolly mysticism. It is a statement of
the causal powers of information instantiated in human brains and exchanged in networks
of communication and feedback. Deterministic theories of history, whether they identify
the causal engine as technological, climatological, or geographic, are belied by the causal
power of ideas. The effects of these ideas can include unpredictable lurches and
oscillations that arise from positive feedback or from miscalibrated negative feedback.

An analysis of society in terms of its propagation of ideas also gave Wiener a
guideline for social criticism. A healthy society—one that gives its members the means
to pursue life in defiance of entropy—allows information sensed and contributed by its
members to feed back and affect how the society is governed. A dysfunctional society
invokes dogma and authority to impose control from the top down. Wiener thus
described himself as “a participant in a liberal outlook,” and devoted most of the moral
and rhetorical energy in the book (both the 1950 and 1954 editions) to denouncing
communism, fascism, McCarthyism, militarism, and authoritarian religion (particularly
Catholicism and Islam) and to warning that political and scientific institutions were
becoming too hierarchical and insular.

Wiener’s book is also, here and there, an early exemplar of an increasingly
popular genre, tech prophecy. Prophecy not in the sense of mere prognostications but in
the Old Testament sense of dark warnings of catastrophic payback for the decadence of
one’s contemporaries. Wiener warned against the accelerating nuclear arms race, against
technological change that was imposed without regard to human welfare (“[W]e must
know as scientists what man’s nature is and what his built-in purposes are”), and against
what today is called the value-alignment problem: that “the machine like the djinnee,
which can learn and can make decisions on the basis of its learning, will in no way be
obliged to make such decisions as we should have made, or will be acceptable to us.” In
the darker, 1950 edition, he warned of a “threatening new Fascism dependent on the
machine a gouverner.”

Wiener’s tech prophecy harks back to the Romantic movement’s rebellion against
the “dark Satanic mills” of the Industrial Revolution, and perhaps even earlier, to the
archetypes of Prometheus, Pandora, and Faust. And today it has gone into high gear.
Jeremiahs, many of them (like Wiener) from the worlds of science and technology, have
sounded alarms about nanotechnology, genetic engineering, Big Data, and particularly
artificial intelligence. Several contributors to this volume characterize Wiener’s book as
a prescient example of tech prophecy and amplify his dire worries.

Yet the two moral themes of The Human Use of Human Beings—the liberal
defense of an open society and the dystopian dread of runaway technology—are in
tension. A society with channels of feedback that maximize human flourishing will have
mechanisms in place, and can adapt them to changing circumstances, in a way that can
domesticate technology to human purposes. There’s nothing idealistic or mystical about
this; as Wiener emphasized, ideas, norms, and institutions are themselves a form of
technology, consisting of patterns of information distributed across brains. The

Nor did Snowden’s breach begin with him handing over classified documents to the Guardian
reporters in Hong Kong in June 2013 or, for that matter, in the eleven days prior to his meeting
with journalists in 2013. He had, as the NSA quickly determined begun illicitly copying
documents in the late summer of 2012. Such an enterprise does not emerge from thin air. Even if
he had managed to elude American intelligence from late May to early June 2013, he could not
hide all the history that led to his decision to come to Hong Kong. There had to be an envelope
of reality surrounding it, including Snowden’s motivation, associates, movements, finances, and
his activities prior to his fleeing to Hong Kong. What was missing was not just Snowden’s first
11 days in Hong Kong but the entire context of the alleged crime. I now needed to fill in that
envelope of reality in America. I left Hong Kong for New York on June 2, 2014 two days after

my meeting with the former official of the consulate.

The Bora-Bora Dealmaker

BAFFIN ISLAND, NUNAVUT

J osh Steinitz44 stood at the edge of the world and stared in amazement. He dug his boots into the six
feet of sea ice and the unicorns danced.

Ten narwhals—rare cousins of the beluga—came to the surface and pointed their six-foot-plus spiral
tusks toward the heavens. The pod of 3,000-pound whales then fell into the depths once again. The
narwhals are deep divers—more than 3,000 feet in some cases—so Josh had at least 20 minutes until
their reappearance.

It seemed appropriate that he was with the narwhals. Their name came from Old Norse and referred to
their mottled white and blue skin.

Ndhvalr —corpse man.
He smiled as he had done often in the last few years. Josh himself was a dead man walking.

One year after graduating from college, Josh found out that he had oral squamous carcinoma—cancer.
He had plans to be a management consultant. He had plans to be lots of things. Suddenly none of it

mattered. Less than half of those who suffered from this particular type of cancer survived. The reaper
didn’t discriminate and came without warning.

It became clear that the biggest risk in life wasn’t making mistakes but regret: missing out on things.
He could never go back and recapture years spent doing something he disliked.

Two years later and cancer-free, Josh set off on an indefinite global walkabout, covering expenses as a
freelance writer. He later became the cofounder of a website that provides customized itineraries to
would-be vagabonds. His executive status didn’t lessen his mobile addiction. He was as comfortable
cutting deals from the over-water bungalows of Bora-Bora as he was in the log cabins of the Swiss Alps.

He once took a call from a client while at Camp Muir on Mt. Rainier. The client needed to confirm
some sales numbers and asked Josh about all the wind in the background. Josh’s answer: “I’m standing
at 10,000 feet on a glacier and this afternoon the wind is whipping us down the mountain.” The client
said he’d let Josh get back to what he was doing.

Another client called Josh while he was leaving a Balinese temple and heard the gongs in the
background. The client asked Josh if he was in church. Josh wasn’t quite sure what to say. All that came
out was, “Yes?”

Back among the narwhals, Josh had a few minutes before heading to base camp to avoid polar bears.
Twenty-four-hour daylight meant that he had much to share with his friends back in the land of cubicles.
He sat down on the ice and produced his satellite phone and laptop from a waterproof bag. He began his
e-mail in the usual way:

“I know youre all sick of seeing me have so much fun, but guess where I am?”

Bob Mercer is an ultimate quant, an engineer who designs investment algorithms and
became a co-CEO of one of the most successful hedge funds, Renaissance Technologies.
With his daughter, Rebekah, Mercer set up what is in effect a private Tea Party movement,
self-funding whatever Tea Party or alt-right project took their fancy. Bob Mercer is almost
nonverbal, looking at you with a dead stare and either not talking or offering only minimal
response. He had a Steinway baby grand on his yacht; after inviting friends and colleagues
on the boat, he would spend the time playing the piano, wholly disengaged from his
guests. And yet his political beliefs, to the extent they could be discerned, were generally
Bush-like, and his political discussions, to the extent that you could get him to be
responsive, were about issues involving ground game and data gathering. It was Rebekah
Mercer—who had bonded with Bannon, and whose politics were grim, unyielding, and
doctrinaire—who defined the family. “She’s ... like whoa, ideologically there is no
conversation with her,” said one senior Trump White House staffer.

With the death of Andrew Breitbart in 2012, Bannon, in essence holding the proxy of
the Mercers’ investment in the site, took over the Breitbart business. He leveraged his
gaming experience into using Gamergate—a precursor alt-right movement that coalesced
around an antipathy toward, and harassment of, women working in the online gaming
industry—to build vast amounts of traffic through the virality of political memes. (After
hours one night in the White House, Bannon would argue that he knew exactly how to
build a Breitbart for the left. And he would have the key advantage because “people on the
left want to win Pulitzers, whereas I want to be Pulitzer!”)

Working out of—and living in—the town house Breitbart rented on Capitol Hill,
Bannon became one of the growing number of notable Tea Party figures in Washington,
the Mercers’ consigliere. But a seeming measure of his marginality was that his big project
was the career of Jeff Sessions—“Beauregard,” Sessions’s middle name, in Bannon’s
affectionate moniker and evocation of the Confederate general—among the least
mainstream and most peculiar people in the Senate, whom Bannon tried to promote to run
for president in 2012.

Donald Trump was a step up—and early in the 2016 race, Trump became the Breitbart
totem. (Many of Trump’s positions in the campaign were taken from the Breitbart articles
he had printed out for him.) Indeed, Bannon began to suggest to people that he, like Ailes
had been at Fox, was the true force behind his chosen candidate.

Bannon didn’t much question Donald Trump’s bona fides, or behavior, or electability,
because, in part, Trump was just his latest rich man. The rich man is a fixed fact, which
you have to accept and deal with in an entrepreneurial world—at least a lower-level
entrepreneurial world. And, of course, if Trump had had firmer bona fides, better behavior,

room at the Mira hotel from June 3 to June 9, 2013, as the event was actually unfolding.
Snowden, speaking for the camera, describes himself as a civilian contractor for the National
Security Agency. He took full responsibility for the theft of classified documents, saying that he
had acted alone. He said that he had been forced to take these documents to expose a crime that
threatened the freedom of Americans: the US government’s illegal surveillance of US citizens.
He said that he had a duty to bring this secret activity to the attention of the American people.
“Sitting on his unmade bed—white sheets and covers, white headboard, white bathrobe, white
skin—Snowden seems like a figure in some obscure ritual, being readied for sacrifice,” George
Packer wrote about the film in a widely-read article in The New Yorker. He said repeatedly he
was willing to make the ultimate sacrifice, by allowing himself to go to prison, so that Americans
could live in freedom. A large part of the public, who viewed this powerful film, including many
of my colleagues in journalism whose writing I greatly respect, came to accept Snowden’s whistle-
blowing narrative.

This powerful narrative, as lucidly articulated by Poitras, Greenwald and other Snowden
supporters, described the NSA activities exposed by Snowden as part of a vast criminal
conspiracy involving, among others, President Obama, James Clapper, the Director of National
Intelligence and both Democrat and Republican members of the Congressional oversight
committees. It further derided claims that there was evidence that Snowden’s theft of NSA
secrets went beyond exposing government misdeeds as part of an orchestrated effort to demonize
Snowden. The purpose of this demonization was to divert away from the government’s crimes.
For example, this narrative asserted as if it was established fact, that US government officials had
deliberately “trapped” Snowden in Russia. According to Snowden, the purpose of this
government ploy was to “demonize” him.

To be sure, it is not unprecedented for the government to release defamatory information
about individuals who have embarrassed US intelligence by defecting. When two NSA analysts,
William Martin and Bernon Mitchell, defected to Russia in the 1960s and accused the NSA of
violating international law after arriving in Moscow, U.S. government officials responded by
putting out the story that they were homosexual lovers, which was both untrue and irrelevant to
the intelligence secrets that they compromised. So it is certainly possible that the government put
out information to intentionally defame Snowden. Secretary of State John Kerry, after all,
characterized him as a coward who should “man up” by returning to the United States.

While one can discount such characterizations against him by government officials as
demonization, as I do, one cannot as easily dismiss the independent evidence that undermines
Snowden assertion that his sole motive was blowing the whistle on illicit surveillance in the
United States. For example, by the Lawfare Institute in cooperation with The Brookings
Institution in 2014 did an independent analysis of all the published documents that Snowden
provided to the media. It concluded that, with some notable exceptions, such as the two
documents initially published by the Guardian and Washington Post, the now famous FISA

“May it [the Declaration of Independence] be to the world, what I believe it will be (to
some parts sooner, to other later, but finally to all), the signal of arousing men to burst the
chains under which monkish ignorance and superstition had persuaded them to bind
themselves, and to assume the blessing and security of self-government. That form which
we have substituted, restores the free right to the unbound exercise of reason and freedom
of opinion. All eyes are opened, or opening, to the rights of man. The general spread of
the light of science has already laid open to every view the palpable truth, that the mass of
mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs, nor a favored few booted and
spurred, ready to ride them legitimacy, by the grace of God.

Jefferson, who himself believed in the God of Deism—that is a non-Biblical, not Judeo Christian
diety—saw the Declaration as freeing Americans (and hopefully the rest of the world) from the
stifling influence of the church (“monkish ignorance and superstition”) and encouraging “the free
right to the unbound exercise of reason and freedom of opinion.”

Even earlier, Jefferson, while President, had written to the Danbury Baptist Association,
describing that the “act of the whole American people which declared their legislature should
‘make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, [as]
thus building a wall of separation between church and state.”

Even earlier, while Adams was president and Jefferson Secretary of State, they jointly signed a
treaty, ratified by the Senate, with the Barbary regime in Tripoli, that stated unequivocally that
“the government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion.”
(emphasis added).

It is difficult, therefore, for any reasonable person, especially anyone who gives weight to the
original understanding, to dispute Jefferson’s conclusion that the First Amendment built a wall of
separation between church and state and that our state is not based on the Christian religion.

Despite this wall of separation guaranteed by our Constitution and despite the unambiguous
statement in the early American treaty, approved by two of our most influential founding fathers,
there are those who continue to insist that the United States is a Christian nation, as a matter of
law. I became personally involved in this divisive controversy in 1988, when the Republican Party
of Arizona proposed the enactment of a resolution declaring the United States to be “a Christian
nation...based on the absolutes of the Bible.”

The leader of the group (characterized by the late Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater as a “bunch
of kooks”) wrote to Justice Sandra Day O’Connor on the United States Supreme Court asking
her to support their efforts.

“Republicans are making some interesting advances in this heavily controlled Democratic
area. Some of us are proposing a resolution which acknowledges that the Supreme Court

ruled in 1892 that this is a Christian nation. It would be beneficial and interesting to have
a letter from you.”

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016934.txt,"Sadly, Keynes’s predictions did not come true. Although productivity did indeed
increase, the system—possibly inherent in a market economy—did not result in humans
working much shorter hours. Rather, what happened is what the anthropologist and
anarchist David Graeber describes as the growth of “bullshit jobs.”°4 While jobs that
produce essentials like food, shelter, and goods have been largely automated away, we
have seen an enormous expansion of sectors like corporate law, academic and health
administration (as opposed to actual teaching, research, and the practice of medicine),
“human resources,” and public relations, not to mention new industries like financial
services and telemarketing and ancillary industries in the so-called gig economy which
serve those who are too busy doing all that additional work.

How will societies cope with technology’s increasingly rapid destruction of entire
professions and throwing large numbers of people out of work? Some argue that this
concern is based on a false premise, because new jobs spring up that didn’t exist before,
but as Graeber points out, these new jobs won’t necessarily be rewarding or fulfilling.
During the first industrial revolution, it took almost a century before most people were
better off. That revolution was possible only because the government of the time
ruthlessly favored property rights over labor, and most people (and all women) did not
have the vote. In today’s democratic societies, it is not clear that the population will
tolerate such a dramatic upheaval of society based on the promise that “eventually”
things will get better.

Even that rosy vision will depend on a radical shake-up of education and lifelong
learning. The Industrial Revolution did trigger enormous social change of this kind,
including a shift to universal education. But it will not happen unless we make it happen:
This is essentially about power, agency, and control. What’s next for, say, the forty-year-
old taxi driver or truck driver in an era of autonomous vehicles?

One idea that has been touted is that of a universal basic income, which will allow
citizens to pursue their interests, retrain for new occupations, and generally be free to live
a decent life. However, market economies, which are predicated on growing consumer
demand over all else, may not tolerate this innovation. There is also a feeling among
many that meaningful work is essential to human dignity and fulfillment. So another
possibility is that the enormous wealth generated by increased productivity due to
automation could be redistributed to jobs requiring human labor and creativity in fields
such as the arts, music, social work, and other worthwhile pursuits. Ultimately, which
jobs are rewarding or productive and which are “bullshit” is a matter of judgment and
may vary from society to society, as well as over time.

So far, ’ve focused on AI’s practical consequences. As a scientist, what bothers me is
our potential loss of understanding. We are now accumulating data at an incredible rate.
In my own lab, an experiment generates over a terabyte of data a day. These data are
massaged, analyzed, and reduced until there is an interpretable result. But in all of this
data analysis, we believe we know what’s happening. We know what the programs are

Untangling them was getting harder, not easier. And we realised that only in an
environment like Camp David — a “pressure cooker” was how I described it to
Clinton, and to US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright — would we ever
discover whether a peace deal could in fact be done.

Now, we knew.

Israel’s equivalent of Air Force One, perhaps in a nod to our country’s
pioneering early years, was an almost prehistoric Boeing 707. It was waiting on
the runway at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington to ferry me and the
rest of our negotiating team back home.

It contained a low-rent equivalent of the American version’s presidential
cabin, and a few 1960s-vintage first-class seats, but consisted mostly of two
long lines of coach seats, three abreast, separated by an almost tightrope-narrow
aisle. I dare say I was alone in finding an odd sense of comfort in boarding the
plane. This museum piece of an aircraft was part of my past. It was the same
model of 707 for which I, with a couple of other young soldiers and engineers,
had come up with what we dubbed the “submarine door” system outside the
cockpit — to protect El Al pilots from future attacks after one of its planes had
been hijacked to Algiers in the summer of 1968. It was also the same kind of
plane — a Sabena flight, hijacked to Tel Aviv’s Ben-Gurion Airport — which I
stormed, before sunrise, four years later with a force of nearly two dozen
Matkal commandos. The shooting was over within 90 seconds. One of my men
—a junior officer named Bibi Netanyahu — was wounded. By one of our own
bullets. But we managed to kill two of the heavily armed hijackers, capture the
others, and free all 90 passengers unharmed.

Still, even I had to accept, it was no fun to fly on.

As we banked eastward after takeoff and headed out over the Atlantic, the
mood on board was sober. Huddling with the inner core of my negotiating team
— my policy co-ordinator Gilad Sher, security aide Danny Yatom and Foreign
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami — I could see that the way the summit ended had hit
them hard. It was probably true, as all three often reminded me, that the greatest
pressure fell on me. I was the one who ultimately decided what we could, or

Nuclear Operator Raises Alarm on Crisis
Hiroko Tabuchi — New York Times

The operator of Japan’s tsunami-hit nuclear power plant sounded the alarm on the gravity of the deepening crisis of
containment at the coastal site on Friday, saying that there are more than 200,000 tons of radioactive water in makeshift
tanks vulnerable to leaks, with no reliable way to check on them or anywhere to transfer the water.

The latest disclosures add to along list of recent accidents, leaks and breakdowns that have underscored grave
vulnerabilities at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant site more than two years after a powerful earthquake and
tsunami set off meltdowns at three reactors.

They come two weeks after the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, promised that his government would take a more active role in
the site’s cleanup, raising questions over how seriously he has taken that pledge. Mr. Abe’s government has continued to
push for a restart of the country’s nuclear power program, and he heads to the Middle East on Saturday to promote
Japanese exports to the region, including nuclear technology.

Mr. Abe also plans to lead Tokyo’s delegation to Argentina for the International Olympic Committee’s final vote, set for Sept.
7, on the host city for the 2020 Olympics. Tokyo, 150 miles south of the stricken nuclear power plant, is one of three finalists
competing to host the games. The others are Istanbul and Madrid.

Opposition lawmakers here have demanded that Mr. Abe stay home and declare a state of emergency.

“The nuclear crisis is real and ongoing, yet the government continues to look the other way,” said Yoshiko Kira of the
opposition Japan Communist Party, which made significant gains in parliamentary elections last month.

“The government should declare a state of emergency right now, and intervene to stop the outflow of contaminated water,”
Ms. Kira said at an anti-nuclear rally outside Mr. Abe’s office in Tokyo.

Mr. Abe remains popular, and it is uncertain how large a liability the crisis at the Fukushima plant will become for him.

But it has become increasingly clear that the latest problems may be too large for the plant’s operator, the Tokyo Electric
Power Company, or Tepco, to handle.

Tepco has built nearly 1,000 tanks at the sprawling complex to store as many as 335,000 tons of contaminated water, the
product of coolant pumped into the reactors to keep their cores from overheating, and groundwater pouring into their
breached basements at a rate of 400 tons a day. This week, Tepco said one tank had sprung a huge leak.

On Friday, Tepco presented an even starker view of the situation, acknowledging that as much as 220,000 tons of that water
is stored in makeshift steel tanks similar to the one that is leaking. The operator said the 36-foot-tall cylindrical tanks, meant
as atemporary repository for the growing amount of radiated water at the complex, used vulnerable rubber sealing and that
their ability to withstand radiation was not tested.

The tanks are susceptible to leaks at the seams and through their concrete base, said Noriyuki Imaizumi, the acting general
manager of Tepco’s nuclear power division. Anearby drain can carry any leaked water to the sea, Mr. Imaizumi said, and
high radiation readings along a section suggest that water has already traveled through the drain to the ocean.

The makeshift tanks also lack water level gauges, making it difficult to detect leaks. Only two workers are assigned to
checking nearly 1,000 tanks on two-hour patrols twice a day, Mr. Imaizumi said.

The Nuclear Regulation Authority, which the Japanese government ordered to more actively advise and monitor Tepco’s
activities at the plant, had told the company to begin transferring the water from the makeshift tanks to better-built vessels.
But after visiting the plant on Friday, an authority commissioner, Toyoshi Fuketa, said the vast quantities made doing so
quickly “unrealistic.”

but the single charge of soliciting a hooker in his luxurious Palm Beach home. Epstein's
lawyers and friends now say he's the hapless victim of a vendetta by Palm Beach Police
Chief Michael Reiter, whom they describe as a born-again nut case.

According to the police investigation, a copy of which was obtained by the Palm Beach
Post, detectives took statements from 17 witnesses and five alleged victims. Haley
Robson, 20, a Palm Beach Community College student who described herself as like a
Heidi Fleiss, says she got naked to give Epstein a massage, then brought him six girls
ages 14-16 for massages and sex at his home. She said they were paid $200 per session.
Cops also allege that Epstein's personal assistant, Sarah Kellen, who hasn't been charged,
set up the liaisons and put fresh sheets on the massage table and supplied massage oils.
Police searched through Epstein's garbage and retrieved sex toys and feminine hygiene
products.

Epstein's Palm Beach lawyer, Jack Goldberger, told Page Six that the Florida state
attorney concluded the cops had looked at evidence from a one-sided perspective. He
added that Epstein had passed an extensive lie-detector test in which he was grilled about
underage girls.

Epstein's New York lawyer, Gerald Lefcourt, said, The prosecutor didn't want to bring
any charges in this case, but because of the craziness of this police chief, we have the
charge of solicitation.

Last night, WPTV in Palm Beach reported that one reason Robson's testimony may have
been dismissed is the kinky Web page she has on MySpace featuring photos of her
female friends playing with sex toys. One friend even uses the name Pimpin' Made EZ.
Robson, who isn't charged, also writes, Do what you do to make that money, life is

a gamble. Stay hustling.”

A spokeswoman for Reiter said, We think our investigation speaks for itself.

Management

Important Information Division

You may obtain documents for ETFs or ETNs for free by 1) visiting EDGAR on the SEC website at http://(www.sec.gov/; 2) contacting your Private Wealth Management
team; or 3) calling toll-free at 1-866-471-2526. Unlike traditional mutual funds, ETFs can trade at a discount or premium to the net asset value and are not directly
redeemable by the fund.

You should understand the risks associated with leveraged or inverse ETFs, ETNs or commodities futures-linked ETFs before investing. These types of securities may
experience greater price movements than traditional ETFs and may not be appropriate for all investors. Most leveraged and inverse ETFs or ETNs seek to deliver
multiples of the performance (or the inverse of the performance) of the underlying index or benchmark on a daily basis. Their performance over a longer period of time
can vary significantly from the stated daily performance objectives or the underlying benchmark or index due to the effects of compounding. Performance differences may
be magnified in a volatile market. Commodities futures-linked ETFs may perform differently than the spot price for the commodity itself, including due to the entering into
and liquidating of futures or swap contracts on a continuous basis to maintain exposure (i.e., “rolling”) and disparities between near term future prices and long term future
prices for the underlying commodity. You should not assume that a commodity-futures linked ETF will provide an effective hedge against other risks in your portfolio.

¢ Alternative Investments. Alternative investments may involve a substantial degree of risk, including the risk of total loss of an investor's capital and the use of leverage,
and therefore may not be appropriate for all investors. Private equity, private real estate, hedge funds and other alternative investments structured as private investment
funds are subject to less regulation than other types of pooled vehicles and liquidity may be limited. Investors in private investment funds should review the Offering
Memorandum, the Subscription Agreement and any other applicable disclosures for risks and potential conflicts of interest. Terms and conditions governing private
investments are contained in the applicable offering documents, which also include information regarding the liquidity of such investments, which may be limited.

¢ Emerging Markets and Growth Markets. |nvesting in the securities of issuers in emerging markets and growth markets involves certain considerations, including:
political and economic conditions, the potential difficulty of repatriating funds or enforcing contractual or other legal rights, and the small size of the securities markets in
such countries coupled with a low volume of trading, resulting in potential lack of liquidity and in price volatility.

¢ Equity Investments. Equity investments are subject to market risk, which means that the value of the securities may go up or down in respect to the prospects of
individual companies, particular industry sectors and/or general economic conditions. The securities of small and mid-capitalization companies involve greater risks than
those associated with larger, more established companies and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements.

¢ Fixed Income. |nvestments in fixed income securities are subject to the risks associated with debt securities generally, including credit/default, liquidity and interest rate
risk. Any guarantee on an investment grade bond of a given country applies only if held to maturity.

* Non-US Securities. Investing in non-US securities involve the risk of loss as a result of more or less non-US government regulation, less public information, less liquidity
and greater volatility in the countries of domicile of the issuers of the securities and/or the jurisdiction in which these securities are traded. In addition, investors in
securities such as ADRs/GDRs, whose values are influenced by foreign currencies, effectively assume currency risk.

¢ Real Estate. Investments in real estate involve additional risks not typically associated with other asset classes, such as sensitivities to temporary or permanent
reductions in property values for the geographic region(s) represented. Real estate investments (both through public and private markets) are also subject to changes in
broader macroeconomic conditions, such as interest rates.

. Structured Investments. Structured investments are complex, involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. Investors in structured investments assume the credit risk
of the issuer or guarantor. If the issuer or guarantor defaults, you may lose your entire investment, even if you hold the product to maturity. Structured investments often
perform differently from the asset(s) they reference. Credit ratings may pertain to the credit rating of the issuer and are not indicative of the market risk associated with the
structured investment or the reference asset. Each structured investment is different, and for each investment you should consider 1) the possibility that at expiration you

Q. At his deposition, he took the Fifth as to
everyone he was asked about; isn't that true?

A. I haven't looked at the depositions lately.
There were also variations in tactics that he used. I
recall for example, that sometimes when he was asked
about a person, even if he knew that person, he would
pretend not to know that person and try to communicate
that, you know, maybe he didn't know that person.

But he did he did have broad invocations of
the Fifth Amendment in his deposition. I certainly
wouldn't quarrel with you on that.

Q. And you understand or I believe this was in
your testimony that if a person takes the Fifth in
response to a question in a civil litigation, that

answer can be used against the person generally; is that

right?
A. Sure. Right.
Q. Are you aware of any authority whatsoever

that Person A taking the Fifth can be used as evidence
against Person B?

A. Yeah, we are sitting here in the -- let's
see, we are in Florida, in the 11th Circuit, and that

\ To the extent there is a similar, but more egregious, local Florida case on the books, it is
. that of Barry Kutun, a former North Miami city attorney accused of having sex with underage
prostitutes and videotaping the sessions. Mr. Kutun pleaded guilty on May 18, 2007 in a Miami-
Dade County courtroom as part of an agreement with State prosecutors and he received five
years probation and a withholding of adjudication with no requirement to register as a sex
offender—all without a shred of involvement by federal prosecutors, who declined to prosecute
him. Indeed, given the wide use of the telephone in today’s society, it gives a rogue prosecutor
carte blanche to turn any local crime into a federal offense. Given the federal government’s
decision to abstain from prosecuting that case, it is hard to understand how the federal
prosecutors responsible for this case think that the State’s treatment of Mr. Epstein somehow
leaves federal interests substantially unvindicated. There is simply no basis for the federal
prosecutors’ disparate treatment of Mr. Epstein.

Summary of the Evidence

Finally, we wish to share new evidence—obtained through discovery in connection with
the civil lawsuits filed in this matter—which confirms that further federal involvement in this
matter would be inappropriate. This testimony taken to date categorically confirms that (i) Mr.
Epstein did not target minors; (ii) women under 18 often lied to Mr. Epstein about their ages; (iii)
Mr. Epstein did not travel in interstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in illegal sexual
activity; (iv) Mr. Epstein did not use the Internet, telephone or any other means of interstate
communication to coerce or entice alleged victims; (v) Mr. Epstein did not apply force or
coercion to obtain sexual favors; and (vi) all sexual activity that occurred was unplanned and
purely consensual. The women’s own statements—made under oath—demonstrate the absence
of a legitimate federal concern in this matter, and highlight the serious practical difficulties an
attempted federal prosecution would face.

NYT
President Obama on Libya

Editorial

March 28, 2011 -- President Obama made the right, albeit belated,
decision to join with allies and try to stop Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi
from slaughtering thousands of Libyans. But he has been far too slow
to explain that decision, or his long-term strategy, to Congress and
the American people. On Monday night, the president spoke to the
nation and made a strong case for why America needed to intervene
in this fight — and why that did not always mean it should intervene
in others. Mr. Obama said that the United States had a moral
responsibility to stop “violence on a horrific scale,” as well as a
unique international mandate and a broad coalition to act with. He
said that failure to intervene could also have threatened the peaceful
transitions in Egypt and Tunisia, as thousands of Libyan refugees
poured across their borders, while other dictators would conclude that
“violence is the best strategy to cling to power.” Mr. Obama could
report encouraging early progress on the military and diplomatic
fronts. Washington and its allies have crippled or destroyed Colonel
Qaddafi’s anti-aircraft defenses, peeled his troops back from the city
of Benghazi — saving potentially thousands of lives — and allowed
rebel forces to retake the offensive. Just as encouragingly, this
military effort that was galvanized internationally — the United
Nations Security Council authorized “all necessary measures” to
protect civilians in Libya — will soon be run internationally. Last
weekend, the United States handed over responsibility for enforcing
the no-flight zone to NATO. And the alliance is now preparing to
take command of the entire mission, with the support of (still too
few) Arab nations. To his credit, Mr. Obama did not sugarcoat the
difficulties ahead. While he suggested that his goal, ultimately, is to

you have a word for an experience it’s no longer fundamental.

54019

The proposed Appendix to Subpart A
included Board contact information and
basic enforcement procedures to enable
employees to learn more about their
NLRA rights and how to enforce them.
Thus, the required notice confirmed that
unlawful conduct will not be permitted,
provided information about the Board
and about filing a charge with the
Board, and stated that the Board will
prosecute violators of the NLRA. The
notice also indicated that there is a 6-
month statute of limitations for filing
charges with the Board alleging
violations and provided Board contact
information. The Board invited
suggested additions or deletions to these
provisions that would improve the
content of the notice of employee rights.
Id.

The content of the proposed notice
received more comments than any other
single topic in the proposed rule. But of
the thousands of comments that address
the content of the notice, the majority
are either very general, or identical or
nearly identical form letters or
“postcard” comments sent in response
to comment initiatives by various
interest groups, including those
representing employers, unions, and
employee rights organizations. Many
comments from both individuals and
organizations offer general support for
the content of the proposed notice,
stating that employee awareness of basic
legal rights will promote a fair and just
workplace, improve employee morale,
and foster workforce stability, among
other benefits.97 More specifically, one
comment asserts that the proposed
notice ‘‘contains an accurate,
understandable and balanced
presentation of rights.” 98 The United
Transportation Union contends that the
“notice presents an understandable,
concise and extremely informative
recitation of workers’ rights, without
getting bogged down in extraneous
language, incomprehensible legalese or
innumerable caveats and exceptions.”

Other comments were less supportive
of the content of the proposed notice
and the notice-posting requirement in
general. A significant number of
comments, including those from many
individuals, employers, and employer
industry and interest groups, argue that
the content of the notice is not balanced,
and appears to promote unionization
instead of employee freedom of
association. In particular, many
comments state that Section 7 of the

°7 See comments of the National Immigration Law
Center, Service Employees International Union, and
Weinberg, Roger & Rosenfeld.

°8 Comment of David Fusco, a labor and
employment attorney.

NLRA includes the right to refrain from
union activity, but claim that this right
is given little attention in comparison to
other rights in the proposed notice.
Several comments also argue that the
proposed notice excludes rights
associated with an anti-union position,
including the right to seek
decertification of a bargaining
representative, the right to abstain from
union membership in “‘right-to-work”’
states, and rights associated with the
Supreme Court’s decision in
Communications Workers v. Beck.°°
Comments also suggest that the notice
should include a warning to employees
that unionizing will result in a loss of
the right to negotiate directly with their
employer.1°° Many of these comments
argue that a neutral government position
on unionization would be more
inclusive of anti-union rights.1°

A number of comments address the
issue of complexity, and argue that the
Board’s attempt to summarize the law is
flawed because the Board’s decisional
law is too complex to condense into a
single workplace notice.1°2 Some of the
comments addressing this issue note
that NLRA law has been developed over
75 years, and involves interpretations by
both the NLRB and the Federal courts,
sometimes with conflicting results. The
Chamber of Commerce cites the
““NLRB’s Basic Guide to the National
Labor Relations Act: General Principles
of Law Under the Statute and
Procedures of the National Labor
Relations Board” (Basic Guide to the
NLRA) (1997), available at http://
www.nirb.gov/publications/brochures,
to make their point about legal
complexity. In the Foreword to the
Basic Guide to the NLRA, the Board’s
General Counsel states that ‘‘[alny effort
to state basic principles of law ina
simple way is a challenging and
unenviable task. This is especially true
about labor law, a relatively complex
field of law.”’ The thrust of these
comments about legal complexity was
that the NLRA is complex, dynamic,
and nuanced, and any attempt to
summarize it in a workplace notice will
result in an oversimplification of the
law and lead to confusion,
misunderstanding, inconsistencies, and
some say, heightened labor-management
antagonism. Moreover, some comments
express concern that Board member
turnover could result in changes to the

law, which may require frequent
updates to the notice.1%

Many comments suggest that the
required notice should include only the
specific rights contained in Section 7 of
the NLRA or, at most, the rights and
obligations stated in employee
aclvisories on the NLRB’s Web site. The
comments favoring a more general
notice suggest that the detailed list of
rights far exceeds the “‘short and plain”
description of rights that the Board has
found sufficient to “clearly and
effectively inform employees of their
rights under the Act’’ in unfair labor
practice cases.1°4 See Ishikawa Gasket
America, Inc., 337 NLRB 175 (2001),
enfd. 354 F.3d 534 (6th Cir. 2004). A
comment from Fisher & Phillips LLP
argues that, under the Board’s current
remedial practices, only an employer
that egregiously violates the Act on
numerous occasions is required to post
such an inclusive list of rights.

Finally, a number of comments
suggest that the notice should include a
list of employer rights, namely the right
to distribute anti-union literature and
the right to discuss the company’s
position regarding unions.

In addition to the general comments
about the proposed notice, many
comments offer suggestions for specific
revisions to individual provisions
within the five sections of the proposed
notice: the introduction, the statement
of affirmative rights, the examples of
unlawful conduct, the collective-
bargaining provision, and the coverage
information. The following discussion
presents the comments related to
individual provisions of the notice,
followed by the Board’s decisions
regarding the content of the final notice
made in response to those comments.

a. Comments Regarding the Introduction

The introduction to the notice of
rights in the proposed rule stated:

The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)
guarantees the right of employees to organize
and bargain collectively with their
employers, and to engage in other protected
concerted activity. Employees covered by the
NLRB are protected from certain types of
employer and union misconduct. This Notice
gives you general information about your
rights, and about the obligations of employers
under the NLRA. Contact the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB), the Federal agency
that investigates and resolves complaints
under the NLRA, using the contact
information supplied below, if you have any
questions about specific rights that may
apply in your particular workplace.

Moreover, if the government had any reason to believe that Prof. Dershowitz was involved in
any criminal activity they would have immediately demanded his recusal rather than continuing
to work with him as one of Epstein’s attorneys in negotiating a plea bargain.

Fourth, Jane Doe #3 then makes the facially absurd and libelous claim that somehow
Prof. Dershowitz must have drafted and benefited from the “co-conspirators” clause of the NPA.
But the link between the need to include these allegations and their ability to rescind the “co-
conspirators” clause goes completely unexplained. The allegations are completely gratuitous, as
there is no such link. No such claim existed until fabricated by Jane Doe #3 many years after the
NPA was signed and fully performed. Additionally, as stated in Prof. Dershowitz’s Supplement
to his Motion for Limited Intervention, this “co-conspirator” provision “was intended to apply to
four alleged co-conspirators, who were named in the original NPA and later redacted at their
request.... Alan Dershowitz was never alleged to be a potential co-conspirator.” (DE 285 at 4°.)

Incredibly, Jane Doe #3’s counsel, Bradley Edwards, agreed with this reading of the NPA
in his Statement of Undisputed Fact during his own personal lawsuit against Jeffrey Epstein
(Jeffrey Epstein v. Scott Rothstein and Bradley J. Edwards, lawsuit (Case no. 502009-CA-
040800)) in Palm Beach County Circuit Court. There, Edwards explained that these co-
conspirators were certain individuals who “procured minor females to be molested by Epstein.”
(DE 291-15 at § 27.) Only now, when convenient as a way to try to justify allegations against
Prof. Dershowitz does Edwards argue (on behalf of Jane Doe #3) that the “co-conspirator”

provision was actually intended to protect Prof. Dershowitz.

> Moreover, it is unlikely that anyone who had sexual contact with Jane Doe #3, or any other
minor involved in the Epstein case, would be considered to be a “co-conspirator.” Instead those
individuals would be substantive perpetrators, not covered by the agreement.

Republican Convention in Cleveland, reported back that, even having been forewarned, he
absolutely was certain of Trump’s sincerity when he said they’d be friends for life—only
never to basically hear from him again or have his calls returned. Still, power provides its
own excuses for social lapses. Other aspects of the Trump character were more
problematic.

Almost all the professionals who were now set to join him were coming face to face
with the fact that it appeared he knew nothing. There was simply no subject, other than
perhaps building construction, that he had substantially mastered. Everything with him
was off the cuff. Whatever he knew he seemed to have learned an hour before—and that
was mostly half-baked. But each member of the new Trump team was convincing him- or
herself otherwise—because what did they know, the man had been elected president. He
offered something, obviously. Indeed, while everybody in his rich-guy social circle knew
about his wide-ranging ignorance—Trump, the businessman, could not even read a
balance sheet, and Trump, who had campaigned on his deal-making skills, was, with his
inattention to details, a terrible negotiator—they yet found him somehow instinctive. That
was the word. He was a force of personality. He could make you believe.

“Is Trump a good person, an intelligent person, a capable person?” asked Sam
Nunberg, Trump’s longtime political aide. “I don’t even know. But I know he’s a star.”

Trying to explain Trump’s virtues and his attraction, Piers Morgan—the British
newspaper man and ill-fated CNN anchor who had appeared on Celebrity Apprentice and
stayed a loyal Trump friend—said it was all in Trump’s book The Art of the Deal.
Everything that made him Trump and that defined his savvy, energy, and charisma was
there. If you wanted to know Trump, just read the book. But Trump had not written 7he
Art of the Deal. His co-writer, Tony Schwartz, insisted that he had hardly contributed to it
and might not even have read all of it. And that was perhaps the point. Trump was not a
writer, he was a character—a protagonist and hero.

A pro wrestling fan who became a World Wrestling Entertainment supporter and
personality (inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame), Trump lived, like Hulk Hogan, as a
real-life fictional character. To the amusement of his friends, and unease of many of the
people now preparing to work for him at the highest levels of the federal government,
Trump often spoke of himself in the third person. Trump did this. The Trumpster did that.
So powerful was this persona, or role, that he seemed reluctant, or unable, to give it up in
favor of being president—or presidential.

However difficult he was, many of those now around him tried to justify his behavior
—tried to find an explanation for his success in it, to understand it as an advantage, not a
limitation. For Steve Bannon, Trump’s unique political virtue was as an alpha male,
maybe the last of the alpha males. A 1950s man, a Rat Pack type, a character out of Mad
Men.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020159.txt,"PROLOGUE
On The Snowden Trail: Hong Kong 2014

The National Security Agency, or, as it now commonly called, the NSA, was created on
October 24, 1952, in such a tight cocoon of secrecy that even the Presidential order creating it
was classified “Top Secret.” When journalists asked questions about this new agency,
Washington officials jokingly told them that the initials NSA stood for “No Such Agency.” The
reason for this extraordinary stealth is that the NSA is involved in a very sensitive enterprise. Its
job is to intercept, decode and analyze foreign electronic communications transmitted around the
globe over from copper wires, fiber optic cable, satellite, microwave relays, cell phone towers,
wireless transmissions and the Internet for intelligence purposes. In intelligence jargon, its product
is called COMINT. This form of intelligence-gathering is particularly effective when the NSA’s
targets are unaware of the state-of-the-art tools the NSA uses to break into their computers and
telecommunications and decipher their enciphered messages.

In the first week of June in 2013, the NSA learned that a huge number of its most secret files
had been stolen. The suspect was Edward Snowden, a 29 year old civilian analyst at the NSA’s
regional base in Oahu, Hawaii, who had fled to Hong Kong. The stolen documents revealed,
among other things, the secret tools and capabilities that the NSA employed to do its job.
According to a three-count criminal complaint filed by Federal prosecutors in the Eastern District
of Virginia, Snowden had stolen government documents and violated the Espionage Act by the
unauthorized and willful communication of national defense information to an unauthorized
person.

This was not a who-dunn-it mystery. On June 9, 2013, in an extraordinary 12-minute video
made in a cramped hotel room in Hong Kong, Snowden identified himself as the person who had
taken the NSA documents. Watching the video, the world saw a shy, awkward and sympathetic-
looking, man wearing a rumpled shirt, rimless glasses and a computer geek-style haircut,
passionately speaking out against the NSA’s violations of the law and, in a shaky voice,
expressing his willingness to expose them.

Snowden had an innocent, idealistic, principled look about him, and the world was ready to
congratulate him for revealing the NSA's illegal collection of data inside the United States. But in
fact, he stole a great deal more than documents relating to domestic surveillance. He had also
stolen secret documents from the NSA revealing the sources and methods it employed in its
monitoring of foreign adversaries.

What made this theft even more extraordinary was that he got away with it. By the time it had

been discovered in the first week of June 2013, it was not possible for the FBI, the Grand Jury or
any other US agency to question him because he had fled the country. He went first to Hong
Kong. Although it is economically autonomous, the city of 7.2 million is actually a special

A common and costly mistake is to put off thinking about a class of
things you are going to need in the next release because of time pressure.
‘Time out, that’s for the next release’ and similar statements spell disaster
for the future of a project as when you come to the next release, you may
have to rewrite much of it from scratch. This is why good architects are
so valuable. They anticipate the future even when they are told to ignore
it and ship now!

Just as there are artistic geniuses, there are programming geniuses.
Hold onto them if you get one. They are rare. We don’t know if they
can be made or they are lucky accidents, but statistics shows that some
people are 1000 times more productive at writing code than the average.
If you can find lots of them and make them work together you will build
the next Google or Facebook. If you have a tight deadline, a super-
programmer may get you out of a hole, producing in a week what might
otherwise take a year. Remember your great programmers will most
prolific if you can get process and distraction out of their way. Just make
sure they have a clear idea of purpose.

Laws
A programmer interrupted eight times a day does no work.
A creative person interrupted eight times a day does no work.
Programming is a creative endeavor.
There are creative geniuses. Hold onto them.

Bugs save us from collapsing space-time when we are lazy and try
to use mechanical means rather than creative thought to write software.

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013781
"
IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029267.txt,"3) Where do our political and economic institutions come from and what causes them to have the peculiar
structure they have?

We have one vote per person, but everyone knows dollars can buy more votes, and voters in small states are
better represented than those in large states. Whose interests are being served and why theirs? Many
economists and political scientists have thought about optimal institutions. And much comparative and
historical work has been done. But there isn't really a good unified theory of how these evolve, what
characteristics are likely to emerge, and in what ways they are or are not optimal.

4) Is there a fundamental theory of human societies that's analogous to Darwin's theory in biology?

Can that framework be as well supported by evidence and as simple as natural selection in biology, that will
likewise explain the interesting things humans do, like, and believe, and the institutions we construct?
Evolutionary psychologists think this doesn't require a new theory, just an investigation of the mind that
biologically evolved on the Savannah. Others like Dawkins have suggested that we are best understood as
machines infested by viruses of the mind which themselves evolve to take advantage of our evolved
psychology. Anthropologists treat culture as just random inputs. Social psychologists document the funny
quirks of our behavior without explaining where they come from. And economists assume people optimize
given their tastes and beliefs but take those as given. Is one of these the right theory, if not is there a more
compelling theory out there? What will it look like? How will we find it? How will we know we have found it,
when we have?

5) How can we fix the perverse incentives in academia?

Researchers get hired and promoted for publishing in top journals. Journal publication is determined by editors
and referees. The best way to publish is to make sure your allies are the referees, cite their work, and don't step
on their toes, and to convince the editor you are famous enough and your work is flashy enough that it will be
well cited and get covered by the nytimes. None of this requires much attention be paid to truth, insight, or
originally.

Arguably, this is why the social sciences are such a mess. Few bother to incorporate evidence or arguments
from outsiders (e.g., social psychologists don’t consult historians, economists barely consult social
psychologists). Few bother to question the fundamental assumptions driving their field that make no sense and
go unchecked (e.g., anthropologists treat culture as random inputs). And many researchers end up spending
their whole careers developing and propagating theories that are completely uninteresting to outsiders, or
obviously fallacious to anyone not steeped in their literature.

It is ridiculous that we’re still using a system derived from the Society of Letters of the 1500s. Perhaps it's time
for something more like Wikipedia, where information gets aggregated and contributors are incentivizes by
their reputation as competent editors to integrate information from across disciplines? Or something like
Reddit, where quality research is recognized by upvotes that aggregate the opinion of thousands from diverse
fields? Or a certification system of sorts, where papers are certified as having done their statistics right or
having integrated what's known from certain fields, or not citing irrelevant papers for political reasons?
Whatever the solution is, social scientists and engineers who work on this problem will have orders of
magnitude more impact on science than scientists doing primary research in our archaic system.

DAY ONE

ared Kushner at thirty-six prided himself on his ability to get along with older men. By
J the time of Donald Trump’s inauguration he had become the designated intermediary
between his father-in-law and the establishment, such as it was—more moderate
Republicans, corporate interests, the New York rich. Having a line to Kushner seemed to
offer an alarmed elite a handle on a volatile situation.

Several of his father-in-law’s circle of confidants also confided in Kushner—often
confiding their worries about their friend, the presidentelect.

“IT give him good advice about what he needs to do and for three hours the next day he
does it, and then goes hopelessly off script,” complained one of them to Trump’s son-in-
law. Kushner, whose pose was to take things in and not give much back, said he
understood the frustration.

These powerful figures tried to convey a sense of real-world politics, which they all
claimed to comprehend at some significantly higher threshold than the soon-to-be
president. They were all concerned that Trump did not understand what he was up against.
That there was simply not enough method to his madness.

Each of these interlocutors provided Kushner with something of a tutorial on the
limitations of presidential power—that Washington was as much designed to frustrate and
undermine presidential power as to accommodate it.

“Don’t let him piss off the press, don’t let him piss off the Republican Party, don’t
threaten congressmen because they will fuck you if you do, and most of all don’t let him
piss off the intel community,” said one national Republican figure to Kushner. “If you fuck
with the intel community they will figure out a way to get back at you and you'll have two
or three years of a Russian investigation, and every day something else will leak out.”

A vivid picture was painted for the preternaturally composed Kushner of spies and
their power, of how secrets were passed out of the intelligence community to former
members of the community or to other allies in Congress or even to persons in the
executive branch and then to the press.

Arabs Will Be Free

Roger Cohen

March 28, 2011 -- Three Middle Eastern countries have been
conspicuous for their stability in the storm. They are Turkey,
Lebanon and Israel. An odd mix, you might say, but they have in
common that they are places where people vote.

Democracy is a messy all-or-nothing business. That’s why I love it.
You can no more be a little bit democratic than a little bit pregnant.
Yes, citizens go to the polls in Turkey, Lebanon and Israel and no
dictator gets 99.3 percent of the vote. They are lands of opportunity
where money is being made and where facile generalizations, for all
their popularity, miss the point. Turkey has not turned Islamist,
Lebanon is not in the hands of Hezbollah, and Israel is still an open
society.

All three countries, of course, are also wracked by division and
imperfection; but then two great merits of democracy are that it
finesses division and does not aspire to perfection.

Speaking of Hezbollah, remember all that alarm a couple of months
back when a Hezbollah-backed businessman, Najib Mikati, emerged
as prime minister? After that, Lebanon introduced the Libyan no-fly-
zone resolution at the United Nations — a rare, if little noted,
example of the United States and a Hezbollah-supported government
in sync.

Talk to Hezbollah: That’s obvious. It’s no terrorizing monolith.
Mikati is struggling with the give-and-take of Lebanese politics. Life
goes on in the freewheeling way that has long drawn repressed,
frustrated Arabs to Beirut.

54013

But even if the new rule is understood
to compel employer speech, Section 8(c)
‘““merely implements the First
Amendment.” Brown, 554 U.S. at 67
(quoting NLEB v. Gissel Packing Co.,
395 U.S. 575, 617 (1969)). Thus, if a
First Amendment challenge to the rule
must fail, so too must a challenge based
on Section 8(c). Such was the holding
of the D.C. Circuit in UAW v. Chao.
There, the court was presented with a
preemption argument, grounded in
Section 8(c), challenging a Federal
procurement regulation that required
contractors to post a notice informing
their employees of certain NLRA rights.
The D.C. Circuit interpreted Section 8(c)
as coextensive with the scope of free
speech rights protected by the First
Amendment and upheld the
procurement regulation in light of well-
established free speech jurisprudence in
the labor context. See 325 F.3d at 365.

3. Lack of Contemporaneity With the
Enactment of the NLRA

Several comments attack the notice-
posting regulation for its lack of
contemporaneity with the enactment of
the NLRA. For example, many
comments criticize the regulation by
noting that ‘‘this is a new rule
interpreted into the Act 75 years after its
passage.”’ The Board rejects these
contentions for two reasons.

First, the Supreme Court has
repeatedly “‘instructed that ‘neither
antiquity nor contemporaneity with [a]
statute is a condition of [a regulation’s]
validity.”’ Mayo, 131 S. Ct. at 712
(alterations in original) (quoting Smiley
v. Citibank (S.D.), N.A., 517 U.S. 735,
740 (1996)); see also Smiley, 517 U.S. at
740 (deferring to a regulation “issued
more than 100 years after the
enactment” of the statutory provision
that the regulation construed). Second,
the argument fails to consider that much
has changed since 1935, the year the
NLRA was enacted. Unionization rates
are one example. As pointed out in the
NPRM and as confirmed by comments
submitted by the Association of
Corporate Counsel’s Employment and
Labor Law Committee, unionization
rates increased during the early years of
the Act, peaking at around 35 percent of
the workforce in the mid-1950s. But
since then, the share of the workforce
represented by labor unions has

Pilchak attorneys to revise the rule to specify that
employers ‘‘may post a notice of equal dignity
which advises employees of * * * additional rights
and realities.” Alternatively, the Pilchak attorneys
propose that the Board amend the rule to permit
employers to “alter the Poster and include
additional rights.” Adopting this suggestion would
compromise the integrity of the notice as a
communication from the government. It, too, is
therefore rejected.

plummeted to approximately 8 percent.
As a result, fewer employees today have
direct, everyday access to an important
source of information regarding NLRA
rights and the Board’s ability to enforce
those rights.

As noted above, “[tlhe responsibility
to adapt the Act to changing patterns of
industrial life is entrusted to the Board.”’
J. Weingarten, Inc., 420 U.S. at 266. It
would therefore be an abdication of that
responsibility for the Board to decline to
adopt this rule simply because of its
recent vintage. Accordingly, the Board
finds such arguments unpersuasive.

4, Comparison With Other Statutes That
Contain Notice-Posting Requirements

Many comments note, as the Board
did in the NPRM, that several other
labor and employment statutes enacted
by Congress contain express notice-
posting provisions. See 75 FR 80411
(listing such statutes). Though a few
such comments, such as those of the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters,
applaud the Board for “‘fill[ing] this
glaring and indefensible gap,” the bulk
of these comments instead argue that
the lack of a parallel statutory provision
in the NLRA negates the existence of
Board authority to issue this rule.

The Board notes that inferences
gleaned from side-by-side comparisons
to other statutes have diminished force
when an agency uses its gap-filling
authority under Chevron. There are
many possible reasons why Congress
did not include an express notice-
posting provision in the NLRA.
“Perhaps that body consciously desired
the [agency] to strike the balance at this
level * * *; perhaps it simply did not
consider the question at this level; and
perhaps Congress was unable to forge a
coalition on either side of the question
* * * ” Chevron, 467 U.S. at 865. But,
“(flor judicial purposes, it matters not
which of these things occurred.” Id.
Indeed, the central premise behind
Chevron and its progeny is that agencies
should be allowed reasonable latitude to
fill gaps arising from congressional
silence or ambiguity. Accordingly, “the
contrast between Congress’s mandate in
one context with its silence in another
suggests not a prohibition but simply a
decision not to mandate any solution in
the second context, i.e., to leave the
question to agency discretion.’’ Cheney
R.R. Co. v. ICC, 902 F.2d 66, 69 (D.C.
Cir. 1990) (labeling the expressio unius
est exclusio alterius canon “an
especially feeble helper’ in Chevron
cases).

Arguments contrasting the NLRA with
other federal enactments that contain
notice-posting requirements might have
some persuasive force if there were

evidence that Congress had considered
and rejected inserting such a
requirement into the Act. However,
nothing in the legislative history of the
Act so indicates. Indeed, there is not the
slightest hint that the omission of a
notice-posting requirement was the
product of legislative compromise and
therefore implies congressional rejection
of the idea. Cf. Ind. Prot. & Advocacy
Servs. v. Ind. Family & Soc. Servs.
Admin., 603 F.3d 365, 384-85 (7th Cir.
2010) (en banc) (Posner, J., concurring)
(inferring a private right of action from
statutory silence in a case where such
silence was not the product of
“legislative compromise’’). For these
reasons, the Board rejects the Motor and
Equipment Manufacturers Association’s
unsupported suggestion that there has
been an affirmative “legislative
determination not to include a posting
requirement by employers that have not
violated the Act.”

A number of comments point out that
Congress included a general notice-
posting provision in the Railway Labor
Act (RLA), which predates the NLRA.
Given the relative proximity of these
two enactments, some comments regard
the absence of a notice-posting
provision in the NLRA as strong
evidence that Congress did not intend
for there to be one. For reasons just
explained, the Board does not find a
side-by-side comparison with the RLA
availing. In addition, the Board notes
that although the NLRA and the RLA
share several common features, the
NLRA was not perfectly modeled after
the RLA. See Bhd. of R.R. Trainmen v.
Chi. River & Ind. R.R. Co., 353 U.S. 30,
31 n.2 (1957) (“The relationship of labor
and management in the railroad
industry has developed on a pattern
different from other industries. The
fundamental premises and principles of
the Railway Labor Act are not the same
as those which form the basis of the
National Labor Relations Act * * *.”’).

Finally, the Board notes that other
federal departments and agencies have
not understood Congress’s failure to
include an express provision containing
a notice-posting requirement in a federal
labor or employment statute as a bar to
such a regulatory requirement. Like the
NLRA, the Fair Labor Standards Act
(FLSA), which was passed in 1938, does
not contain a provision requiring
employers to post a notice of pertinent
employee rights. Yet the Department of
Labor adopted a notice requirement now
codified at 29 CFR 516.4. Furthermore,
the Board is unaware of any challenge
to the Labor Department’s authority to
promulgate or enforce the FLSA notice
requirement, which has been in effect
for over 60 years. See 14 FR 7516 (Dec.

Yitzhak Rabin's Moral Answer to the Israeli Dilemma of Peace and Survival - US News

binational state in which one people ruled another.

He was uniquely qualified for this adventure. Those to his political right had the strength but not the will to
take a calculated risk for peace. Those to his political left had the will but not the strength, He alone, at the
time, had the capacity to persuade the divided and wary Israelis to accept a compromise arrangement with
the Palestine Liberation Organization that held great promise for peace but also great risk. But the risk was
seen as a risk from the Arabs, not the risk of Jew killing Jew, What the right-wing fanatics were blind to is
that their murderous intransigence threatened the state that gave them succor and its necessary
acceptance by the world. Without the flame of peace, they would have nothing but bloodshed threatening
every Israeli's personal security.

[ZUCKERMAN: The Palestinians’ Lies Are Fueling the Violence]

The debate over security in Israel is different from the quarrel with the extremists. Many moderate people
all across Israel are concerned about giving up land, because for years their leaders told them this land
was essential to their national security. In Israel, security decisions are made in the context of the terrible
reality that a single Israeli strategic blunder may mean not only military defeat but a genocidal threat to the
very existence of the state — one that the world could nat forestall, even if it were willing to. Many Israelis
ask: Will the peace process be the beginning of a new future or the beginning of the end?

The Israelis are determined to avoid another genocide, this time in Israel. The decision to exchange lawfully
captured territory for the promise of peace from those who have constantly threatened violence is fraught
with unprecedented risk. Israel will not survive in this neighborhood by superior morality in the absence of
superior real strength. Arab moderation is in direct proportion to Israeli strength. If the Arabs could defeat
Israel, who could doubt that sooner or later they would try?

Can Shimon Peres, a durable politician less trusted by Israelis, lead the people in pursuit of Rabin's twin
goals of peace and security? He is a consummate international diplomat and served with great distinction
as prime minister a decade ago. His ardent desire for peace may be part of his problem, for many people
believe he is too eager to cut a deal, too dovish and not skeptical enough about security issues, too
wrapped up in his own ambitions. So his challenge is to relieve the worries of Israelis as well as meet the
needs of the Palestinians.

In this effort, American support is crucial. Rabin said he was elected to take risks for peace. President
Clinton said, “If that is your goal, | will do my best to minimize the risks you must take. That is the fire of
friendship and support that will enable Israel to fulfill what Rabin so bravely began.

that this administration under President Obama is doing in regard to our security more than anything that I can
remember in the past.”

While Romney had time for a $50,000-a-plate breakfast with American Jewish donors in Jerusalem, with
Adelson at his elbow, he did not have two hours to go to Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority, to meet
with its president, Mahmoud Abbas, or to share publicly any ideas on how he would advance the peace process.
He did have time, though, to point out to his Jewish hosts that Israelis are clearly more culturally entrepreneurial
than Palestinians. Israel today is an amazing beehive of innovation — thanks, in part, to an influx of Russian
brainpower, massive U.S. aid and smart policies. It’s something Jews should be proud of. But had Romney gone
to Ramallah he would have seen a Palestinian beehive of entrepreneurship, too, albeit small, but not bad for a
people living under occupation. Palestinian business talent also built the Persian Gulf states. In short, Romney
didn’t know what he was talking about.

On peace, the Palestinians’ diplomacy has been a fractured mess, and I still don’t know if they can be a partner
for a secure two-state deal with even the most liberal Israeli government. But I do know this: It is in Israel’s
overwhelming interest to test, test and have the U.S. keep testing creative ideas for a two-state solution. That is
what a real U.S. friend would promise to do. Otherwise, Israel could be doomed to become a kind of apartheid
South Africa.

And here is what I also know: The three U.S. statesmen who have done the most to make Israel more secure and
accepted in the region all told blunt truths to every Israeli or Arab leader: Jimmy Carter, who helped forge a
lasting peace between Israel and Egypt; Henry Kissinger, who built the post-1973 war disengagement
agreements with Syria, Israel and Egypt; and James Baker, who engineered the Madrid peace conference. All of
them knew that to make progress in this region you have to get in the face of both sides. They both need the
excuse at times that “the Americans made me do it,” because their own politics are too knotted to move on their
own.

So how about all you U.S. politicians — Republicans and Democrats — stop feeding off this conflict for
political gain. Stop using this conflict as a backdrop for campaign photo-ops and fund-raisers. Stop making
things even worse by telling the most hard-line Israelis everything that they want to hear, just to grovel for
Jewish votes and money, while blatantly ignoring the other side. There are real lives at stake out there. If you’re
not going to do something constructive, stay away. They can make enough trouble for themselves on their own.

Nevertheless, we believe that some of the headwinds that have plagued this sector will continue.
These include:

e Data privacy issues impacting a broad range of companies, including Facebook, Google,
Twitter, Alipay and Tencent.

e High likelihood of greater regulatory scrutiny in the US? and Europe as policy makers
increasingly believe that these companies will not address “the privacy and security issues of
social media users” on their own.

e Increased focus by ESG investors (Environment, Social, and Governance) that many of the
technology and social media companies are falling short on social and governance issues.

While this basket of stocks may or may not lead the market in the future, it is important to note that
they represent only 10% of S&P 500 earnings.

Investment Implications

The recent market downdraft has understandably rekindled fears that the longest bull market in
history is coming to an end. While there are no certainties in investing, we do not think the odds
support that conclusion based on our read of the steady and unsteady factors discussed above. Keep
in mind that about 75% of historical US bear markets—defined here as equity market declines of 20%
or more—have occurred during economic recessions. In fact, US equity returns have remained
favorable until about five to six months prior to the onset of recession, highlighting the penalty for
prematurely exiting the market (see Exhibit 11). With only 10% odds of recession over the next year,
we think the economic backdrop remains favorable for stocks.

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016908.txt,"Forget clockwork analogies; our brains are closer to a system of canals and locks, with
signals traveling like water from one state to another.

As I sit here typing, I’m actually seeking equilibrium states in an n-dimensional
topology of gradients. Take just one: heat. My body temperature is higher than the air
temperature, so I radiate heat, which must be replenished in my core. Even the bacteria
in my digestive tract use sensors to measure sugar concentrations in the liquid around
them and whip their tail-like flagella to swim “upstream” where the sugar supply is
richest. The natural state of all systems is to flow to lower energy states, a process that is
broadly described by entropy (the tendency of things to go from ordered to disordered
states; all things will fall apart eventually, including the universe itself).

But how do you explain more complex behavior, such as our ability to make
decisions? The answer is just more gradient descent.

Our Brains

As miraculous and inscrutable as our human intelligence is, science is coming around to
the view that our brains operate the same way as any other complex system with layers
and feedback loops, all pursuing what we mathematically call “optimization functions”
but you could just as well call “flowing downhill” in some sense.

The essence of intelligence is learning, and we do that by correlating inputs with
positive or negatives scores (rewards or punishment). So, for a baby, “this sound” (your
mother’s voice) is associated with other learned connections to your mother, such as food
or comfort. Likewise, “this muscle motion brings my thumb closer to my mouth.” Over
time and trial and error, the brain’s neural network reinforces those connections.
Meanwhile “this muscle motion does not bring my thumb close to my mouth” is a
negative correlation, and the brain will weaken those connections.

However, this is too simplistic. The limits of gradient descent constitute the so-
called local-minima problem (or local-maxima problem, if you’re doing a gradient
ascent). If you are walking in a mountainous region and want to get home, always
walking downhill will most likely get you to the next valley but not necessarily over the
other mountains that lie around it and between you and home. For that, you need either a
mental model (i.e., a map) of the topology so you know where to ascend to get out of the
valley, or you need to switch between gradient descent and random walks so you can
bounce your way out of the region.

Which 1s, in fact, exactly what the mosquito does in following my scent: It
descends when it’s in my plume and random-walks when it has lost the trail or hit an
obstacle.

Al
So that’s nature. What about computers? Traditional software doesn’t work that way—it
follows deterministic trees of hard logic: “If this, do that.” But software that interacts
with the physical world tends to work more /ike the physical world. That means dealing
with noisy inputs (sensors or human behavior) and providing probabilistic, not
deterministic, results. And that, in turn, means more gradient descent.

AI software is the best example of this, especially the kinds of AI that use
artificial neural-network models (including convolutional, or “deep,” neural networks of
many layers). In these, a typical process consists of “training” them by showing them

Sing, one of San Francisco’s six major community organizations representing Chinese
immigrants, became the first major Chinese group to fly the flag of the PRC on its building.
Then a second Tong declared its fealty to Beijing, and a competition broke out between the
PRC and Taiwan in San Francisco’s Chinatown to see which side could fly the most flags.
This competition can be vividly seen from the seventeenth floor of a public housing project
overlooking Chinatown, where PRC and Republic of China flags sit atop adjacent buildings
stretching into the horizon. The value of these associations to Beijing can be seen in this
example: When China’s president Xi Jinping visited the United States in September 2015,
one of the leaders of San Francisco’s local Chinese American community associations

was listed as first among twenty prominent Chinese Americans honored by the Chinese
president.?!

Chinese Americans and the Chinese People’s Consultative Conference

Several Chinese Americans are so trusted by Beijing that they are direct participants in
China’s most prominent national united front body, the Chinese People’s Consultative
Conference (CPPCC). The preamble of China’s constitution defines the Chinese People’s
Political Consultative Conference as “a broadly based representative organization of the
united front which . . . will play a still more important role in the country’s political and
social life, in promoting friendship with other countries and in the struggle for socialist
modernization and for the reunification and unity of the country.” In practice, the CPPCC
has served as an important advisory committee to help legitimize Chinese Communist
Party’s rule both domestically and abroad.

Beijing has been appointing Chinese Americans to the CPPCC for years. In some cases,
authorities in Beijing seem to have had problems finding appropriately influential
Americans to take seats on the committee, such as in 2017, when a Chinese property
developer and educator (who appears to still be a Chinese citizen) was one of seven
“Americans” listed as CPPCC members.”

In doling out prestigious positions on the CPPCC, China seeks to show overseas

Chinese that prominent members of their community want to be connected with

China’s government. The American contingent to the thirteenth CPPCC (announced in
March 2018) was no exception. Perhaps the most remarkable in years, the list of thirty-
five overseas representatives included four highly successful Chinese American academics,
scientists, and businessmen.”?

The appointment of Chinese Americans to positions on this advisory body to the Chinese
Communist Party raises difficult questions of divided national loyalty. Americans should,
of course, be free to participate in whatever organizations they see fit, since freedom of
association is hardwired into the constitutional DNA of the United States. However, the
CPPCC is not an independent civil society NGO, but an organization controlled, managed,

worthy of being issued against the leader or leadership of the Hamas

is highly united, and its decisions are one.

Senior Hamas official Dr. Salah al-Bardawil confirmed to Asharq Al-

outlets are trying to convince the public that there is division within
the ranks of Hamas. Al-Bardawil also stressed that Hamas figures
have the right to issue their statements using whatever language they
wish so long as they are expressing their own views and ideas, and
this does not mean that there is a split in the Hamas movement's
decision.

Dr. Bardawil also stressed to Asharg Al-Awsat that Hamas is under
the leadership of Khalid Meshal, adding that Hamas is a resistance
movement that believes that resistance is the means of liberating
Palestine, especially after it has became clear to everybody that it
would be a terrible gamble to bet on these futile negotiations.

The Zionism-Racism resolution was followed by a deluge of anti-Israel sentiment in the General
Assembly, the Security Council, and the UN Council on Human Rights. At the 1978 session,
“several speakers drew a parallel between Zionism and apartheid,” insisting that “those selective
and racist regimes should be outlawed by the international community.” In 1979, after the
Cambodian genocide was already completed but before any major UN body condemned the
genocide, there were more comparisons between Zionism and apartheid, with some delegates
drawing a parallel “between Nazi policies against the Jews and Israeli brutalities against the
people of Palestine.”

When the General Assembly itself finally addressed the Cambodian genocide in a resolution, it did
so in tepid terms compared to its treatment of Israel. The General Assembly simply noted “with
great concern that the armed conflict in Kampuchea [Cambodia] and is seriously threatening the
peace and stability of South-East Asia.” In contrast, a resolution passed that same year “deplores
the continued and persistent violation by Israel of the Geneva Convention relative to the
Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, and other applicable
international instruments, and condemns in particular those violations which that Convention
designates as ‘grave breaches’ thereof.”

True to form, Chomsky related Cambodia to Israel, inverting the actual seriousness of the human
rights violations and asserting that “condemnation of Cambodian atrocities, covering the full
spectrum with the exception of some Maoist groups, had reached a level and scale that has rarely
been matched, whereas the situation of the Arabs under Israeli occupation (or indeed, in Israel
itself) is virtually a taboo topic in the United States.”

The Zionism-racism resolution was ultimately rescinded in 1991 by a vote of the General
Assembly, but it continued to animate U.N. actions, especially by the “Human Rights Council” of
the U.N. (previously known as the UN Commission on Human Rights), which in 2001 convened
the first of several “Durban Conferences” against “racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and
related intolerance.” Its primary, if not exclusive, focus was on Israel. It virtually ignored racial
genocides, slavery and other obvious manifestations of racism and discrimination. The final
preparatory session was held in Tehran. All Israelis and all Jewish NGO’s were excluded.

According to Irwin Cotler, the former Attorney General of Canada, who attended the conference,
the air was filled with hate speech such as “too bad the Holocaust was not completed.” The
conference became a “festival of hate such that we had not experienced anywhere at any time
before.” It was “a state sanctioned culture of hate” which, to Cotler, “is the most dangerous
form of anti-Semitism that we are witnessing in the 21* Century.” And all of this was done under
the Aegis of the U.N.! Even the U.N. High Commissioner for human rights—Mary Robinson, no
friend of Israel—was appalled at what she was witnessing. The Arab Lawyers’ Union distributed
a booklet of anti-Semitic cartoons that could have been published by Der Sturmer. The Jerusalem
Post reported Robinson’s reaction:

be, it is unclear that the newcomers would follow the Assads'
cautious-use doctrine and refusal to share chemical weapons with non-
state groups, or that the new leaders would be able to maintain strict
security measures at the chemical sites.

Meanwhile, it's possible that an existential threat will cause the Assad
regime to abandon its previous policy of restraint regarding chemical
weapons. It is not a huge leap from attacking civilians with tank fire,
machine guns, and naval artillery to deploying poison gas, and the
shock effect and sense of dread engendered by even limited use could
quash a city-wide uprising within an hour.

The options available to the United States to minimize these risks are
limited at best. Washington has certainly warned Assad against using
the weapons domestically. But with Assad already at risk of
indictment for crimes against humanity, and given his likely belief
that the United States will not intervene militarily due to its
commitments elsewhere -- including its politically unpopular and still
Opaque involvement in Libya -- U.S. warnings may have little
deterrent effect.

A preemptive Israeli military strike to destroy the weapons does not
appear technically feasible: Even if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu were ready to change the status quo, Assad is believed to
have stored bulk chemical agents and filled (or quickly filled) shells
and bombs in underground bunkers at multiple sites throughout the
country. Moreover, even if Israel used incendiary bombs in an
attempt to incinerate the chemical agents, the risk of dispersing large
quantities of poisonous liquids would remain, with the potential to
cause large-scale casualties.

The Obama administration needs to start planning now to manage
Assad's chemical weapons legacy. If a new government replaces
Assad -- or even if different groups compete for international
recognition -- a U.S.-led coalition, including Turkey and the leading

State and Local Governments

In late 2017, an American city in the mid-Atlantic region was invited to form a sister
city relationship with a town in southern China. The American partner city was home
to a large number of national security professionals and university and government
scientists, including many of PRC origin. The partnership was proposed and
shepherded by the manager of a for-profit Chinese “exchanges” company—a woman
of PRC origin. She was assisted by an American citizen of PRC origin who was running

for a position on the local school board.

In a briefing, an American China expert told the local sister city committee that there
was no reason not to explore a partnership, provided the American side had defined
goals and was aware of Beijing’s increasingly repressive domestic policies, its growing
suspicions of US influence, and its well-funded efforts to increase its influence overseas.
The man running for the local school board objected to this characterization and

pointed out that China’s constitution gives the CCP paramount authority in China.

After a long debate, the new sister city agreement was signed in the fall of 2018.

Some Americans involved objected to China’s insistence that all sister city activities
be carried out “in accordance with the principles on the establishment of diplomatic
relations between the United States of America and the People’s Republic of China
(ARGS A B32 Xe M),” because this seemed to be a reference to the One China
Principle, which might be invoked to preclude exchanges with Taiwan. Despite these
objections, the phrase appeared in the signed agreement because the Chinese side said
that the Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries required
that all sister city agreements include such language and the US side did not want to

derail the agreement by insisting otherwise.

The story of this sister city agreement illustrates the challenges and opportunities
“sub-national entities” (local governments, cities, and states) face in the United States
when dealing with a China intent on maximizing its influence in America and across
the globe. As this report details in other sections, the age of innocent engagement

is over, and this is now true for American local officials as well as for representatives

Is Shame Necessary?
Jennifer Jacquet
Jennifer Jacquet graduated with a master’s degree in environmental economics from Cornell
University in 2004 and earned a PhD in 2009 from the University of British Columbia, where
she now holds a postdoctoral fellowship. As part of the Sea Around Us Project, a joint
collaboration between the university and the Pew Charitable Trusts, she researches marketbased
conservation initiatives related to seafood and other natural resources. With colleagues
from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology and UBC’s Mathematics Department,
she is currently conducting a series of games and experiments to study the effects of honor and
shame on cooperation.
Financial executives received almost $20 billion in bonuses in 2008 amid a serious financial
crisis and a $245 billion government bailout. In 2008, more than 3 million American homes went
into foreclosure because of mortgage blunders those same executives helped facilitate. Citigroup
proposed to buy a $50-million corporate jet in early 2009, shortly after receiving $45-billion in
taxpayer funds. Days later, President Obama took note in an Oval Office interview. About the
jet, he said, “They should know better.” And the bonuses, he said, were “shameful.”
What is shame’s purpose? Is shame still necessary? These are questions I’m asking
myself. After all, it is not just bankers we have to worry about. Most social dilemmas exhibit a
similar tension between individual and group interest. Energy, food, and water shortages, climate
disruption, declining fisheries, increasing antibiotic resistance, the threat of nuclear warfare—all
can be characterized as tragedies of the commons, in which the choices of individuals conflict
with the greater good.
Balancing group- and self-interest has never been easy, yet human societies display a
high level of cooperation. To attain that level, specialized traits had to evolve, including such
emotions as shame. 1 Shame is what is supposed to occur after an individual fails to cooperate

with the group. Shame regulates social behavior and serves as a forewarning of punishment:
Conform or suffer the consequences. The earliest feelings of shame were likely over issues of
waste management, greediness, and incompetence. While guilt is evoked by an individual’s
standards, shame is the result of group standards. Therefore, shame, unlike guilt, is felt only in
the context of other people.
The first hominids could keep track of cooperation and defection only by firsthand
observation. Many animals use visual observations to decide whether to work with others. Reef
fish in the Red Sea, for instance, watch wrasses clean other reef fish, to determine whether or not
they’re cooperative, as biologist Redouan Bshary discovered. Bshary went scuba diving off
Egypt’s coast to observe this symbiotic relationship. Bluestreak cleaner wrasses (Labroides
dimidiatus) eat parasites, along with dead or infected tissue, off reef fishes in more than 2,000
interactions a day, each of which can be considered an act of cooperation. Wrasses are tempted
to eat more than just the parasites, but if the reef fish loses too much flesh in the deal, it will
refuse to continue working with the wrasse. Reef fish approach wrasses that they see cooperating
with their current clients and avoid the wrasses they see biting off more than they should chew. 2
Like the Bluestreak cleaner wrasses, humans are also more cooperative when they sense
they are being watched. Researchers at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne examined the
effect of a pair of eyes on payments for tea and coffee to an honesty box. Alternating images of
flowers and human faces were posted above the box in the university coffee room each week for
ten weeks; researchers found that people paid nearly three times as much for their drinks in

weeks during which they were exposed to the human gaze. 3
The feeling of being watched enhances cooperation and so does the ability to watch
others. To try to know what others are doing is a fundamental part of being human. So is fitting
in. The more collectivist the human society, the more important it is to conform and the more
prominent the role of shame. 4 Shame serves as a warning to adhere to group standards or be
prepared for peer punishment. Many individualistic societies, however, have migrated away from
peer punishment toward a third-party penal system, such as a hired police force, formal
contracts, or trial by jury. Shame has become less relevant in societies where taking the law into
one’s own hands is viewed as a breach of civility.
Perhaps this is why it makes us uncomfortable to contemplate shaming people: Shame
invites the public in on the punishment. Consider the scaffolds, scab lists during union strikes, or
Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter. Or the proposal made by prominent conservative
William F. Buckley Jr. in 1986 to tattoo people with AIDS. These instances of shaming now
seem an affront to individual liberty. Getting rid of shaming seems like a pretty good thing,
especially in regulating individual behavior that does not harm others. In eschewing public
shaming, society has begun to rely more heavily on individual feelings of guilt to enhance
cooperation.
Guilt prevails in many social dilemmas, including one area of my own research:
overfishing. At the root of the problem of overfishing is the human appetite. Wild fish catches
are declining, and many of us seek to avoid the guilt brought on by eating unsustainable seafood.

Here are just a few recent headlines from major newspapers: “HOLY MACKEREL AND OTHER
GUILT-FREE FISH” (New York Times), “GUILT-FREE SUSHI” (Christian Science Monitor), “COD
AND CHIPS? MAKE IT POLLOCK IN GUILT-FREE GUIDE TO SEAFOOD” (The Times of London), and
“A GOOD APPETITE; SEAFOOD, EASY AND GUILT-FREE” (New York Times).
It is perhaps unsurprising that a set of tools has emerged to assuage this guilt and, in the
case of seafood, reform the appetite. 5 These tools aim to divert demand from one type of seafood
toward another. Wallet cards, iPhone apps, and eco-labels tell consumers which fish ought to be
and ought not to be eaten. Shoppers in Europe have been given rulers, so that they can measure
fish and avoid buying juveniles.
Guilt abounds in many situations where conservation is an issue, not just in the response
to overfishing. Harried by guilt, one mother reuses her daughter’s bathwater for her own bath.
Los Angeles shoppers refuse to buy blueberries imported from Chile, because of the fuel
consumed in shipping them. Another woman feels guilty about the natural habitat lost to cocoa
cultivation and refuses to buy chocolate, prompting her husband to say that she took the joy out
of his Almond Joy. 6
Just as the devout purchased guilt-alleviating papal indulgences in the
Middle Ages, guilt-ridden consumers today buy carbon offsets, LED light bulbs, and hybrid cars
and can be guided to something approaching sanctimony by books like The Virtuous Consumer,
The Rough Guide to Shopping with a Conscience, and The Eco Chick Guide to Life: How to Be
Fabulously Green.
The problem is that environmental guilt, while it may well lead to conspicuous
ecomarkets, does not seem to elicit conspicuous results. One supermarket chain introduced signs
at the fish counter to show the most and least sustainable seafood: Sales of the green-tagged

“best choice” fish increased an average of 29 percent per week, sales of yellow-tagged “proceed
with caution” seafood declined an average of 27 percent per week, but the sales of the red-tagged
“worst choice” seafood—i.e., the heavily overfished species—remained the same. 7 Between
1980 and 2008, sales of pesticides increased 36 percent in the state of California, the birthing
ground of the organic food eco-label. 8 Despite sporadic instances of such measures as carpooling
and use of cloth grocery bags in lieu of plastic-or-paper, the demand for oil in the U.S.
has grown 30 percent overall and 5 percent per capita since 1990. 9 The positive effect of
idealistic consumers does exist, but it is masked by the growing demand and numbers of other
consumers.
Guilt is a valuable emotion, but it is felt by individuals and therefore motivates only
individuals. Another drawback is that guilt is triggered by an existing value within an individual.
If the value does not exist, there is no guilt and hence no action (e.g., sales for red “worst choice”
seafood remained the same). What if the aim were to promote a value felt by the group but not
necessarily by every individual in the group? Many problems, like most concerning the
environment, are group problems. Perhaps to solve these problems we need a group emotion.
Maybe we need shame.
Shaming, as noted, is unwelcome in regulating personal conduct that does not harm
others. But what about shaming conduct that does harm others? The U.S. National Sex Offender
Registry provides an online database with the names, photographs, and addresses of sex
offenders in every state. In March 2010, Nebraska lawmakers approved a bill that allows the

state to publish online the names and addresses of people owing more than $20,000 in taxes.
Judges in various states issue shaming punishments, such as sentencing pickpockets and robbers
to carry picket signs that announce their crimes to the public. These instances of shaming might
deter bad behavior, but critics like Martha Nussbaum, a political philosopher at the University of
Chicago, argue that shaming by the state conflicts with the law’s obligation to protect citizens
from insults to their dignity. 10
What if government is not involved in the shaming? A neighborhood in Leicester,
England, has a YouTube channel dedicated to neighborhood issues, including catching “litter
louts.” A collection of videos shows individuals caught in various acts of littering, and if
someone recognizes the litter lout, he or she can e-mail the lout’s identity to the neighborhood
management board, which they pass on to City Council so that fines can be issued and the video
removed. In 2008, the Santa Fe Reporter published the names and addresses of the top ten
water-using households in the city (first place went to a homeowner who used twenty-one times
the household average). The tennis club near my apartment in Vancouver, B.C. publishes the
names of people who do not pay their dues. In each of these cases, the activity of the individual
compromises the community. In none of them is the state involved in the shaming. Is this a fair
use of shaming? Is it effective?
Let’s deal with the latter question. Shaming might work to change behavior in these
cases, but in a world of urgent, large-scale problems, changing individual behavior is
insignificant. Small changes, adopted by one individual at a time, can make a difference in a
problem only when the problem is small or there is lots of time to solve it (for instance, in

marginalizing politically incorrect words). Many of today’s social movements, like the
industries they seek to revolutionize, must make big changes quickly—which is best
accomplished by directing efforts upward toward institutions. I call this vertical agitation. The
Santa Fe Reporter listed the top ten commercial water users, in addition to the top ten
households. The first of these offenders, the city of Santa Fe, used 195 times more water than the
number-one household offender. Imagine the relative difference in getting the city to commit to
water-saving techniques as compared to reforming a single household.
Guilt cannot work at the institutional level, since it is evoked by individual scruples,
which vary widely. But shame is not evoked by scruples alone; since it’s a public sentiment, it
also affects reputation, which is important to an institution. At the 2004 meeting of the World
Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, leading CEOs issued a press release about how
corporate brand reputation outranked financial performance as the most important measure of
success. For an example of how shame and reputation interact, consider restaurant hygiene cards,
introduced in 1998 by Los Angeles County as a shaming technique in the interests of public
health. Restaurants were required to display grade cards that corresponded to their most recent
government hygiene inspection. The large grade in the window—A, B, or C—honors restaurants
that value cleanliness most and shames those that value it least. The grade cards have apparently
led to increased customer sensitivity to restaurant hygiene, a 20-percent decrease in county-wide
hospitalizations for food-borne illnesses, and better hygiene scores for county restaurants. 11
Recall that in our early evolution we could gauge cooperation only first-hand. As group
size got bigger, and ancient humans grappled with issues of necessary cooperation, the human
brain became better able to keep track of all the rules and all the people. The need to

accommodate the increasing number of social connections and monitor one another could be,
according to the social grooming hypothesis put forward by British anthropologist Robin
Dunbar, why we learned to speak. 12 Then, 5,000 years ago, another tool: writing. Language, both
oral and written, allowed for gossip, a vector for social information. Research carried out by Ralf
Sommerfeld of the Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology and his colleagues
demonstrated that in cooperation games that allowed players to gossip about one another’s
performance, positive gossip resulted in higher cooperation. Of even greater interest, gossip
affected the players’ perceptions of others even when they had access to firsthand information. 13
Human society today is so big that its dimensions have outgrown our brains. We have an
increasing number of people and norms. What tool could help us gossip in a group this size?
Nowadays we keep track of and distribute unprecedented amounts of information via our
computers: for example, citizens, journalists, and interest groups can access the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency’s Toxics Release Inventory database online to identify and
shame polluters. Between the database’s inception in 1988 and 1995, releases of 330 toxic
chemicals on the list have declined by 45 percent. 14
After the retailer Trader Joe’s was
unresponsive to requests by the nonprofit group Greenpeace to stop selling unsustainable
seafood, Greenpeace coordinated singing fish telephone calls or demonstrations at every Trader
Joe’s across the nation using the Internet. The Trader Joe’s CEO decided to comply with
Greenpeace demands by dropping several overfished species and agreeing to source all seafood
from sustainable sources by the end of 2012.

humans to evoke the shame that leads to cooperation. In addition, the emergence of new tools—
language, writing, the Internet—cannot completely replace the eyes. Face to face interactions,
such as those outside of Trader Joe’s stores, are still the most impressive form of dissent.
So what is stopping shame from catalyzing social change? I see three main drawbacks:
(1.) Today’s world is rife with ephemeral, or “one-off,” interactions. When you know
you are unlikely to run into the same situation again, there is less incentive to change your
behavior. Research shows, however, that if people know they will interact again, cooperation
improves. 15 Shame works better if the potential for future interaction is high. In a world of oneoff
interactions, we can try to compensate for anonymity with an image score, such as the
hygiene grade cards or EBay’s seller ratings, which sends a signal to the group about an
individual or an institution’s degree of cooperation.
(2.) Today’s world allows for amorphous identities. Recall the reef fish that observe
Bluestreak cleaner wrasses in the Red Sea. The wrasses seem to know they are being watched,
and certain wrasses will build their reputation on the small reef fish, allowing the big reef fish to
observe their cooperative behavior with the small fry. Then, when the big fish comes in for its
own cleaning, these wrasses eat some of the big reef fish’s flesh along with its parasites,
fattening themselves on their defection. To add to the confusion on the reef, False cleanerfish
(Aspidontus taeniatus) make their living by looking very similar to the Bluestreak cleaner
wrasses. They are able to approach reef fish under the guise of cooperation and then bite off
pieces of fish flesh and swim off.
Many of our interactions these days are similar to the fish cleanings in the Red Sea. It’s

hard to keep track of who cooperates and who doesn’t, especially if it’s institutions you’re
monitoring. Enron, which in 2001 filed one of the largest bankruptcies in U.S. history, hid
billions of dollars in debt in hundreds of shell firms, which bought poorly performing Enron
stocks so that Enron could create a fraudulent company profile and mislead its auditors. Lehman
Brothers, in the years before its 2008 collapse, used a smaller firm called Hudson Castle (of
which it owned 25 percent) to shift risky investments off its books so that Hudson Castle, not
Lehman Brothers, could absorb “headline risk.” Which leads us to shaming’s third weakness.
(3.) Shaming’s biggest drawback is its insufficiency. Some people have no shame. In the
research my colleagues and I have conducted on first-year students, involving games that require
cooperation, we have found that shame does not encourage cooperation among those players
who are least cooperative. This suggests that a certain fraction of a given population will always
behave shamelessly, like the False cleanerfish, if the payoff is high enough. The banks may have
gone bankrupt, but the bankers got their bonuses. There was even speculation that publishing
individual banker bonuses would lead to banker jealousy, not shame.
My colleagues and I conclude that ultimately shame is not enough to catalyze major
social change. Slavery did not end because abolitionists shamed slave owners into freeing their
slaves. Child labor did not stop because factories were shamed into forbidding children to work.
Destruction of the ozone layer did not slow because industries were ashamed to manufacture
products that contained chlorofluorocarbons. This is why punishment remains imperative. Even
if shaming were enough to bring the behavior of most people into line, governments need a
system of punishment to protect the group from the least cooperative players.
Finally, consider who belongs to the group. Today we are faced with the additional
challenge of balancing human interests and the interests of nonhuman life. How can we
  10

encourage cooperation between all living things when the nonhumans have no voice? Successful
species will likely be those that recognize, implicitly or explicitly, life’s interdependency. If
humans are to succeed as a species, our collective shame over destroying other life-forms should
grow in proportion to our understanding of their various ecological roles. Maybe the same
attention to one another that promoted our own evolutionary success will keep us from failing
the other species in life’s fabric and, in the end, ourselves.

Massaging the system

Palm Beach Post Editorial

Thursday, August 10, 2006

Palm Beach police say their 11-month investigation shows that 53-year-old part-time
town resident Jeffrey Epstein committed unlawful sex acts with and lewd and lascivious
molestation on five underage girls. Defense attorney Jack Goldberger claims that his
client, Jeffrey Epstein, had no idea that the untrained girls he hired for massages were
minors.

The Palm Beach Count State Attorney's Office could have let a jury decide whom to
believe. Instead, State Attorney Barry Krischer left the public to wonder whether the
system tilted in favor of a wealthy, well-connected alleged perpetrator and against very
young girls who are alleged victims of sex crimes.

Mr. Krischer took the unusual step of referring the case to a grand jury, which last month
indicted Jeffrey Epstein on one felony count of solicitation of prostitution. That decision
came after Harvard law Professor Alan Dershowitz met with prosecutors to undermine
the credibility of the 14- to 17-yearold girls who charged that Mr. Epstein had paid them
$200 to $300 to undress and massage him in his five-bedroom, 7 1/2 -bath home on the
Intracoastal Waterway.

The girls, Mr. Dershowitz told prosecutors, had written on myspace.com about smoking
marijuana and drinking alcohol. But if the girls have a credibility problem, what about
Jeffrey Epstein? Mr. Goldberger, told The Post: Mr. Epstein absolutely insisted anybody
who came to his house be over the age of 18. How he verified that, I don't know. And
prosecutors took him at his word?

Police collected evidence that refutes Jeffrey Epstein’s defense. Police searched his home
and garbage and found phone messages about the girls’ school schedules and even a high
school transcript, suggesting that Mr. Epstein at least knew that the girls were teenagers.
The state attorney's office has responded to criticism from Palm Beach police and others
by noting the higher standard prosecutors face for conviction than law-enforcement
officers do for arrest. But in this case, the state attorney bowed to the risk that a jury
might look at both Jeffrey Epstein and the girls, and point fingers at both sides.

Even if the girls could be impugned as prostitutes, solicitation of a minor is a crime.
Former disc jockey and teacher Bruno Moore was charged with that Tuesday.
Investigators say the 34-year-old used the Internet - myspace.com - to recruit a 13-year
old.

Police say Jeffrey Epstein used a 20-year-old woman who had a myspace.com

account to recruit young girls. His actions were sleazy. It would have been good to ask a
jury just how criminal they were.

For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. Person means (1) a citizen or resident of the U.S., (2) a
corporation created or organized in or under the laws of any Stafe of the U.S. (including the District of
Columbia}, (3) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its
source, (4) a trust if either (a) a court within the U.S. is able to exercise primary supervision over the
administration of such trust and one cr more U.S, Persons have the authority to control all substantial
decisions of such trust or (b) the trust has a valid election in effect to be treated as a U.S. Person for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, or (5) any other person or entity that is treated for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as if it were one of the foregoing. The term “non-U.S. Person” means any person other than a
U.S. Person.

18.2.1 United States Federal Income Taxation of KUE and its Subsidiaries

Partnership Status of KUE. KUE believes that it should be classified as a partnership for United States
federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, KUE fs not a taxable entity and incurs no U.S. federal income
tax liability. Instead, each Partner will be allocated its share of KUE’s income or loss, as the case may be,
for United States federal income tax purposes as set forth in the Limited Partnership Agreement. [n
addition, each U.S. Partner's share of income or loss from KUE generaily will be required to be includable
in income for state and local tax purposes in the jurisdiction in which the investor is a resident and in the
jurisdictions in which KUE operates. Each U.S. Partner will be responsible for paying the income tax on
that portion of KUE’s income allocated to such investor. No assurances can be given that any cash
distribution will be made from KUE to the partners to pay such income tax liabilities.

Under the Code, certain non-U.S corporations may be treated as U.S. corporations for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, thereby subjecting such non-U.S. corporations to U.S. federal income tax on their
income. Recently enacted U.S. tax legislation includes one such provision. Under this legislation,
referred to as the anti-inversion legislation, non-U.S. corporations that acquire interests in a U.S.
corporation or partnership and meet certain ownership, operational and other tests may be treated as U.S.
corporations for federal income tax purposes. The legislation grants broad regulatory authority to the U.S.
Secretary of Treasury to provide such regulations as may be appropriate to determine whether a non-US.
corporation is treated as a U.S. corporation or as are necessary to carry out the intent of the provision,
including adjusting its application as necessary to prevent the avoidance of its purpose. Recently issued

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010965.txt,"Risk tolerance might be anything in any individual. As a norm, it tends to bea
function of age, gender and wealth. Effects of age and gender are better understood.
Teens and young adults, particularly males, seem readiest to take chances. Prison
populations and medal of honor rolls feature young males. Part of the explanation, |
think, is biologist R. A. Fisher’s sex ratio theory of 1930, or equally Bob Trivers’
differential investment theory of 1971. Young males show greatest variance in
reproductive prospects. Females are almost always assured of a few offspring.
Young males might leave none or many. Nature arranges tournaments or displays to

give fitter males the advantage.

Another reason is that the young, of either sex, have most time left to outride

downswings. The older we get, the more risk-averse.

Some businesses and assets are inherently riskier than others. Nerf balls are safer
than hand grenades. But | prefer to look past the asset owned to the owner. We tend
to own assets suited to our risk preferences. And we tend to operate it as safely or
riskily as we like. That is true particularly of human capital, although it was first
designed according to our parents’ goals rather than ours. Human capital is
probably the most versatile asset, even so, and is adapted to our purposes rather
than theirs. We make it as risky as we choose. The risk-averse can become florists or
Trappists. Risk lovers can try bullfighting or skydiving. What does that tell us about

the relative risk of the factors?

Human capital is owned disproportionately by the young. We own very little
physical capital, legally or in practical effect, until maturity. Pay at first is barely
enough for survival. We accumulate it gradually as pay rises with age, and then
deplete it in provision for the young and in our own retirement. Since physical
capital is owned disproportionately by the older and more risk-averse, and human

capital the contrary, human capital figures to be higher on average in risk and return.

In State of the Union  
address, Obama lays out 
his second-term agenda  
Editorial 
February 13, 2013 -- TWO DOMESTIC 
concerns towered above all others as 
President Obama addressed a joint session 
of Congress on Tuesday night on the state  
of the union. One was stubbornly slow 
economic growth. The other was the long-
term threat to prosperity posed by the 
structural mismatch between the federal 
government's projected revenue and its 
spending commitments. A successful 
second term for Mr. Obama will require 
both credible proposals for overcoming 
those related challenges and the 
determination to carry them through. 
The president addressed the deficit and 
debt first, and at some length. This was 
fitting, giving that the most pressing piece 
of business facing Washington is what to 
do about the impending $85 billion across-
the-board spending cut. He was forthright

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028675 
in declaring that this so-called sequester 
threatens the military as well as domestic 
programs. But his plan to avoid it basically 
repeated the offer of a balanced approach 
— unspecified tax hikes and spending cuts 
— which Republicans have already 
rejected. 
Somewhat more substantively, he called for 
a larger deficit-reduction deal built around 
loophole-closing tax reform and what he 
called modest reforms to Medicare and 
entitlements. In an apparent effort to rally 
Democrats to this cause, he called on 
those of us who care deeply about 
programs like Medicare to embrace 
reform. 
Yet in promising the same amount of 
Medicare savings as the Simpson-Bowles 
commision proposed, Mr. Obama did not 
mention that this would be a mere $341 
billion over 10 years. All told, he envisions 
shaving an additional $1.5 trillion off 
projected deficits over 10 years, which 
would leave the national debt at a 
historically aberrant 70-odd percent of 
gross domestic product. In short, he 
declined to push back against the mind-set 
within his party that considers acceptable 
stabilizing the debt at this level by the 
time Mr. Obama's second term ends. At 
best, that would buy a respite of a few 
years before the debt resumed its upward 
climb. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028676 
As for raising the economy's growth 
potential, the president was more 
persuasive. His emphasis on reforming the 
tangled and counterproductive corporate 
tax code was especially welcome, and 
relatively likely to draw GOP support. He 
offered several promising ideas on 
education, including a promise of high-
quality preschool for all children, though 
how that would square with his promise not 
to increase the deficit by a single dime 
went unexplained. He sounded a ringing 
call for greater federal attention to college 
cost containment. Taxpayers can't keep on 
subsidizing spiraling tuition, he said, 
candidly and correctly. 
As European trading partners had hoped, 
the president endorsed negotiations for a 
transatlantic free-trade zone, which would 
help America's export industries and the 
jobs that depend on them. Coupled with an 
agreement that Obama is promoting for the 
Pacific region, the proposal has the 
potential to make his second term fruitful 
for global trade. He also suggested raising 
the federal minimum wage, from $7.25 per 
hour to $9 — although the precise amount 
is less important, in our view, than the 
president's call for annual cost-of-living 
adjustments. 
In keeping with Mr. Obama's theme of 
nation-building at home, foreign policy 
played a secondary role in his speech. He 
promised to bring home half of the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028677 
remaining U.S. troops in Afghanistan 
within the next year. But officials said the 
withdrawal would be weighted toward 
year's end, leaving most of the troops to 
partner with Afghan troops for much of this 
year. The president said the United States 
would support democratic transitions in the 
Middle East, keep the pressure on [the] 
Syrian regime and do what is necessary 
to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear 
weapon — but he offered no specifics. 
Mr. Obama pressed his case for reform of 
immigration laws and for action to slow 
global warming — and, in especially 
moving terms, tougher gun laws. In each 
case, there may be measures he can take 
through executive action, but new laws will 
be needed for substantial progress. 
Mr. Obama was right when he pointed to 
the survivors and grieving relatives of gun 
violence victims and insisted, They 
deserve a vote. 
Article 2 
Foreign Policy 
The world is no longer 
America's problem  
Aaron David Miller 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028678 
February 13, 2013 -- If you want to know 
what an American president's foreign 
policy is likely to be, particularly in a 
second term, don't listen to his State of the 
Union speech. You'd probably have more 
luck playing with Tarot cards, or reading 
tea leaves or goat entrails. But not this year. 
Barack Obama's fourth such address left a 
trail of foreign-policy cookie crumbs that 
lead directly to some pretty clear, if hardly 
surprising or revolutionary, conclusions. 
His first term contained no spectacular 
successes (save killing Osama bin Laden), 
but no spectacular failures either. And 
more than likely, that's what the president 
will settle for in a second, even as the Arab 
world burns and rogues like Iran and North 
Korea brandish new weapons. He's nothing 
if not a cautious man. 
Behold: I am the Extricator in Chief 
Afghanistan -- the good war -- has been 
pretty much MIA in Obama's speeches 
since he became president. He's alternated 
between spending a few words on the 
mission there (2009) or a paragraph (2010, 
2011, 2012). If his words have been brief, 
the message has been stunningly clear: It's 
about the leaving. And tonight was no 
exception. Not more than two minutes in, 
the president spoke about America's men 
and women coming home from 
Afghanistan. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028679 
Obama's signature is indeed that of the 
extricator. And he broke the code early (the 
2009 surge was designed politically to get 
in so that he could get out with a clearer 
conscience). He is the president who has 
wound down the longest and among the 
most profitless wars in American history, 
where victory was never defined by 
whether we can win, but by when can we 
leave. It is his legacy, and one about which 
he has reason to be proud. Obama has left 
himself and his military commanders 
plenty of discretion about the pace of 
extrication. But that's fine with the 
president so long as they're heading for the 
exits. 
Not the Destroyer and Rebuilder of Worlds 
Surprise, surprise: There was scant mention 
of Syria in the president's speech -- just one 
throwaway line about supporting Syria's 
opposition. Obama did not disengage from 
Iraq and Afghanistan only to plunge 
America into new black holes in the 
Middle East. 
Obama isn't worried about boots on the 
ground in Syria. That was never on the 
table. Instead the question is this: Given the 
uncertainty about the end state in Syria and 
the risks of providing serious weapons to 
the rebels (and a no-fly zone) that might 
alter the arc of the fight against the regime, 
the president saw and continues to see no 
purpose in America providing arms of 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028680 
marginal utility. That course would either 
expose him to be truly weak and ineffectual 
or lead to calls to do more. So he's going to 
provide non-lethal support and is 
apparently prepared to take the hits from 
critics who see the president's policy as 
passive, cruel, and unforgiving, particularly 
now that we know that members of his own 
cabinet clearly wanted to do more. The 
Iranian nuclear issue, the other potential tar 
baby in the SOTU, followed a pretty 
predictable rising arc of concern in the list 
of presidential foreign-policy worries. In 
2009, in Obama's address to a joint session 
of Congress (a speech some regard as a 
SOTU), Iran wasn't even mentioned. In the 
2010 SOTU, Obama threatened that if Iran 
ignored its international obligations, there 
would be consequences; in 2011, he did the 
same; and in 2012, he made it clear that he 
would prevent Iran from acquiring a 
nuclear weapon and take no option off the 
table. Obama repeated half of what he said 
in 2012 about preventing Iran from getting 
a nuclear weapon, but instead of saying all 
options were on the table, he spoke of the 
importance of diplomacy. I suspect he'll go 
to extreme lengths to avoid war, and won't 
greenlight an Israeli attack either until the 
arc of diplomacy has run its course. And 
then Obama would likely act only if the 
mullahs push the envelope by accelerating 
their uranium enrichment program and 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028681 
other military aspects of the nuclear 
enterprise. 
Seizing the Nuclear High Road with Little 
to Lose 
Even as he confronts a real bomb in North 
Korea (very bad options there) and a 
potential one in Iran (bad options there 
too), Obama is trying to make good on a 
longstanding commitment to reduce 
America's own nuclear arsenal. Backed by 
the military chiefs and likely by the public 
too (getting rid of nukes equals saving 
money), but opposed by Republicans in 
Congress, Obama will try to work around 
the political obstacles by seeking a deal 
with yes ... you got it ... his old friend Vlad 
Putin. It's worth a try. If Putin balks or 
Republicans get in the way, the president 
can always advocate unilateral cuts -- not 
something he wants to do. But if he can't 
have his way on nukes, he can always 
blame it on the Russians and the 
Republicans with little to lose. The road to 
getting rid of nukes is a long one. Let the 
next guy (or gal) worry about it. 
A Little Leg on Palestine? 
Obama hasn't mentioned the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict in a SOTU speech since 
2009. And that's no coincidence. His own 
poorly thought-through initial effort 
crashed and burned, leaving the president 
pretty frustrated and annoyed with both 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028682 
Israelis and Palestinians, particularly Israeli 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
But hey, that was then. A second-term 
president has committed himself early in 
2013 to a trip to Israel and has an Energizer 
bunny in Secretary of State John Kerry, 
who wants to do the right thing and keep 
the two-state solution alive. Obama clearly 
kept his distance from the issue again on 
Tuesday night. He spoke of standing with 
Israel to pursue peace, but didn't mention 
Palestinians or the peace process. He 
mentioned his own trip to the Middle East, 
but missed an opportunity to give what 
might be a trip to the region by his new 
secretary of state higher profile. It's just as 
well. The paradox of the Israeli-Palestinian 
issue is that it's too complicated to 
implement right now and too important to 
abandon. It's in this space that Obama will 
be forced to operate. And while the odds of 
success are low, Obama will be tempted in 
his final term to do something bold, 
perhaps laying out a U.S. plan of 
parameters on the key final-status issues. 
It's the Middle Class, Not the Middle East 
Spoiler alert: Barack Obama might still be 
a consequential foreign-policy president if 
he's lucky, willful, and skillful. But it's his 
domestic legacy that will make or break his 
presidency. Health care -- his signature 
legacy issue -- will look much better if the 
economy improves, driven by a revived 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028683 
housing market and rising employment, 
and of course if some broader deal can be 
struck on entitlements and taxes. 
Immigration reform and gun-control 
legislation driven by a functional 
bipartisanship would cement that legacy. 
He'd be an historic rather than a great 
president. 
Two clocks tick down in a president's 
second term: the drive for legacy and the 
reality of lame duckery. Obama's political 
capital will diminish quickly. Where, how, 
and on what he wants to spend it is critical. 
The Middle East is violent and volatile and 
may yet suck him in, but if he can avoid it, 
he'll try. This was a State of the Union 
address that stressed fixing America's 
broken house, not chasing around the world 
trying to fix everyone else's. The future of 
America isn't Cairo or Damascus; it's 
Chicago and Detroit.

Article 3. 
Agence Global 
Can the United States  
Strike a Deal with Iran?  
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028684 
Patrick Seale 
12 Feb 2013 -- Negotiations with Iran are 
once more on the international agenda. 
After an eight-month break, the five 
permanent members of the UN Security 
Council plus Germany -- the so-called 
P5+1 -- are due to hold a meeting with Iran 
on 25 February in Kazakhstan. What are 
the prospects of success? In a nutshell, that 
would seem to depend more on the climate 
in Washington than in Tehran. Iran is 
gesturing that it wants to negotiate, but 
Washington has not yet signalled any 
greater flexibility than in the past. 
In a major speech in Tehran last Sunday, 
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 
addressed the United States: Take your 
guns out of the face of the Iranian nation 
and I myself will negotiate with you, he 
declared. Meanwhile, the Iranian 
ambassador to Paris told French officials 
that, provided a work plan was agreed, Iran 
was ready to allow inspectors of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) to visit Parchin, a military facility 
where Iran is suspected of having done 
work on atomic weapons. Ahmadinejad 
himself has said repeatedly that Iran was 
ready to stop enriching uranium to 20% if 
the international community agreed to 
supply it instead to the Tehran research 
reactor for the production of isotopes 
needed to treat cancer patients. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028685 
The only recent encouraging word from the 
United States was a hint by Vice-President 
Joe Biden at last week's Munich security 
conference that the time may have come 
for bilateral U.S.-Iranian talks. Iran's 
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi 
responded positively to Biden's offer, 
although he added that Iran would look for 
evidence that Biden's offer was 'authentic' 
and not 'devious'. 
The road to a U.S.-Iranian agreement is 
littered with obstacles -- grave mutual 
distrust being one of them. There is little 
optimism among experts that a 
breakthrough is imminent. For one thing, 
Iran is almost certain to want to defer any 
major strategic decision until a new 
President is elected next June to replace the 
sharp-tongued Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. To 
strike a deal with Iran, the United States 
would also need to assure its Arab allies in 
the Gulf that they would not fall under 
Iranian hegemony or lose American 
protection. Guarantees would no doubt 
have to be given. 
Israel, America's close ally, poses a more 
substantial obstacle. It is totally opposed to 
any deal which would allow Iran to enrich 
uranium, even at the low level of 3.5%. 
Wanting no challenge to its own 
formidable nuclear arsenal, Israel's long-
standing aim has been to halt Iran's nuclear 
programme altogether. To this end it has 
assassinated several Iranian nuclear 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028686 
scientists and joined the United States in 
waging cyber warfare against Iranian 
nuclear facilities. Its belligerent prime 
minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has for 
years been pressing Obama to destroy 
Iran's nuclear programme and -- better still 
-- bring down the Islamic regime 
altogether. 
Faced with these obstacles, it is clear that 
any U.S. deal with Iran would require 
careful preparation. Obama would need to 
mobilize strong domestic support if he is to 
confront America's vast array of pro-Israeli 
forces. They include Congressmen eager to 
defend Israeli interests at all costs (as was 
vividly illustrated by the recent Chuck 
Hagel confirmation hearings), powerful 
lobbies such as AIPAC, media barons, 
high-profile Jewish financiers like Sheldon 
Adelson, a phalanx of neo-con strategists in 
right-wing think tanks, influential pro-
Israelis within the Administration, and 
many, many others. The cost in political 
capital of challenging them could be very 
substantial. Nevertheless, elected for a 
second term, he now has greater freedom 
and authority than before. 
Obama is due to visit Israel on March 20-
21, something he did not do in his first 
term. This visit will be the first foreign trip 
of his second term -- in itself a sign of its 
importance. Although the White House is 
anxious to play down suggestions that he 
will announce a major initiative, either on 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028687 
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or on Iran, 
there are issues he cannot avoid. He may, 
however, choose to raise them in private 
talks with Israeli leaders rather than in 
public. His message is expected to be 
twofold: Israel should not delay in granting 
statehood to the Palestinians, however 
painful that choice may be, and it should be 
careful not to make an eternal enemy of 
Iran. Both conflicts have the potential to 
isolate Israel internationally and threaten its 
long-term interests, if not its actual 
existence. 
In his first term of office, Obama resisted 
Netanyahu's pressure to wage war on Iran. 
This was no more than a semi-success, 
however, since he managed to blunt 
Netanyahu's belligerence only by imposing 
on Iran a raft of sanctions of unprecedented 
severity. They have halved Iran's oil 
exports, caused its currency to plummet 
and inflation to gallop, severed its relations 
with the world's banks and inflicted severe 
hardship on its population. 
The key question today is this: What are 
Obama's intentions? Is he seeking to bring 
down Iran's Islamic regime, as Israel 
would like, or is he simply seeking to limit 
its nuclear ambitions? If 'regime change' is 
his aim then sanctions will have to be 
tightened even further and extended 
indefinitely. But if Obama's aim is to strike 
a deal with Iran over its nuclear programme 
then he must give it at least some of what it 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028688 
wants: such as sanctions relief; acceptance 
of its right under the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty to enrich uranium to a 
low level for peaceful purposes; 
recognition of its security interests, of the 
legitimacy of its Islamic regime born out of 
the 1979 revolution, and of its place in the 
region as a major power. 
The P5+1, which are due to meet Iran later 
this month, remain so divided that they are 
unlikely to improve substantially on their 
previous miserly offer, which was to 
provide Iran with some airplane spare parts 
if it gave up uranium enrichment to 20% --
its trump card. It is the paralysis of Iran's 
dealings with the P5+1 that has lent 
credence to the idea that the best hope of a 
breakthrough may lie in bilateral U.S.-
Iranian talks -- perhaps even a summit 
meeting between President Obama and 
Ayatollah Khomeini. 
For such a summit to be successful the 
United States would have to change its 
approach. Iran's supreme leader has made 
clear that Iran will not negotiate under 
threat of attack. There would have to be 
give and take. Above all, Iran wants to be 
treated with respect. This is the challenge 
facing Obama. 
It is worth remembering that there is as yet 
no evidence whatsoever that Iran has 
decided to build nuclear weapons. Nor has 
it developed a reliable delivery system. 
Instead, it has focussed its efforts on 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028689 
medium-range missiles unable to reach 
Israel. It has no second strike capability. As 
President Ahmadinejad stressed during his 
visit to Cairo last week, Iran has no 
intention of attacking Israel. Its posture is 
purely defensive. 
If Obama were to act with boldness and 
vision, he could defuse a nagging problem 
which has plagued the region for years. It is 
surely time for the United States to draw 
Iran into the regional community of nations 
and put an end to 34 years of unremitting 
hostility.

What path now for Syria?  
David Ignatius  
February 12, 2013 -- Syrian opposition 
fighters appear to be making significant  
gains on the battlefield this week, 
following an offer by their top political 
leader for negotiations with the regime of 
President Bashar al-Assad. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028690 
This military and diplomatic news may 
appear positive. But Syrian sources caution 
that the battlefield advances may accelerate 
movement toward a breakup of the country, 
as Alawite supporters of the regime retreat 
to their ancestral homeland in the 
northwestern region around Latakia. And 
there's no sign that either Assad or his 
Russian patrons are paying any more than 
lip service to a political settlement. 
One potential game-changer is a request for 
U.S. help in training elite rebel units, which 
has been drafted by Brig. Gen. Salim Idriss, 
the new commander of the opposition Free 
Syrian Army. In a letter dated Feb. 4, he 
seeks U.S. assistance in training for: (1) 
special operations; (2) international 
humanitarian law; and (3) ... in chemical 
weapons security. 
Idriss requested various supplies for these 
elite units, including: (1) combat armor; 
(2) night vision goggles; (3) hand held 
monocular and longer range spotting 
equipment; (4) strategic communications; 
(5) winterization packs; and (6) tactical 
communications. 
This request for assistance was made just 
after the Assad regime had rebuffed an 
offer by Sheik Ahmad Moaz al-Khatib, the 
head of a new opposition coalition, to 
negotiate with government representatives. 
The rebels' recent military successes have 
come mostly in northern Syria; the attacks 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028691 
were made by different battalions that 
appear to operate with little central 
command and control. The gains include: 
*The al-Jarrah air base, about 30 miles east 
of Aleppo, which appears to have been 
overrun by fighters from Ahrar al-Sham, a 
battalion based in Idlib. Videos posted 
Tuesday by the rebels showed them 
walking past derelict Syrian warplanes and 
inside a fortified hangar containing what 
appeared to be two Czech-built ground 
assault planes. On camera, the rebels 
displayed dozens of bombs racked in a 
warehouse, and other ammunition and 
spoils of war. 
*The Thawra hydroelectric dam on the 
Euphrates, which is one of Syria's biggest 
power-generating facilities. Rebel sources 
said the Syrian army gave up the strategic 
dam after army positions there were 
overrun. The rebels negotiated a surrender 
with regime loyalists who remained. These 
sources said the dam continues to operate 
and provide power — a positive sign for 
those who worry that Syria's infrastructure 
would collapse if the rebels took over. 
*The Aleppo International Airport, 
southeast of the city, is close to falling. 
Free Syrian Army sources said Tuesday 
that their fighters, including allies in the 
extremist al-Nusra Front, had captured an 
access point near the airport known as 
Liwa 80. Syrian sources said rebels there 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028692 
had seized large amounts of ammunition, 
including some shoulder-fired anti-aircraft 
missiles. 
*Damascus and its suburbs, where the 
rebels are tightening their squeeze on 
access points to the capital. Syrian sources 
said fighters are converging on Damascus 
from different parts of the country, 
expecting a decisive battle there soon. 
Regime forces are suffering from very low 
morale, whereas FSA soldiers have been 
encouraged by recent positive 
developments, asserts one FSA report 
from Damascus. 
The al-Nusra Front has been a catalyst and 
beneficiary of the rebels' success. 
According to Syrian sources, al-Nusra is 
gaining strength in Homs, a city in central 
Syria where the group was never strong. 
One Syrian source told the State 
Department: They have money, they are 
helping people with everything including 
daily living supplies. I heard that some 
fighters are leaving their [former] brigades 
and joining [Al-Nusra], some of them 
selling their weapons to feed their 
families. 
One Syrian who works closely with the 
Free Syrian Army explained how creating 
an elite commando force could help check 
Syria's drift toward becoming a failed 
state: We still believe FSA on the ground 
is still needed badly to tip the power and 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028693 
support other parallel solutions, including 
the political one. But FSA [has] become a 
jungle. ... My recommendation is ... to 
start working on elite [forces that can] ... 
initiate key attacks plus help as a buffer 
from potential warlords and fights among 
fragmented FSA factions. Plus, this unit 
can handle other key tasks, like securing 
chemical weapons. 
This Syrian strategist argues in another 
memo that the rebels must speak to the 
silent majority, many who did not care 
about the revolution, and they want their 
life back. He said that such a negotiated 
settlement requires more pressure on the 
United States, Russia and the United 
Nations to find a way out of the 
deadlock.

Why Does Europe  
Pretend Hezbollah Has a  
Good Side?  
Matthew Levitt 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028694 
February 12, 2013 -- Bulgaria's interior 
minister announced on Feb. 5 the result of 
his country's investigation into the July 
2012 bombing of a bus filled with Israeli 
tourists in the city of Burgas, which killed 
five Israelis and the vehicle's Bulgarian 
driver. Two of the individuals who carried 
out the terrorist attack, he said, belonged 
to the military formation of Hezbollah. 
It was not by chance that his statement 
fingered only the military wing of 
Hezbollah, not the group as a whole. 
Within the European Union, the findings of 
the Bulgarian investigation have kicked off 
a firestorm over whether to add the 
Lebanese militant organization -- in whole, 
or perhaps just its military or terrorist 
wings -- to the EU's list of banned terrorist 
groups. But are there in fact distinct wings 
within the self-styled Party of God? 
Hezbollah is many things. It is one of the 
dominant political parties in Lebanon, as 
well as a social and religious movement 
catering first and foremost -- though not 
exclusively -- to Lebanon's Shiite 
community. Hezbollah is also Lebanon's 
largest militia, the only one to keep its 
weapons and rebrand its armed elements as 
an Islamic resistance in response to the 
terms of the 1989 Taif Accord, which 
ended the Lebanese Civil War. 
While the group's various elements are 
intended to complement one another, the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028695 
reality is often messier. In part, that has to 
do with compartmentalization of 
Hezbollah's covert activities. It is also, 
however, a result of the group's multiple 
identities -- Lebanese, pan-Shiite, pro-
Iranian -- and the group's multiple and 
sometimes competing goals tied to these 
different identities. 
Hezbollah's ideological commitment to 
Iranian Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's 
revolutionary doctrine of velayat-e 
faqih (guardianship of the jurist), which 
holds that a Shiite Islamic cleric should 
serve as the supreme head of government, 
is a key source of conflict. The group is 
thus simultaneously committed to the 
decrees of Iranian clerics, the Lebanese 
state, its sectarian Shiite community within 
Lebanon, and fellow Shiites abroad. 
The consequences of these competing 
ideological drivers was clear in July 2006, 
when Hezbollah dragged Israel and 
Lebanon into a war neither state wanted by 
crossing the U.N.-demarcated border 
between the two countries, killing three 
Israeli soldiers, and kidnapping two more 
in an ambush. They came to the fore again 
two years later, when Hezbollah took over 
West Beirut by force of arms, turning its 
weapons of resistance against fellow 
Lebanese citizens. When the chips are 
down, Hezbollah's commitment to Iran 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028696 
trumps its identity as a Lebanese political 
movement. 
The ties that bind Hezbollah's political 
leadership with its international illicit 
activities are also unmistakable. According 
to a CIA document, even before Hassan 
Nasrallah rose to the position of secretary-
general in 1992, he was directly involved 
in many Hizballah terrorist operations, 
including hostage taking, airline hijackings, 
and attacks against Lebanese rivals. 
Time and again, Hezbollah's political 
personalities have been tied to the group's 
terrorist and criminal activities. Consider a 
major case in the United States: In 2008, 
while Hezbollah operative Ali Karaki was 
planning a Hezbollah attack in Azerbaijan's 
capital, Baku, his brother, Hasan Antar 
Karaki, was helping lead a broad criminal 
conspiracy to sell counterfeit and stolen 
currency in Philadelphia. Luckily, Hasan 
Antar Karaki sold his wares to an 
undercover FBI informant posing as a 
member of the Philadelphia criminal 
underworld. Hasan Antar Karaki proved to 
be a major figure in Hezbollah's forgery 
operations, and he provided an FBI source 
with fraudulent British and Canadian 
passports. 
Meanwhile, in meetings in Lebanon and 
the United States, Hasan Antar Karaki's 
associate, Hassan Hodroj, a Hezbollah 
spokesman and the head of its Palestinian 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028697 
issues portfolio within the group's political 
echelon, sought to procure a long list of 
sophisticated weapons in a black-market 
scheme involving Hezbollah operatives 
across the globe. According to court 
documents, Hodroj wanted heavy 
machinery for the fight against Jews and 
to protect Lebanon. But move forward 
with caution, Hodroj counseled an 
undercover FBI source, because someone 
in the United States could go to jail for 
100 years if caught dealing with 
Hezbollah. 
In light of cases like this one, in which 
people overtly affiliated with Hezbollah's 
political activities are engaged in criminal 
and terrorist activities, it becomes 
increasingly difficult to separate 
Hezbollah's overt activities from its covert 
behavior. Little is known about [the 
Hezbollah military wing's] internal 
command hierarchy, a Western 
government report noted in 2012, due to 
its highly secretive nature and use of 
sophisticated protective measures. 
The structure and manpower of Hezbollah's 
terrorist operation, which is responsible for 
its financial and logistical activities as well 
as its terrorist operations abroad, are 
similarly opaque. We do know, however, 
that Hezbollah's terrorist network, the 
Islamic Jihad Organization (IJO), was 
formally founded in 1983 when Hezbollah 
master terrorist Imad Mughniyeh fled to 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028698 
Iran after orchestrating the October 1983 
bombing of the U.S. Marine Corps and 
French military barracks in Beirut with his 
brother-in-law, Mustafa Badreddine. 
This much is clear: Since its founding, 
Hezbollah has developed a sophisticated 
organizational and leadership structure. 
The overall governing authority, the Majlis 
al-Shura (Consultative Council), wields all 
decision-making power and directs several 
subordinate functional councils. Each 
functional council reports directly to the 
Majlis al-Shura, which, as Hezbollah 
Deputy Secretary-General Naim Qassem 
wrote in his book, is in charge of drawing 
the overall vision and policies, overseeing 
the general strategies for the party's 
function, and taking political decisions. 
U.S. assessments echo Qassem's 
description. Hezbollah has a unified 
leadership structure that oversees the 
organization's complementary, partially 
compartmentalized elements, reads a 
Congressional Research Service report. 
The secretary-general, currently Nasrallah, 
presides over the Majlis al-Shura and 
functions as the group's leader under the 
authority of the jurist theologian 
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme 
leader. Five administrative bodies, 
organized around thematic responsibilities, 
run Hezbollah's political, military (jihad), 
parliamentary, executive, and judicial 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028699 
activities. The Majlis al-Shura considers all 
elements of the group's activities, including 
its political and military wings, as part of 
one holistic entity. 
According to Hezbollah's top officials, this 
unity of purpose among the group's diverse 
activities is essential to its success. If the 
military wing were separated from the 
political wing, this would have 
repercussions, and it would reflect on the 
political scene, Qassem told a Lebanese 
paper in 2000. Hezbollah's secretary-
general is the head of the Shura Council 
and also the head of the Jihad Council, and 
this means that we have one leadership, 
with one administration. 
The Jihad Council is the functional council 
underneath the Majlis al-Shura responsible 
for all military matters. Qassem writes that 
it comprises those in charge of resistance 
activity, be that in terms of oversight, 
recruitment, training, equipment, security, 
or any other resistance-related endeavors. 
To accomplish its mission, the council is 
divided into several smaller units in charge 
of protecting the leadership and carrying 
out internal and external surveillance, as 
well as overseas operations. The party's 
security branch is further broken down into 
three subgroups: central, preventive, and 
overseas security. In 2000, a dedicated 
counterintelligence branch was reportedly  
founded as well. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028700 
Under this structure, Hezbollah's militia 
and terrorist activities, along with its 
security organ, all report to the Jihad 
Council. Until he was killed, Mughniyeh 
was Hezbollah's top militant commander 
and reportedly led the Jihad Council 
himself By some accounts, he also held a 
seat on the Majlis al-Shura, which would 
be typical for the party's standing military 
commander. 
Unlike its sister councils, however, the 
Jihad Council enjoys strategic ambiguity. 
Neither the majority of Hezbollah officials 
nor the party's elected parliamentarians are 
aware of the details of their party's covert 
military and terrorist activities, which are 
decided on by the most senior leadership. 
According to the U.S. government, these 
activities are executed by the leadership 
of Hezbollah's military apparatus, known 
as the Islamic Resistance and led by 
Badreddine, and by the IJO, led by Talal 
Hamiyah, and they are overseen by 
Nasrallah. 
Europe's approach to Hezbollah has been 
varied. Many European governments have 
resisted international efforts to designate 
the organization as a terrorist group by 
distinguishing between Hezbollah's 
political and military wings. Britain 
distinguishes among Hezbollah's terrorist 
wing (the Islamic Jihad Organization), 
military wing, and political wing, and the 
country banned the IJO in 2000 and the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028701 
military wing in 2008. The Netherlands, 
however, designated Hezbollah a terrorist 
entity in 2004 without distinguishing 
between the group's political and military 
wings. A 2004 Dutch intelligence report 
highlighted investigations that show 
Hezbollah's political and terrorist wings 
are controlled by one co-ordinating 
council. 
The European Union has taken action 
against Hezbollah's interests in the past. In 
May 2002, the European Union froze the 
assets of a non-European terrorist group for 
the first time by adding seven Hezbollah-
affiliated individuals, including 
Mughniyeh, to its financial sanctions list 
for terrorism. It did not, however, sanction 
Hezbollah as an organization. On March 
10, 2005, the European Parliament passed a 
nonbinding resolution recognizing that 
clear evidence exists of terrorist activities 
on the part of Hezbollah and calling on the 
European Council to take all necessary 
steps to curtail them. 
But the necessary steps did not occur. 
Instead, most European countries preferred 
to make convenient distinctions between 
the different parts of Hezbollah, even when 
the group's own leadership does not. 
Today, as European leaders consider 
whether to label Hezbollah a terrorist 
group, they should judge the group by the 
totality of its actions. Hezbollah cannot be 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028702 
forgiven its criminal, terrorist, or militant 
pursuits simply because it also engages in 
political or humanitarian ones. As the 
Burgas bus bombing demonstrates, the 
Party of God can and has mobilized 
operatives for everything from criminal 
enterprises to terrorist attacks well beyond 
Lebanon's borders. 
And though Hezbollah is composed of 
multiple committees and branches, it 
operates as a single entity. Hezbollah, the 
U.S. intelligence community has 
determined, is a multifaceted, disciplined 
organization that combines political, social, 
paramilitary, and terrorist elements and is 
one in which decisions to resort to arms or 
terrorist tactics [are] carefully calibrated. 
Hezbollah's Qassem, speaking in October 
2012, concurred: We don't have a military 
wing and a political one; we don't have 
Hezbollah on one hand and the resistance 
party on the other.... Every element of 
Hezbollah, from commanders to members 
as well as our various capabilities, are in 
the service of the resistance, and we have 
nothing but the resistance as a priority, he 
said. 
Maybe it is time Western leaders finally 
listened to him.

A Middle-Class Paradise  
in Palestine?  
Armin Rosen 
Feb 11 2013 -- The sole outlet to Rawabi  
sits off a dizzying two-lane highway 
flanked by round, scraggly hills. In this part 
of the West Bank, just north of where the 
Jerusalem suburbs thin into a dry, granite-
gray wilderness, the mountains seem to aid 
in the illusion that Israeli and Palestinian 
spheres of authority can remain perfectly, 
even harmoniously separate. Arabs use the 
road to get to the Palestinian-controlled 
cities of Bir Zeit and Ramallah, for Jewish 
Israelis, the road connects the Jerusalem 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028704 
area to settlements deep inside the northern 
half of the West Bank. 
Ramallah's skyline is barely discernible on 
a hazy day. Ateret, a red-gabled settlement 
of about 90 families that sits high above the 
Rawabi junction -- a community which 
would likely either be vacated or 
incorporated into a Palestinian state under a 
future peace agreement -- flickers in and 
out of view with every delirious knot in the 
road. Even a concrete pillbox looming over 
the highest point along the highway is 
abandoned, its connection to the territory's 
oddly invisible occupying army marked 
only by a tattered Israeli flag that no one 
has bothered to steal or replace. 
Last year was the first since 1973 in which 
no Israeli citizen was killed in a terrorist 
attack originating from the West Bank. As 
on the newly-pacified Gaza-Israel border, a 
tense quiet pervades things here, although a 
bright red sign at the junction reminds one 
category of motorist not to feel too 
complacent. This road leads to Area 'A' 
Under the Palestinian Authority, it reads 
in Arabic, Hebrew, and broken English. 
The entrance for Israeli citizens is 
forbidden, dangerous to your lives and is 
against the Israeli law. At the Rawabi 
junction these warnings of latent danger are 
almost comically off-base, partly because 
of the only other marker at the turnoff: a 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028705 
light-green arrow sagging off of a nearby 
post. 
No one lives at the end of the road, which 
is every bit as wavy and disorienting as the 
adjoining highway. It empties into a scene 
that seems engineered for maximum 
bewilderment: three high-rise cranes, 
topped with fluttering Palestinian flags, 
tower over massive stone and concrete 
building frames. Cement-mixers, painted 
the same shade of light green as the arrow 
at the turnoff and marked with the project's 
logo -- a wiry oval with a cute little convex 
loop at the end, like a child's drawing of a 
heart that could also be a tree -- line up to 
receive material from a buzzing, state-of-
the-art plant. The construction site, a 
couple turns up-road of the cement factory, 
is swarming with workers in green 
hardhats. Spotless SUVs with the Rawabi 
logo on the door speed from one side of the 
site to another. 
Rawabi, which will be the first Palestinian 
planned city in the West Bank, runs from 
the top of the mountain to the valley below, 
with its highest point sitting at an elevation 
slightly higher than Ateret, which is now 
constantly visible. In contrast, the chaos of 
Ramallah, stronghold of an insolvent and 
sclerotic Palestinian Authority, feels distant 
in more senses than one. 
Rawabi represents something totally new --
a visionary Palestinian-directed private 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028706 
sector project, with support from both 
Israeli businesses and a major Arab 
government. It has the potential to shift the 
conversation on the region's future on both 
sides of the Green Line. It could convince 
Palestinians -- and the rest of the world --
that the future of the West Bank shouldn't 
be shackled to Ramallah or Jerusalem's 
vacillating willingness to hash out 
fundamental issues. It could prove that 
there's an appetite, both among Palestinian 
consumers and foreign donors, for the 
creation of a social and economic existence 
in the West Bank that's de-coupled, 
insomuch as currently possible, from the 
Middle East's tense and labyrinthine 
politics. 
It would also help solidify the benefits of 
the current cessation in hostilities. Indeed, 
Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas's 
progress in fostering the end of violent 
resistance in the West Bank in the years 
after the bloody Second Intifada, coupled 
with Palestinian Prime Minister Salaam 
Fayyad's widely-respected institution-
building initiative, could get a crucial 
private sector assist through Rawabi's 
eventual success. 
And Rawabi gets at something even more 
fundamental. It touches upon all of the 
core issues of control and sovereignty, 
says Robert Danin, a fellow at the Council 
on Foreign Relations who, as head of the 
Quartet mission in Jerusalem from 2008 to 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028707 
2010, witnessed some of the political 
discussions that accompanied the project's 
creation. This could be a huge, iconic 
victory for the whole strategy of building 
Palestine from the bottom up rather than 
trying to build it at the negotiating table, 
he says. 
Its success would prove just how much 
power Palestinians can, and indeed already 
do, have in shaping their future. And its 
failure could prove the exact opposite. 
I visited Rawabi two weeks ago with a 
group of national security professionals, as 
part of a trip organized by the Foundation 
for Defense of Democracies, a Washington, 
DC-based think tank. (All of the photos in 
the body of the article are mine.) We were 
taken around the construction site by a 
young Palestinian engineer who conveyed 
the vast ambition underlying the project: 
When the city is completed, she said, it will 
house 45,000 people in 23 distinct 
neighborhoods with innocuous, nature-
based names like Flint, and Hard Rock. 
(Rawabi is Arabic for Hills.) There will 
be eight schools -- some of them built with 
the help of the U.S. Agency for 
International Development -- a huge 
park, a convention center, an 850-seat 
indoor theater, and a 20,000-seat 
amphitheater carved into a hillside. 
Most ambitiously, there will be a 
commercial center that developers hope 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028708 
will bring in between 3,000 and 5,000 
permanent jobs within the next five years --
hopefully, we were told, in the 
informational technology sector (an 
aspiration that might imply a certain 
cooperation with the burgeoning tech 
industry on the other side of the Green 
Line). The engineer said that Rawabi had 
already created 3,000 construction jobs for 
West Bank Palestinians. The city is 
Palestinian-designed and Palestinian-built - 
- making the surfeit of Qatari flags at the 
construction site somewhat puzzling at 
first. And while the project does not 
purchase materials from Jewish settlements 
in the West Bank, the engineer was hardly 
shy in explaining that Rawabi would add 
an estimated $85 million to the Israeli 
economy. 
As we drove around the construction site, 
the engineer's talk made few demands on 
the imagination. The sheer scale of the 
project is already obvious. Within the next 
18 months, the first phase, which includes 
six neighborhoods, a mosque, the 
amphitheater, and two-thirds of the city's 
commercial center, will be complete, and 
3,000 people are scheduled will move into 
Rawabi by the end of 2013. Apartment 
blocks built of a local white stone --
Rawabi stone, the engineer called it -- are 
already rising out of a network of 
concentric ring-roads centered on the top of 
the hill. Most of these roads have already 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028709 
been paved, and there are terraced retaining 
walls, built out of thick stacks of local 
sandstone, running all the way to the 
bottom of the valley. No bleachers have 
been installed in the amphitheater yet, but 
it's fairly far along, with the future seating 
area fanning into a wide notch in the 
mountainside. There are attractive stone 
signs bearing the stylized Arabic names of 
neighborhoods that haven't been built yet. 
The future commercial center is also well 
on its way to completion. Situated on a 
shelf slightly below the summit of the hill, 
the complex of office buildings, hotels, 
theaters, and a convention center will 
huddle around a broad outdoor plaza, 
which will be connected to the lower 
neighborhoods through a wide flight of 
stairs. The stairs, plaza, and central 
buildings are already past their skeletal 
phase, and the high-rise apartments ringing 
the city center look like they're almost 
complete. For now, the commercial core is 
a jumble of dust and brutal concrete 
surfaces, but in the future, someone 
lingering in the cafés near the staircase will 
enjoy phenomenal views of the rugged hill 
country, and perhaps even glimpses of the 
Jordan River Valley on a clear day. 
It is still possible to remain unconvinced of 
Rawabi's reality -- doubtful as to whether 
that café will ever be built, or whether any 
middle class-Palestinian desirous of a 
generic middle class existence will ever 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028710 
linger there. There's abundant reason for 
skepticism. The project's future depends on 
the Israeli authorities' willingness to allow 
for the construction of access roads in 
Area C, or West Bank territory under the 
direct control of Israel. The sole existing 
route into the city only exists because the 
Israeli government, after years of 
bureaucratic and high-level diplomatic 
wrangling, granted Rawabi's developers a 
permit for a temporary road. Technically, 
they will have to destroy the road when the 
current permission expires. And even if the 
Israelis agree to make the road permanent, 
one two-lane route is hardly adequate for a 
city of 45,000 people. Developers claim it 
isn't even adequate to the needs of the 
current construction site. 
Water is another challenge. Negotiations 
with Israel and the Palestinian Water 
Authority are ongoing, and developers say 
they have held in excess of 100 meetings 
with Israeli officials on water-related issues 
alone. Developers admit that they aren't 
sure where the city's water resources will 
eventually come from, and the construction 
site only got running water two months 
ago. 
And they'll admit that attracting jobs to the 
site is an even bigger challenge than Israel's 
West Bank regime. Rawabi isn't meant to 
be a bedroom community of Ramallah. It's 
meant to be a self-contained city, with 
office and retail space. The jobs haven't 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028711 
quite materialized yet (although the 
developers have a slight head start: 
between 200 and 300 call center-type jobs 
currently based in Ramallah are scheduled 
to move into Rawabi when the first phase 
of construction is complete). If the political 
or security situation seriously deteriorates - 
- if the checkpoints return, if the Israelis are 
forced to re-occupy urban areas ceded to 
the Palestinian Authority under the Oslo 
Accords, as happened during the Second 
Intifada; if Hamas wages a violent takeover 
of the Palestinian government -- all bets are 
off The developers don't seem to be 
bothered by those possibilities right now. 
At the showroom, built at the very top of 
the hill, the future is nothing but bright. 
I chatted with another site engineer as we 
walked through a scale-model mock-up of 
a typical Rawabian street, where happy 
families in western dress waved from little 
video screens inset in plastic apartment 
windows. I asked her about the Qatari flags 
I had seen around the construction site. 
Qatar's state investment fund is footing two 
thirds of the nearly $1 billion project bill, 
she said. This is the biggest investment in 
the history of Palestine, she explained as 
we stepped over a fake valley in the next 
room, walking past a mock-up of a 
stunning hilltop view contained inside a 
mock-up of a future apartment suite. The 
Rawabians will apparently own large flat-
screen TVs and stylish coffee tables, and 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028712 
their living spaces will be kept mercilessly 
clean. 
What, of that $1 billion investment, was 
going to Israel, I asked? Israeli companies 
were providing cement powder and sand, 
she said, and the project had consulted with 
Israeli experts. In some cases, you have 
to do that, she said, alluding to the 
comparative difficulty of importing 
building materials through neighboring 
Jordan. In other words, working with the 
Israelis was a necessary business decision 
for a project this large and complex. 
The fake street, fake valley, fake 
apartment-display ended in a pleasant sky-
lit lobby, where representatives of the 
Cairo Amman Bank, Arab Islamic Bank, 
and Arab Bank sat in logoed glass cubicles, 
available to discuss financing for future 
purchases. And for the still-skeptical, 
there's a six-minute 3-D movie, where the 
city appears in its completed glory -- a 
place where families picnic, men in 
business dress greet each other amid 
bustling plazas, and fireworks crest over 
soaring apartment towers topped with solar 
panels. The architecture is tasteful. These 
aren't dachas plunked on fake islands off 
the coast of Dubai. It's the kind of place 
where I, or just about anyone in the world 
with middle or even upper-middle class 
aspirations, would want to live. And it 
looked weirdly familiar. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028713 
The group had a chance to visit with 
Bashar Masri, the Nablus-born founder and 
CEO of Massar International, the 
Palestinian conglomerate financing a third 
of Rawabi. Massar and Qatar Diar, the real 
estate investment arm of the government of 
Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, jointly 
created Bayti Real Estate Investment 
Company -- Palestine to build and market 
Rawabi. But if two-thirds of the project's 
money is coming from Qatar, the vision 
behind Rawabi is Masri's. 
Massar owns a private equity fund that 
invests in Palestinian agriculture and 
natural gas distribution. It runs travel 
agencies in Jordan and brokerage firms in 
Serbia. Massar invests in Harvest Export, 
which sells Palestinian produce to 
consumers in Russia and Western Europe --
as well as in Israel. Two years ago, Masri 
made headlines when he attempted to  
purchase a bankrupt Jewish housing 
development in East Jerusalem. He helped 
create an online trading and brokerage 
platform for Palestine's stock exchange. 
Masri has lived outside of Palestine for 
periods of his life, and is, by all accounts, 
largely untainted by connections to the 
PA's notoriously rent-seeking inner circle. 
He's a trim middle-aged man, smartly-
dressed, friendly and approachable. There 
seemed no more appropriate a place to talk 
to him one-on-one than on a wide terrace 
overlooking the construction site, with 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028714 
hills, valleys, and rising apartment blocks --
the future he was in the process of building 
-- stretched out in front of him. 
On a good, clear day, you can see Tel 
Aviv, Ashdod, and Ashkelon, he told me. 
One-third of Palestine and Israel. Rawabi 
is in the second-largest, yet most sparsely-
populated Area A in the West Bank -- from 
the terrace, which faces away from Ateret, 
you can see expanses of mostly-empty 
hills. Perhaps in Masri's mind, they are 
awaiting Rawabis of their own. When I 
returned to Washington, I asked him in a 
phone interview if he viewed his project as 
the first of many such planned cities in 
Palestine. I always say our success is 
measured not by how many homes we sell. 
It is measured when a second Rawabi is 
established, he told me. 
Standing on the terrace, I asked him if his 
willingness to undertake such a massive 
project reflected any optimism about the 
coming years -- no one invests this much 
time, money, and energy into something if 
they expect war is on the horizon. This 
project is built for today's politics, he 
replied. If it gets a little worse, or a little 
better -- fine. If it gets really bad, we're in 
trouble. If it doesn't, then great. We're not 
waiting on a breakthrough. 
He estimated that Israeli obstruction had 
delayed the project by a year and a half 
The bureaucratic inertia could continue: 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028715 
For instance, developers were surprised to 
find out that, by a quirk in the West Bank's 
notoriously Byzantine and palimpsestic 
legal codes, they required the approval of a 
joint Israeli-Palestinian water commission 
created through the Oslo Accords to build a 
sewage treatment plant in an Area A, 
approval that they recently received. 
There's also the still-unresolved matter of 
the access road. But thus far, Rawabi had 
flourished in spite of delays and 
inconveniences. 
Could it survive its isolation, though --
could this hilltop off of a two-lane highway 
get enough water and electricity to support 
45,000 people living at a middle class 
standard? There is nothing here at all. 
We're out in the boondocks, he conceded. 
We're building everything from scratch. 
One needed only to glance at the busy 
construction site below to understand that 
Masri considers this a point of pride, far 
from a potential death-sentence for his 
project. 
I asked Masri about something that had 
jumped out at me during the 3-D video. 
The finished Rawabi, I'd noted, had the 
same terraced garden parks, stoic, modular 
apartment design, and concentric hilltop 
roads that I had seen in Talpiyot Misrach, a 
new neighborhood on the fringes of West 
Jerusalem. His city looked very, well, 
Israeli. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028716 
This place is influenced by Reston, 
Virginia, he said -- Masri is a Virginia 
Tech alumnus, and had lived in the 
Washington, DC area earlier in life. It was, 
he said, influenced by planned suburbs 
outside of Cairo. And it's influenced by 
Modi'in, he added, explaining that the 
site's engineers and designers (who were 
entirely Palestinian, we had been told 
earlier), had traveled to the Israeli city, 
which is built around similar topography, 
for inspiration. 
Palestinians have long understood that a 
western-style standard of living was 
possible in their part of the world. They 
knew that places like Rawabi already 
existed minutes from their own homes, but 
didn't think that the quality of life 
epitomized by hilltop settlements and cities 
in Israel -- places they weren't allowed to 
visit without an official permit from the 
military -- was accessible to them. 
During our phone interview, Masri talked 
about the astonishment that Palestinians 
feel when they visit the construction site. 
When [Palestinians] come to Rawabi, and 
they go through the showroom and they see 
what we have planned for them, and they 
see it actually being built, they say, 'Wow, 
this can't be for us. This is not for us. This 
is too high of a standard for us because we 
are supposed to live miserably under the 
occupation'. Then they come to the other 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028717 
side of the showroom and see the city being 
built, and reality starts sinking in. 
It's a type of living closely associated with 
the Palestinians' neighbors in Israel. They 
know very well that just a 20-minute drive 
away, there's a community with a much 
higher standard of living. And that 
community happened to be one 
representing the occupier, quote-unquote 
the 'enemy.' But they would love to live 
like that. And that's why when they come 
to Rawabi some of them don't believe this 
is for them initially. The first thing that 
goes through their mind is that this could 
be for the Israelis. 
But it is for them. Rawabi's significance 
could lie in something more mundane than 
basic issues of sovereignty and control in 
the West Bank. It lies in the common, 
human desire -- powerful on either side of 
the Green Line -- for a comfortable and 
dignified existence. 
In some quarters, this idea of working 
within the present and less-than-ideal 
political and economic framework to 
achieve this goal is nothing short of 
inflammatory. The U.S.-based, anti-peace 
process website Electronic Intifada has 
smeared Masri as an Israeli collaborator, 
and there have been scattered accusations 
that the project actually legitimizes Israeli 
control over the West Bank. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028718 
Danin says that Masri is faced with a 
difficult balancing act. On the one hand 
you're denying the occupation, and you're 
saying you do not accept its legitimacy, he 
says. But that doesn't mean you won't 
work with Israel in order to improve the 
Palestinian situation with the goal of 
removing the occupation. That's a difficult 
message to convey successfully. 
Masri rejects the notion that he abetting a 
problematic status quo. The vast majority 
of Palestinians understand and know 
reality, he said. There is no home in 
Palestine without Israeli cement and parts. 
Every construction project in Palestine 
must have components from Israel. So it's 
not like I'm doing something different. 
Of course, he doesn't like that Israel has so 
much control over Palestinian imports, and 
the West Bank economy in general. This 
is the occupation, he said. I'm not happy 
about that and that's why we strive for a 
state of our own. But he likened 
boycotting Israeli products to boycotting 
products from the United Kingdom, the 
United States, or other countries supportive 
of Israel -- something he wouldn't consider. 
The only people he won't buy from are the 
West Bank settlers. 
Luckily, Masri's vision has the backing of a 
powerful regional government -- one that 
does not officially recognize Israel, and 
whose actions have often had the effect of 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028719 
strengthening some of the Jewish State's 
sworn enemies. 
The Gulf kingdom of Qatar has done more 
than simply buy into the Rawabi paradigm: 
It's also funding two-thirds of the project, 
to the tune of over $600 million. This is 
enough money to single-handedly finance 
the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority 
-- which is effectively broke, thanks to 
penalties imposed by the Israeli and U.S. 
governments after Mahmoud Abbas's 
successful push for a U.N. General 
Assembly vote on Palestinian U.N. 
membership, and a freeze in financial aid 
from Gulf State donors, most notably Saudi 
Arabia -- for the better part of a year. 
Instead, the Qataris have not only bypassed 
the PA, but channeled money into a project 
that seems to prove the PA's uselessness. 
It's like an island inside the traditional 
infrastructure of the PA, says Jonathan 
Schanzer, vice president of research at the 
Foundation for Defense of Democracies 
and author of a book on Palestinian internal 
politics. It shows everyone what you can 
do if you don't go through the PA. The PA 
receives $600 million a year [in foreign 
aid] and they have not done something like 
this. 
Masri says that the leadership of the PA has 
been fully supportive, but that Rawabi has 
been hurt by the Palestinian government's 
lack of capacity. We should not be 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028720 
building public schools. We should not be 
building a waste water treatment plant or 
waste water networks or water reservoirs, 
he told me. Unfortunately we have to do 
that because the Palestinian Authority does 
not have the funding and the donors let [the 
PA] down. 
There might be a political calculation 
behind Qatar's decision to throw an amount 
of money equivalent to two years of U.S.  
financial aid to the PA behind a single 
private-sector figure like Masri. Qatar 
recently announced plans to invest nearly  
$400 million in the Hamas-controlled Gaza 
Strip, and in October of 2012, Qatari Emir 
Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani 
became the first head of state to visit the  
Strip  after the Islamist militant group's 
2007 takeover. Hamas politburo chief 
Khaled Meshaal lives in Doha, and Qatar 
Diar is financing a major development in  
Sudan, whose cash-strapped government 
enjoys close relations with Iran, and has 
facilitated the transfer of long-range 
rockets to Hamas. In short, Qatar supports 
an E.U. and U.S. listed terrorist 
organization bitterly opposed to both Israel 
and the current PA leadership. And it also 
has no problem investing in Rawabi. 
According to Kamran Bokhari, vice 
president of Middle Eastern and South 
Asian affairs for Stratfor, Qatari support for 
Hamas is part of the sheikhdom's larger, 
post-Arab Spring strategy of siding with 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028721 
the Middle East's Islamists, and specifically 
the Muslim brotherhood, whom the Qataris 
view as the region's rising power. The 
Qatari strategy is that the situation has 
changed, and we need to fend for ourselves 
and ensure that the regional anarchy is not 
going to impact us, says Bokhari. The 
Qatari investment in Rawabi -- which feeds 
an $85 million investment in the Israeli 
economy, and which could not have 
happened without some degree of official 
Israeli approval -- is an example of this 
larger geopolitical strategy, which is driven 
more by perceived self-interest than by an 
ideological affinity for political Islam. 
Investments in the region are about the 
return on political influence, adds Gregory 
Gause, a professor at the University of 
Vermont and a non-resident senior fellow 
at the Brookings Institution-Doha. He 
noted the presence of a large American 
airbase in Qatar, and the country's close 
relations with the United States. 
In the Palestinian territories, as in the 
broader region, the Qataris are supporting 
secular and religious forces in a way that 
will maximize their influence and keep the 
regional balance as favorable for them as 
possible. In a sense, the same strategic 
calculus that convinces Qatar to support 
Hamas allows them to cooperate with Israel 
and the West Bank private sector as well. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028722 
I think Qatar is going by the ground 
reality, says Bokhari. Fatah, the ruling 
faction of the PA, is essentially tanking. It's 
really in a state of decline because of 
corruption and charges of embezzlement. 
It's got an aging leadership. There's no 
dynamism left in the group. There's a lot of 
factionalism. It's almost like an oligarchy. 
Rawabi could be Qatar's way of 
encouraging the currently-calm status quo 
in the West Bank, but without obviously 
upgrading their ties to Israel, or throwing 
their money behind a political 
establishment that they don't fully trust. 
On one end they need to make sure Fatah 
does not completely collapse or weaken to 
the point where they're no longer coherent, 
says Bokhari, and Hamas needs to be 
shaped and contained and shepherded in a 
way that it doesn't grow into anything 
larger. 
Though there are politics underlying 
Qatar's investment in Rawabi, it is still, 
inevitably, a financial decision. You have 
serious people who have a lot at risk here, 
Danin says. Their goal is not primarily to 
make a political point. Their goal is to 
recoup their investment and make some 
money. Even resource-rich Qatar, which 
wants to diversity its holdings in order to 
hedge against long-term shifts in the oil 
and natural gas market, cares whether its 
investment choices pay off 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028723 
Danin believes that Rawabi's Palestinian 
and Qatari investors made a wise decision. 
Housing in Ramallah is expensive, and 
Danin says that there is a sizable and 
highly-educated Palestinian middle class in 
need of an alternative to the West Bank's 
de-facto capital. He expressed little doubt 
when I asked him if the West Bank 
economy could support Rawabi. This is a 
Palestinian national project, he said. It is 
the best of what is possible in that it's 
private sector-led, and it's profit-making 
led. 
And it has supporters in high places. When 
President Barack Obama met with Israeli 
officials in Washington in September of 
2010, Rawabi was on the agenda. 
From one perspective, Rawabi is a historic 
investment in Palestine, as well as an 
unusually open point of cooperation 
between Israel and an Arab government. It 
could improve the lives of Palestinians, 
while convincing Israelis that they have 
nothing to fear from their neighbors' 
prosperity. But any attempts to change 
the status quo in the West Bank are fraught 
with difficulties. 
There's Israeli bureaucracy to overcome. 
In Israel, if the Minister of Defense says I 
want something, it's not that the system 
thwarts it. But the system is so 
decentralized that ultimately it takes a lot 
of steps to get it translated into action, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028724 
says Danin. Israeli officials are positively 
disposed towards Rawabi, but it's still taken 
years to resolve sovereignty and 
governance issues around necessities like 
water, and a single access road. Such 
Israeli inertia was apparently at the heart of 
Obama's concerns back in 2010, and 
sources say that the president has discussed 
the issue of the access road with Israeli 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on 
multiple occasions. 
Back in Washington, I asked Masri if he 
believed the Israelis understood the 
potential importance of Rawabi. I really 
don't know, he said. Their statements are 
neutral to positive. But their actions are 
neutral to negative. 
And then there's the larger inertia. What 
meaning does a place like Rawabi have if it 
sits in the middle of a still-unresolved 
conflict, or if Palestinian economic self-
improvement stands in contrast to an all-
pervading political stasis -- or even 
political backsliding? Today, Rawabi is 
significant because of its novelty. But if 
there's a breakthrough in the Israeli-
Palestinian peace process, perhaps enabled 
by a growing West Bank economy and a 
permanent end in terrorism, it could take on 
an importance much larger than itself 
On the drive out of the valley, where the 
highway swerves past the pillbox with the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028725 
beaten Israeli flag and past the turnoff for 
Ateret, the picture is still mixed.

“Obviously, the class is one of the biggest developments in cardiology in the last decade, that will allow us to
treat patients who have been extremely difficult to treat with high levels of LDL cholesterol,” says Steven
Nissen, chairman of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic. “It’s very promising.”

But it will also be very expensive, say Troy Brennan, the chief medical officer of CVS Caremark, the giant
pharmacy benefits manager.“If these drugs are used as broadly as they could be used, they are going to be by
far the most expensive drug class,” Brennan says.

Praluent, an injection, lowers low-density lipoprotein, the so-called “bad cholesterol”, by as much as 60%, far
more than the statin drugs alone. It is the first drug to work by targeting a protein called PCSK9. Mutations in
the gene that makes it can result in patients having lower cholesterol and a dramatically lower lifetime risk of
heart attacks. A rival medicine from Amgen is also expected to be approved soon. The FDA is

clearing Praluent for patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic condition that causes
high cholesterol, and for people who have heart disease, like those who’ve had heart attacks or strokes, who
are already taking the maximum dose of a statin they can tolerate.

Regeneron and its marketing partner Sanofi say Praluent will have a wholesale cost of $40 a day, or $14,600 a
year, for either of two doses, 75 milligrams or 150 mgs. It’s likely that insurance companies will get a
significant discount, because Amgen and Regeneron will compete by giving the insurers rebates.

tains there its largest intelligence base outside mainland China. A
large contingent of its officers are stationed officially in the Prince
of Wales skyscraper in central Hong Kong and unofficially main-
tain informers in Hong Kong’s police, governing authority, airport
administration, and other levers of power. It checks the computer-
ized visitors entering Hong Kong and has the capability to ferret
names that match those in the immense database its global cyber
espionage has amassed. When it detects the entry of any person of
possible intelligence interest, it can use its sophisticated array of
cyber tools to attempt to remotely steal data from that individual.
Such remote surveillance was so effective in 2013 that the U.S. State
Department had instructed all its personnel in Hong Kong to avoid
using their iPhones, Androids, BlackBerry phones, and other smart
phones when traveling to Hong Kong or China. Instead, it supplied
them with specially altered phones that disable location tracking
and have a remotely activated switch to completely cut off power
to its circuitry. No one in the intelligence community doubts the
prudence of taking such precautions in China, and it is nearly incon-

© ceivable that Snowden, whose prior position at the NSA included ©
teaching military personnel about Chinese capacities, could himself
be unaware of Chinese intelligence service capabilities to acquire
travelers’ data in Hong Kong.

Once Hong Kong had served as a window into China for West-
ern intelligence, but in the first decade of this century the Chinese
intelligence service had achieved such a pervasive presence in Hong
Kong, and such ubiquitous electronic coverage of diplomats and
other foreigners even suspected of involvement in foreign intelli-
gence work, that the CIA and British intelligence found it almost
as difficult to operate in Hong Kong as in mainland China. Even
though the CIA kept officers there in 2013, it was considered “hos-
tile territory,” according to the former CIA officer Tyler Drumheller.

Snowden apparently knew the limits of CIA operations in Hong
Kong, which provided him with an envelope of protection. He told
Greenwald that he was counting on the Chinese presence in Hong
Kong to deter the CIA from intruding on their meetings.

When he flew to Hong Kong in May 2013, he took with him
NSA secrets, which he knew would be of great interest to China.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014005.txt,"Don’t manufacture product in large quantities to increase margin unless your product and marketing are
tested and ready for rollout without changes. If a limited number of prototypes cost $10 per piece to
manufacture and sell for $11 each, that’s fine for the initial testing period, and essential for limiting
downside. Sacrifice margin temporarily for the testing phase, if need be, and avoid potentially fatal
upfront overcommitments.

8. Negotiate Late— Make Others Negotiate Against Themselves

Never make a first offer when purchasing. Flinch after the first offer (“$3,000!” followed by pure silence,
which uncomfortable salespeople fill by dropping the price once), let people negotiate against themselves
(“Is that really the best you can offer?” elicits at least one additional drop in price), then “bracket.” If
they end up at $2,000 and you want to pay $1,500, offer $1,250. They’ll counter with approximately
$1,750, to which you respond: “I'll tell you what—let’s just split the difference. I'll overnight FedEx you
a check, and we can call it a day.” The end result? Exactly what you wanted: $1,500.

9. Hyperactivity vs. Productivity — 80/20 and Pareto’s Law

Being busy is not the same as being productive. Forget about the start-up overwork ethic that people
wear as a badge of honor— get analytical. The 80/20 principle, also known as Pareto’s Law, dictates that
80% of your desired outcomes are the result of 20% of your activities or inputs. Once per week, stop
putting out fires for an afternoon and run the numbers to ensure you’re placing effort in high-yield areas:
What 20% of customers/products/ regions are producing 80% of the profit?) What are the factors that
could account for this? Invest in duplicating your few strong areas instead of fixing all of your
weaknesses.

10. The Customer Is Not Always Right—‘‘Fire” High-Maintenance Customers

Not all customers are created equal. Apply the 80/20 principle to time consumption: What 20% of people
are consuming 80% of your time? Put high-maintenance, low-profit customers on autopilot— process
orders but don’t pursue them or check up on them—and “fire” high-maintenance, high-profit customers
by sending a memo detailing how a change in business model requires a few new policies: how often and
how to communicate, standardized pricing and order process, etc. Indicate that, for those clients whose
needs are incompatible with these new policies, you are happy to introduce other providers. “But what if
my largest customer consumes all of my time?” Recognize that (1) without time, you cannot scale your
company (and, oftentimes, life) beyond that customer, and (2) people, even good people, will
unknowingly abuse your time to the extent that you let them. Set good rules for all involved to minimize
back-and-forth and meaningless communication.

11. Deadlines Over Details—Test Reliability Before Capability

Skills are overrated. Perfect products delivered past deadline kill companies faster than decent products
delivered on time. Test someone’s ability to deliver on a specific and tight deadline before hiring them
based on a dazzling portfolio. Products can be fixed as long as you have cash flow, and bugs are
forgiven, but missing deadlines is often fatal. Calvin Coolidge once said that nothing is more common
than unsuccessful men with talent; I would add that the second most common is smart people who think
their IQ or resume justifies delivering late. —JUNE 24, 2008

Bernadotte.

“Why are you so strident,” Shamir asked me, only half-jokingly, after ’'d
insisted on joining a government discussion and pressing several intelligence
matters. “It’s because I’ve read the Lebanon inquiry,” I replied. “I saw what
happened when a message isn’t delivered assertively. I’m not going to be in the
position of making the same mistakes.” He nodded, and didn’t raise it again.

In fact, it was under Shamir that I began to get more involved with political
and policy issues beyond the armed forces. Part of this came with the job of
Rosh Aman. There was hardly a major domestic or foreign challenge that did
not have some security component, and no security matter on which intelligence
was not critical. But I also found myself working more closely with leading
politicians: mainly Shamir and Misha Arens, who as defense minister was my
main point of contact. Since I was a Labor kibbutznik, we made an odd
threesome. Arens was also a lifelong Jabotinsky Zionist. He had been in the
Betar youth movement in America, before going to Palestine in 1948 and
joining the Irgun. In fact, it was with Misha’s personal backing that one of my
former Sayeret Matkal officers — the son of a Jabotinsky acolyte — had recently
taken his first steps into the political limelight. After a two-year stint as Israel’s
number-two diplomat in Washington, Bibi Netanyahu had become our
ambassador to the United Nations.

With both Arens and Shamir, I built a solid relationship, based on mutual
respect, and it would deepen further when I moved on to a wider role in the
kirya a few years later. They were straight talkers. While resolute about
decisions once they’d taken them, they were genuinely open to discussion and
debate. I also sometimes found a surprising degree of nuance behind their tough
exterior.

The toughness was there, however. One of the first major security crises we
faced after Shamir became Prime Minister was known as the Kav 300 affair,
named for the bus route between the southern port city of Ashdod and Tel Aviv.
On the evening of April 12, 1984, four Palestinians from Gaza boarded the bus
and hijacked it back toward the border with Egypt. They told the passengers they
were armed with knives, and that a suitcase which one of them was carrying
contained unexploded anti-tank shells. After a high-speed chase, an Israeli army
unit managed to shoot out the tires and disable the vehicle, when it was still
about ten miles short of Gaza. One of the passengers had been severely injured at

— Either relative benefits and risks of various treatment options (technology
assessment, evidence-based medicine), or

— Both clinical effectiveness and relative cost (cost-benefit analysis).

e Without rigorous data about comparative effectiveness, according to the CBO:

— Treatment decisions often depend on anecdotal evidence, conjecture, and the
experience/judgment of involved physicians.

— Treatments and types of care vary widely from one area of the country to another.
e To affect healthcare spending meaningfully, comparative effectiveness must alter

doctor and patient behavior, potentially through reimbursement scheme changes, the
CBO notes.

e Note that by law, Medicare is effectively precluded from considering costs when

making coverage decisions.

Still from Ground Camera

LOOK AT THE IMAGES, WHAT HAPPENED?

The truth is you simply don't know. If you are puzzling over the
strength of tiles, you have been misdirected. There is video footage of
some sort of impact on a wing mostly covered in white tiles, and a slide
describing the effect of a benign sounding ‘foany hitting those tiles. But
what is the evidence for an impact on a tile? The shuttle is certainly not
made entirely from tiles; I can see a window in the picture. You should
instead be asking more questions, “What happened?” “What hit what?”
and “How bad is that?”

It was bad. The foam, a very tough material, had hit the leading edge
of the wing, a weak point, punching a hole through it. The wing failed
on reentry and tore the shuttle apart. Clearly, a full discussion of the
possibilities did not occur amongst the shuttle team, or perhaps it only
happened amongst the engineers in private. Once the analysis was tidied
up and presented to ‘management’ it was a one-way communication of
the conclusions, not a discussion of the underlying ambiguous thought
process. The result: people passively listened to the information rather

as rape. There are clearly gray areas in which the man ought to resolve doubts in favor of not
acting and where the law ought to resolve doubts in favor of not convicting.

I have represented several clients who fit this situation. One such case was a highly publicized
prosecution of three prominent doctors and a nurse at one of Boston’s leading hospitals.

One of the doctors had a party at his house for some of the hospital staff. During the party, the
nurse danced with several of the doctors and two of them “fooled around” with her in the
bathroom. As the party was ending, the three doctors invited the nurse to join them for a drive to
Rockport where one of the doctors had a vacation home. She went along with them because in
her words, she thought they were just “horsing around.”

When they arrived at the Rockport home, two of the doctors smoked marijuana and all of three of
them began to disrobe. She said she protested and told them to stop when the three of them
began to undress her. Each of the defendants then had sex with the nurse in the bedroom. She
testified that she felt physically numbed and could not resist.

Sometime later, they drove back to Boston and stopped to view the beach, to have breakfast and
fill the car up with gasoline. One of the doctors gave her his card and said he would be interested
in hooking up with her again. The defendants each testified that the sexual intercourse was
entirely consensual, that it was she who took her dress off and that she appeared at all times to be
a willing participant.

The issue in the case was what the jury should do if they believe both the nurse and the
doctors—that is, if they thought that the nurse did not want to have sex with the three doctors,
but if the doctors believed that she was a willing participant.

The jury convicted the defendants and the judge sentenced them to six months imprisonment
obviously suggesting that he had some doubts about the sufficiency of the case. I was asked to
consult on the appeal. I accepted the assignment because I wanted to preserve the mistake of fact
defense in the face of efforts to abolish it in rape cases.

Unfortunately for these defendants their trial lawyers had not appropriately raised the issue of
reasonable mistake of fact. They asked for an instruction that might have invited the jury to
acquit even if the mistake had been unreasonable—that is, even if the doctors believed that “no”
meant “yes.” The appellate court ruled, therefore, “We need not reach the issue whether a
reasonable and honest mistake to the fact of consent would be a defense, for even if we assume it
to be so, the defendants did not request a jury instruction based on a reasonable mistake of fact.
We are aware of no American court of last resort that recognizes mistake of fact, without
consideration of its reasonableness.”

In a subsequent case, in which I was not involved, a Massachusetts Appellate Court ruled that
even a reasonable mistake of fact is not a defense when it comes to consent or lack of consent in
the context of a rape prosecution.

addition to Dan and me, it included key members of the general staff and senior
defense ministry officials. The idea was for us to hear a half-dozen academics
and other specialists speak about the political aspects of the sudden eruption of
Palestinian violence.

Though he spoke for barely 10 minutes, it was the last speaker who left the
deepest impression. Shimon Shamir, a professor at Tel Aviv University, began
by emphasizing he was not an expert in riot control. Finding a response to the
violence was something we were far better equipped to do. But then he paused,
looked intently at Rabin, Dan and me, and said: “What I can do is draw on
history.” One by one, he cited examples of more than a dozen broadly similar
rebellions over the past century, in the Middle East and beyond. “If we were
dealing with simple rioting, things might be different.” But he said the
Palestinians were, fundamentally, acting out of a shared sense of grievance, and
shared national identity. Both were in large part the result of Israel having
controlled their daily lives now for more than two decades. “I’m afraid I can
find no historical precedent for the successful suppression of the national will of
a people,” he said. Even when those in power used unimaginably punitive tools:
like expulsion, or forced starvation. “Even, as we know well as a Jewish people,
extermination.”

I glanced at Yitzhak and at Dan. Both of them looked like I felt: in no doubt
the professor was right, yet also aware that, in the short term, we still had to find
a way of putting a lid on the cauldron and keeping the situation for getting
irretrievably out of control.

It wasn’t as if ’'d been unaware of the sense of the anger building among
many West Bank and Gaza Palestinians, or of their wish to see an end to Israel’s
military administration and the growing number of Jewish settlements. From
my time as head of the central command, I also knew that there was a young,
activist core intensifying efforts to organize attacks on troops and settlers. But
none of us had any inkling that something of the scale, longevity and political
complexity of the intfada lay ahead.

Partly, this was a failure of specific intelligence warnings. But it went deeper
than that. Sobering though it was, I had to accept that — no less so than before
the Yom Kippur War in 1973 — I and many others had for too long been
comforting ourselves with a fundamental misconception about our military
occupation and civilian settlement in the areas captured in 1967. The roots of
the myopia went back to the immediate aftermath of the Six-Day War, to the

If you invest a little time on the slide you will understand it
and may even see it as a thing of beauty. But Masters’ audience was
obviously expecting something different and, presented with this level
of complexity, went into shutdown. Perhaps they wanted a simpler
presentation, a high-level summary, a few bullet points. Of course, there
is no simple presentation on Afghanistan. The lesson is that context,
timing and expectation are often as important to good communication
as the elegance of the content, and that information is a complex thing.

If you want a lighthearted poke at PowerPoint here is Peter Norvig’s
PowerPoint version of the Gettysburg Address.

Understanding

Next time you are in a business meeting, count the number of times the
word ‘understand is used. If you ask the people around you what it means
you'll stump many of them. That’s because understanding has two very
different meanings. Most people don’t separate these meanings but the
distinction is important. Understanding means to decode information,
to comprehend — but, more importantly, it also means to absorb and
internalize information. That feeling you have when you ‘et it’

If I say, “I understand” I mean I have taken in the question you
asked and decoded it into ideas so I can provide an answer. This can be
quite a mechanical process and computers routinely understand natural
language and answer questions — Apple's digital assistant Siri being a
case in point.

When I say, “I understand a problem” or “understand a culture”
I mean something far less tangible. Somehow the information I have
gathered over my life is formed into a matrix within my brain that allows
me to ponder and run scenarios. I can predict the effects of my actions
before I do them, and often anticipate your responses. That’s clearly
a very useful evolutionary adaption, but is there more to it than that?
Roger Penrose and David Deutsch think understanding allows us to
transfer non-symbolic information from one brain to another. We don't
run programs in our brains, nor do we store precise information such as
lists and tables. We have, therefore, had to evolve a creative approach to
communicating skills and understanding each other. One of the most
closely studied areas in the field of communication is when it breaks
down in the lead up to a disaster.

I think the President could win if it actually went to trial, but it
won’t go to trial. What I would do if I were his lawyer is to say,
“Look, the dignity of the office precludes the [President from
answering any of these questions. We realize that as a result of not
answering these questions, we will reluctantly, without admitting
anything, have to be sanctioned by having the verdict directed
against us on the merits. We accept that because we can’t answer
the questions and preserve the dignity. And now let’s move on to
the damages, where the focus is not on the [P]resident but on Paula
Jones.” And in that way, he can, in effect, settle the case, even if
the other side doesn’t settle because the damages will be very low,
there won’t be an apology. There’ll be a judgment against him, but
the judgment will be explained on the basis of the dignity of the
presidency. So if the settlement talks fail, that’s what I would
recommend that his lawyers think about. . . .

And the [P]resident has to start asking himself: Is he well advised
here?

The President had three options, but he was aware of only two of them. He knew that he could
litigate and try to win — as he ended up doing. He also knew that he could try to settle the case,
which would have avoided the necessity of testifying at the deposition or trial. A settlement
requires both sides to agree. In the Jones case, the president reportedly offered to pay Jones
$700,000, in order to settle the case. Jones insisted on an apology® and the settlement talks
eventually broke down.

The third option, of which the president was unaware, was to default the Jones case. Every
litigant in a civil case has the right to default — which means, essentially, to settle the case
unilaterally by simply refusing to contest the allegations in the complaint. Consider, for example,
the following hypothetical case: a fired employee of a high tech business sues for $10,000 in back
pay. The business realizes that in order to defend its actions, it would have to reveal commercial
secrets valued at $1,000,000 and take the time of executives which it estimates at being worth
$200,000. It offers to settle the case for the $10,000 that the employee is demanding, but the
angry employee prefers a trial at which he will be publicly vindicated. The company has the right
simply to default, have the judgment entered against it, and have the court order it to the pay the
damages sought by the employee. No stigma is attached to defaulting a case. It does not even
necessarily entail an admission of liability. It represents a practical assessment of the costs and
benefits of litigating and not litigating — just as a settlement does.

Robert Bennett never told President Clinton that he could have defaulted and paid Jones without
making any apology. Perhaps the Lewinsky story would have leaked, but the President would not
have had to dignify a rumor with a response. It was the entirely avoidable decision to have him

%° Paula Jones’ lawyer have subsequently revealed that the Jones lawsuit could have been settled at one point for no
money with just a simple apology from President Clinton which made it clear that Paula Jones did not do anything
wrong in the hotel room.

learning hierarchy, i.e. they are acquired *after* we learn to simulate a mental world, not before. Classical

linguists ignored the simulation of a mental world entirely.

It seems miraculous that purely conceptual machine translation works at all, but that is because concepts are
shared between speakers, so the structure of the conceptual space can be inferred from the statistics of
language use. But the statistics of language use have too little information to infer what objects look like

and how they interact.

My own original ideas concern a few parts of the emerging understanding of what the brain does. The
request-confirmation networks that I have introduced at a NIPS workshop in last the December are an
attempt at modeling how the higher layers might self-organize into cognitive programs.

during his next fifteen days in Hong Kong would not likely escape
China’s scrutiny.

The United States had the ability to also follow Snowden’s move-
ments via the cell phones of his lawyers and other confederates
after he surfaced. All tracking could be done by the NSA. What the
United States lacked was any practical means to capture a high-
profile intelligence defector in a city that was part of China. By this
time, U.S. intelligence had established that Chinese and Hong Kong
security services were monitoring Snowden’s every move. This left
few options in the game for the United States. “I’m not going to
be scrambling jets to get a twenty-nine-year-old hacker,” President
Obama said on June 27.

The real prize, in any case, was not Snowden but the NSA’s secret
documents that he had with him. When Snowden was observed
entering the Russian consulate, the game was all but over. U.S. dip-
lomats could protest over back channels to Moscow, as they did, but
with a trove of NSA secrets at stake there was little expectation that
would stop the Russians. Two days later, the “single point of failure,”

© as Snowden described himself, was on his way to Russia, where his ©
hosts would be calling the shots.

When a victory is obtained in a major sports event, it is cause for
public celebrations. The opposite is true in espionage. An intelligence
victory involving secret documents, even if it cannot be entirely
hidden, is kept veiled, as far as is possible, to increase the value of
the coup. “The final move in any sophisticated intelligence game,”
Angleton told me in relation to espionage intelligence, is “obscuring
a success.”

Following Angleton’s precept, the Russian or Chinese intelli-
gence services, if they had a role in acquiring the product of the self-
described “single point of failure,” would work to cover their tracks in
the affair even before the Aeroflot plane carrying Snowden touched
down at Sheremetyevo International Airport on June 23. If any false
flag operations had been used to trick, mislead, or otherwise induce
Snowden to come to Hong Kong, they would be disbanded. If any
safe house had been used to quarter Snowden in his first eleven days
in Hong Kong, it would be shut down. If any operatives had been

Do you prefer a phone call or an e-mail to answer a quick question?

PHONE CALL, absolutely. DO NOT e-mail me for anything urgent. I really follow my own

When Tim types “dictate” in the e-mail response, this means that we can say to the recipient: As
Tim is traveling at the moment and not able to personally respond to your e-mail, I mentioned
your message while on the phone to him, and he asked me to dictate. This makes the process easier
as we do not have to change the context of the person responding.

[This is to avoid having an assistant convert my first-person “Please tell him that I ...” to third-
person “Tim says that he ...”—providing shorthand for “cut and paste” saves hours of assistant
time. ]

If someone e-mail blasts a bunch of people and I am one of them, usually safe to ignore or delete.
Read them carefully, of course, but if it says for example “a few influential people I know” or
something like that then if someone can’t take the time to personalize for me, forget them. If Tim is

touch and smell (the latter being better modeled as something like an asymmetric Hopfield net,
prone to frequent chaotic dynamics [LLW~05]) — these may also cross-connect with each other
and with the more hierarchical perceptual subnetworks. Of course the suggested architecture
could inclide any number of sensory modalities; the diagram is restricted to four just for
simplicity.

The self-organized patterns in the upper layers of perceptual hierarchies may become quite
complex and may develop advanced cognitive capabilities like episodic memory, reasoning, lan-
guage learning, etc. A pure deep learning approach to intelligence argues that all the aspects
of intelligence emerge from this kind of dynamics (among perceptual, action and reinforcement
hierarchies). Our own view is that the heterogeneity of human brain architecture argues against
this perspective, and that deep learning systems are probably better as models of perception
and action than of general cognition. However, the integrative diagram is not committed to
our perspective on this — a deep-learning theorist could accept the integrative diagram, but
argue that all the other portions besides the perceptual, action and reinforcement hierarchies
should be viewed as descriptions of phenomena that emerge in these hierarchies due to their
interaction.

reality to portray Fatah as colluding with Israel against the Palestinian
people during a confrontation.

For its part, Hamas has the support of Islamists in the region,
including Shiite Iranians, but that is an explosive mix to base a
strategy on. Hamas must break its isolation if it is to counter the tired
but real power of Fatah. Symbolic flotillas from Turkey are
comforting, but Hamas needs an end to Egyptian hostility to Hamas
more than anything.

Egypt's Role and Fatah on the Defensive

Egypt is the power that geographically isolates Hamas through its
treaty with Israel and with its still-functional blockade on Gaza. More
than anyone, Hamas needs genuine regime change in Egypt. The new
regime it needs is not a liberal democracy but one in which Islamist
forces supportive of Hamas, namely the Muslim Brotherhood, come
to power.

At the moment, that is not likely. Egypt's military has retained a
remarkable degree of control, its opposition groups are divided
between secular and religious elements, and the religious elements
are further divided among themselves - as well as penetrated by an
Egyptian security apparatus that has made war on them for years. As
it stands, Egypt is not likely to evolve in a direction favorable to
Hamas. Therefore, Hamas needs to redefine the political situation in
Egypt to convert a powerful enemy into a powerful friend.

Though it is not easy for a small movement to redefine a large nation,
in this case, it could perhaps happen. There is a broad sense of
unhappiness in Egypt over Egypt's treaty with Israel, an issue that
comes to the fore when Israel and the Palestinians are fighting. As in
other Arab countries, passions surge in Egypt when the Palestinians
are fighting the Israelis.

Under Mubarak, these passions were readily contained in Egypt. Now
the Egyptian regime unquestionably is vulnerable, and pro-

Conclusion—Closing Argument:

Looking back at my 50 year career and forward to the laws next 50 years.

As I begin my second half century of law practice and teaching, I look back with fondness,
nostalgia and a heavy dose of surprise on my interesting life and career, as I look forward to my
remaining years. Since I try to prepare my students to be lawyers over their entire careers, and
since the career of a lawyer now extends to a full half century, I must always think ahead to what
our legal system will look like when my current students end their careers.

I could not have asked more or better from my first half century. I have accomplished far more
than I could ever have anticipated, especially in light of my undistinguished elementary and high
school performance, and I have lived a more interesting life than I could ever have dreamed. I
have surely lived the passion of my times and I’ve been very lucky, at least so far. (I don’t want
to give myself a “kneina hura.”!’) Like the fictional Zelig in Woody Allen’s great film of that
name, I was privileged to have been present—literally or virtually—at many of the most important
legal and political events that transpired during my adult life. For some I volunteered, for others I
was solicited. Sometimes I was a direct participant, other times an active observer and reporter.
In this “closing argument” I will try to summarize my role in the important legal and political
developments in which I participated. I will also speculate about what the future may hold for our
system of laws and justice.

Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. viewed the role of the lawyer as a predictor of future legal decisions
and trends.’’” But the Talmud cautioned that prophecy ended with the destruction of the second
temple and that he/she who tries to prophecy the future is either a fool or a naive. Or asa
contemporary sage—Y ogi Berra—put it: “Prediction is very hard, especially about the future.” I
certainly agree that prognosticating the future is a daunting challenge, but lawyers and law
professors must confront that challenge, because one of the most important jobs we have is to
identify trends and to anticipate significant developments, I will try, therefore, with these cautions
in mind, to extrapolate about what a lawyer writing an autobiography 50 years from now might
look back at and write about.

Before I summarize my past and speculate about the future, let me say a word about my present
life. I remain extremely active in every phase of my career. Here is a summary of the week
during which I wrote these words. The week of November 13 through November 20, 2011 was
fairly typical of my life during my 74 year.!!

On Sunday morning I was picked up by limo and taken to Bedford airport where I boarded a
private 747 jet owned by Sheldon Adelson, reputed to be the richest Jew in history and among the
handful of wealthiest Americans. The son of a Boston cab driver, Adelson has accumulated
billions of dollars by building and running casinos in Las Vegas, Micow and Singapore. His jet,

first protected and then continued their activities were the following:

1. Ali Mohamed, identified in the 9/11 Commission Report as the leader of the 1998 Nairobi
Embassy bombing;

2. Mohammed Jamal Khalife, Osama bin Laden's close friend and, while in the Philippines, financier
of both Ramzi Yousef (principal architect of the first World Trade Center [WTC] attack) and his uncle
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed;

3. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, identified in the 9/11 Commission Report as the principal architect of
the 9/11 attacks”;

4. Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, two of the alleged 9/11 hijackers, whose presence in the
United States was concealed from the FBI by CIA officers for months before 9/11.

It might sound from these citations that the 9/11 Commission marked a new stage in the U.S.
treatment of these terrorists, and that the report now exposed those terrorists who in the past had
been protected. On the contrary, a principal purpose of my chapter is to show that

1. one purpose of protecting these individuals had been to protect a valued intelligence connection
(the al-Qaeda connection,” if you will);

2. one major intention of the 9/11 Commission Report was to continue protecting this connection;

3. those on the 9/11 Commission staff who were charged with this protection included at least one
commission member (Jamie Gorelick), one staff member (Dietrich Snell), and one important witness
(Patrick Fitzgerald) who earlier had figured among the terrorists’ protectors.

In the course of writing this chapter [Scott continues], | came to another disturbing conclusion | had
not anticipated. This is that a central feature of the protection has been to defend the 9/11
Commission’s false picture of al-Qaeda as an example of non-state terrorism, ignoring not just the
CIA but also the royal families of Saudi Arabia and Qatar. In reality, as | shall show, royal family
protection from Qatar and Saudi Arabia (concealed by the 9/11 Commission) was repeatedly given
to key figures like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged “principal architect of the 9/11 attacks.” The
establishment claims that the wars fought by America in Asia since 9/11 have been part of a global
“war on terror.” But this “war on terror” has been fought in alliance with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and
Pakistan - precisely the principal political and financial backers of the al-Qaedist networks the United
States has supposedly been fighting. Meanwhile the most authentic opponents in the region of these
Sunni al-Qaedists - the governments of Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Iran - have found themselves
overthrown (in the case of Iraq and Libya), subverted with U.S. support (in the case of Syria), or
sanctioned and threatened as part of an “axis of evil” (in the case of Iran). We should not forget that,
just one day after 9/11, “Rumsfeld was talking about broadening the objectives of our response and
‘getting Iraq.”

than a cover for on-going terrorism ops.

several billionaire clients. Months earlier, the stepmother of a 14-year-old girl told the
Palm Beach police that a wealthy older man, whom the girl later identified as Mr.
Epstein, might have had inappropriate sexual contact with her.

In sworn statements to the police, the 14-year-old and other teenage girls said a friend
had arranged for them to visit Mr. Epstein’s home and give him massages, usually in
their underwear, in exchange for cash.

Most of the girls, according to the police, said Mr. Epstein had masturbated during the
massages, and a few said he had penetrated them with his fingers or penis. They
identified him in photos and accurately described the inside of his home. Some recalled
that his employees had fed them snacks or rented them cars.

Mr. Epstein pleaded not guilty in August to the crime he was ultimately charged with,
soliciting prostitution. But at a time when prosecutors around the nation have become
increasingly severe in dealing with people accused of sex offenses, the case has raised
questions about whether Mr. Epstein’s prominence won him preferential treatment.

By the account of the police, they found probable cause to charge Mr. Epstein with much
more serious offenses: one count of lewd and lascivious molestation and four counts of
unlawful sexual activity with a minor.

But instead of proceeding with such charges on his own, the Palm Beach County state
attorney took the rare step of presenting a broad range of possible charges to a grand jury,
which indicted Mr. Epstein in July on the lesser count. In Florida, prosecutors usually
refer only capital cases to grand juries.

Even before the indictment, the Palm Beach police chief, Michael Reiter, had accused
prosecutors of giving Mr. Epstein special treatment and asked the state attorney, Barry E.
Krischer, to remove himself from the case.

In an editorial, The Palm Beach Post attacked Mr. Krischer, a Democrat whose post is
elective, saying the public had been left “to wonder whether the system tilted in favor of
a wealthy, well-connected alleged perpetrator and against very young girls who are
alleged victims of sex crimes.”

The case has taken a toll on the reputation of Mr. Epstein, who owns a palatial home in
Manhattan, has pledged $30 million to Harvard and once flew former President Bill
Clinton on his 727. Politicians including Eliot Spitzer, a Democratic candidate for
governor in New York, and Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, also a Democrat, have
returned campaign contributions from him.

But Mr. Epstein fought back, assembling a team of star lawyers, including Gerald B.
Lefcourt and Alan M. Dershowitz, a friend of his, to look into the backgrounds of his
young accusers.

Mr. Lefcourt says that the police acted “outrageously” and that his client has been
wrongfully dragged through the mud.

“He disputes that he ever had sex with any under-age person or anything like that,” said
Mr. Lefcourt, whose clients have included Russell Crowe, Martha Stewart and Abbie
Hoffman.

Neither the police nor the state attorney’s office would discuss the case in detail. But the

buyer (or affiliates of that buyer) or (ii) 33% of the Principals’ original KUE holdings in the aggregate.

14.20. Drag-Along Right

A Drag-Along Transfer’ means a sale or other transfer for economic value of a majority of the Common
LP Units held by KUE LLC or its affiliates (and, uniess otherwise approved by the Board of Directors and
ihe independent Committee of the General Partner, a corresponding percentage of Class A Shares held
by KUE LLC), Prior to the Initial Listing, in the event of a Drag-Along Transfer of Common LP Units and
corresponding Class A Shares to a proposed purchaser that is not a KUE LLC Entity (a “Proposed Drag-
Along Transfer), KUE LLC may require Investors to sell a pro rata portion (based on the percentage of
Units held by KUE LLC being sold in the Proposed Drag-Along Transfer) of their Units and Class A
Shares in the Proposed Drag-Along Transfer to the proposed purchaser on the same terms and
conditions as KUE LLC in the Proposed Drag-Along Transfer.

14.21. Additional Listing of Investors’ Units

Beginning any time after six months after the initial Listing, one or more holders holding an aggregate of
$100 million of more of the Units (calculated based on the issue price) may request KUE and the General
Partner to take such action as may be necessary (including regulatory and legal actions) for their Units to
be freely tradable and not subject to volume restrictions on the international securities exchange on which
the Initial Listing occurred; provided that no more than one such action may be required in any 12 month
period and customary cut-back and other provisions will apply in any such listing or underwritten
transaction, as the case may be. KUE will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such action toe
cover such holders and the securities of any other holders legally eligible to participate in such action.

14.22. Subsequent Capital Raising Activities

Subsequent to the completion of this offering, KUE may raise additional capital through the sale of equity
or debt securities. KUE will not have any preferred limited partner units outstanding upon completion of
this offering but KUE may issue limited partner units with preferences over the Common LP Units in the
future and may amend the Limited Partnership Agreement accordingly.

14.23. Periodic Reporting; Books and Records

As soon as practicable after the end of each fiscal year but in no event more than 180 days thereafter,
each Partner will be sent audited financial statements of KUE for the prior year. These financial!
statements will include: (i} profit and loss statements and (ii) a balance sheet showing KUE's financial
position as of the end of that fiscal year. KUE will also provide to each Partner on a semi-annual basis a
report concerning KUE’s operations. As soon as practicable after the end of each fiscal year, each
Partner will be furnished with all information necessary for the preparation of each Partner's U.S. Federal
income tax return and a copy of KUE's federal, state, and local tax or information returns for the year.

KUE will maintain at its principal place of business full and complete books and records for KUE including
the following: (1) a current list of the full name and last known business or residence address of each

to more jail time than his boss as a result of the complex investigation into Epstein’s activities. He was
fired, he says, for inadvertently drawing police attention to one of the girls when she arrived at the house
unannounced to collect money. He saw an unfamiliar “beater” in the driveway one evening and called
911. When he left Epstein’s employ, Rodriguez took away some notes and emails about massage
appointments as “protection” against his own prosecution, and failed to produce them during the Palm
Beach Police Department’s initial investigation.

Unable to get work as a house manager elsewhere in South Florida, he says, Rodriguez later tried to sell
this “golden nugget”—his term—for $50,000, to be used in the victims’ civil suits. Unfortunately, he
made the offer to an undercover cop, and was subsequently charged with “obstruction of official
proceedings” for withholding information that could have advanced the criminal investigation of
Epstein—which by that point had been settled in a plea deal. Rodriguez was sentenced to 18 months in
federal prison (Epstein was allowed to serve 13 months in the Palm Beach county jail), and now awaits
an additional sentence on Aug. 24 in federal court in Miami for transporting firearms, another deal he
says he made to pay the bills after he lost his job.
In a deposition given for the civil suits, Rodriguez testified that he was instructed to always have $2,000
in cash on hand, so that he could pay both the girls who gave massages and recruiters such as Haley
Robson who brought them to the house. He also testified that Epstein made large contributions to the
Palm Beach Police Department, and in return was given PBPD baseball hats to put on the dashboard of
his various cars to avoid being stopped or ticketed by local police. Retired Police Chief Michael Reiter,
in his own deposition, acknowledged that, in addition to earlier donations to the police department
(which are fairly common in well-heeled Palm Beach), Epstein had recently given the department
$100,000 for some sophisticated equipment. The police were still researching the purchase when Epstein
came under suspicion, and Reiter ordered the money returned. (Guy Frostin, one of Epstein’s local
attorneys, told police that Epstein also gave $100,000 to the Florida Ballet for massages, because he was
“very passionate” about massages being “therapeutically and spiritually” beneficial. Yet victims told
police they had no massage training.)
Perhaps most disturbing, in terms of possible sex trafficking, was Epstein’s relationship with Jean Luc
Brunel, owner of the MC2 modeling agency. According to a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of Florida, an alleged victim said that Epstein, Maxwell, Brunel, Rodriguez, and
Marcinkova “deliberately engaged in a pattern of racketeering that involved luring minor children
through MC2, mostly girls under the age of 17, to engage in sexual play for money.” (Which would
amount to trafficking.)
Brunel is a 50-plus French playboy who was formerly part owner of Karin, a Paris-based modeling
agency. He lives in New York and South Beach, Florida, and owns 85 percent of MC2, which has offices
in New York, Miami, and Tel Aviv. (The remaining 15 percent is owned by his partner, Jeff Fuller.)
Brunel has been observed as a house guest at Epstein’s Palm Beach home and may well have had contact
with him also in New York, where Epstein owns a lavish home, and in Paris, where Epstein keeps an
apartment on elegant Ave. Foch.
CBS reporter Craig Pyes, who investigated Brunel for a 60 Minutes broadcast many years ago, is quoted
in Michael Gross’ book about the modeling industry, Model: The Ugly Business of Beautiful Women.

combination of explicit and implicit knowledge in the system’s knowledge graph, the synergetic
interaction of different cognitive processes would not work so smoothly, and the emergence of
effective high-level hierarchical, heterarchical and self structures would be less likely.

6.6 Analysis and Synthesis Processes in CogPrime

We now return to CogPrime’s fundamental cognitive dynamics, using examples from the “virtual
dog” application to motivate the discussion.

The cognitive schematic Context \ Procedure — Goal leads to a conceptualization of the
internal action of an intelligent system as involving two key categories of learning:

e Analysis: Estimating the probability p of a posited C A P > G relationship

e Synthesis: Filling in one or two of the variables in the cognitive schematic, given as-
sumptions regarding the remaining variables, and directed by the goal of maximizing the
probability of the cognitive schematic

More specifically, where synthesis is concerned,

e The MOSES probabilistic evolutionary program learning algorithm is applied to find P,
given fixed C' and G. Internal simulation is also used, for the purpose of creating a simulation
embodying C and seeing which P lead to the simulated achievement of G.

— Example: A virtual dog learns a procedure P to please its owner (the goal G) in the
contert C where there is a ball or stick present and the owner is saying “fetch”.

e PLN inference, acting on declarative knowledge, is used for choosing C, given fixed P and
G (also incorporating sensory and episodic knowledge as appropriate). Simulation may also
be used for this purpose.

— Example: A virtual dog wants to achieve the goal G of getting food, and it knows that
the procedure P of begging has been successful at this before, so it seeks a context C
where begging can be expected to get it food. Probably this will be a context involving a
friendly person.

e PLN-based goal refinement is used to create new subgoals G to sit on the right hand side
of instances of the cognitive schematic.

— Example: Given that a virtual dog has a goal of finding food, it may learn a subgoal of
following other dogs, due to observing that other dogs are often heading toward their

food.

e Concept formation heuristics are used for choosing G and for fueling goal refinement, but
especially for choosing C (via providing new candidates for C). They are also used for
choosing P, via a process called “predicate schematization” that turns logical predicates
(declarative knowledge) into procedures.

— Example: At first a virtual dog may have a hard time predicting which other dogs are
going to be mean to it. But it may eventually observe common features among a number
of mean dogs, and thus form its own concept of “pit bull,” without anyone ever teaching
it this concept explicitly.

feature in other Nusayri rituals, namely Ali, Muhammad, and Salman
al-Farisi (the Persian companion of Muhammad who in several
Islamic traditions forms a link between the Arabs and the wisdom of
ancient Persia). Nusayri rituals, performed in private homes or out-of-
the-way places, include a ceremony known as Qurban—almost
identical to the mass—where wine is consecrated and imbibed in the
Christian manner. As Matti Moosa, a leading scholar of the Nusayris,
states in his seminal study Extremist Shiites: The Ghulat Sects
(1988):

The Christian elements in the Nusayri religion are unmistakable.
They include the concept of trinity; the celebration of Christmas, the
consecration of the Qurban, that is, the sacrament of the flesh and
blood which Christ offered to His disciples, and, most important, the
celebration of the Quddas [a lengthy prayer proclaiming the divine
attributes of Ali and the personification of all the biblical patriarchs
from Adam to Simon Peter, founder of the Church, who is seen,
paradoxically, as the embodiment of true Islam].

Moosa suggests that like other schismatic groups residing in Syria,
such as the Druzes and Ismailis, the Nusayris do not take their beliefs
literally, but understand them as allegorical ways of reaching out to
the divine. While this may be true of the educated naqibs, or spiritual
elders, such belief systems may have different ramifications for
semiliterate peasants, reinforcing a contempt or disdain for outsiders
who do not share these beliefs. Like the Druzes and some Ismailis,
Nusayris believe in metempsychosis or transmigration. The souls of
the wicked pass into unclean animals such as dogs and pigs, while the
souls of the righteous enter human bodies more perfect than their
present ones. The howls of jackals that can be heard at night are the
souls of Sunni Muslims calling their misguided co-religionists to
prayer.

will tend in fact to be lower, judging from logic and evidence for a decline in risk

tolerance with age.

Then what besides work is recovered in pay? The two possibilities I was weighing
were maintenance consumption and human depreciation. The winner was obvious.
The higher-paid usually consume more, but not always and not in proportion. The
fact that we must generally be paid enough to cover consumption does not imply
that we are paid to consume. We are motivated to do that anyhow. We are paid to
apply skills, and are paid in proportion to skills applied. Human capital is skill sets.
Pay measures its transfer to products, whether in realized work currently created or

from capital in place through human depreciation.

That’s how! came to the pay rule. We see why it ought to startle economists.
Macroeconomic tradition teaches the doctrine that wage measures work, and
teaches it so confidently that it uses the notation W for either. Human capital
tradition recognizes that some work is self-invested, but effectively treats human
depreciation as deadweight loss. That’s why I use “pay” in place of the more usual

“wage”.

Refuting a Piketty Argument

There are practical uses for the pay rule aside from solution of the age-wage
problem. These are the impact on tax laws and public policy that I promised. Piketty
has shown correctly that the ratio of pay to net profit rose substantially during the
world wars, world depression and welfare state period following, and has declined
since. Piketty argues for higher capital taxes in consequence. His argument follows
tradition in comparing pay and net profit as the shares of workers and investors in
income. But tradition is wrong. Pay is the worker’s gross realized income, meaning
gross of human depreciation. Depreciation, for either factor, is a steadier flow. This
makes gross output for either less responsive to upturns and downturns. It is a

particularly high share of realized income or output in hard times when dislocation

Eye on the Market, June 14, 2011 (attached PDF is easier to read)

 

Market update: for better or worse, this is the kind of year we were expecting.  We were surprised at the market’s unbridled optimism in April*, since the tug-of-war between private sector profits and public sector problems has a long way to go.  We chose the charts on the front page of our 2011 Outlook carefully; they were designed to show that equity markets were priced inexpensively, but were likely to stay that way, given too much stimulus in the East, and ineffective stimulus in the West **.  We expect a modest second half recovery, based primarily on US capital spending increases, easy credit conditions everywhere, and a pick-up in industrial production in Japan.  But the world’s structural problems are weighing on the private sector, and our portfolios are positioned for a single-digit year in credit, equities and hedge funds.

 

* The Osama Bin Laden episode marked the equity market peak.  Some commentators saw this event as a basis for further optimism, but unsurprisingly, the positive glow lasted for only around 2.5 hours the subsequent Monday.  According to the Congressional Research Service, over the last decade, the US has spent at least $1.1 trillion in war funding operations, surpassing the constant-dollar cost of the Korean and Vietnam Wars combined.  This highlights the disproportionately large pain that small, non-sovereign entities can inflict in the modern era.

 

** So far, the large growth and employment multipliers from deficit spending estimated by Christina Romer (former Chair of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers) have not materialized.  John Taylor and John Cogan from Stanford have been closer to the mark: an initial boost, but then a rapidly fading benefit

 

Something different this week.  I was on the road seeing clients last week, and was asked “what should be done about job growth”.  We are investors and not politicians, so my ideas [a] are not relevant.  However, it seems to me that anyone involved in the jobs debate should be required to read the article below, written after the prior deep US recession (1990-1991).  It’s from George McGovern, one of the most liberal politicians [b] ever to hold office and run for President.   His epiphanies after leaving office and running the Stratford Inn are worth considering as legislators contemplate additional job creation measures, and the broader regulatory environment in which the private sector operates.

 

“A Politician's Dream Is a Businessman's Nightmare”, by George McGovern, June 1992 [c]

 

Wisdom too often never comes, and so one ought not to reject it merely because it comes late.  (Justice Felix Frankfurter).   It's been 11 years since I left the U.S. Senate, after serving 24 years in high public office. After leaving a career in politics, I devoted much of my time to public lectures that took me into every state in the union and much of Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. 

 

In 1988, I invested most of the earnings from this lecture circuit acquiring the leasehold on Connecticut's Stratford Inn. Hotels, inns and restaurants have always held a special fascination for me. The Stratford Inn promised the realization of a longtime dream to own a combination hotel, restaurant and public conference facility--complete with an experienced manager and staff.   In retrospect, I wish I had known more about the hazards and difficulties of such a business, especially during a recession of the kind that hit New England just as I was acquiring the inn's 43-year leasehold.  I also wish that during the years I was in public office, I had had this firsthand experience about the difficulties business people face every day. That knowledge would have made me a better U.S. senator and a more understanding presidential contender.

 

Today we are much closer to a general acknowledgment that government must encourage business to expand and grow.  Bill Clinton, Paul Tsongas, Bob Kerrey and others have, I believe, changed the debate of our party [d].  We intuitively know that to create job opportunities we need entrepreneurs who will risk their capital against an expected payoff.   Too often, however, public policy does not consider whether we are choking off those opportunities. 

 

My own business perspective has been limited to that small hotel and restaurant in Stratford, Conn., with an especially difficult lease and a severe recession. But my business associates and I also lived with federal, state and local rules that were all passed with the objective of helping employees, protecting the environment, raising tax dollars for schools, protecting our customers from fire hazards, etc. While I never doubted the worthiness of any of these goals, the concept that most often eludes legislators is: `Can we make consumers pay the higher prices for the increased operating costs that accompany public regulation and government reporting requirements with reams of red tape.' It is a simple concern that is nonetheless often ignored by legislators [e].   For example, the papers today are filled with stories about businesses dropping health coverage for employees. We provided a substantial package for our staff at the Stratford Inn. However, were we operating today, those costs would exceed $150,000 a year for health care on top of salaries and other benefits. There would have been no reasonable way for us to absorb or pass on these costs. 

 

Some of the escalation in the cost of health care is attributed to patients suing doctors. While one cannot assess the merit of all these claims, I've also witnessed firsthand the explosion in blame-shifting and scapegoating for every negative experience in life.   Today, despite bankruptcy, we are still dealing with litigation from individuals who fell in or near our restaurant. Despite these injuries, not every misstep is the fault of someone else. Not every such incident should be viewed as a lawsuit instead of an unfortunate accident. And while the business owner may prevail in the end, the endless exposure to frivolous claims and high legal fees is frightening. 

 

Our Connecticut hotel, along with many others, went bankrupt for a variety of reasons, the general economy in the Northeast being a significant cause. But that reason masks the variety of other challenges we faced that drive operating costs and financing charges beyond what a small business can handle. It is clear that some businesses have products that can be priced at almost any level. The price of raw materials (e.g., steel and glass) and life-saving drugs and medical care are not easily substituted by consumers. It is only competition or antitrust that tempers price increases. Consumers may delay purchases, but they have little choice when faced with higher prices.   In services, however, consumers do have a choice when faced with higher prices. You may have to stay in a hotel while on vacation, but you can stay fewer days. You can eat in restaurants fewer times per month, or forgo a number of services from car washes to shoeshines. Every such decision eventually results in job losses for someone. And often these are the people without the skills to help themselves--the people I've spent a lifetime trying to help. 

 

In short, “one-size-fits-all” rules for business ignore the reality of the market place. And setting thresholds for regulatory guidelines at artificial levels--e.g., 50 employees or more, $500,000 in sales--takes no account of other realities, such as profit margins, labor intensive vs. capital intensive businesses, and local market economics.   The problem we face as legislators is: Where do we set the bar so that it is not too high to clear? I don't have the answer. I do know that we need to start raising these questions more often.

So, there you have it, one of the more remarkable epiphanies in American politics: a paean to entrepreneurship and government restraint from one of its most progressive members.  Public epiphanies like this are rare, but there have been others.  Last year, Al Gore conceded that first-generation ethanol was “not good policy” given its low energy conversion ratios, and said he had supported ethanol out of “a certain fondness for the farmers in the state of Iowa because I was about to run for president [f].  In 2008, former Fed Chair Greenspan conceded that his Ayn Rand philosophies regarding regulations and shareholder self-interest were flawed.  Perhaps the most famous epiphany was from Robert McNamara, Secretary of Defense and one of the principal architects of the Vietnam War.  In 1995, he conceded that he was “wrong, terribly wrong” about the war.  George McGovern was one of the war’s fiercest opponents, saying on the floor of the Senate, “I'm tired of old men dreaming up wars for young men to fight”.

 

There may be no magic elixir of policies to speed the adjustment the US faces.  Look at it this way: the US is trying the mega-stimulus route, while the UK has accelerated its fiscal austerity program.  Yet both countries are struggling with below-trend growth and employment.  Perhaps after a debt binge, there are no easy answers, other than time.  What to do next?  McGovern’s article suggests that an overly interventionist public sector may be the wrong answer, given the unintended consequences.

Notes

[a] I like the idea of extending the holding period for short term capital gains to 3-5 years, and cutting the long term capital gains rate closer to 5%-10%.  It could encourage more business formation, since more of what people create, they keep.  If the cutoff year is properly set, it could be done on a deficit–neutral basis.

 

[b] According to methodology described by Keith Poole of the University of San Diego in the American Journal of Political Science, McGovern ranks as the 99th most liberal politician out of 3,320 politicians serving from 1937 to 2002.

 

[c] In a letter to the Wall Street Journal.  Reprinted with permission; emphasis added.

 

[d] This may not have been a permanent change.  The National Taxpayers Union rated the Blue Dog Democrats as having a fiscal conservatism score of 52% in 1995; by 2009, it had fallen to 18%.

 

[e] Would McGovern’s focus on red tape make sense today?  According to surveys conducted by the National Federation of Small Business, the answer would be yes.   The 3 issues most frequently mentioned as each respondent’s “single most important problem” are Poor Sales, Regulation & Red Tape, and Taxes.  Two things of note.  First, Regulation & Red Tape concerns have been steadily rising over the last two years.  Secondly, availability of credit does not show up as an issue.  As the NFIB wrote in May 2011, “92 percent reported that all their credit needs were met or that they were not interested in borrowing.  Eight percent reported that not all of their credit needs were satisfied. Three percent reported financing as their #1 business problem, so credit supply is not a problem for the overwhelming majority.”

emerged to protest what they considered the Almoravids’ “tolerance.”
Their takeover of Andalusia radicalized the society, leading to the
persecution of non-Muslims and to religious warfare.

Turkey’s Islamization under the AKP threatens to follow a similar, if
more gradual, trajectory. The AKP’s embrace of religious values is
not the biggest problem of Turkish secularists. Rather, the larger
threat is that, now that the AKP has pushed religion more to the
center of Turkish social preoccupations, fundamentalists will gain
carte blanche to challenge the AKP as “not Muslim enough.”

Indeed, last November the AKP was moved to fire Ali Bardakoglu,
the liberal head of Diyanet, Turkey’s official religious authority that
has historically checked fanaticism by building mosques and training
imams while promoting a liberal understanding of Islam. The AKP
replaced Bardakoglu with another well-known scholar, Mehmet
Gormez, who has an avowedly more conservative take on Islam.

The new Diyanet chief’s first act was to fire Ayse Sucu, who headed
the organization’s women’s branch. Sucu’s initiatives had included
suggesting that women should be able to decide for themselves
whether to cover their hair. Fundamentalist media and pundits were
ecstatic at her ousting, claiming that it signaled that there was no
room for a personal interpretation of Islam.

The AKP has promoted socially conservative values, such as the need
for women to wear the Islamic headscarf and a disdain for alcohol.
Turkish bureaucrats and businesspeople complain that embracing
these practices to prove that one is a “good Muslim” has become a
precondition for getting government promotions and contracts.
Meanwhile, the AKP-run media watchdog recently scolded a
television station for broadcasting a program about Suleiman the
Magnificent that truthfully depicted the famously cosmopolitan
Ottoman sultan drinking alcohol. The official warning followed an
outcry led by AKP leaders and fundamentalists alike, who demanded

as “so proud” and so “endowed with intelligence,” but who “have in the main given their
acquiescence or their support to the Nixon ethos” which has led to the death, maiming,
and displacement of “some six million Southeast Asians.” Berrigan referred to the ironic
figure of 6 million as “one of those peculiar facts which must be called free-floating” and
concluded with a veiled threat to both American Jews and to Israel: “To put the matter
brutally, many American Jewish leaders were capable of ignoring the Asian holocaust in
favor of economic and military aid to Israel ... It is not merely we nor the Vietnamese
who must live with that fact. So must Israel. So must the American Jews.”

Reaction to Berrigan’s polemic was swift and sharp, especially among lawyers who had
represented left-wing causes and individuals. Battle lines were quickly drawn. Some, like
William Kunstler, supported Berrigan. Others — among them lawyers who had
represented Berrigan and Kunstler — were appalled at Berrigan’s diatribe.

In 1970, the guild sent a delegation to the Congress of the International Association of
Democratic Lawyers — an organization consisting largely of Communist lawyers from
Eastern Europe and “progressive” lawyers from Western Europe. The International
Association of Democratic Lawyers passed a resolution supporting Palestinian terrorism,
characterizing it as “heroic” and “legitimate resistance and ... the expression of a national
liberation movement constituting an integral part of the world struggle for liberation
against imperialism.” The guild delegates were subjected to considerable pressure from
the PLO to conform their organization’s policy to the consensus of “democratic” and
“progressive” lawyers. It agreed, therefore to commit “the resources of the organization
to continuing and expanding our internal political education on the Palestinian question.”

As part of this educational process, the guild subsequently decided to send what it called
an objective delegation to the Middle East. The organizer of this “objective” group was
Abdeen Jabara, the founder of the Association of Arab-American University Graduates
and the editor of Free Palestine, a paper that justified the planting of terrorist bombs in
universities and marketplaces. Jabara arranged for the funding of the three-week, ten-
person trip and for its itinerary. The major funding for and sponsorship of this objective
educational adventure came from none other than the “objective” Palestine Liberation
Organization.

The grateful delegation showed its appreciation for the PLO grant by beginning its
education in PLO camps and, according to one member of the delegation, limiting its
interviews almost exclusively to PLO-approved Palestinians and Israeli anti-Zionists.

The resulting report contained few surprises: it presents a sordid caricature of Israel as a
repressive totalitarian society which tortures, imprisons, and expels its Arab population without
even a semblance of reason or justification. Nowhere in the report’s 127 pages is there any
discussion of the PLO terrorism that plagued the civilian population of Israel and the West Bank.
Indeed, the single mention of terrorism that I was able to find in the report is a quoted reference
to “acts of terrorism” by Israeli authorities against the peaceful Arab occupants of the West Bank.

FBI investigation, while defenders say the president acted properly and Comey deserved to be

Mr. John Roth
June 19, 2008
Page 14

Appx. 849, 2006 WL 14581 at *3 (1 1” Cir. 2006) (to establish Sims’s guilt on the sex trafficking of
a minor count, the government had to show that Sims benefited financially from Owen’s sexual
activity and that Sims knew that (a) force or coercion would be used to cause Owens to engage in a
criminal sex act or (b) that Owens was under the age of 18.) (emphasis added). Again, none of these
factors is present in this case. The Eleventh Circuit’s interpretation of the statute makes perfect
sense: were § 1591 not limited in this fashion, it would threaten to criminalize a host of localized
behavior that has nothing to do with human trafficking, and, thus, is of no valid federal interest.

In sum, to accord discretion to the USAO, albeit without benefit of the requested full de novo
review, to exercise authority to pursue a prosecution which involves a “novel” application of three
federal statutes in the face of numerous “compelling arguments” is not warranted, as it is not
supported by the facts, the law, or justice. Echoing the admonition of the Supreme Court in the
Berger decision, the Comment to Rule 3.8 of the Rules of Professional Conduct (Special
Responsibilities of a Prosecutor), says it best “A prosecutor has the responsibility of a minister of
justice and not simply that of an advocate. This responsibility carries with it specific obligations to
see that a defendant is accorded procedural justice and that guilt is decided upon the basis of
sufficient evidence.” This is a responsibility that can not be taken for granted. The government bears
the burden of assuring that it possesses sufficient evidence to prove each element of a crime with
respect to some specific victim before publicly branding Mr. Epstein a child molester. In this case,
however, the USAO has not met its burden for any victim for any of the crimes alleged. It is not
enough to simply gloss over the required proof, and rely on the jury or the court to just sort it all out
in the end. The stakes are too high. As a result, the USAO should not be permitted to pursue an
unfounded federal criminal case against Mr. Epstein under the guise of prosecutorial discretion.

Such prosecution in this case necessarily would appear to be selective to Mr. Epstein. To be
clear, our request that Mr. Epstein should not be prosecuted federally would not permit him to go
completely unpunished, but, rather, would simply place him in the same prosecution position as
others similarly situated. Therefore, we continue to believe that after a complete, de novo, and
independent review, the only appropriate conclusion will be that this case is best left to the state to
resolve.

Very truly yours,

Did you ever consider that Loudoun was a target? That your community was induced to walk it’s own
children down the plank as compensation for what Loudoun had done to the young Dima Yakovlev?
Because now child exploitation is deeply embedded within your community with your own people
(your own police, your own prosecutors, your own public defenders and private attorneys) protecting
this very system that will be used to take the futures of your Loudoun children (see more of the details

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024548.txt,"14. THE STRUCTURE OF KUE AND THE GENERAL PARTNER

The following information is a summary of the principal terms of the organizational documents of KUE and
the General Partner. The information below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended and
Restated Limited Partnership Agreement of KUE and the organizational documents of the General
Partner, including the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association of the General
Partner and the Agreement Among Members of the General Partner (the “Organizational Documents”),
copies of which have been provided or are available upon request. in the event of any inconsistency
between the terms herein and the terms of the Organizational Documents, the Organizational Documents
shall control.

14.1. KUE

KUE is constituted as a Cayman islands exempted limited partnership under the Exempted Limited
Partnership Law (2003 Revision) (the “ELP Law’). A Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership is
constituted by the signing of the relevant partnership agreement and its registration with the Registrar of
Exempted Limited Partnerships in the Cayman Islands.

Notwithstanding registration, an exempted limited partnership is not a separate legal person distinct from
its partners. Under Cayman Islands law, any property of the exempted limited partnership shall be held or
deemed to be held by the general partner, and if more than one then by the general partners jointly upon
trust, as an asset of the partnership in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement. Similarly,
the general partner for and on behalf of the partnership incurs the debts or obligations of the exempted
limited partnership. Registration under the ELP Law eniails that the partnership becomes subject to, and
the limited partners therein are afforded the limited liability and other benefits of the ELP Law.

The business of an exempted limited partnership will be conducted by its general partner(s) who will be
liable for all debts and obligations of the exempted limited partnership to the extent the partnership has
insufficient assets. As a general matter, a limited partner of an exempted limited partnership will not be
liable for the debts and obligations of the exempied limited partnership save (i) as expressed in the
partnership agreement, (ii) if such limited partner becomes involved in the conduct of the partnership's
business or (iii) if such limited partner is obliged pursuant to Section 14(1) of the ELP Law to return a
distribution made to it where the exempted limited partnership is insolvent,

The Limited Partnership Agreement of KUE limits the liability and reduces the fiduciary duties of the
General Partner to the Limited Partners of KUE (the Limited Partners,” and, together with the General
Partner, the “Partners”) to the full extent of applicable law. The Limited Partnership Agreement also
restricts the remedies available to the Limited Partners for actions that might otherwise constitute a
breach of the General Partner's fiduciary duties owed to the Limited Partners. By purchasing Units,
Investors are treated as having consented to various actions contemplated in the Limited Partnership
Agreement and conflicts of interest that might otherwise be considered a breach of fiduciary or other
duties under applicable Cayman law.

14.2. The General Partner

The General Partner is incorporated in the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited liability
under the Companies Law (2004 Revision) (the “Companies Law’), The Memorandum and Articles of
Association comprise the constitution of General Partner. The principal business purpose of the General
Partner is to act as the general partner of KUE, tc own interests in KUE and to engage in activities related
thereto (the Business Purpose), The General Partner will not engage in maierial activities (including
holding any material assets or incurring any material liabilities) unrelated to the Business Purpose, The
General Partner has no prior operating history or prior business and will not have any substantial assets or

when artspace and debt taken out, - then only after weeks, when you delayed any detailed discussion of
money wanting to give the issue a thoughtful response ( which I fully understand ) . you unilaterally
changed our agreement.. 5m would be reserved for the future ? . and out of the remaining 15m ,? 1
would receive only a third. ( note : I'm confident that both the debt , and the art space investment will also
lead to a write- off of another 30 m. plus ) In my dining room ,you were surprised when I said that 1
require most people to pay their advisory fee up front so that I am assured that I will be properly
compensated for my work when strategies are implemented . you may recall that you appeared offended
and said  are you suggesting that i would go back on my word I said no , of course not ! you are my
closest of friends ,but my experience is that when amounts get large, people tend to get unhappy when it
actually comes time for them to pay.

I include below the email i sent to you on April 15, the day i was examining your returns It laid out
my understanding of the compensation agreed for a transaction of the magnitude to the penny of the one
just completed.ie 600m When it appeared that the transcation would and could go foward I was the
first to point out that our agreement would cost you too much money, therefore

From day one I proposed to discount our agreement toa 50-60 million range. An extremely fair price
for all the transactions just completed . including Phaidon. - I was never told that this was out of
range. in fact, alternative methods of payment . ie my plane, or an -in-kind payment were discussed (ie
including keeping the 30m portion of the fee outstanding till March ) ,I provided , only because you
specifically requested a detailed step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that i was given
access to. ( Phaidon was never forthcoming ) in order to make my many corrections . ( as i said more
needed on phaidon ). Iwas then told that Alans involvement warranted a discount . Even in the best
of light , though it is beyond question that not one time in the three years of his retainer has he ever
proposed a unique idea. (including any way to deal with the use issue on debras death ,or even the most
basic review of your largest asset by far , the BRH agreement. ) O.K. - lets say he made a contribution to
the plan and stretch reality beyond the pale and say it was 50 %. though no one could posit such a large
amount unless they were wearing a clown suit. , the payment and our formula of 37 percent associated
with the deal was known . It had both sent in writing and spoken about on the phone numerous times ,

a detailed execution plan was provided . then and only then, after the entire transaction was laid out for
the group to follow You told me that after a number of conversations with brad karp that a total of only
20m would be paid , (and even that was more than you originally contemplated ) for both transactions .
Leon I feel It was remarkably unfair. Did brad even knew of our prior agreements.? ?, I would ask that
you I and Brad karp sit together if you think it would be helpful. . I would like to send him this email, with
your consent of course. Ifthe transactions were never consummated , 1 would not be owed a dime,
however , the expected fee was known up front. , the detailed step by step plan was followed and
overseen by me, the amount that I had requested before the transaction had even begun, had already
been heavily discounted, out of friendship, . I believe the decision re only paying 20 m has frankly , left
me felling quite uneasy. and colors the view about the Athene or Rothschild transaction.

Trump’s relationship with Barrack is one of the most important, if little understood, of

cultivation of such a ruthlessly skeptical approach morally repugnant, and we can
anticipate that even the most proficient system-users would occasionally succumb to the
temptation to “befriend” their tools, if only to assuage their discomfort with the execution
of their duties. No matter how scrupulously the AI designers launder the phony “human”
touches out of their wares, we can expect novel habits of thought, conversational gambits
and ruses, traps and bluffs to arise in this novel setting for human action. The comically
long lists of known side effects of new drugs advertised on television will be dwarfed by
the obligatory revelations of the sorts of questions that cannot be responsibly answered
by particular systems, with heavy penalties for those who “overlook” flaws in their
products. It is widely noted that a considerable part of the growing economic inequality
in today’s world is due to the wealth accumulated by digital entrepreneurs; we should
enact legislation that puts their deep pockets in escrow for the public good. Some of the
deepest pockets are voluntarily out in front of these obligations to serve society first and
make money secondarily, but we shouldn’t rely on good will alone.

We don’t need artificial conscious agents. There is a surfeit of natural conscious
agents, enough to handle whatever tasks should be reserved for such special and
privileged entities. We need intelligent tools. Tools do not have rights, and should not
have feelings that could be hurt, or be able to respond with resentment to “abuses” rained
on them by inept users.'* One of the reasons for not making artificial conscious agents is
that however autonomous they might become (and in principle, they can be as
autonomous, as self-enhancing or self-creating, as any person), they would not—without
special provision, which might be waived—share with us natural conscious agents our
vulnerability or our mortality.

I once posed a challenge to students in a seminar at Tufts I co-taught with
Matthias Scheutz on artificial agents and autonomy: Give me the specs for a robot that
could sign a binding contract with you—not as a surrogate for some human owner but on
its own. This isn’t a question of getting it to understand the clauses or manipulate a pen
on a piece of paper but of having and deserving legal status as a morally responsible
agent. Small children can’t sign such contracts, nor can those disabled people whose
legal status requires them to be under the care and responsibility of guardians of one sort
or another. The problem for robots who might want to attain such an exalted status is
that, like Superman, they are too invulnerable to be able to make a credible promise. If
they were to renege, what would happen? What would be the penalty for promise-
breaking? Being locked in a cell or, more plausibly, dismantled? Being locked up is
barely an inconvenience for an AI unless we first install artificial wanderlust that cannot
be ignored or disabled by the AI on its own (and it would be systematically difficult to
make this a foolproof solution, given the presumed cunning and self-knowledge of the
AI); and dismantling an AI (either a robot or a bedridden agent like Watson) is not killing
it, if the information stored in its design and software is preserved. The very ease of
digital recording and transmitting—the breakthrough that permits software and data to be,

prosecutors narrowly interpreted their responsibilities under the Act.
Second, the Article reviews the purpose, text, structure, and history of the
CVRA, concluding that they all support the conclusion that crime victims
have rights during criminal investigations. Third, our Article critiques the
Department’s memorandum, demonstrating that the Department’s analysis
is unpersuasive. Fourth and finally, the Article provides a_ specific
approach for determining when rights should attach—specifically when
federal law enforcement agencies have identified a crime with sufficient
precision to send a “target” letter to a criminal defendant. We also
observe that federal and state prosecutors have already accorded rights to
victims before formally filing charges, which further undermines the
Department’s overly narrow construction of the Act.

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016273.txt,"rapid development of software without standards of correctness has opened up many
routes to exploit von Neumann architecture’s storage of data and instructions in the same
memory. One of the most common routes, known as “buffer overrun,” involves an input
number (or long string of characters) that is bigger than the programmer expected and
overflows into where the instructions are stored. By carefully designing an input number
that is too big by far, someone using a piece of software can infect it with instructions not
intended by the programmer, and thus change what it does. This is the basis for creating
a computer virus—so named for its similarity to a biological virus. The latter injects
extra DNA into a cell, and that cell’s transcription and translation mechanism blindly
interprets it, making proteins that may be harmful to the host cell. Furthermore, the
replication mechanism for the cell takes care of multiplying the virus. Thus, a small
foreign entity can take control of a much bigger entity and bend its behavior in
unexpected ways.

These and other forms of digital attacks have taken the security of our everyday
lives from us. We rely on computers for almost everything now. We rely on computers
for our infrastructure of electricity, gas, roads, cars, trains, and airplanes; these are all
vulnerable. We rely on computers for our banking, our payment of bills, our retirement
accounts, our mortgages, our purchasing of goods and services—these, too, are all
vulnerable. We rely on computers for our entertainment, our communications both
business and personal, our physical security at home, our information about the world,
and our voting systems—all vulnerable. None of this will get fixed anytime soon. In the
meantime, many aspects of our society are open to vicious attacks, whether by
freelancing criminals or nation-state adversaries.

The second development is that computation has gone beyond simply computing
functions. Instead, programs remain online continuously, and so they can gather data
about a sequence of queries. Under the Wiener/Turing/von Neumann scheme, we might
think of the communication pattern for a Web browser to be:

User: Give me Web page A.
Browser: Here is Web page A.

User: Give me Web page B.
Browser: Here is Web page B.

Now instead it can look like this:

User: Give me Web page A.
Browser: Here is Web page A. [And I will secretly
remember that you asked for Web page A.]

User: Give me Web page B.

Browser: Here is Web page B. [I see a correlation between
its contents and that of the earlier requested Web page A, so Iwill
update my model of you, the user, and transmit it to the company
that produced me. ]

Jacobson, 1981; Cornfield et al, 1982; Ornstein, 1989; Ruelle, 1990). The close

relationships in real brain observables between the appearance rate of new
symbols or new unstable periodic orbits, hr , and log 4(+), reflecting the rate of

divergence from the next expected value generating a new, unexpected value, is
not surprising. In fact, a maximal estimate of the entropy of a dynamical system, hr
= log 4(+) whereas the largest value that hy can attain is log(#of states). A great
deal of substantial mathematics has gone into proofs that similarities (“equivalence

relations”) and differences between dynamical patterns are robustly indicated by
differences in hy and hy (Adler et al, 1977; Adler and Marcus, 1979).

lf the sum of the densities in each | box were normalized so as to sum to 1.0,
such that each is a probability, pj , then - X pj log p; represents the metric entropy,
hu. hy was first described in the dynamical context by Kolmogorov (1958;1959).
The sum having a —1 prefactor converts the negative log of < 1 to a meaningful
positive value in the expression. hy is maximal for the equidistributed, uniformly
expansive, C or Axiom A systems (see above). As noted above, generally hy = the
maximum estimate of the entropy and hy the minimum estimate (Adler and Weiss,
1965). ht = hw in uniformly hyperbolic systems (Bowen, 1975) and the difference,
[hz — hy] is an index of non-uniformity found useful in discriminating among classes
of single neurons from their discharge patterns (Mandell, 1987; Selz and Mandell,
1992: Mandell and Selz, 1993; Mandell and Selz, 1997a). These measures applied
to temporal and spatial patterns of rat exploratory behavior have been used to
discriminate among stimulant drug effects (Paulus et al, 1990; Paulus and Geyer,
1992). Similar computations involving the symbolic dynamics and disallowed
transitions have been used to study the complexity of the the EEG (Xu, 1994) in
which both extremely low (fixed point, periodic) and high (Gaussian random)
entropies are seen as manifesting low “complexity as a function of the diversity of

the available patterns of behavior (Crutchfield and Young, 1989a).
Before describing the simple but definitional matrix operations for ht and hy

below which might seem forbidding to those “not up on their linear algebra,” we note

Fwd: Statement for Press 
From: Carolyn Cohen 
Date: February 10, 2015 at 10:40:57 AM EST 
To: Alan Dershowitz ______________________ 
Subject: Statement for Press 
Alan Dershowitz's Statement: We can now prove that Jane Doe #3 has no credibility and lied  
about Clinton, the Gores and Dershowitz.  
Dershowitz's lawyers have filed a detailed reply to Jane Doe #3 false charges. In it they definitively 
respond to all of the alleged evidence presented by Jane Doe #3 and her lawyers. Since that filing Mr. 
Dershowitz's lawyers have uncovered additional evidence that Jane Doe #3 has lied about her 
alleged contacts with fonner President Clinton and former Vice President Gore and the then Mrs. 
Gore. In her first affidavit to the court she repeats the claim that she had earlier sold to a British 
tabloid: namely that former President Bill Clinton was present on the island [Jeffrey Epstein's 
private island] at a time when [Jane Doe #3] was also present on the Island. 
This statement, sworn under oath, summarizes a far more elaborate fantasy that she sold to a British 
tabloid which has since been repeated by the international media. In neither statement, does she 
provide any specific dates or times, but she does weave an imaginative fantasy about her fictional 
meeting with former President Clinton. She describes how Mr. Clinton's Secret Service detail 
allowed Ghislaine Maxwell, then a novice helicopter pilot, to fly the former President to Epstein's 
private island on a large black helicopter — an obvious lie. She then purports to describe specific 
seating locations at a fictional dinner party that included her, Mr. Clinton, Jeffrey Epstein and two 
other underage olive-skinned brunettes whose identities she could not provide: 
I flew to the Caribbean with Jeffrey and then Ghislaine Maxwell went to pick up Bill in a huge black 
helicopter that Jeffrey had bought her. She'd always wanted to fly and Jeffrey paid for her to take 
lessons, and I remember she was very excited because she got her licence around the first year we 
met. I used to get frightened flying with her but Bill had the Secret Service with him and I remember 
him talking about what a good job she did. I only ever met Bill twice but Jeffrey had told me that 
they were good friends. I asked, How come? and he laughed and said, He owes me some 
favours. Maybe he was just joking but it constantly surprised me that people with as much to lose as 
Bill and [Prince] Andrew weren't more careful. She said that when dining that night, Maxwell sat at 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029225 
President Clinton's left, while they were joined by two 'olive-skinned brunettes' who had been flown 
in from New York... 
I'd never met them before. I'd say they were no older than 17, very innocent-looking. 
They weren't there for me. They weren't there for Jeffrey or Ghislaine because I was there to have sex 
with Jeffrey on the trip. 
Maybe Jeffrey thought they would entertain Bill, but I saw no evidence that he was interested in 
them. He and Jeffrey and Ghislaine seemed to have a very good relationship. Bill was very funny. 
He made me laugh a few times. And he and Jeffrey and Ghislaine told blokey jokes and the brunettes 
listened politely and giggled. 
After dinner I gave Jeffrey an erotic massage. I don't remember seeing Bill again on the trip but I 
assume Ghislaine flew him back... 
Jane Doe #3 also concocted another meeting with a powerful political figure for the British tabloid, 
this time claiming to have met former Vice President Gore and his then wife, Tipper, on the same 
Island, again providing no specific dates or times, but only personal interest details designed to 
enhance the value of her fictional account 
[Jane Doe #3} disclosed that Mr Clinton's vice-president Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, were also 
guests of Epstein on his island... 'I had no clue that anything was up,' [Jane Doe #3] says. 'The Gores 
seemed like a beautiful couple when I met them. All I knew was that Mr Gore was a friend of 
Jeffrey's and Ghislaine's. Jeffrey didn't ask me to give him a massage... There might have been a 
couple of other girls there on that trip but I could never have imagined this guy would do anything 
wrong. I was planning to vote for him when I turned 18. I thought he was awesome. 
These fabrications, which are obvious on their face, could easily have been determined to be false by 
any reasonable investigation. Our investigation has turned up evidence that Mr. Clinton was never 
on Mr. Epstein's island, that neither Mr. Gore, nor his former wife, have ever been on the island, and 
that Mr. and Mrs. Gore do not even know Mr. Epstein. Jane Doe #3's salaciously detailed accounts, 
sold for money to a tabloid are made up and were purposely designed to titillate the interests of 
readers eager for such salacious material. Jane Doe #3's even more salacious descriptions of her 
alleged sexual encounters with Dershowitz are also fabricated. 
If it turns out that Jane Doe #3 deliberately lied about seeing former President Clinton on the island, 
she would be guilty of perjury. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029226 
Mr. Dershowitz's legal team has uncovered additional evidence, which it is in the process of 
verifying, that proves a pattern of lying and false accusations that casts even further doubt on Jane 
Doe #3's credibility. This evidence will be disclosed once it has been confirmed by their 
investigation.

units, and they drew a kind of protective box of shellfire around Ira’s men as
they moved back. We sent our other reserve division towards the crossroads to
provide support, and Amram went with them to co-ordinate the operation. But
Ira still had to fight his way out. It was 15 minutes of hell. By the time he
reached safety at around nine in the morning, he’d lost ten tanks and nearly 20
men, four of them during the final, frantic retreat. Five more were missing. The
reserve division also found itself in a fierce firefight with the Syrians, and lost
eleven men.

We were now just three hours from the cease-fire. We did advance nearer to
the Beirut-Damascus road. An hour before noon, our dedicated anti-tank unit
destroyed 20 of Assad’s top-tier tanks, Soviet-made T-72s. Under different
circumstances, those successes might have been a cause for consolation. Yet it
was hard to dwell on them given what had happened north of Tovlano. After the
war, Sultan Yacoub created fertile ground for conspiracy theories, half-truths
and finger-pointing. That there had been many oversights and errors was clear,
though there was never a full and formal debriefing process to identify in detail
what had gone wrong. I found it deeply frustrating that, unlike in 1973 when I'd
been in a battlefield command role, I was now at several steps removed from
what was happening on the ground. But everyone involved shared responsibility
for the failures — including the overall commanders: Yanoush, and me as well.

That weight felt even heavier because the tragedy occurred only hours before
our own force’s involvement in the Lebanon War was over.

It was not, however, the end of the war. The cease-fire held only
intermittently in the rest of Lebanon, barely at all in some areas. Freed from
fighting in our sector, Yanoush, Amram and I began spending time with units
elsewhere. A couple of days after the cease-fire, I found myself alongside a pair
of generals, Uri Simchoni and Yossi Ben-Hannan, south of Beirut. In front of
us, troops from the Golani Brigade were completing their takeover of Beirut
airport. “You were right,” I told Uri and Yossi. They had been in charge of the
simulation exercise in the Airya, predicting how Arik’s ostensibly more limited
invasion plan would inevitably develop into Big Pines. Even as we were talking,

Gagosian has one final change to the Picasso agreement. As you know, we have structured this
agreement with the Buyer as either Narrows Holdings LLC or AP Narrows LP, and given both of those
entities the right to assign the agreement to any one among Leon, Debra, the kids, or family trusts
including APO1 and APO2.

Gagosian wants us to agree that, if Narrows/AP Narrows assigns the agreement to someone else,
Narrows/AP Narrows “Shall not be discharged from its liabilities under this Agreement and
shall remain primarily liable to Seller.” Larry is concerned that we might assign to the
Black kids or to a trust that has no assets, and then when he has to sue us because we
don’t make the final payment of the purchase price but have possession of the art, the
entity/person to which we have assigned the agreement has no money.

| think this is a valid concern and that we should agree to it.

However, Ada just reminded me that it is possible that Narrows/AP Narrows (really,
Leon’s) agreeing to effectively guarantee payment by the assignee might be considered
a gift to the assignee. In the discussions with Alan about rearranging the bank loan once AP
Narrows is operational, Alan agreed that there could be deemed to be a potential gift from Leon to
APO1/APO2 if Leon provides a guarantee to the bank that is for the benefit of the trusts as partners in AP
Narrows. Alan suggested mitigating this risk by having the trusts sign side agreements with Leon which
say that if AP Narrows defaults on the loan and the bank goes after Leon on his guarantee, the trusts will
make him whole.

This issue only arises if we assign the agreement. The risk is also limited in time because it would run
from the moment we assigned the agreement until the final payment is made, which even if we assigned
immediately after signing, would only be 11 1/2 months.

Shall I agree to Gagosian’s request that Narrows/AP Narrows remain liable even if they assign the
agreement?

I’m in the office if you would like to discuss this, but I would love to get back to Gagosian ASAP so we
can have this agreement signed today.

Thanks,

Heather

Article 5.

Wall Street Journal

It's in America's Interest to Stay in Iraq

Max Boot

April 18, 2011 -- Secretary of Defense Bob Gates was in Iraq early
this month urging Iraqi leaders to decide whether they want U.S.
forces to stay beyond Dec. 31. If there is to be a presence, to help
with some of the areas where [the Iraqis] still need help, he said,
we're open to that possibility. But they have to ask.

This is a small, belated, but welcome step in the right direction. Until
now the Obama administration has taken a hands-off attitude in Iraq,
giving every indication that it would be fine with a complete pullout
of the 50,000 U.S. troops currently in the country. This would
presumably allow the president to make good on his 2008 campaign
pledge to end the war--although U.S. troops aren't engaged in much
of a war at the moment.

They are primarily involved in training, assisting and advising Iraqi
forces, conducting counterterrorism missions, and serving as a buffer
force to reassure all sides in Iraq's fractious politics that their
opponents will not resort to force to achieve their ends. The
reassurance provided by U.S. forces is important, given that violence
continues to be perpetrated by Sunni and Shiite extremist groups,
including al Qaeda in Iraq, whose premature obituary has been
written more than once.

U.S. forces play a particularly important role as a peacekeeper
between the Kurdish peshmerga militia and the Iraqi Security Forces
along the ill-defined frontier (the Green Line) between Iraq proper
and the Kurdish Regional Government. On a visit to Iraq last month,
I encountered the umpteenth crisis between the Kurds and Arabs. The
peshmerga had come down south of the Green Line to surround the

encounter with Epstein. The woman had not wanted to make a
formal complaint at the time. But she had taken the cop’s card,
and now he was happy to hear that she'd changed her mind.

In a shaky voice, Alicia described Epstein as a tallish man—
five feet eleven or six feet in height was her guess—with gray
hair and brown eyes. He was the owner of a large black four-door
Mercedes and was a regular at Shutters on the Beach, which was
the kind of place that cost one thousand dollars a night and was
frequented by actors, agents, and other Hollywood types.

Alicia told the cop that she was a model and actress herself.
She'd known Epstein for about a month. They had a friend in
common, and she’d sent him her head shots.

Then, through an assistant, Epstein had invited her to meet
in his room at the hotel.

Alicia said she was having reservations, the officer wrote in his
report, because generally interviews are not conducted in hotel
rooms.

According to her, things turned frightening quickly.

She was unsure she was safe because although she wanted to
land the job as a ‘Victoria's Secret’ catalog model she felt as
though Epstein was attempting to get her to act in an unpro-

fessional manner for 4 model.

Epstein wore navy blue sweatpants and a white T-shirt, she

recalled. The T-shirt had the letters USA printed on it in patriotic

red, white, and blue.

Epstein told her to undress and actually assisted her to do so
while saying ‘let me manhandle you for a second.’

Powell M. Cabot Professor of American Literature 
Dear Woody, 
Tel: 
Fax 
As I know Jeffrey has told you, I really enjoyed our conversation on the plane last spring about William 
Carlos Williams's This Is Just to Say. You offered a reading of the poem that seemed to me 
completely persuasive and plausible and, yet, also, one that is not strictly dictated or delimited by the 
lines themselves. These are lines that seem to me unusually open to divergent readings-- including, for 
instance, a reading much more coaxing and seductive; another, much more defensive and manipulative; 
another, much more about language itself as a mode of sharing. I left our conversation wanting to 
explore with you the aggressive (or maybe mock aggressive) reading you gave, as well as the way this 
poem, perhaps more than many, sustains so many readings. You helped me think about Williams's 
poem as it seems in some ways more like a script than a poem, a poem written in such a way as to be 
turned by different voices in different directions, a poem that might even be directed by the reader. I'd 
love to hear you read the poem again and, if you are willing, to discuss it a bit with me on camera for my 
upcoming Massive Open Online Course on American poetry. 
To remind you, the course I'm working on is Poetry in America, one of three Humanities courses that 
will be launched internationally by edX in the next 18 months. This free course will allow students of all 
ages around the world to immerse themselves in the history, the art, and the interpretation of American 
poetry. Using state of the art tools, the course will combine text, video, audio, archival materials, on site 
historical narrative and interactive features, and it will have a companion book that docks with it. (I'm 
writing that book now.) 
As I'm asking you here, I am inviting other distinguished Americans to do short cameo readings and, 
when they are willing, short discussions of the poem with me. Those who have already done tapings, or 
have agreed to participate, include Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan, Harvard President Drew 
Faust, performer and activist Eve Ensler, journalist Michael Pollan, Tour de France champion Greg 
Lemond, professor and PBS personality Henry Lewis Gates, (my husband!) Larry Summers, Rabbi 
Moshe Waldoks, poet Martin Espada, playwright Tony Kushner, and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino. 
We are now reaching out to Bill Clinton, Matt Damon, Natalie Portman, and John McCain, among 
others, and feel confident that many will agree. I'm very much hoping that you will agree to join this 
distinguished group. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029543 
The poem I'm hoping you would read is one that we discussed, William Carlos Williams's iconic poem 
This Is Just to Say. The poem is copied below. There are, naturally, commentaries on it I could share, 
if you wanted to read some, but you seem to have already thought about it quite a bit. 
This Is Just to Say 
I have eaten 
the plums 
that were in 
the icebox 
and which 
you were probably 
saving 
for breakfast 
Forgive me 
they were delicious 
so sweet 
and so cold 
Logistically, we are at your service. I would be happy to film you when I visit New York on October 
24th. Or, I would love it if you would come visit Larry and me in Boston with Jeffrey. We could show 
you and Soon Yi around Harvard, eat a big bowl of plums, and talk poetry. I would introduce you on 
camera and you'd read, or recite, and we'd perhaps talk about the poem for a moment. 
Thank you very much for considering this proposal. I admire you immensely and would feel honored to 
bring you into this project.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013024.txt,"108 6 A Brief Overview of CogPrime

top-level goals will be simple things such as pleasing the teacher, learning new information
and skills, and protecting the robot’s body. Figure 6.3 shows part of the architecture via which
cognitive processes interact with each other, via commonly acting on the AtomSpace knowledge
repository.

Comparing these diagrams to the integrative human cognitive architecture diagrams given
in Chapter 5, one sees the main difference is that the CogPrime diagrams commit to specific
structures (e.g. knowledge representations) and processes, whereas the generic integrative archi-
tecture diagram refers merely to types of structures and processes. For instance, the integrative
diagram refers generally to declarative knowledge and learning, whereas the CogPrime diagram
refers to PLN, as a specific system for reasoning and learning about declarative knowledge. Ta-
ble 6.1 articulates the key connections between the components of the CogPrime diagram and
those of the integrative diagram, thus indicating the general cognitive functions instantiated by
each of the CogPrime components.

6.3 Current and Prior Applications of OpenCog

Before digging deeper into the theory, and elaborating some of the dynamics underlying the
above diagrams, we pause to briefly discuss some of the practicalities of work done with the
OpenCog system currently implementing parts of the CogPrime architecture.

OpenCog, the open-source software framework underlying the “OpenCogPrime” (currently
partial) implementation of the CogPrime architecture, has been used for commercial applica-
tions in the area of natural language processing and data mining; for instance, see [GPPG06]
where OpenCogPrime’s PLN reasoning and RelEx language processing are combined to do
automated biological hypothesis generation based on information gathered from PubMed ab-
stracts. Most relevantly to the present work, it has also been used to control virtual agents in
virtual worlds [GEA08].

Prototype work done during 2007-2008 involved using an OpenCog variant called the Open-
PetBrain to control virtual dogs in a virtual world (see Figure 6.6 for a screenshot of an
OpenPetBrain-controlled virtual dog). While these OpenCog virtual dogs did not display in-
telligence closely comparable to that of real dogs (or human children), they did demonstrate a
variety of interesting and relevant functionalities including:

e learning new behaviors based on imitation and reinforcement

e responding to natural language commands and questions, with appropriate actions and
natural language replies

® spontaneous exploration of their world, remembering their experiences and using them to
bias future learning and linguistic interaction

One current OpenCog initiative involves extending the virtual dog work via using OpenCog
to control virtual agents in a game world inspired by the game Minecraft. These agents are
initially specifically concerned with achieving goals in a game world via constructing structures
with blocks and carrying out simple English communications. Representative example tasks
would be:

e Learning to build steps or ladders to get desired objects that are high up
e Learning to build a shelter to protect itself from aggressors

Q. Which conversation with Rebecca did you
tape record?

A. I tape recorded a conversation with her
permission where she told me that she was pressured,
she didn't -- where Rebecca told me that Virginia
was pressured and that she didn't want to name me
but she was pressured to name me, that she had never
previously named me.

By the way, | told this to Virginia

A. Iknow what you know because I'm a logical
person and I know that Virginia -- I know that
Virginia Roberts repeatedly called this -- this
woman and her husband, repeatedly text her, and
knows her name. And you and Virginia Roberts'
lawyers are operating in privity here. You're
whispering to each other, you're passing notes. You
are part of a joint legal team.

And if you want to know her name, all you
have to do is ask Sigrid McCawiley and she'll tell
you her name. I'm sure you know her name. And if
you don't know her name, it's because you haven't
asked.

. Okay.

telling you I don't know her name. And you are
under oath and obliged to answer material and
relevant questions, and I want to know what her name
is.

A. I don't recall. But it's on the
transcript.

Q. And does it also reflect that the
recording is being made with her permission?

A. Uh-huh.

Q. That's a yes?

A. Yes. Yes, that's a yes.

Q. What is Rebecca's last name?

A. You know Rebecca's last name and she has
asked me not to reveal it to the press. And so }
would like to comply with that -- with that request.
For purposes of discovery, you know her name, you
know her husband's name, you know her phone number,
and she has been called. But there's no reason for
me to reveal it so that it appears in the press that
she would be called by newspapers and by the media.

Q. Okay. She has still insisted that her
name not be revealed; is that correct?

A. Her husband asked me to do whatever |
could not to put her name in front of the press, in
front of the media.

Q. There's no -- there's no one from the
press here today.

MR. SCOTT: Yeah, but they're going to
order the transcript and they're going to sce,
so that's the same thing. And I've already
told --

A. You will have her name in five --

MR. SCOTT: I will give you her name --

MR. SCOTT: And, Jack, if you want to take
a break now --

THE REPORTER: Holdon. Hold on,
gentlemen. You can't talk at the same time.

MR. SCOTT: Let me do the talking at this
point.

In Aleppo, a jewel among cities, with its commanding citadel and
labyrinthine, covered souk, she sees fully veiled ladies, exotic
bedouin women displaying bright spots of color, and wealthy Gulf
Arabs wearing white robes rubbing shoulders with men riding
donkeys and mixing with “trophy girlfriends” in miniskirts teetering
perilously on the ultra-high-heeled shoes that Aleppans evidently
consider to be the height of fashion.

Having been in Aleppo recently, I can vouch for the accuracy of her
descriptions. Visiting several mosques, churches, and shrines, she
provides impressive testimony of the country’s religious diversity and
the regime’s commitment to religious freedom. It would be tragic if
the pursuit of democracy led to the shredding of this bright human
canopy, where religious and cultural differences seem to have
flourished under the iron grip of a minority sectarian regime.

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028743.txt,"bodyguards of Finance Minister Rafie al-Issawi, who is Sunni, arrested for
alleged terrorist activities on Dec. 20 — almost exactly one year after he

ordered the arrest of Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi’s security
detail. Hashimi fled to Turkey and is unlikely to return soon to Iraq, where
he was sentenced to death after Maliki demanded his trial in absentia for
murder and financing terrorism.

The threat to Issawi, a moderate technocrat from Anbar, galvanized Iraqi
Sunnis, who rightly saw Maliki’s move as sectarian and an assault on
government participation by Sunnis not under the prime minister’s thumb.
Three days after the arrests, demonstrations broke out in Ramadi, Fallujah
and Samarra. Three days after that, a large protest closed the highway
from Baghdad to Syria and Jordan. The popular resistance spread to Mosul
on Dec. 27.

These protests erupted during a constitutional crisis and as an expanding
Arab-Kurd conflict has become increasingly militarized. Iraqi President
Jalal Talabani was incapacitated by a stroke on Dec. 17 and has been out
of the countryfor treatment. Iraq’s constitution specifies a line of
succession — but with one vice president in exile and the other a Shiite
and obvious Maliki proxy, Iraq has been, in effect, operating without a
president. Political processes that require presidential involvement have
been paralyzed, including moving forward with long-standing efforts by
Sunnis and Kurds to hold a parliamentary vote of no-confidence in Maliki.

Talabani had been the critical link holding Baghdad and Kurdistan
together since tensions rose following a 10-day standoff between Iraqi
army units and Kurdish pesh merga troops in October, after Maliki sent
the army toward the disputed city of Kirkuk. That move followed a series
of skirmishes and mobilizations along the “Green Line” separating
Kurdistan from Arab Iraq and a series of attacks in the area by al-Qaeda in
Iraq.

The recent protests underscore the collapse of the inclusive political
accommodation reached in 2007, which had been reconfirmed by the
formation of a grand Sunni-Shiite-Kurd coalition government after
parliamentary elections in 2010. By November 2012, Maliki had evolved

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028743

learn from.

The second high-point was a couple named David and Leah Zimmerman.
Though Mishmar Hasharon, like other kibbutzim, was secular, they introduced
us to the Talmud, the ancient compendium of rabbinic discussion and debate on
the meaning of passages from the Bible. We focused on two tractates, Baba
Kama and Baba Metziah, in which the rabbis drew on verses from Exodus to
argue out a system of rules for resolving civil disputes. It was the Talmud of
torts. The intricacy and the depth of the rabbinical debate fascinated me.

Yigal returned from the army a few months after the 1956 war, when, like
other teenagers, I was about to enter a pre-military program known as Gadna.
There were several options kids could choose. One was linked to the air force,
another to the navy. But most of us joined the reconnaissance and scouting
group, Gadna Sayerim. It involved studying topography and navigation, as well
as field exercises that were a lot like the ones Yigal had put us through a few
years earlier. At year’s end, we took part in a national exercise. It was called, a
bit grandiosely, Mivam el Yam: from sea to sea. We had to find our way from
the Mediterranean, near Haifa, across northern Israel to a lake which was a sea
only in name, the Sea of Galilee. It lasted three days. We were placed in teams
of four. We were each given a topographical map and a compass, with
landmarks marked along the way which we had to find and draw in a notebook
to prove we’d been there.

A couple of hours in, we faced our first challenge. We were making our way
along a shepherds’ trail, with brush and bramble on either side, when the path
split in two. We had to decide which fork to take. The map didn’t help. Each
inch covered the equivalent of a mile-and-a-half. The key was to be able to
match it with what we were seeing around us. To use points we could identify
from the map — Haifa and the sea in the receding distance, and a taller hill to our
northeast — and then figure out which path was more likely to take us in the
right direction. I knew this mix of calculation and imagination was something I
enjoyed. But it was more than that. Each of us had had the same preparation for
the exercise. As my trek-mates turned to me for this first decision, and then on

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016854.txt,"there is a constant structure with some activity going on inside it. When von Neumann’s
abstract machine reproduced, it made a copy of itself in another region of the plane.
Within the “machine” was a horizontal line of squares which acted as a finite linear tape,
using a subset of the finite alphabet. It was the symbols in those squares that encoded the
machine of which they were a part. During the machine’s reproduction, the “tape” could
move either left or right and was both interpreted (transcribed) as the instructions
(translation) for the new “machine” being built and then copied (replicated)—with the
new copy being placed inside the new machine for further reproduction. Francis Crick
and James Watson later showed, in 1953, how such a tape could be instantiated in
biology by along DNA molecule with its finite alphabet of four nucleobases: guanine,
cytosine, adenine, and thymine (G, C, A, and T).'* Asin von Neumann’s machine, in
biological reproduction the linear sequence of symbols in DNA is interpreted—through
transcription into RNA molecules, which then are translated into proteins, the structures
that make up a new cell—and the DNA is replicated and encased in the new cell.

A second foundational piece of work was in a 1945 “First Draft” report on the
design for a digital computer, wherein von Neumann advocated for a memory that could
contain both instructions and data.'4 This is now known as a von Neumann architecture
computer—as distinct from a Harvard architecture computer, where there are two
separate memories, one for instructions and one for data. The vast majority of computer
chips built in the era of Moore’s Law are based on the von Neumann architecture,
including those powering our data centers, our laptops, and our smartphones. Von
Neumann’s digital-computer architecture 1s conceptually the same generalization—from
early digital computers constructed with electromagnetic relays at both Harvard
University and Bletchley Park—that occurs in going from a special-purpose Turing
Machine to a Universal Turing Machine. Furthermore, his self-replicating automata
share a fundamental similarity with both the construction of a Turing Machine and the
mechanism of DNA-based reproducing biological cells. There is to this day scholarly
debate over whether von Neumann saw the cross connections between these three pieces
of work, Turing’s and his two. Turing’s revision of his paper was done while he and von
Neumann were both at Princeton; indeed, after getting his PhD, Turing almost stayed on
as von Neumann’s postdoc.

Without Turing and von Neumann, the cybernetics of Wiener might have
remained a dominant mode of thought and driver of technology for much longer than its
brief moment of supremacy. In this imaginary version of history, we might well live
today in an actual steam-punk world and not just get to observe its fantastical
instantiations at Maker Faires!

My point is that Wiener thought about the world—physical, biological, and (in
Human Use) sociological—in a particular way. He analyzed the world as continuous
variables, as he explains in chapter 1 along with a nod to thermodynamics through an
overlay of Gibbs statistics. He also shoehorns in a weak and unconvincing model of
information as message-passing between and among both physical and biological entities.
To me, and from today’s vantage point seventy years on, his tools seem woefully

Why Syria will get away with it

Gideon Rachman

June 13 2011 -- late last week, Robert Gates, the US defence
secretary, launched an offensive of his own. In a speech in Brussels,
he dismissed most of America’s European allies as a useless bunch of
timewasters. I paraphrase — but not much.

Mr Gates pointed out that while all Nato countries had voted to
intervene in Libya, most had chosen not to participate in the actual
fighting. Even those European countries that are taking part began to
run short of munitions just 11 weeks into the fighting — forcing an
exasperated America to step into the breach. More broadly, a
situation in which the US accounts for 75 per cent of the military
spending in Nato was “unacceptable” and unsustainable. If it is not
rectified, Mr Gates predicted, Nato faces a “dismal” future.

The conjunction of the Gates speech and the Syrian civil war is very
telling. It explains why a 20-year experiment with the idea that
western military force can put the world to rights is coming to a
close.

Just a few weeks ago, that would have seemed a surprising
conclusion. Supporters of “liberal interventionism”’ hailed the
decision to bomb Colonel Gaddafi’s forces in Libya as evidence of a
longed-for new era, in which dictators can no longer feel free to
massacre their own people.

However a western failure to intervene, as the Syrian army brutalises
and kills its own citizens, is likely to be a more accurate guide to the
future than the Libyan campaign. There is, of course, a direct link
between the west’s reluctance to get involved in Syria and the

This all suggests that the start of the 9/11 agenda pre-dated him as well. | see now that there was a
seemingly relevant 1990 event as well. On September 11, 1970 -- a date that only took on haunting
overtones with the attacks on New York and Washington in 2001 -- Nixon became the first U.S.
president to try to protect air travelers from extremists who sensed gaping vulnerabilities in security
for commercial airliners, issuing a statement listing a string of measures including the introduction of
100 air marshals on U.S. planes. Most countries, including the United States, found effective means
of dealing with piracy on the high seas a century and a half ago,” Nixon said. We can -- and we will -
- deal effectively with piracy in the skies today.”

The President had been jolted into action by the simultaneous hijackings of planes in Europe headed
to the United States. Jets belonging to TWA, Pan Am and Swissair were seized by the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine. The group also attempted to hijack a jet over London belonging to the
Israeli airline El Al but was thwarted by security guards on board.

The Pan Am seizure ended quickly, but the passengers on the TWA and Swissair jets were diverted
to a British air base in Jordan and the drama only ended after days of tense diplomacy, when the
hostages were all released in a deal in which the Swiss, German, British and Israeli governments let

Palestinian prisoners go.” (http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/27/politics/terrorism-19 70s-richard-
nixon/index.html)

This 9/11 response sounds quite normal of course. But fast forward and the two secret service
individuals chosen for an April 2001 interview by a PWC staff member on behalf of what becomthe
IBM Center for the Business of Government were (1) Steve Colo who happened to be the head of

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026845.txt,"PESSIMISTIC POPULISTS

The third challenge today is a widespread loss of confidence in the West
about its own systems and future potential. Sluggish growth across the
developed world, stagnant incomes for much of the population, rising
economic inequality, political gridlock, and the emergence of populist
insurgencies on both sides of the political spectrum have fueled a
widespread sense that Western models of governance and economic
management are floundering.

Many of these problems are real and important. But they are not beyond the
capacity of determined leadership to solve, nor do they represent
fundamental weaknesses of the Western model. So the pessimism strikes us
as dramatically overdone, like previous bouts of declinism and worry that
the West's best days were past. The greatest danger, in fact, is that the
widespread pessimism will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Gloomy
Western policymakers and publics are more likely to see threats than
opportunities and to turn away from the world rather than continue to lead
it successfully.

This is notable in the rising opposition, for example, to the Trans-Pacific
Partnership, a major trade deal that would help extend and deepen the
liberal order across a broad swath of the globe. It is evident in the increasing
suspicion of immigrants and refugees and in the growing support for closing
borders. And it can be seen in the fraying and potential unraveling of
international institutions such as the European Union, formerly a model of
progressive international integration.

It would be a terrible shame if the West walked away from the very
international order that it created after World War II and that has facilitated
so much security, prosperity, and development over the decades. Instead, it
should try to reinvigorate that order, with three moves in particular:
working with China and India, bolstering international rules, and
accentuating the positive global trends that get lost in all the hysteria about
the negative ones.

Why China and India? Because they have the largest populations and
economies in the developing world, are led by strong, reform-minded
leaders, and are approaching the future with dynamism, optimism, and
hope. Both understand that they need to take on greater responsibilities in
confronting global problems, and as last fall's Paris climate agreement
demonstrates, they are already starting to do so.

Although China's rise has been one of the universally acknowledged
wonders of the age, India's recent rise has been impressive as well, as India,
too, has embraced modernization, globalization, and Enlightenment
rationalism. Along the way, India has maintained the world's largest
democracy, successfully accommodated an amazingly diverse cultural and

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020011.txt,"chairman Devin Nunes in a farcical effort to discredit Comey and support the wiretap
theory. The scheme shortly collapsed in universal ridicule.

Bannon, taking a public hands-off with respect to both health care and Comey, began
to advise reporters that the important story wasn’t health care but Russia. This was cryptic
advice: it was not clear whether he was trying to distract attention from the coming health
care debacle, or couple it with this new dangerous variable, thus amping up the kind of
chaos that he usually benefited from.

But Bannon was unequivocal about one thing. As the Russia story unfolds, he advised
reporters, keep your eye on Kushner.

OOK Ok

By mid-March, Gary Cohn had been drafted into the effort to salvage the faltering health
care bill. This might have seemed like a form of hazing for Cohn, whose grasp of
legislative matters was even more limited than that of most in the White House.

On Friday, March 24, the morning of the theoretical House vote for the Republican
health care bill, Politico’s Playbook characterized the chances of a vote actually coming to
the floor as a “toss-up.” In that morning’s senior staff meeting, Cohn was asked for an
assessment of where things stood and promptly said, “I think it’s a toss-up.”

“Really?” thought Katie Walsh. “That’s what you think?”

Bannon, joining Walsh in a pitiless contempt for the White House effort, targeted
Kushner, Cohn, Priebus, Price, and Ryan in a series of calls to reporters. Kushner and
Cohn could, per Bannon, be counted on to run at the first sound of gunfire. (Kushner, in
fact, had spent much of the week on a skiing holiday.) Priebus mouthed Ryan talking
points and excuses. Price, supposedly the health care guru, was an oafish imposter; he
would stand up in meetings and mumble nothing but nonsense.

These were the bad guys, setting up the administration to lose the House in 2018,
thereby assuring the president’s impeachment. This was vintage Bannon analysis: a certain
and immediate political apocalypse that sat side by side with the potential for a half
century of Bannonism-Trumpism rule.

Convinced he knew the direction of success, keenly aware of his own age and finite
opportunities, and—if for no clear reason—seeing himself as a talented political infighter,
Bannon sought to draw the line between believers and sell-outs, being and nothingness.
For him to succeed, he needed to isolate the Ryan, Cohn, and Kushner factions.

The Bannon faction held tight on forcing a vote on the health care bill—even knowing
defeat was inevitable. “I want it as a report on Ryan’s job as Speaker,” said Bannon. That
is, a devastating report, an epic fail.

The day of the vote, Pence was sent to the Hill to make one last pitch to Meadows’s

Staring down at the floor to avoid the blinding ceiling lights, I was supposedly one of the best in the
world, but it just didn’t register. My partner Alicia shifted from foot to foot as we stood in line with nine
other couples, all chosen from over 1,000 competitors from 29 countries and four continents. It was the
last day of the Tango World Championship semifinals, and this was our final run in front of the judges,
television cameras, and cheering crowds. The other couples had an average of 15 years together. For us,
it was the culmination of 5 months of nonstop 6-hour practices, and finally, it was showtime.

“How are you doing?” Alicia, a seasoned professional dancer, asked me in her distinctly Argentine
Spanish.

“Fantastic. Awesome. Let’s just enjoy the music. Forget the crowd—they’re not even here.”

That wasn’t entirely true. It was hard to even fathom 50,000 spectators and coordinators in La Rural,
even if it was the biggest exhibition hall in Buenos Aires. Through the thick haze of cigarette smoke, you
could barely make out the huge undulating mass in the stands, and everywhere there was exposed floor,
except the sacred 30’ x 40' space in the middle of it all. I adjusted my pin-striped suit and fussed with my
blue silk handkerchief until it was obvious that I was just fidgeting.

“Are you nervous?”
“Tm not nervous. I’m excited. I’m just going to have fun and let the rest follow.”

“Number 152, you’re up.” Our chaperone had done his job, and now it was our turn. I whispered an
inside joke to Alicia as we stepped on the hardwood platform: “Tranquilo” —Take it easy. She laughed,
and at just that moment, I thought to myself, “What on earth would I be doing right now, if I hadn’t left
my job and the U.S. over a year ago?”

The thought vanished as quickly as it had appeared when the announcer came over the loudspeaker
and the crowd erupted to match him: “Pareja numero 152, Timothy Ferriss y Alicia Monti, Ciudad de
Buenos Aires!!!”

We were on, and I was beaming.

THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL of American questions is hard for me to answer these days, and luckily so. If
it weren’t, you wouldn’t be holding this book in your hands.

“So, what do you do?”

Assuming you can find me (hard to do), and depending on when you ask me (I'd prefer you didn’t), I
could be racing motorcycles in Europe, scuba diving off a private island in Panama, resting under a palm
tree between kickboxing sessions in Thailand, or dancing tango in Buenos Aires. The beauty is, ’m not a
multimillionaire, nor do I particularly care to be.

I never enjoyed answering this cocktail question because it reflects an epidemic I was long part of: job
descriptions as self-descriptions. If someone asks me now and is anything but absolutely sincere, I
explain my lifestyle of mysterious means simply.

“Tm a drug dealer.”

Pretty much a conversation ender. It’s only half true, besides. The whole truth would take too long.
How can I possibly explain that what I do with my time and what I do for money are completely
different things? That I work less than four hours per week and make more per month than I used to
make in a year?

For the first time, I’m going to tell you the real story. It involves a quiet subculture of people called

To: Jeffrey Epstein [jeeyacation@gmail.com] 
Subject: Patterson 
Importance: High 
A few things to think about: 
If the Patterson book is being published in August, that presents some time frame issues. You would not be able 
to do a competing book or documentary before then. This is not to say that they shouldn't be pursued. In a 
sense, better that they know what Patterson's position is and, a year from now say, be able to counter it. I have 
some thoughts on book and doc to share at your convenience. 
That being said, you do need an immediate counter narrative to the book. I believe Trump offers an ideal 
opportunity. It's a chance to make the story about something other than you, while, at the same time, letting you 
frame your own story. Also, becoming an anti-Trump voice gives you a certain political cover which you 
decidedly don't have now. Still, this necessary involves you going public. And so the most basic decision is 
about your willingness to do that. My view is that in a couple of weeks you could master message and technical 
proficiency. I know a bunch of people who could be very helpful here. This would involve something along the 
lines of you writing an op-ed, doing a high profile television interview (Charlie Rose, I'd say), and perhaps 
some social media efforts. 
Speaking of which, again, I think a strategic plan, involving your public identity, philanthropic activities and 
interests, and the development of media allies, ought finally to be put in place. A big, comprehensive, expensive 
effort. 
The alternative is to continue to keep head down and hope Patterson book is just more he-said she-said and 
Connolly getting lost in the reeds (which, as an inveterate conspiracist, he always does). My worry is that 
Patterson can be counted on to produce a bestseller, and while he isn't regarded as a serious writer, he'll surely 
be unloading a lot of tabloid copy. Because this will be tied to the election, the Trump-Clinton angle will amp 
up the attention 10-fold, in fact, possibly, a hundred fold. Possibly more than anything you've encountered 
before. 
Meanwhile--
In a lawyer's letter, I'd suggest including the following points--not necessarily legal, but a warning about how a 
press campaign might unfold (publishers are more worried about being caught in negative media controversy 
than they are of legal threats): 
1) Little, Brown has made on the record representations to at least one well-known journalist that it was not 
publishing a book by James Patterson about Jeffrey Epstein--possibly an effort to avoid inquiries about the 
questionable nature of the book; 
2) The actual author of the book, John Connolly, is someone other than the stated author, James Patterson. 
Connolly is known to have developed an obsession with Epstein, such that, his longtime employer, Vanity Fair, 
has refused to allow him to write about Epstein for the magazine; 
3) Sources have confirmed for us that Patterson has had little more than a minimal consulting role in the book, 
and that Connolly has functioned in every material way as the book's researcher and writer. We believe 
Patterson's authorship of the book will not stand up to scrutiny. And, indeed, that the entire notion of an 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 032244 
extension of the Patterson franchise into nonfiction, as it has been used in fiction and children's book--
effectively other authors writing under the Patterson name—presents a host of journalism ethical issues.

share of their signals intelligence. From the perspective of defending
themselves from potential threats, the deal that these allies had with
the NSA was mutually advantageous.

The NSA‘s overseas intelligence gathering was not limited to
adversary nations. With the exception of the Five Eyes allies, it
gathered data that was deemed important by the president and the
Defense Department in friendly countries. These operations had
been approved by every American president and funded by every
American Congress since 1941. After all, even in the realm of allies,
activities take place that run counter to American interests. The 9/11
conspiracy, for example, was hatched in Hamburg, Germany, and
financed in Dubai and Saudi Arabia.

Nor were American allies unaware of the reach of the NSA. “Yes,
my continental European friends, we have spied on you. And it is
true we use computers to sort through data by using keywords,”
the former CIA director James Woolsey wrote in The Wall Street
Journal in 2000. “Have you stopped to ask yourselves what we are
looking for?” Whether or not it was appreciated by other countries,

© the global harvesting of communications intelligence by the NSA ©
was hardly a secret.

As the NSA expanded further, it delegated part of its work to
regional bases, including ones in Utah, Texas, Hawaii, and Japan. The
paramount task of the NSA remained monitoring the channels of
communications that an adversary might use. The vast prolifera-
tion of these channels in cyberspace, which included e-mail, social
media, document sharing, and other innovations of the Internet age,
greatly complicated this task. Even so, this challenge was not insur-
mountable, because most of the Internet actually traveled through
fiberglass landline cables that crossed the territories of the United
States, Britain, and Australia. So the NSA found the technical means,
including voluntarily gaining access to major Internet companies, to
“harvest” vast amounts of this Internet data. America’s other intel-
ligence agencies quickly recognized the value of the communica-
tions intelligence gleaned from foreign telecommunications. John E.
McLaughlin, who was the CIA’s acting director in 2004, described
the NSA as nothing less than the “very foundation of U.S. intel-
ligence.” It served as a “foundation” for the CIA because intercepted

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020005.txt,"maturity but sagaciousness, the Tea Party-Bannon-Breitbart wing mounted an ad hominem
campaign pushing an image of Ryan as uncommitted to the cause, an inept strategist and
incompetent leader. He was the Tea Party-Bannon-Breitbart punch line: the ultimate empty
suit, a hee-haw sort of joke and an embarrassment.

Trump’s distaste for Ryan was significantly less structural. He had no views about
Ryan’s political abilities, and had paid no real attention to Ryan’s actual positions. His
view was personal. Ryan had insulted him—again and again. Ryan had kept betting
against him. Ryan had become the effective symbol of the Republican establishment’s
horror and disbelief about Trump. Adding insult to injury, Ryan had even achieved some
moral stature by dissing Trump (and, as usual, he considered anybody’s gain at his
expense a double insult). By the spring of 2016, Ryan was still, and by then the only,
alternative to Trump as the nominee. Say the word, many Republicans felt, and the
convention would stampede to Ryan. But Ryan’s seemingly smarter calculation was to let
Trump win the nomination, and then to emerge as the obvious figure to lead the party after
Trump’s historic defeat and the inevitable purge of the Tea Party-Trump-Breitbart wing.

Instead, the election destroyed Paul Ryan, at least in Steve Bannon’s eyes. Trump had
not only saved the Republican Party but had given it a powerful majority. The entire
Bannon dream had been realized. The Tea Party movement, with Trump as its remarkable
face and voice, had come to power—something like total power. It owned the Republican
Party. Publicly breaking Paul Ryan was the obvious and necessary step.

But a great deal could fall into the chasm between Bannon’s structural contempt for
Ryan and Trump’s personal resentment. If Bannon saw Ryan as being unwilling and
unable to carry out the new Bannon-Trump agenda, Trump saw a chastened Ryan as
suddenly and satisfyingly abject, submissive, and useful. Bannon wanted to get rid of the
entire Republican establishment; Trump was wholly satisfied that it now seemed to bend
to him.

“He’s quite a smart guy,” Trump said after his first postelection conversation with the
Speaker. “A very serious man. Everybody respects him.”

Ryan, “rising to a movie-version level of flattery and sucking-up painful to witness,”
according to one senior Trump aide, was able to delay his execution. As Bannon pressed
his case for Meadows—who was significantly less yielding than Ryan—Trump dithered
and then finally decided that not only was he not going to push for Ryan’s ouster, but Ryan
was going to be his man, his partner. In an example of the odd and unpredictable effects of
personal chemistry on Trump—of how easy it can be to sell the salesman—Trump would
now eagerly back Ryan’s agenda instead of the other way around.

“T don’t think that we quite calculated that the president would give him carte blanche,”
reflected Katie Walsh. “The president and Paul went from such a bad place during the
campaign to such a romance afterward that the president was happy to go along with

2002-2003 BrainQUICKEN LLC has taken off, and I’m now making more than $40K per month
instead of $40K per year. The only problem is that I hate life and now work 12-hour-plus days 7 days a
week. Kinda painted myself into a corner. I take a one-week “vacation” to Florence, Italy, with my
family and spend 10 hours a day in an Internet café freaking out. Sh*t balls. I begin teaching Princeton
students how to build “successful” (1.e., profitable) companies.

Winter 2004 The impossible happens and I’m approached by an infomercial production company and
an Israeli conglomerate (huh?) interested in buying my baby BrainQUICKEN. I simplify, eliminate, and
otherwise clean house to make myself expendable. Miraculously, BQ doesn’t fall apart, but both deals
do. Back to Groundhog Day. Soon thereafter, both companies attempt to replicate my product and lose
millions of dollars.

June 2004 I decide that, even if my company implodes, I need to escape before I go Howard Hughes. I
turn everything upside down and—backpack in hand—go to JFK Airport in New York City, buying the
first one-way ticket to Europe I can find. I land in London and intend to continue on to Spain for four
weeks of recharging my batteries before returning to the salt mines. I start my relaxation by promptly
having a nervous breakdown the first morning.

July 2004-2005 Four weeks turn into eight, and I decide to stay overseas indefinitely for a final exam
in automation and experimental living, limiting e-mail to one hour each Monday morning. As soon as I
remove myself as a bottleneck, profits increase 40%. What on earth do you do when you no longer have
work as an excuse to be hyperactive and avoid the big questions? Be terrified and hold on to your ass
with both hands, apparently.

assumptions about what can and cannot be done. “Drug Dealing for Fun and Profit” has evolved into a

Subject: Patterson 
To: Jeffrey Epstein <jeevacation@gmail.com> 
A few things to think about: 
If the Patterson book is being published in August, that presents some time frame issues. You would not be 
able to do a competing book or documentary before then. This is not to say that they shouldn't be pursued. In 
a sense, better that they know what Patterson's position is and, a year from now say, be able to counter it. I 
have some thoughts on book and doc to share at your convenience. 
That being said, you do need an immediate counter narrative to the book. I believe Trump offers an ideal 
opportunity. It's a chance to make the story about something other than you, while, at the same time, letting 
you frame your own story. Also, becoming an anti-Trump voice gives you a certain political cover which you 
decidedly don't have now. Still, this necessary involves you going public. And so the most basic decision is 
about your willingness to do that. My view is that in a couple of weeks you could master message and 
technical proficiency. I know a bunch of people who could be very helpful here. This would involve something 
along the lines of you writing an op-ed, doing a high profile television interview (Charlie Rose, I'd say), and 
perhaps some social media efforts. 
Speaking of which, again, I think a strategic plan, involving your public identity, philanthropic activities and 
interests, and the development of media allies, ought finally to be put in place. A big, comprehensive, 
expensive effort. 
The alternative is to continue to keep head down and hope Patterson book is just more he-said she-said and 
Connolly getting lost in the reeds (which, as an inveterate conspiracist, he always does). My worry is that 
Patterson can be counted on to produce a bestseller, and while he isn't regarded as a serious writer, he'll 
surely be unloading a lot of tabloid copy. Because this will be tied to the election, the Trump-Clinton angle will 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 032250 
amp up the attention 10-fold, in fact, possibly, a hundred fold. Possibly more than anything you've 
encountered before. 
Meanwhile--
In a lawyer's letter, I'd suggest including the following points--not necessarily legal, but a warning about how a 
press campaign might unfold (publishers are more worried about being caught in negative media controversy 
than they are of legal threats): 
1) Little, Brown has made on the record representations to at least one well-known journalist that it was not 
publishing a book by James Patterson about Jeffrey Epstein--possibly an effort to avoid inquiries about the 
questionable nature of the book; 
2) The actual author of the book, John Connolly, is someone other than the stated author, James Patterson. 
Connolly is known to have developed an obsession with Epstein, such that, his longtime employer, Vanity Fair, 
has refused to allow him to write about Epstein for the magazine; 
3) Sources have confirmed for us that Patterson has had little more than a minimal consulting role in the book, 
and that Connolly has functioned in every material way as the book's researcher and writer. We believe 
Patterson's authorship of the book will not stand up to scrutiny. And, indeed, that the entire notion of an 
extension of the Patterson franchise into nonfiction, as it has been used in fiction and children's book--
effectively other authors writing under the Patterson name—presents a host of journalism ethical issues.

Donald Trump says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia

Clinton attacks Trump's foreign policy as 'dangerously incoherent’ 1 /27U.S. Democratic presidential candidate
Hillary Clinton lambasted Donald Trump's foreign policy platform as dangerously incoherent in a speech on
Thursday that cast her Republican rival as both a dangerous and laughable figure.

A former U.S. secretary of state, Clinton attacked Trump for his policies and his character, suggesting Trump
might start a nuclear war if elected to the White House simply because someone got under his very thin skin.
Donald Trump's ideas are not just different, they are dangerously incoherent, she said to a room of supporters
in San Diego, California. They're not even really ideas, just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds and
outright lies.”

© Mike Blake U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton delivers a speech on national
security in San Diego, California, United States June 2, 2016.

Clinton, the front-runner in the race to become the Democratic presidential nominee, delivered her speech as
she seeks to shift her attention to the Nov. 8 election against likely rival Trump and away from Bernie Sanders,
a U.S. senator from Vermont, who is continuing his longshot bid for the nomination.

Trump, the Republicans’ presumptive nominee, has said he would sit down with North Korean leader Kim Jong
Un to try to stop Pyongyang's nuclear program and has criticized the decades-old NATO alliance with mainly
European nations as obsolete and too costly for the United States.

Clinton derided these and other positions, promising she would do a better job keeping the United States safe
and standing in front of a backdrop of 19 large U.S. flags, an unusual abundance even by the standards of
presidential campaign events.

Trump, a billionaire businessman who has never held elected office or worked in government before, says he
has experience dealing with foreign governments through setting up hotels, resorts, golf courses and beauty
pageants in foreign countries. Clinton, who is also a former U.S. senator and former first lady, mocked this.
He says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia, she said to loud
laughter.

Trump has talked tough on foreign policy. He has said he would bring back waterboarding and other brutal
interrogation techniques for terrorism suspects that are widely regarded as torture and were discontinued by
Democratic President Barack Obama.

Trump has criticized Clinton for her handling of foreign policy during her 2009-2013 stint as foreign secretary,
including the Sept. 11, 2012, attack by Islamist militants on a U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya, that
killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans.

He cites Clinton's support for the Iraq war - launched by former Republican President George W. Bush - as

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026689.txt,"Deployment challenges are limiting sovereign
ability to match targets

In previous reports, we observed sovereigns’ return
gaps, driven by low interest rates and challenging
targets for fixed income allocations. We have also
noted how appetite for alternatives has grown as
sovereigns seek greater returns from private markets.
In last year’s report, we demonstrated that high levels
of competition in infrastructure and private equity
were causing sovereigns to shift deployment of real
assets towards real estate.

Competition for infrastructure and private equity
deals has accelerated in 2016, with deployment
times increasing across alternative asset classes
(figure 4). While the growth in these times is small,
it is significant: sovereigns are increasingly dependent
on their alternative investments to generate yields,
however, growing levels of undeployed capital for
alternative investments are being held in cash and
money market funds, so that sovereigns can respond
quickly when real asset opportunities arise. These
highly liquid investments offer limited returns,
particularly in comparison to sovereign targets for
real asset investments, causing further growth in
the return gap.

Risk of fund withdrawals is slowing further

illiquid asset investment

The ability of sovereigns to respond to the return

gap is being limited by the increasing likelihood of
withdrawals. Over the past three years, governments
have responded to economic volatility by reducing
new funding to sovereigns and, in some cases,
drawing down from sovereign reserves, as seen

in figure 5.

While previously only liability sovereigns
experienced regular drawdown of funds (in the form
of outflows to beneficiaries), an increasing propensity
for government withdrawals is encouraging
investment and liquidity sovereigns to consider the
liquidity of their portfolio. Liquidity sovereigns were
comfortable in their ability to withdraw from their
portfolio at short notice, however, many sovereigns
stated that liquidity management was an entirely
new objective, with certain investment sovereigns
responding by creating tactical allocations to cash
and money market funds. This has led to conflicting
liquidity requirements: sovereigns have to manage
withdrawal risks by shortening time horizons while
simultaneously seeking to access illiquidity premia
to generate greater returns.

George Dyson

George Dyson is a historian of science and technology and the author of Baidarka: the
Kayak, Darwin Among the Machines, Project Orion, and Turing’s Cathedral.

The history of computing can be divided into an Old Testament and a New Testament:
before and after electronic digital computers and the codes they spawned proliferated
across the Earth. The Old Testament prophets, who delivered the underlying logic,
included Thomas Hobbes and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. The New Testament prophets
included Alan Turing, John von Neumann, Claude Shannon, and Norbert Wiener. They
delivered the machines.

Alan Turing wondered what it would take for machines to become intelligent.
John von Neumann wondered what it would take for machines to self-reproduce. Claude
Shannon wondered what it would take for machines to communicate reliably, no matter
how much noise intervened. Norbert Wiener wondered how long it would take for
machines to assume control.

Wiener’s warnings about control systems beyond human control appeared in
1949, just as the first generation of stored-program electronic digital computers were
introduced. These systems required direct supervision by human programmers,
undermining his concerns. What’s the problem, as long as programmers are in control of
the machines? Ever since, debate over the risks of autonomous control has remained
associated with the debate over the powers and limitations of digitally coded machines.
Despite their astonishing powers, little real autonomy has been observed. This is a
dangerous assumption. What if digital computing is being superseded by something
else?

Electronics underwent two fundamental transitions over the past hundred years:
from analog to digital and from vacuum tubes to solid state. That these transitions
occurred together does not mean they are inextricably linked. Just as digital computation
was implemented using vacuum tube components, analog computation can be
implemented in solid state. Analog computation is alive and well, even though vacuum
tubes are commercially extinct.

There 1s no precise distinction between analog and digital computing. In general,
digital computing deals with integers, binary sequences, deterministic logic, and time that
is idealized into discrete increments, whereas analog computing deals with real numbers,
nondeterministic logic, and continuous functions, including time as it exists as a
continuum in the real world.

Imagine you need to find the middle of a road. You can measure its width using
any available increment and then digitally compute the middle to the nearest increment.
Or you can use a piece of string as an analog computer, mapping the width of the road to
the length of the string and finding the middle, without being limited to increments, by
doubling the string back upon itself.

Many systems operate across both analog and digital regimes. A tree integrates a
wide range of inputs as continuous functions, but if you cut down that tree, you find that
it has been counting the years digitally all along.

enriched uranium — far from weapons grade — under International
Atomic Energy Agency inspection and allow rumors to swirl.

So Iran, long at the top of the Washington agenda, has slid down. It’s
partly the Arab Spring. It’s partly that you can’t keep saying the same
thing. People do begin to remember the refrain, although nobody in
the large Iran-the-clear-and-present-danger school ever seems to get
called to account. They should be. The nuclear bogeyman obsession
has been a distraction from the need to try to tease out a relationship
with Tehran, see Iran as it is. Only the most flimsy efforts have been
made, insufficient to test the waters.

Those waters are troubled. The Islamic Republic has not recovered
from its convulsion of 2009. It is sickly, consumed by hypocrisy as it
cheers on some brave Arabs (but not those in Syria) while brutalizing
its own seekers of the freedom promised in 1979. Arabs aren’t buying
Iranian hypocrisy. Only Iran’s command of Revolutionary Guard
force and the opposition’s lack of a shared goal salvage it.

Khamenei is at loggerheads with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad,
who got into such a sulk recently that he took 11 days off work,
infuriating everybody. The Majlis, or parliament, is investigating
Ahmadinejad for various alleged frauds including, of all things, vote-
buying in 2009! Ahmadinejad was booed during his June 3 speech
commemorating Ayatollah Khomeini’s death. Iran is characterized by
what Farideh Farhi of the University of Hawaii recently termed
“administrative chaos.”

That’s not how you make a nuke. When remembering Iran — and it
must be remembered — call the fear-mongers to account.

Deep in the vaults of the American Museum of Natural History lies a bird with a reddish beak: skin number 6999 of the Heinrich Expedition 1931. In life, it was
flightless, secretive and rare, living in the dense jungle thicket of the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia. Its call was sonorous but strange - a kind of low rumble or hum,
like a deep snore - the signature of Aramidopsis plateni, the Snoring Rail.
The bird's hunter, 36-year-old Gerd Heinrich, had been searching Sulawesi for nearly two years, bagging insects, mammals and other birds, but holding out for the
Snoring Rail. Its capture established his reputation as a collector, earned him his nickname, die Ralle, and would come to symbolize a life dedicated to discovery.
It would also capture the imagination of his son Bernd, a distinguished biologist at the University of Vermont and best-selling author (Mind of a Raven, Bumblebee
Economics). In The Snoring Bird, Bernd Heinrich leads us through his family's extraordinary history, which begins in Europe, ends in America and is shaped at
every turn by the rise of the science of biology. With his usual warmth, grace and insight, Heinrich has created an unconventional memoir - equal parts father and
son - that explores two radically different, often conflicting approaches to understanding the natural world.
The journey begins at Heinrich's childhood home in rural Maine when, years after Gerd's death, he comes across a pile of his father's personal effects. Strewn around
the barn and covered in guano, they would tell a remarkable tale. Gerd was born in Berlin in 1896 but spent his early life on an idyllic agricultural estate in Poland,
Borowke, which he called the home of my soul.
His days were passed on the land, observing and collecting nature's spoils. Then, the First World War intervened. Just 17, Gerd enlisted and eventually joined the
Luftwaffe as a pilot, was sought out by the legendary Red Baron and earned an Iron Cross for bravery. Shot down twice over enemy territory, he survived to return
to his beloved Borowke, where he soon rediscovered his old zoological passion to live it again.
Soon after, Gerd encountered a lifelong intellectual companion in Erwin Stresemann, curator of birds at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin. Their friendship would
survive another war, revolution, invasion, expulsion, starvation, and emigration. It was Stresemann who, in 1927, sent Gerd on his first zoological expedition, to
Persia, and fuelled his ambitions as a naturalist. In addition to Persia and Sulawesi, Gerd would lead zoological expeditions to Burma, Angola, Tanzania and
elsewhere.
While collecting specimens around the world, he was able to pursue an abiding passion, ichneumons, mysterious and exotic wasps that are parasitic connoisseurs,
and went on to describe 1,479 new species in his lifetime. He became one of the world's foremost experts on these rarefied creatures, obsessively collecting and
carefully differentiating one species from another based on subtle differences in body markings or shape, just as Vladimir Nabokov had done with his blues in the
butterfly world.
Gerd's desire to publish his manuscript on Oriental ichneumons brought him and his family to the United States when he was 55. There, he lived in poverty, an
amateur naturalist marginalized by the scientific community. Yet in rural Maine, living in an old farmhouse with no electricity and no running water, he was close to
the wilderness, which meant freedom. He had found New Borowke.
In the latter half of The Snoring Bird, Bernd Heinrich's story, we learn that he has also settled in Maine and that he shares his father's faith: I believe ... that our
well-being is tied not so much to the structure of our society and the politics that determine it, as to our ability to maintain contact with nature, to feel that we are part
of the natural order. It is this shared belief and fascination with the natural world that led them both to the frontiers of biology; and, it is there that their lives
diverged dramatically.
Gerd practised taxonomy, a descriptive science, while Bernd liked to experiment. Gerd's work was drudgery, whereas Bernd's was (and, one gets the sense, still is)
purest joy. Species identification, once at the forefront of biology, came to be derided as mere stamp collecting. By contrast, experimentation has become the
paradigm for modern biology and its growth logarithmic.
Modern biology's currency, Heinrich reminds us, is ideas. He has had many. Big ones. Ones published in leading journals, including Science, and which earned
him prestigious professorships and the admiration of his peers. They also brought him an unusual degree of academic freedom, which he has used to full effect, often
taking laypeople along on his wide-ranging journeys of discovery - into the minds of ravens, for instance - through popular writing.

file://localhost/Users/Lborth/Heinrich%20Book%20Review.html
Bernd's chapters here are earnest and humorous, and offer a window into the making of a scientist. But it is the early chapters on Gerd's life that captivate.
Heinrich skillfully recreates his father's story, through correspondence, an unpublished memoir and remembrances, to create a nuanced portrait - at times generous, at
other times hostile.
Gerd never celebrated his son's success as a scientist - at least not outwardly. The conflict between old science and new tainted their relationship, and Gerd's struggle
for recognition in science made him resentful. On the other hand, Bernd struggled for years to see the value in his father's science and to understand his motivations.
The memoir documents this struggle and builds to an ardent defence of his father's choices and of specimen-collecting biology: There was a purpose, an ethic, even
a morality to what naturalists of his time practised; Biology is history, and no amount of chemistry can explain how or why the different ichneumon wasps came
into being, or what role they play in different ecosystems; Naming before knowing.
Importantly, The Snoring Bird reminds us that science itself evolves, and that scientists are a product of their time and culture. Bernd Heinrich leaves us with no
doubt that in Gerd's youth, the naturalists' reputation shone brightly, and that taxonomy has provided biologists with a framework for thinking about the natural
world, upon which modern biology is built.
But he glosses over the fact that biology is in the midst of a new - some would say revolutionary - effort to catalogue Earth's biological diversity, using a short
sequence of each organism's DNA called DNA barcodes. They have verified past species divisions - those determined by taxonomists such as Gerd - and clarified
others; and, they represent another tool with which to understand and protect this bounty. In barcoding, an old science has become new again - albeit transformed.
But it is proof that to most of us, nature is still a magic show of the highest order, and that the values of naturalists such as Bernd and Gerd Heinrich live on.

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029449.txt,"Howard Stieglitz and Paul Krugman, two superb economists and Nobel Memorial
Laureates met with Obama and urged a 1.5 trillion dollar infusion, which would
have been almost exactly right. But they had both supported Hillary Clinton in the
primaries and so he went with his own advisor, Larry Summers who had a record of
major mistakes when working for Bill, not to mention as President of Harvard, so
Obama proposed an 800 billion infusion and then made the classic “Barry” mistake
by giving 400 billion of it to small business. This was well known to have no positive
effect whatsoever. Businesses do not invest during a recession, they wait for
demand to return. They are happy to get the money, which they promptly put away
in savings where it has no effect. In short, Obama’s stimulus was % the size it needed
to be. It did reverse the slide downwards leading to years of positive growth but the
effect was too weak when needed most and chants of “Yes we can” turned, in effect,
to chants of “Yes we can but it sure is gong to take a long time” and the Tea Party

swept aside many of his powers in 2010.

Barack was known as “Barry” growing up because his Kenyan father Barack was a
“rolling stone that gathered no moss” and his son always had to navigate two worlds
without the support of his father. He had all the benefits of outbreeding—tall, good
looking and very bright—and his ability to navigate the two worlds propelled him
upwards—into Harvard Law School, then first “black” Law Review editor, then
Illinois legislator—then his memorable “not Red States nor Blue States but United
States” speech at the 2004 Democratic Convention. But always with the flaw of

compromising where he should not.

The second major mistake he made right away was to appoint Hillary to be
Secretary of State, making peace with his defeated opponent, a nice gesture perhaps
but unheard of in US history. Why elevate your opponent? Why indeed. She will be
in a lead position to replace you 8 years later but will in fact usher in something far
worse. “Crooked” Hillary indeed—not because of some foolishness over e-mails but

because she was a life-long enabler of a thoroughly dishonest husband, as when she

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011500.txt,"Chapter Two

The 1948 war and the decade that followed remain vivid in my mind not just
for the obvious reason: they secured the survival of the infant state of Israel and
saw it into a more assured and independent young adulthood. It was also the
time when I grew from a young child —introspective and contemplative, aware
of how quickly my mind seemed to grasp numbers and geometric shapes and
musical notes, but also small for my age and awkward at the sports we’d play
on the dusty field at the far edge of the kibbutz — into a sense of my own place
in the family and community and the country around me. I did, along the way,
become arguably the most effective left defensive back on our kibbutz soccer
team. But that was not because I suddenly discovered a buried talent for the
game. Physically, I was like my father. I had natural hand coordination which
made delicate tasks come easily — one reason I would soon discover a pastime
that lent itself to acts of kibbutz mischief bordering on juvenile delinquency.
But when it came to larger muscles, I was hapless, if not hopeless. My prowess
as a soccer defenseman was because no opposing player in his right mind, once
I’d inadvertently cut his knees from under him when aiming for the ball, felt it
was worth coming anywhere close to me.

But when the war broke out in earnest in the spring of 1948, my focus, like
that of all Israelis, was on the fighting, which even the youngest of us knew
would determine whether the state would survive at all. Day after day, my
father helped me to chart each major advance and setback on a little map.
Dozens of kibbutzim around the country were in the line of fire. Some had soon
fallen, while others were barely managing to hang on. Just five miles inland
from us, an Israeli settlement came under attack by an Iraqi force in the nearby
Arab village of Qaqun.

But inside Mishmar Hasharon, I had the almost surreal feeling that this great
historical drama was something happening everywhere else but on our kibbutz.
If it hadn’t been for the radio, or the newsreels which we saw in weekly movie
nights in the dining hall, and the little map on which I traced its course with my
father, I would barely have known a war was going on. One Arab army did get
near to us: the Iraqis, in Qaqun. If they had advanced a few miles further, they
could have overrun Mishmar Hasharon, reached the coast and cut the new
Jewish state in half. I can still remember the rumble of what sounded like
thunder one morning in June 1948, as the Alexandronis, one of the twelve
brigades in the new Israeli army, launched their decisive attack on the Iraqis.

DAN ARIELY
Dan Ariely (born April 29, 1968) is an Israeli American
professor of psychology and behavioral economics. He
teaches at Duke University and is the founder of The
Center for Advanced Hindsight. Ariely’s talks on TED
have been watched 2.8 million times. He is the author
of Predictably Irrational and The Upside of Irrationality,
both of which became New York Times best sellers.
Dan Ariely was born in New York City while
his father was studying for an MBA degree at Columbia
University. The family returned to Israel when he was
three. He grew up in Ramat Hasharon. In his senior year of
high school, he was active in Hanoar Haoved Vehalomed,
an Israeli youth movement. While preparing a ktovet esh
(fire inscription) for a traditional nighttime ceremony, the
flammable materials he was mixing exploded, causing
third-degree burns over 70 percent of his body.
Ariely is married to Sumi, with whom
he has two children, a son and a daughter.
Ariely was a physics and mathematics major
at Tel Aviv University, but transferred to philosophy
and psychology. However, in his last year he dropped
philosophy and concentrated solely on psychology, in
which he received his B.A. He also holds an M.A. and a
Ph.D. in cognitive psychology from the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill. He completed a second doctorate
in business administration at Duke University at the urging
of Nobel economic sciences laureate Daniel Kahneman.
After obtaining his Ph.D. degree, he taught at MIT
between 1998 and 2008, before returning to Duke University
as James B. Duke Professor of Psychology and Behavioral
Economics. He was formerly the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of
Behavioral Economics at MIT Sloan School of Management.
Although he is a professor of marketing with no formal training
in economics, he is considered one of the leading behavioral
economists. Ariely is the author of the books Predictably
Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions and The
Upside of Irrationality: The Unexpected Benefits of Defying Logic
at Work and at Home. When asked whether reading Predictably
Irrational and understanding one’s irrational behaviors could
make a person’s life worse (such as by defeating the benefits of
a placebo), Ariely responded that there could be a short-term
cost, but that there would also likely be long-term benefits,
and that reading his book would not make a person worse off.
Ariely’s laboratory, the Center of Advanced
Hindsight at Duke University, pursues research in
subjects like the psychology of money, decision making
by physicians and patients, cheating, and social justice.
KEITH BLACK
Keith L. Black (born September 13, 1957) is an American
neurosurgeon specialising in the treatment of brain tumors
and a prolific campaigner for funding of cancer treatment.
He is chairman of the neurosurgery department and
director of the Maxine Dunitz Neurosurgical Institute at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California.
Keith Black was born in Tuskegee, Alabama. His
mother, Lillian, was a teacher and his father, Robert, was the
principal at a racially segregated elementary school in Auburn,
Alabama; prohibited by law to integrate the student body,
Black’s father instead integrated the faculty, raised standards,
and brought more challenging subjects to the school. Later in
his childhood, Black’s parents found new jobs and relocated
the family to Shaker Heights, Ohio. Black attended Shaker
Heights High School. Already interested in medicine, Black
was admitted to an apprenticeship program for minority
students at Case Western Reserve University, and then became
a teenaged lab assistant for Frederick Cross and Richard
Jones (inventors of the Cross-Jones artificial heart valve) at
St. Luke’s Hospital in Cleveland. At 17, he won an award in a
national science competition for research on the damage done
to red blood cells in patients with heart-valve replacements.
According to Black: “I was working in the lab of a heart surgeon
who had developed his own artificial heart valve, and I had a
concept that the heart valve might be damaging red blood cells,
so I asked to do a research project using a scanning electron
microscope at the time. When I was trying to basically learn
the technique, I took some blood from the heart-lung bypass
machine from patients undergoing heart-lung bypass, and
when I incubated the red blood cells overnight, I noticed that
a certain percentage of these cells change from their normal
discoid shape to one that resembled a porcupine, called an
econocyte. What I did was to describe the discocyte-econocyte
transformation in patients undergoing heart-lung bypass, as
an index of sub-lethal red blood cell damage. The importance
being that the blood cells could not parachute through the
small capillaries.” He attended the University of Michigan in
a program that allowed him to earn both his undergraduate
degree and his medical degree in 6 years. He received his M.D.
degree from the University of Michigan Medical School in 1981.
After serving his internship and residency at the
University of Michigan, in 1987 he moved to the UCLA
Medical Center in Los Angeles, where he later became head
of UCLA’s Comprehensive Brain Tumor Program. In 1997,
after 10 years at UCLA, he moved to Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center to head the Maxine Dunitz Neurosurgical Institute.
He was also on the faculty of the University of California,
Irvine School of Medicine from 1998 to 2003. In 2007 he
opened the new Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. Brain Tumor Center
at Cedars-Sinai, a research center named after the famous
lawyer who had been Black’s patient and supporter.
Black has been a frequent subject of media reports
on medical advances in neurosurgery. He was featured
in a 1996 episode of the PBS program The New Explorers
entitled “Outsmarting the Brain”. Esquire included him in
its November 1999 “Genius Issue” as one of the “21 Most
Important People of the 21st Century.” He has been cited as
an expert in reports about whether mobile phone use affects
the incidence of brain tumors. He is also noted for his very
busy surgery schedule: a 2004 Discover article noted that he
performs about 250 brain surgeries per year, and that at age 46
he had “already performed more than 4,000 brain surgeries,
the medical equivalent of closing in on baseball’s all-time
career hits record.” (As of 2009, Black’s surgery count had risen
to “more than 5,000 operations for resection of brain tumors”.)
In 1997, Time magazine featured Black on the
cover of a special edition called “Heroes of Medicine”. The
accompanying article described Black’s reputation as a
surgeon who would operate on tumors that other doctors
would not, as well as aspects of his medical research,
including his discovery that the peptide bradykinin can
be effective in opening the blood–brain barrier.
In 2009 Black published his autobiography, coauthored
with Arnold Mann, entitled Brain Surgeon. New
York Times reviewer Abigail Zuger described the book as a
“fascinating, if somewhat stilted, memoir”. The Publishers
Weekly review commented that the book “examines
racial hurdles he had to leap to become a neurosurgeon”
and “alternat[es] incisive writing about incisions with
his personal memoir, insightful and inspirational.”
DAVID BLAINE
For more than a decade, David Blaine has been attracting
the world’s attention with his high-profile endurance stunts.
Starting his career as a magician who appeared to do the
impossible with a deck of cards, he was soon following in the
footsteps of Houdini—seeking out that which seems physically
impossible and actually doing it. To that end, he’s been buried
alive in New York City for a week, barely survived being
encased inside a six-ton block of ice for three days and three
nights, stood atop a 100-foot-tall pillar in Bryant Park for 36
hours without a safety net, survived inside a transparent box in
London on nothing but water for 44 days, and spent one week
submerged in a sphere-shaped aquarium at Lincoln Center, at
the end of which he attempted to break the world record for
breath holding. A year later, he succeeded live on the Oprah
Winfrey show, holding his breath for 17 minutes and 4 seconds.
Born in Brooklyn, Blaine discovered his passion for
magic at the age of four when he saw a magician perform
in the subway. His mother encouraged his passion and he
began performing professionally at private parties by the age
of thirteen. By the age of twenty-three, Blaine had created,
directed, and produced an original television program titled
Street Magic, which garnered rave reviews by critics and
revolutionized the way magic is portrayed on television.
Penn Jillette of Penn & Teller called Street Magic “the best
TV magic special ever done” and “the biggest breakthrough
in our lifetime.” The New York Times noted that David has
“taken a craft that’s been around for hundreds of years
and done something unique and fresh with it.” The New
Yorker claimed that “he saved magic.” Since then, Blaine
has produced nine additional primetime specials.
Blaine has performed magic privately for U.S.
Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, Governor
Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bill Gates, Henry Kissinger, Mayor
Bloomberg, Mark Zuckerberg, and Muhammad Ali, as
well as President Dmitry Medvedev of Russia and other
international leaders. He also performed alongside Michael
Jackson, and during the Super Bowl halftime show.
In 2010, Blaine performed magic for 72 hours
straight in Times Square, raising nearly $100,000 for
relief efforts following the earthquake in Haiti.
Blaine resides in New York City with his
fiancée, Alizee Guinochet. The couple welcomed a
magical daughter into the world on January 27, 2011.

ADAM B LY
Adam Bly (born 1981 in Montreal, Canada) is founder
and CEO of Seed. He is the editor of “Science is Culture:
Conversations at the New Intersection of Science +
Society” (published by HarperCollins) and the creator
of the data visualization platform Visualizing.org.
He began his career at the age of 16 as the youngest
researcher at the National Research Council of Canada, where
he spent three years studying the biochemistry of cancer,
specifically the role of cell adhesion in metastasis. Out of the
lab, he founded Seed—tag-lined “Science is Culture™”—and
served as its Editor-in-Chief. “The best comparison for Seed,”
wrote a media critic at the time of the magazine’s launch in
2001, “is the early years of Rolling Stone, when music was less a
subject than a lens for viewing culture.” Under his leadership,
the magazine earned critical acclaim for modernizing
scientific publishing and for bridging long-standing divides
between science and society—from art and design to politics
and religion. Together with Paola Antonelli he co-founded a
monthly gathering of scientists, architects, and designers
that laid the foundation for Design and the Elastic Mind,
an exhibition about science and design at The Museum
of Modern Art.
In 2007, Bly was named a Young Global Leader
by the World Economic Forum. He is a recipient of the
Golden Jubilee Medal from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II
and his achievements have been highlighted by Canadian
Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, “for showing people the
scope and power of science not just as an object of study
but as a key to understanding the world around us.”
Bly has lectured around the world on the future of
science and its role in society, including at the World Economic
Forum, the National Academies of Science, the Royal Society,
the National Institutes of Health, the State Department,
NASA, the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology, The
Museum of Modern Art, and The Academy of Sciences for the
Developing World, before the National Science Board and the
U.S. House of Representatives, and at universities including
Harvard, MIT, and Beijing. He has served on the nominating
committees and juries of the Buckminster Fuller Challenge,
the Earth Award, and the TED Prize, and sits on the Science
Advisory Committee of the World Economic Forum, the
External Advisory Board of the University of Michigan’s Risk
Science Center, the American Committee of the Weizmann
Institute of Science, the Communications Advisory Board
of the National Academy of Sciences, and as an advisor to
OECD’s Global Project on Measuring the Progress of Societies.
Bly was recently named Vice Chair of the World
Economic Forum’s Global Agenda Council on Design
Innovation and Partner to the Executive Coordination
Office for the Rio+20 United Nations Conference
on Sustainable Development.

DAVID BROOKS
David Brooks (born August 11, 1961) is a political and cultural
commentator who writes for The New York Times. He worked as
an editorial writer and film reviewer for the Washington Times;
a reporter and later op-ed editor for The Wall Street Journal;
a senior editor at The Weekly Standard from its inception; a
contributing editor at Newsweek and The Atlantic Monthly;
and as a commentator on National Public Radio. He is
now a columnist for The New York Times and commentator
on PBS NewsHour.
Brooks, who is Jewish, was born in Toronto,
Canada—his father was a U.S. citizen living in Canada at the
time—and grew up in New York City in Stuyvesant Town. He
graduated from Grace Church School in New York City, Radnor
High School (located in a Main Line suburb of Philadelphia)
in 1979 and from the University of Chicago, with a degree
in history, in 1983.
Brooks edited a 1996 anthology of writings by
new conservative writers, Backward and Upward: The New
Conservative Writing. He wrote a book of cultural commentary
titled Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They
Got There, published in 2000, and followed it four years later
with On Paradise Drive: How We Live Now (And Always Have)
in the Future Tense.
He also authored The Social Animal: The Hidden
Sources of Love, Character and Achievement. The book was
excerpted in The New Yorker magazine in January 2011
and received mixed reviews upon its full publication, by
Random House, in March of that year. The book has been a
commercial success, reaching the #3 spot on the Publishers
Weekly best-sellers list for non-fiction in April 2011.
Brooks was a visiting professor of public policy at
Duke University’s Terry Sanford Institute of Public Policy, and
he taught an undergraduate seminar there in the fall of 2006.
He and his wife live in the Cleveland Park
neighborhood of Northwest Washington, DC.
Brooks describes himself as being originally a liberal
before “coming to my senses.” In 1983, he wrote a parody
of conservative pundit William F. Buckley Jr., which said
“In the afternoons he is in the habit of going into crowded
rooms and making everybody else feel inferior. The evenings
are reserved for extended bouts of name-dropping.”
Buckley admired the parody and offered Brooks
a job with National Review. A turning point in Brooks’s
thinking came later that year in a televised debate with
Milton Friedman, which, as Brooks describes it, “was
essentially me making a point, and he making a twosentence
rebuttal which totally devastated my point.”
Before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Brooks argued
forcefully for American military intervention, echoing the
belief of commentators and political figures that American
and British forces would be welcomed as liberators. In the
spring of 2004, some of his opinion pieces suggested that
he had tempered his earlier optimism about the war.
Brooks’ public writing about the U.S. wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq is similar to those by neoconservatives,
according to a Salon article by Glenn Greenwald, that labels
Brooks as a neoconservative. His angry dismissal of the
conviction of Scooter Libby as being “a farce” and having “no
significance” was derided by political blogger Andrew Sullivan.
On August 10, 2006, Brooks wrote a column for The
New York Times titled “Party No. 3”. The column proposed
the idea of the McCain-Lieberman Party, or the fictional
representation of the fictional moderate majority in America.
Ottawa Citizen commentator David Warren has
identified Brooks as the sort of conservative pundit that
liberals like, someone who is “sophisticated” and “engages
with” the liberal agenda, in contrast to a real conservative like
Charles Krauthammer. Brooks has long been a supporter of
John McCain; however, he did not show a liking for McCain’s
2008 running mate, Sarah Palin, calling her a “cancer” on
the Republican Party. He has referred to her as a “joke,”
unlikely to ever win the Republican nomination. But he later
admitted during a CSPAN interview that he had gone too far
in his previous “cancer” comments about Palin, which he
regretted, and simply stated he was not a fan of her values.
In a March 2007 article published in The New
York Times titled “No U-Turns”, Brooks explained that the
Republican Party must distance itself from the minimalgovernment
conservative principles that had arisen
during the Abraham Lincoln, Barry Goldwater, Ronald
Reagan and Calvin Coolidge eras. He claims that these
core concepts had served their purposes and should
no longer be embraced by Republicans in order to win
elections, which he considers the most important purpose
of a political party designed to serve the political class.
Brooks has been a frequent admirer of President
Barack Obama. In an August 2009 profile of Brooks, The
New Republic describes his first encounter with Obama, in the
spring of 2005: “Usually when I talk to senators, while they
may know a policy area better than me, they generally don’t
know political philosophy better than me. I got the sense he
knew both better than me. […] I remember distinctly an image
of—we were sitting on his couches, and I was looking at his
pant leg and his perfectly creased pant, and I’m thinking,
a) he’s going to be president and b) he’ll be a very good
president.” Two days after Obama’s second autobiography,
The Audacity of Hope, hit bookstores, Brooks published a
column in The New York Times, titled “Run, Barack, Run”,
urging the Chicago politician to run for president. However as
of December 2011 in a CSPAN interview, Brook’s opinion of
Obama’s presidency was more tempered, giving Obama only
a “B-” rating, and said that Obama’s chances of reelection
would be less than 50-50 if elections were held at that time.
In writing for The New York Times in January 2010,
Brooks described Israel as “an astonishing success story”.
He wrote that “Jews are a famously accomplished group,”
who, because they were “forced to give up farming in the
Middle Ages... have been living off their wits ever since”. In
Brooks’ view, “Israel’s technological success is the fruition
of the Zionist dream. The country was not founded so stray
settlers could sit among thousands of angry Palestinians
in Hebron. It was founded so Jews would have a safe place
to come together and create things for the world.”
Brooks opposes what he sees as self-destructive
behavior, such as teenage sex and divorce. His view is that
“sex is more explicit everywhere barring real life. As the
entertainment media have become more sex-saturated,
American teenagers have become more sexually abstemious”
by “waiting longer to have sex…[and] having fewer partners.”
He sees the culture war as nearly over, because “today’s
young people…seem happy with the frankness of the left
and the wholesomeness of the right.” As a result, he
is optimistic about the United States’ social stability,
which he considers to be “in the middle of an
amazing moment of improvement and repair.”
Brooks also broke with many in the conservative
movement when, in late 2003, he came out in favor of samesex
marriage in his New York Times column. He equated
the idea with traditional conservative values: “We should
insist on gay marriage. We should regard it as scandalous
that two people could claim to love each other and not
want to sanctify their love with marriage and fidelity.…
It’s going to be up to conservatives to make the important,
moral case for marriage, including gay marriage.”
Regarding abortion, Brooks has advocated for
pro-choice government regulations: abortion should be
legal, with parental consent for minors, during the first four
or five months, and illegal afterward, except in extremely
rare circumstances. (New York Times, April 22, 2002.)
MARK CUBAN
When Mark Cuban purchased the Dallas Mavericks on
January 14, 2000, the face of the organization began to
change immediately. Once again Mavericks games had
a party atmosphere as Reunion Arena rocked with the
return of the “Reunion Rowdies.” Mavericks games
became more than just ordinary NBA games—
they were a total entertainment experience.
Cuban was not only successful at instilling a sense
of pride and passion into Mavericks fans by presenting himself
as the ultimate role model by cheering from the same seats he
had in years past, but he also became the first owner in team
sports to encourage fan interaction through e-mail on his
personal computer. It was through this personal touch that
fans throughout the Metroplex, and around the world, began
to notice Cuban’s energetic personality and take notice of
the Mavericks. He has personally responded to thousands
of emails, and several suggestions from fans have led to
innovative changes such as a new three-sided shot clock,
which allows line of site to the 24-second clock from
anywhere in the arena.
Cuban’s whatever-it-takes attitude and commitment
to winning has everyone’s attention. From his first introduction
to the team to the end of his first season as owner, the players
responded with a 31-19 record, including a 9-1 mark in April
2000. In addition to hiring special coaches for offense,
defense and shooting, Cuban has promised to do everything
in his power to improve the team. This goal was achieved as
the club finished the 2000-01 season with a 53-29 record en
route to their first playoff appearance in 11 years where they
became just the sixth team in NBA history to be down 0-2 and
come back to win a five-game series vs. Utah in Round 1.
Before the start of the 2001-02 season, American
Airlines Center, the Mavs new home, opened and Cuban
co-founded HDNet, an all high-definition television network
on DIRECTV channel 199 which launched in September
2001. As with his other ventures, Cuban is revolutionizing
the television industry with HDNet. He is planning to expand
HDNet to include three more networks showing high-def
sports, movies and entertainment by the end of 2002.
During the Mavs 2001-02 campaign, the team
continued their winning ways by finishing the season with
a franchise-best record of 57-25 and an NBA-best road
record of 27-14, advancing to the postseason for the
second-consecutive year.
Prior to his purchase of the Mavericks, Cuban cofounded
Broadcast.com, the leading provider of multimedia
and streaming on the Internet, in 1995, selling it to Yahoo!
in July of 1999. Before Broadcast.com, Cuban co-founded
MicroSolutions, a leading National Systems Integrator,
in 1983, and later sold it to CompuServe.
Today, in addition to his ownership of the Mavericks,
Cuban is an active investor in leading and cutting-edge
technologies and continues to be a sought-after speaker.
ANTONIO DAMASIO
Antonio Damasio (born February 25, 1944 in Lisbon, Portugal)
is a University Professor (an award based on multi-disciplinary
interests and significant accomplishments in several
disciplines) and David Dornsife Professor of Neuroscience at
the University of Southern California, where he heads USC’s
Brain and Creativity Institute. Prior to taking up his posts at
USC, in 2005, Damasio was M.W. Van Allen Professor and
Head of Neurology at the University of Iowa Hospitals and
Clinics from 1976 to 2005. He is also Adjunct Professor
at the Salk Institute.
Damasio is the author of several best-selling
books which describe his scientific thinking. “As a leading
neuroscientist, Damasio has dared to speculate on
neurobiological data, and has offered a theory about the
relationship between human emotions, human rationality,
and the underlying biology.”
Damasio was born in Lisbon and studied medicine
at the University of Lisbon Medical School in Portugal, where
he also did his neurological residency and completed his
doctorate. He worked as a research fellow at the Aphasia
Research Center in Boston in 1967, prior to receiving his
MD in Lisbon. His work there on behavioural neurology
was done under the supervision of the late Norman
Geschwind, the Harvard neurologist who created the field.
As a researcher, Damasio’s main field is the
neurobiology of the mind, especially neural systems which
subserve emotion, decision-making, memory, language and
consciousness. Damasio’s seeks to demonstrate that emotions
play a critical role in high level cognition, an idea that ran
counter to dominant 20th century views in psychology,
neuroscience and philosophy. He showed that emotions and
their biological underpinnings are involved in decision-making
(both positively and negatively, and often non-consciously);
provide the scaffolding for the construction of social cognition;
and are required for the self processes which undergird
consciousness. “Damasio provides a contemporary scientific
validation of the linkage between feelings and the body by
highlighting the connection between mind and nerve cells…
this personalized embodiment of mind.”
He formulated the somatic markers hypothesis,
which captures the essence of these ideas. This idea has
inspired many systems-neuroscience experiments carried out
in laboratories in the U.S. and Europe, and has had a major
impact in contemporary science and philosophy. His articles
on this topic include: Bechara A, Damasio AR, Damasio H,
Anderson S. Insensitivity to future consequences following
damage to human prefrontal cortex. Cognition. 50:7-15. 1994;
Bechara A, Damasio H, Tranel D, Damasio AR. Deciding
advantageously before knowing the advantageous strategy.
Science. 275:1293-1294. 1997; Anderson SW, Bechara A,
Damasio H, Tranel D, Damasio AR. Impairment of social
and moral behaviour related to early damage in human
prefrontal cortex. Nature Neuroscience. 2:1032-1037. Damasio
has been named by the Institute of Scientific Information as
one of the most highly cited researchers in the past decade).
Current work on the biology of moral decisions, neuroeconomics,
social communication, and drug-addiction,
has been strongly influenced by Damasio’s hypothesis.
Damasio also proposed that emotions are part of
homeostatic regulation and are rooted in reward/punishment
mechanisms. He recovered James’ perspective on feelings as
a read-out of body states, but expanded it with an “as-if-bodyloop”
device which allows for the substrate of feelings to be
simulated rather than actual (foreshadowing the simulation
process later uncovered by mirror neurons). He demonstrated
experimentally that the insular cortex is a critical platform
for feelings, a finding that has been widely replicated, and
he uncovered cortical and subcortical induction sites for
human emotions, e.g. in ventromedial prefrontal cortex
and amygdala. He also demonstrated that while the
insular cortex plays a major role in feelings, it is not
necessary for feelings to occur, suggesting that brain
stem structures play a basic role in the feeling process.
He has continued to investigate the neural basis of
feelings and demonstrated that although the insular cortex is
a major substrate for this process it is not exclusive, suggesting
that brain stem nuclei are critical platforms as well. He
regards feelings as the necessary foundation of sentience.
In another development, Damasio proposed that
the cortical architecture on which learning and recall depend
involves multiple, hierarchically organized loops of axonal
projections that converge on certain nodes out of which
projections diverge to the points of origin of convergence
(the convergence-divergence framework). This architecture
is applicable to the understanding of memory processes
and of aspects of consciousness related to the access
of mental contents.
In “The Feeling of What Happens”, Damasio lays
the foundations of the “enchainment of precedences”: “the
nonconscious neural signaling of an individual organism
begets the protoself which permits core self and core
consciousness, which allow for an autobiographical self,
which permits extended consciousness. At the end of the
chain, extended consciousness permits conscience.
Damasio’s research depended significantly on
establishing the modern human lesion method, an enterprise
made possible by Hanna Damasio’s structural neuroimaging/
neuroanatomy work complemented by experimental
neuroanatomy (with Gary Van Hoesen and Josef Parvizi),
experimental neuropsychology (with Antoine Bechara, Ralph
Adolphs, and Dan Tranel) and functional neuroimaging (with
Kaspar Meyer, Jonas Kaplan, and Mary Helen Immordino-
Yang). The experimental neuroanatomy work with Van Hoesen
and Bradley Hyman led to the discovery of the disconnection
of the hippocampus caused by neurofibrillary tangles in the
entophinal cortex of patients with Alzheimer’s disease.
As a clinician, he and his collaborators
have studied and treated disorders of behaviour
and cognition, and movement disorders.
Damasio’s books deal with the relationship between
emotions and feelings, and what their brain substrates. His
1994 book, Descartes’ Error: Emotion, Reason and the Human
Brain, won the Science et Vie prize, was a finalist for the
Los Angeles Times Book Award, and is translated in over 30
languages. It is regarded as one of the most influential books
of the past two decades. His second book, The Feeling of What
Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness,
was named as one of the ten best books of 2001 by the New
York Times Book Review, a Publishers Weekly Best Book of
the Year, a Library Journal Best Book of the Year, and has
over 30 foreign editions. Damasio’s Looking for Spinoza: Joy,
Sorrow, and the Feeling Brain, was published in 2003. In it,
Damasio suggested that Spinoza’s thinking foreshadowed
discoveries in biology and neuroscience views on the mindbody
problem. Spinoza was a protobiologist. His latest book
is Self Comes to Mind: Constructing the Conscious Brain. In
it Damasio suggests that the self is the key to conscious
minds and that feelings, from the kind he designates as
primordial to the well-known feelings of emotion, are the
basic elements in the construction of the protoself and core
self. The book received the Corinne International Book Prize.
Damasio is a member of the American Academy of
Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Sciences’ Institute
of Medicine, and the European Academy of Sciences and Arts.
Damasio has received many awards including the Prince of
Asturias Award in Science and Technology, the Honda Prize,
the Kappers Neuroscience Medal, the Beaumont Medal from
the American Medical Association, the Nonino Prize and the
Reenpaa Prize in Neuroscience. He has received honorary
doctoral degrees (Doctor honoris causa) from the University
of Aachen (2002), University of Aveiro (2003), University
of Copenhagen (Copenhagen Business School; 2009),
University of Leiden (2010), University Ramon Llull,
Barcelona (2010), University of Coimbra (2011) and
from the EPFL, Lausanne (2011).
His current work involves the social emotions,
consciousness and the creative interface between
neuroscience and the arts, especially music and
film. The role of feelings states on sentience.
Damasio is married to Dr. Hanna Damasio,
his colleague and frequent co-author.
Damasio himself notes, in fallibilist fashion,
“I have a difficult time seeing scientific results, especially in
neurobiology, as anything but provisional approximations”’.
Whether despite or because of that fallibilism, Damasio
writes in the belief that ‘scientific knowledge can
be a pillar to help humans endure and prevail’.

DAVE GALLO
David Gallo is an American oceanographer and Director
of Special Projects at the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution—a preeminent, globally recognized scientific
laboratory. For more than 25 years, Dr. Gallo has been at the
forefront of ocean exploration, participating in and being
witness to the development of new technologies and scientific
discoveries that shape our view of planet earth. He has been
described by TED Conferences as “an enthusiastic ambassador
between the sea and those of us on dry land.” With more than
8 million views his TED presentation “Underwater
Astonishments” is among the top 5 TED Talks viewed to date.
David has participated in expeditions to all of
the world’s oceans and was one of the first scientists to
use a combination of robots and submarines to explore
the deep seafloor. Most recently he co-led an expedition
to create the first detailed and comprehensive map of the
RMS Titanic and he co-led the successful international
effort to locate the remains of Air France flight 447.
Dr. Gallo is currently active in planning a series of
challenging expeditions and is encouraging the development

MATT GROENING
Matt Groening was born in Portland, Oregon, on February
15, the third of five children. His father, Homer, was a
cartoonist and filmmaker. From an early age, Matt created
his own cartoons, amusing his friends and annoying his
teachers. Groening attended Evergreen State College
in Washington State, where he studied philosophy and
continued his interest in cartoons, comics and music.
After his graduation in 1977, Groening headed to
Los Angeles where he struggled in immobilizing but irksome
poverty. Increasingly frustrated by the traffic, smog, and
his landlords, Matt began to vent his angst to his friends by
sending them cartoons starring a bug-eyed rabbit named
Binky. Groening soon began to publish and sell these cartoons
at the record shop where he worked. Their popularity
encouraged Matt to syndicate, and in April 1980, Life In Hell®
formally debuted in the Los Angeles Reader. It was there that
he met his future wife, Deborah Caplan, and together
they formed Acme Features Syndicate, which today
circulates Life in Hell® to more than 250 newspapers
around the world in a half-dozen languages.
Life in Hell® has also been collected in a bestselling
series of books with over two million copies in print,
including Love is Hell, Work is Hell, School is Hell, Childhood
is Hell, Akbar & Jeff ’s Guide to Life, Greetings From Hell, The
Big Book of Hell, With Love From Hell, How to Go to Hell, The
Road to Hell, Binky’s Guide to Love, and Love is Still Hell.
In 1987 James L. Brooks approached Matt about
creating animated shorts to fit between sketches of “The
Tracey Ullman Show.” Matt agreed, but instead of using the
Life in Hell® characters, he created an entirely new cast:
The Simpsons, which bear the names of his family members,
Homer, Marge, Lisa and Maggie (Bart is an anagram for brat).
The Simpsons were soon spun off into a half-hour
animated series which first aired on December 17, 1989
with a Christmas special, followed by the series premiere
on January 14, 1990. It has since gone on to become
the longest running prime-time animated show in
television history. An international hit, the series has
also spawned a licensing and merchandising empire.
Books based on The Simpsons include The Simpsons
Xmas Book, Greetings From The Simpsons, The Simpsons
Rainy Day Fun Book, The Simpsons Uncensored Family Album,

HERBIE HANCOCK
Herbie Hancock is a true icon of modern music. Throughout
his explorations, he has transcended limitations and
genres while maintaining his unmistakable voice. With an
illustrious career spanning five decades and 14 Grammy®
Awards, including Album of the Year for River: The Joni
Letters, he continues to amaze audiences across the globe.
There are few artists in the music industry
who have had more influence on acoustic and electronic
jazz and R&B than Herbie Hancock. As the immortal
Miles Davis said in his autobiography, “Herbie was
the step after Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk, and I
haven’t heard anybody yet who has come after him.”
Born in Chicago in 1940, Herbie was a child
piano prodigy who performed a Mozart piano concerto
with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at age 11. He
began playing jazz in high school, initially influenced
by Oscar Peterson and Bill Evans. He also developed a
passion for electronics and science, and double-majored
in music and electrical engineering at Grinnell College.
In 1960, Herbie was discovered by trumpeter Donald
Byrd. After two years of session work with Byrd as well as
Phil Woods and Oliver Nelson, he signed with Blue Note
as a solo artist. His 1963 debut album, ‘Takin’ Off ’, was an
immediate success, producing the hit “Watermelon Man.”
In 1963, Miles Davis invited Herbie to join the
Miles Davis Quintet. During his five years with Davis, Herbie
and his colleagues Wayne Shorter (tenor sax), Ron Carter
(bass), and Tony Williams (drums) recorded many classics,
including ‘ESP’, ‘Nefertiti’ and ‘Sorcerer’. Later on, Herbie
made appearances on Davis’ groundbreaking ‘In a Silent Way’
and ‘Bitches Brew’, which heralded the birth of jazz-fusion.
Herbie’s own solo career blossomed on Blue Note,
with classic albums including ‘Maiden Voyage’, ‘Empyrean
Isles’, and ‘Speak Like a Child’. He composed the score to
Michelangelo Antonioni’s 1966 film ‘Blow Up’, which led to
a successful career in feature film and television music.
After leaving Davis, Herbie put together a new
band called The Headhunters and, in 1973, recorded ‘Head
Hunters.’ With its crossover hit single “Chameleon,”
it became the first jazz album to go platinum.
By mid-decade, Herbie was playing for stadium-sized
crowds all over the world and had no fewer than four albums in
the pop charts at once. In total, Herbie had 11 albums in the pop
charts during the 1970s. His ’70s output inspired and provided
samples for generations of hip-hop and dance music artists.
Herbie also stayed close to his love of acoustic
jazz in the ’70s, recording and performing with VSOP
(reuniting him with his Miles Davis colleagues), and in
duet settings with Chick Corea and Oscar Peterson.
In 1980, Herbie introduced the trumpeter Wynton
Marsalis to the world as a solo artist, producing his debut
album and touring with him as well. In 1983, a new pull to the
alternative side led Herbie to a series of collaborations with
Bill Laswell. The first, ‘Future Shock’, again struck platinum,
and the single “Rockit” rocked the dance and R&B charts,
winning a Grammy for Best R&B Instrumental. The video of
the track won five MTV awards. ‘Sound System’, the follow-up,
also received a Grammy in the R&B instrumental category.
Herbie won an Oscar in 1986 for scoring the
film “’Round Midnight”, in which he also appeared as
an actor. Numerous television appearances over the
years led to two hosting assignments in the 1980s: “Rock
School” on PBS and Showtime’s “Coast To Coast”.
After an adventurous 1994 project for Mercury
Records, ‘Dis Is Da Drum’, he moved to the Verve label,
forming an all-star band to record 1996’s Grammywinning
‘The New Standard’. In 1997, an album of
duets with Wayne Shorter, ‘1+1’, was released.
The legendary Headhunters reunited in 1998,
recording an album for Herbie’s own Verve-distributed
imprint, and touring with the Dave Matthews Band. That
year also marked the recording and release of ‘Gershwin’s
World’, which included collaborators Joni Mitchell, Stevie
Wonder, Kathleen Battle, the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra,
Wayne Shorter and Chick Corea. ‘Gershwin’s World’ won three
Grammys in 1999, including Best Traditional Jazz Album
and Best R&B Vocal Performance for Stevie Wonder’s
“St. Louis Blues.”
Herbie reunited with Bill Laswell to collaborate
with some young hip-hop and techno artists on
2001’s FUTURE2FUTURE. He also joined with Roy
Hargrove and Michael Brecker in 2002 to record a live
concert album, ‘Directions In Music: Live at Massey
Hall’, a tribute to John Coltrane and Miles Davis.
‘Possibilities’, released in August 2005, teamed
Herbie with many popular artists, such as Sting, Annie Lennox,
John Mayer, Christina Aguilera, Paul Simon, Carlos Santana,
Joss Stone and Damien Rice. That year, he played a number
of concert dates with a re-staffed Headhunters,
and became the first-ever Artist-In-Residence at
the Tennessee-based festival Bonnaroo.
In 2007, Hancock recorded and released ‘River: The
Joni Letters’, a tribute to longtime friend and collaborator Joni
Mitchell featuring Wayne Shorter, guitarist Lionel Loueke,
bassist Dave Holland and drummer Vinnie Colaiuta and coproduced
by Larry Klein. He enlisted vocalists Norah Jones,
Tina Turner, Corinne Bailey Rae, Luciana Souza, Leonard
Cohen and Mitchell herself to perform songs she wrote or was
inspired by. The album received glowing reviews and was a
year-end Top 10 choice for many critics. It also garnered three
Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year; Herbie is one
of only a handful of jazz musicians ever to receive that honor.
In 2010 Hancock released the critically-acclaimed
CD, ‘Herbie Hancock’s The Imagine Project,’ winner of two
20ll Grammy Awards for Best Pop Collaboration and Best
Improvised Jazz Solo. Utilizing the universal language of
music to express its central themes of peace and global
responsibility, the ‘Imagine’ project was recorded around
the world and features a stellar group of musicians
including Jeff Beck, Seal,Pink, Dave Matthews, The
Chieftains, Lionel Loueke, Oumou Sangare, Konono
#l, Anoushka Shankar, Chaka Khan, Marcus Miller,
Derek Trucks, Susan Tedeschi, Tinariwen, and Ceu.
Herbie Hancock also maintains a thriving career
outside the performing stage and recording studio. Recently
named by the Los Angeles Philharmonic as Creative Chair
For Jazz, he currently also serves as Institute Chairman of the
Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz, the foremost international
organization devoted to the development of jazz performance
and education worldwide. Hancock is also a founder of
The International Committee of Artists for Peace, and was
recently awarded the much esteemed “Commandeur des Arts
et des Lettres” by French Prime Minister Francois Fillon.
In July of 2011 Hancock was designated a UNESCO
Goodwill Ambassador by UNESCO Director-General Irina
Bokova. Recognizing Herbie Hancock’s “dedication to the
promotion of peace through dialogue, culture and the arts,”
the Director-General has asked the celebrated jazz musician
“to contribute to UNESCO’s efforts to promote mutual
understanding among cultures, with a particular emphasis on
fostering the emergence of new and creative ideas amongst
youth, to find solutions to global problems, as well as ensuring
equal access to the diversity of artistic expressions.” UNESCO’s
Goodwill Ambassadors are an outstanding group of celebrity
advocates who have generously accepted to use their talent
and status to help focus the world’s attention on the objectives
and aims of UNESCO’s work in its fields of competence:
education, culture, science and communication/information
Now in the fifth decade of his professional life,
Herbie Hancock remains where he has always been: in the
forefront of world culture, technology, business and music.
Though one can’t track exactly where he will go next, he is
sure to leave his inimitable imprint wherever he lands.
DANNY HILLIS
William Daniel “Danny” Hillis (born September 25, 1956,
in Baltimore, Maryland) is an American inventor, scientist,
engineer, entrepreneur, and author. He co-founded Thinking
Machines Corporation, a company that developed the
Connection Machine, a parallel supercomputer designed
by Hillis at MIT. He is also co-founder of the Long Now
Foundation, Applied Minds, Metaweb Technologies,
Applied Proteomics, and author of The Pattern on the
Stone: The Simple Ideas That Make Computers Work.
Danny Hillis was born in Baltimore, Maryland
in 1956. His father, William Hillis, was a US Air Force
epidemiologist studying hepatitis in Africa and relocated with
his family through Rwanda, Burundi, Republic of the Congo,
and Kenya. He spent a brief part of his childhood in Calcutta,
India when his father was a visiting faculty at ISI, Calcutta.
During these years the young Hillis was home schooled by his
mother Aryge Briggs Hillis, a biostatistician, and developed an
early appreciation for mathematics and biology. His younger
brother is David Hillis, a professor of evolutionary biology
at the University of Texas at Austin, and his sister is Argye E.
Hillis, a professor of neurology at Johns Hopkins University.
In 1978 Hillis graduated from MIT with a BS degree
in mathematics, followed in 1981 with an MS
degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer
Science (EECS), specializing in robotics.
During this time Hillis worked at the MIT Logo
Laboratory developing computer hardware and software for
children. He designed computer-oriented toys and games
for the Milton Bradley Company, and co-founded Terrapin
Software—a producer of computer software for elementary
schools. He also built a digital computer composed of
Tinkertoys that is on display at the Museum of Science, Boston.
Hillis’ major research, however, was into parallel
computing. Hillis designed the Connection Machine, a
parallel supercomputer; in 1983 Hillis co-founded Thinking
Machines Corporation to produce and market supercomputers
based on this design. In 1988, continuing this research, Hillis
received a PhD in EECS from MIT under doctoral advisers
Gerald Jay Sussman, Marvin Minsky and Claude Shannon.
Hillis co-founded Thinking Machines Corporation in
1983 while doing his doctoral work at MIT. The company was
to develop Hillis’ Connection Machine design into commercial
parallel supercomputers, and to explore computational
pathways to building artificial intelligence. Hillis’ ambitions
are represented by the company’s motto: “We’re building
a machine that will be proud of us,” and Hillis’ parallel
architecture was to be the main component for this task:
Clearly, the organizing principle of the brain is
parallelism. It’s using massive parallelism. The information
is in the connection between a lot of very simple parallel
units working together. So if we built a computer that was
more along that system of organization, it would likely
be able to do the same kinds of things the brain does.
At Thinking Machines Corporation, Hillis
built a technical team with many people that would
later become leaders in science and industry including
Brewster Kahle, Guy Steele, Sydney Brenner, David
Waltz, Jack Schwartz, and Eric Lander. He even recruited
Richard Feynman to spend his summers there. For many
years, Thinking Machines Corporation connection
machines were the fastest computers in the world.
During 1994, however, Thinking Machines filed for
bankruptcy. In 1996, after a short stint as a professor at the MIT
Media Lab, Hillis joined The Walt Disney Company full time
in the newly created role of Disney Fellow and Vice President,
Research and Development, Walt Disney Imagineering,
which Hillis claimed was an early ambition of his:
I’ve wanted to work at Disney ever since I was a
child…I remember listening to Walt Disney on television
describing the ‘Imagineers’ who designed Disneyland.
I decided then that someday I would be an Imagineer.
Later, I became interested in a different kind of magic—
the magic of computers. Now I finally have the perfect
job—bringing computer magic into Disney.
At Disney, Hillis developed new technologies as well
as business strategies for Disney’s theme parks, television,
motion pictures, Internet and consumer products businesses.
He also designed new theme park rides, a full sized walking
robot dinosaur and various micro mechanical devices.
Hillis left Disney in 2000, taking with him Bran
Ferren, President of the Walt Disney Imagineering, R&D
Creative Technologies division. Together, Ferren and Hillis
founded Applied Minds, a company aimed at providing
technology and consulting services to firms in an array of
industries, including aerospace, electronics, and toys. In
July 2005, Hillis and others from Applied Minds initiated
Metaweb Technologies, Inc. to develop a semantic data storage
infrastructure for the Internet, and Freebase, an “open,
shared database of the world’s knowledge”. When Metaweb
was acquired by Google, the technology became the basis
of Google’s Knowledge Graph. Hillis, together with
Dr. David B. Agus, cofounded a spinoff of Applied Minds
called Applied Proteomics Inc which designed and
prototyped a machine that measures the level of proteins
in the blood for medical diagnosis.
Hillis’ work with Agus on cancer led to the
founding of the University of Southern California
Physical Sciences-Oncology Center (USC PS-OC),
funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Hillis
is the principle investigator of this program.
In 1993, with Thinking Machines facing its demise,
Hillis wrote about long-term thinking and suggested a
project to build a clock designed to function for millennia:
When I was a child, people used to talk about
what would happen by the year 2000. Now, thirty years
later, they still talk about what will happen by the year
2000. The future has been shrinking by one year per year
for my entire life. I think it is time for us to start a longterm
project that gets people thinking past the mental
barrier of the Millennium. I would like to propose a large
(think Stonehenge) mechanical clock, powered by seasonal
temperature changes. It ticks once a year, bongs once a
century, and the cuckoo comes out every millennium.
This clock became the Clock of the Long
Now, a name invented by the songwriter and composer,
Brian Eno. Hillis wrote an article for Wired magazine
suggesting a clock that would last over 10,000 years.
The project led directly to the founding of the Long Now
Foundation in 1996 by Hillis and others, including Stewart
Brand, Brian Eno, Esther Dyson, and Mitch Kapor.
Hillis asserts that parallelism itself is approximately
the main ingredient of intelligence; that there is not
anything else required to make a mind result from a
distributed network of processors. Hillis believes that
…intelligence is just a whole lot of little
things, thousands of them. And what will happen is
we’ll learn about each one at a time, and as we do it,
machines will be more and more like people. It will
be a gradual process, and that’s been happening.
This is not so different from Marvin Minsky’s Society
of Mind theory, which holds that mind is a collection of agents,
each one taking care of a particular aspect of intelligence,
and communicating with one another, exchanging
information as required.
Some artificial intelligence theorists have other
opinions—that it’s not the underlying computational
mode that’s crucial, but rather particular algorithms
(of reasoning, memory, perception, etc.). Others
argue that the right combination of “little things” is
needed to give rise to the overall emergent patterns of
coordinated activity that constitute real intelligence.
Hillis is one of a small number of people
who have made a serious attempt to create such a
“thinking machine” and his ambitions are clear:
“I’d like to find a way for consciousness to
transcend human flesh. Building a thinking machine is
really a search for a kind of Earthly immortality. Something
much more intelligent than we can exist. Making a
thinking machine is my way to reach out to that.”
Hillis’ 1998 popular science book The Pattern on the
Stone attempts to explain concepts from computer science for
laymen using simple language, metaphor and analogy. It moves
from Boolean algebra through topics such as information
theory, parallel computing, cryptography, algorithms,
heuristics, Turing machines, and promising technologies
such as quantum computing and emergent systems.
BJARKE INGELS
QUINCY JONES
Bjarke Ingels started BIG Bjarke Ingels Group in 2005 after
co-founding PLOT Architects in 2001 and working at OMA
in Rotterdam. Through a series of award-winning design
projects and buildings, Bjarke has developed a reputation
for designing buildings that are as programmatically
and technically innovative as they are cost and resource
conscious. Bjarke has received numerous awards and
honors, including the Danish Crown Prince’s Culture Prize
in 2011, the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale in 2004,
and the ULI Award for Excellence in 2009. In 2011, the Wall
Street Journal awarded Bjarke the Architectural Innovator
of the Year Award. In 2012, the American Institute of
Architects granted the 8 House its Honor Award, calling it
“a complex and exemplary project of a new typology.”
Alongside his architectural practice, Bjarke
taught at Harvard University, Yale University, Columbia
University, and Rice University and is an honorary professor
at the Royal Academy of Arts, School of Architecture in
Copenhagen. He is a frequent public speaker and has
spoken in venues such as TED, WIRED, AMCHAM, 10
Downing Street, and the World Economic Forum.
An impresario in the broadest and most creative sense
of the word, Quincy Jones’ career has encompassed the
roles of composer, record producer, artist, film producer,
arranger, conductor, instrumentalist, TV producer, record
company executive, magazine founder, multi-media
entrepreneur and humanitarian. As a master inventor of
musical hybrids, he has shuffled pop, soul, hip-hop, jazz,
classical, African and Brazilian music into many dazzling
fusions, traversing virtually every medium, including
records, live performance, movies and television.
Celebrating more than 60 years performing and
being involved in music, Quincy’s creative magic has spanned
over six decades, beginning with the music of the postswing
era and continuing through today’s high-technology,
international multi-media hybrids. In the mid-50’s, he was
the first popular conductor-arranger to record with a Fender
bass. His theme from the hit TV series Ironside was the first
synthesizer-based pop theme song. As the first black composer
to be embraced by the Hollywood establishment in the 60’s,
he helped refresh movie music with badly needed infusions of
jazz and soul. His landmark 1989 album, Back On The Block—
named “Album Of The Year” at the 1990 Grammy Awards—
brought such legends as Dizzy Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah
Vaughan and Miles Davis together with Ice T, Big Daddy Kane
and Melle Mel to create the first fusion of the be bop and hip
hop musical traditions; while his 1993 recording of the critically
acclaimed Miles and Quincy Live At Montreux, featured
Quincy conducting Miles Davis’ live performance of the
historic Gil Evans arrangements from the Miles Ahead, Porgy
and Bess and Sketches of Spain sessions, garnered a Grammy
Award for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Performance. As producer
and conductor of the historic “We Are The World” recording
(the best-selling single of all time) and Michael Jackson’s
multi-platinum solo albums, Off The Wall, Bad and Thriller
(the best selling album of all time, with over 50 million copies
sold), Quincy Jones stands as one of the most successful and
admired creative artist/executives in the entertainment world.
His 1995 recording, Q’s Jook Joint, again showcased
Quincy’s ability to mold the unique talents of an eclectic
group of singers and musicians, in what resulted in a
retrospective of his broad and diverse career from that of
a seasoned Jazz musician, to skilled composer, arranger,
and bandleader, to acclaimed record producer.
A reference to the backwoods club houses of rural
America in the 1930’s, 40’s, and 50’s, the platinum selling
Q’s Jook Joint featured performances by artists such as
Bono, Brandy, Ray Charles, Phil Collins, Coolio, Kenny
“Babyface” Edmonds, Gloria Estefan, Rachelle Ferrell, Aaron
Hall, Herbie Hancock, Heavy D., Ron Isley, Chaka Khan, R.
Kelly, Queen Latifah, Tone Loc, the Luniz, Brian McKnight,
Melle Mel, Shaquille O’Neal, Joshua Redman, the Broadway
musical troupe Stomp, SWV, Take 6, newcomer Tamia,
Toots Thielemans, Mervyn Warren, Barry White, Warren
Wiebe, Charlie Wilson, Nancy Wilson, Stevie Wonder, Mr.
X, and Yo-Yo, among others, and garnered seven Grammy
nominations. His recording, From Q, With Love, featured a
collection of 26 love songs that he recorded over the last 32
years of his more than 50 year career in the music business.
Named by Time Magazine as one of the most
influential jazz musicians of the 20th century, Quincy Jones
was born on March 14, 1933, in Chicago and brought up
in Seattle. While in junior high school, he began studying
trumpet and sang in a gospel quartet at age 12. His musical
studies continued at the prestigious Berklee College of
Music in Boston, where he remained until the opportunity
arose to tour with Lionel Hampton’s band as a trumpeter,
arranger and sometime-pianist. He moved on to New York
and the musical “big leagues” in 1951, where his reputation
as an arranger grew. By the mid-50’s, he was arranging and
recording for such diverse artists as Sarah Vaughan, Ray
Charles, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Big Maybelle, Dinah
Washington, Cannonball Adderly and LeVern Baker.
In 1957, Quincy decided to continue his musical
education by studying with Nadia Boulanger, the legendary
Parisian tutor to American expatriate composers such as
Leonard Bernstein and Aaron Copeland. To subsidize
his studies he took a job with Barclay Disques, Mercury’s
French distributor. Among the artists he recorded in Europe
were Charles Aznavour, Jacques Brel and Henri Salvador,
as well as such visitors from America as Sarah Vaughan,
Billy Eckstine and Andy Williams. Quincy’s love affair with
European audiences continues through the present: in 1991,
he began a continuing association with the Montreux Jazz
and World Music Festival, which he serves as co-producer.
Quincy won the first of his many Grammy’s in
1963 for his Count Basie arrangement of “I Can’t Stop
Loving You.” Quincy’s three-year musical association as
conductor and arranger with Frank Sinatra in the mid-60’s
also teamed him with Basie for the classic Sinatra At The
Sands, containing the famous arrangement of “Fly Me To
The Moon,” the first recording played by astronaut Buzz
Aldrin when he landed upon the moon’s surface in 1969.
When he became vice-president at Mercury Records
in 1961, Quincy became the first high-level black executive
of an established major record company. Toward the end of
his association with the label, Quincy turned his attention
to another musical area that had been closed to blacks--the
world of film scores. In 1963, he started work on the music
for Sidney Lumet’s The Pawnbroker and it was the first of
his 33 major motion picture scores. In 1985, he co-produced
Steven Spielberg’s adaptation of Alice Walker’s The Color
Purple, which garnered eleven Oscar nominations, introduced
Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey to film audiences, and
marked Quincy’s debut as a film producer. In 1991 Quincy
helped launch NBC-TV’s hit series, The Fresh Prince Of
Bel Air, for which he served as an executive producer.
In 1990, Quincy Jones formed Quincy Jones
Entertainment (QJE), a co-venture with Time Warner, Inc. The
new company, which Quincy served as CEO and chairman,
had a broad ranging, multi-media agenda which encompassed
programming for current and future technologies, including
theatrical motion pictures and network, cable and syndicated
television. QJE produced NBC Television’s Fresh Prince Of
Bel Air (now in syndication), and UPN’s In The House and
Fox Television’s Mad TV, among other syndicated shows and
television specials. In 1991 Jones founded VIBE Magazine,
and with his publishing group VIBE Ventures, would go on to
acquire SPIN Magazine before divesting his magazine interests.
In January 1992, Quincy Jones executive produced
the An American Reunion concert at Lincoln Memorial,
an all-star concert and celebration that was the first
official event of the presidential inaugural celebration
and drew widespread acclaim as an HBO telecast.
On March 25, 1996, Quincy Jones, executive
produced the most watched awards show in the
world, the 68th Annual Academy Awards. The show
received widespread acclaim as one of the most
memorable Academy Award shows in recent years.
In 1997, Quincy Jones formed the Quincy Jones
Media Group. QJMG’s feature film projects in development
include such highly anticipated films as the adaptations of the
Ralph Ellison novel Juneteeth, David Halberstam’s The Children
for Home Box Office in association with producers Kathleen
Kennedy and Frank Marshall, a bio-pic on the 19th century
Russian poet Alexander Pushkin, Pimp and Seeds of Peace for
Showtime, among others. For television, QJMG is developing
the sit-com The White Guy. QJMG is also active in live
entertainment, direct response marketing, and cross-media
projects for home entertainment and educational applications.
As a record company executive, Quincy remained
highly active in the recording field throughout the 1990s as the
guiding force behind his own Qwest Records, which boasted
such important artists as New Order, Tevin Campbell, Andre
Crouch, Patti Austin, James Ingram, Siedah Garrett, Gregory
Jefferson and Justin Warfield. New Order’s album, Substance
earned Qwest a gold album in 1987. Tevin Campbell’s T.E.V.I.N
was both a critical sensation and major commercial success,
and the label’s release of the Boyz N The Hood soundtrack
album was among the most successful soundtrack recordings
of 1991. Qwest Records has also released soundtrack albums
from the major motion pictures Sarafina! and Malcolm X.
In 1994, Quincy Jones led a group of businessmen,
including Hall of Fame football player Willie Davis, television
producer Don Cornelius, television journalist Geraldo Rivera
and businesswoman Sonia Gonsalves Salzman in the formation
of Qwest Broadcasting, a minority controlled broadcasting
company which purchased television stations in Atlanta and
New Orleans for approximately $167 million, establishing it
as one of the largest minority owned broadcasting companies
in the United States. Quincy served as chairman and CEO of
Qwest Broadcasting. In 1999, taking advantage of the rapid
escalation of broadcast station values, Jones and his partners
sold Qwest Broadcasting for a reported $270 million.
The laurels, awards and accolades have been
innumerable: Quincy has won an Emmy Award for his score
of the of the opening episode of the landmark TV miniseries,
Roots, seven Oscar nominations, the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences’ Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award,
27 Grammy Awards, and N.A.R.A.S.’ prestigious Trustees’
Award and The Grammy Living Legend Award. He is the alltime
most nominated Grammy artist with a total of 79 Grammy
nominations. In 1990, France recognized Quincy with its most
distinguished title, the Commandeur de la Legion d’ Honneur.
He is also the recipient of the French Ministry of Culture’s
Distinguished Arts and Letters Award. Quincy is the recipient
of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music’s coveted Polar
Music Prize, and the Republic of Italy’s Rudolph Valentino
Award. He is also the recipient of honorary doctorates from
Howard University, the Berklee College of Music, Seattle
University, Wesleyan University, Brandeis University,
Loyola University (New Orleans), Clark Atlanta University,
Claremont University’s Graduate School, the University of
Connecticut, Harvard University, Tuskegee University, New
York University, University of Miami and The American
Film Institute, among others. In 2001, Jones was named a
Kennedy Center Honoree, for his contributions to the cultural
fabric of the United States of America. He was recognized by
the National Endowment for the Arts as a Jazz Master—the
nation’s highest jazz honor, and was most recently bestowed
the National Medal of Arts, our nation’s highest artistic honor.
In 1990, his life and career were chronicled in
the critically acclaimed Warner Bros. film, Listen Up: The
Lives of Quincy Jones, produced by Courtney Sale Ross,
a film which helped illuminate not only Quincy’s life and
spirit, but also revealed much about the development of
the African American musical tradition. Reflecting on
the changes in pop music over the years, Quincy says, “If
there are any common denominators, they are spirit and
musicality. I go for the music that gives me goose bumps,
music that touches my heart and my soul.” Over the years,
Quincy Jones has reached the essence of music and art:
the ability to touch people’s feelings and emotions.
In 2001, Quincy Jones added the title “Best
Selling Author” to his list of accomplishments when his
autobiography Q: The Autobiography of Quincy Jones entered
the New York Times, Los Angeles Times and Wall Street Journal
Best-Sellers lists. Released by Doubleday Publishing, the
critically acclaimed biography retells Jones’ life story from
his days as an impoverished youth on the Southside of
Chicago through a massively impressive career in music,
film and television where he worked beside legends such
as Billie Holiday, Ray Charles, Dizzy Gillespie, Count
Basie, Ella Fitzgerald and Michael Jackson, among many
others. In conjunction with the autobiography, Rhino
Records released a 4-cd boxed set of Jones’ music, spanning
his more than 5 decade career in the music business,
entitled “Q: The Musical Biography of Quincy Jones.”
The audio recording of “Q: The Autobiography
of Quincy Jones,” (Simon & Schuster) earned Jones
his 27th Grammy Award, in the Best Spoken Word
Category, while “Q: The Musical Biography of Quincy
Jones” garnered him a 15th NAACP Image Award,
in the category of Outstanding Jazz Artist.
In 2008 The Complete Quincy Jones: My Journey &
Passions, (Palace Press) examined the virtuosity of the man
Frank Sinatra named “Q,” celebrating his prolific contribution
to American art and culture. The book included a foreword
by Clint Eastwood, preface from Bono, an introduction by
Maya Angelou and an afterword by Sidney Poitier. Comprised
of personal interviews and recollections from Jones, this
collection peers behind the veil of celebrity, with extraordinary
access to his creative inspirations and achievements.
Jones next projects include the forthcoming
release of Soul Bossa Nostra, an album featuring some of
today’s biggest recording artists and producers such as
Usher, Ludacris, Akon, Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Hudson, Mary
J. Blige, T-Pain, Robin Thicke, LL Cool J, John Legend,
Snoop Dogg, Wyclef Jean, Q-Tip, Talib Kweli, Three 6 Mafia,
David Banner, Bebe Winans, Mervyn Warren, Jermaine
Dupri, DJ Paul, and Scott Storch, among others, who have
joined together to celebrate the music of the multi-Grammy
winning producer, composer and arranger by recording
contemporary versions of popular recordings from his
massive catalog; the book Q on Producing which recounts
his six-decade long career working in the recording studio
with music icons such as Count Basie, Duke Ellington,
Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson, among
many others; a duets album with Stevie Wonder and Tony
Bennett; as well as multiple projects for film and television.
With a long history of humanitarian work which
began in the 1960’s and 70’s, Jones was one of the key
supporters of Jesse Jackson’s Operation P.U.S.H. In 1985, he
pioneered the model of using celebrity to raise money and
awareness for a cause with “We Are the World.” The song
remains the best-selling single of all-time, and raised more
than $63 Million for Ethiopian famine relief. More importantly,
however, it shined a spotlight on the Ethiopian drought and
U.S. Government responded with over $800 million in aid.
In 1999 Quincy Jones joined Bono and Bob
Geldof during a meeting with Pope John Paul II as a part of
the Jubilee 2000 delegation to end third world debt. The
delegation’s visit resulted in $27 billion in third world debt
relief for Bolivia, Mozambique, and the Ivory Coast.
In 2004, in front of a live audience of more than
a half-million spectators, Jones launched the We Are the
Future initiative with a concert featuring Carlos Santana,
Alicia Keyes, Josh Groban, Oprah Winfrey, Norah Jones
and a host of other entertainers from around the world.
The initiative has established Municipal Child Centers
in the cities of Addis Ababa (Ethiopia), Asmara (Eritrea),
Freetown (Sierra Leone), Kigali (Rwanda) and Nablus
(Palestine) where youth are being trained to run childbased
programs in health, nutrition, Information and
Communication Technology (ICT), Sports and Arts.
In 2007, Jones and the Harvard School of Public
Health joined forces to advance the health and well-being of
children worldwide through Project Q, a strategic initiative
of School’s Center for Health Communication. Through
the strategic use of media, Project Q challenges leaders
and citizens of the world to provide essential resources
to enable young people to achieve their full potential.
A centerpiece of Project Q is the Q Prize, which
recognizes extraordinary leadership by public figures and social
entrepreneurs who are championing the needs of children.
The inaugural Q Prize was awarded in January 2007 to Scott
Neeson, founder of the Cambodian Children’s Fund, and over
$600,000 was raised in support of Neeson’s work. The 2008
Q Prize will be awarded on October 23 in New York City.
Through his personal foundation, The Quincy
Jones Foundation, Jones raises awareness and financial
resources for initiatives that support global children’s
issues in areas of conflict, malaria eradication, clean
water and efforts to restore the Gulf Coast (post-Katrina).
Philanthropic partners include Malaria No More, Millennium
Promise, and R&B singer Usher’s New Look Foundation.

JEFFREY KATZENBERG
Jeffrey Katzenberg (born December 21, 1950) is an American
film producer and CEO of DreamWorks Animation. He
is perhaps most known for his period as chairman of The
Walt Disney Studios when Disney produced some of its
biggest hits, including The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the
Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King. As a founder and CEO
of DreamWorks Animation, he has overseen the production
of such animated franchises as Shrek, Madagascar, Kung Fu
Panda, Monsters vs. Aliens and How to Train Your Dragon.
Katzenberg was born in New York City, the son
of Anne, an artist, and Walter, a stockbroker. He attended
the Ethical Culture Fieldston School, graduating in 1969.
Katzenberg began his career as an assistant to
producer David Picker, then in 1974 he became an assistant
to Barry Diller, the Chairman of Paramount Pictures. Diller
moved Katzenberg to the marketing department, followed
by other assignments within the studio, until he was
assigned to revive the Star Trek franchise, which resulted
in the hit film, Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979). He
continued to work his way up and became President of
Production under Paramount President Michael Eisner.
In 1984, Michael Eisner became Chief Executive
Officer (CEO) at The Walt Disney Company. Eisner brought
Katzenberg with him to take charge of Disney’s motion
picture division. Katzenberg was responsible for reviving
the studio which, at the time, ranked last at the box office
among the major studios. He focused the studio on the
production of adult-oriented comedies under its Touchstone
Pictures banner, including films such as Down and Out in
Beverly Hills (1986), Three Men and a Baby (1987) and Good
Morning, Vietnam (1987). By 1987, Disney had become
the number-one studio at the box office. Katzenberg also
oversaw Touchstone Television, which produced such hit
TV series, The Golden Girls and Home Improvement.
Katzenberg was also charged with turning around
Disney’s ailing Feature Animation unit, creating some
intrastudio controversy when he personally edited three
minutes out of a completed Disney animated feature, The
Black Cauldron (1985), shortly after joining the company.
Under his management, the animation department eventually
began creating some of Disney’s most critically acclaimed and
highest grossing animated features. These films include Who
Framed Roger Rabbit (1988), The Little Mermaid (1989),The
Rescuers Down Under (1990), Beauty and the Beast (1991,
the first animated feature to be nominated for an Academy
Award for Best Picture), Aladdin (1992), and The Lion King
(1994). In addition, Katzenberg also sealed the deal that
created the highly successful partnership between Pixar and
Disney and the deal that brought Miramax Films into Disney.
When Eisner’s second in command, Frank Wells,
died in a helicopter crash in 1994, Eisner refused to promote
Katzenberg to the vacated position of president. This led to
a falling out between the two executives, and Katzenberg
left the company in September 1994. He launched a lawsuit
against Disney to recover money he felt he was owed and
settled out of court for an estimated $250 million.
Later in 1994, Katzenberg co-founded
DreamWorks SKG with Steven Spielberg and David
Geffen, with Katzenberg taking primary responsibility for
animation operations. He was also credited as executive
producer on the DreamWorks animated films The Prince
of Egypt (1998), The Road to El Dorado and Joseph:
King of Dreams (both in 2000) and Shrek in 2001.
After DreamWorks Animation suffered a
$125 million loss on the traditionally-animated Sinbad:
Legend of the Seven Seas, the studio switched to all
computer-generated animation. Since then, DreamWorks’
animated films have been consistently successful.
In 2004, DreamWorks Animation (DWA)
was spun off from DreamWorks as a separate
company headed by Katzenberg in an IPO and has
recorded mostly profitable quarters since then.
The live-action DreamWorks movie studio was
sold to Viacom in December 2005. In 2008, the liveaction
DreamWorks studio again became an independent
production company, releasing its films through Disney.
In 2006, Katzenberg made an appearance on the
fifth season of The Apprentice. He awarded the task winners
an opportunity to be character voices in Over the Hedge.
Katzenberg has been an industry leader in promoting
digital 3D production of film, calling it “the greatest advance
in the film industry since the arrival of color in the 1930s.”
When Katzenberg appeared on The Colbert Report on April
20, 2010, he confirmed that from now on “every single
movie” that DreamWorks Animation produced would be
in 3D and gave Stephen Colbert a pair of new 3D glasses.
Katzenberg married Marilyn Siegel, a kindergarten
teacher, in 1975, and they have two children.
Together, Marilyn and Jeffrey have been highly
active in charitable causes. They donated the multimillion-dollar
Katzenberg Center to Boston University’s
College of General Studies, citing that the school gave
their two children the “love of education.” They also
donated the Marilyn and Jeffrey Katzenberg Center for
Animation at the University of Southern California.
In addition to serving as Chairman of the Board
for the Motion Picture and Television Fund Foundation,
Katzenberg sits on the boards or serves as a trustee of AIDS
Project Los Angeles, American Museum of the Moving Image,
California Institute of the Arts, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center,
Geffen Playhouse, Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s
Research, University of Southern California School of
Cinematic Arts and The Simon Wiesenthal Center. Together
with DreamWorks Animation, Katzenberg founded the
DreamWorks Animation Academy of Inner-City Arts in 2008.
Katzenberg has an estimated worth of $800
million according to Forbes. Katzenberg is reported to
have donated over $3.5 million in political contributions
since 1979: 33% ($1.171+ million) to Democrats, 66%
($2.33+ million) to special interest groups without party
affiliations, and less than 1% ($7,000) to Republicans.
He was awarded an honorary doctorate from
Ringling College of Art and Design on May 2, 2008.
NORMAN LEAR
90
Norman Lear has enjoyed a long career in television and film,
and as a political and social activist and philanthropist.
Mr. Lear began his television writing career in 1950
when he and his partner, Ed Simmons, were signed to write
for the The Ford Star Revue, starring Jack Haley. After only
four shows, they were hired away by Jerry Lewis to write for
the Martin and Lewis Colgate Comedy Hour, which they
continued to write until 1953. Mr. Lear then began writing on
his own for comedy shows including The Martha Raye Show,
The George Gobel Show, and The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show.
In 1958, Mr. Lear teamed with director Bud Yorkin
to form Tandem Productions. Together they produced several
feature films, with Mr. Lear taking on roles as executive
producer, writer, and director. He was nominated in 1967
for an Academy Award for his script for Divorce American
Style. In 1970, CBS signed with Tandem to produce All in
the Family, which first aired on January 12, 1971 and ran for
nine seasons. It earned four Emmy Awards for Best Comedy
series as well as the Peabody Award in 1977. All in the Family
was followed by a succession of other television hit shows
including Maude, Sanford and Son, The Jeffersons, One Day
at a Time, Good Times, and Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.
Concerned about the growing influence of radical
religious evangelists, Mr. Lear decided to leave television
in 1980 and formed People For the American Way, a nonprofit
organization designed to speak out for Bill of Rights
guarantees and to monitor violations of constitutional
freedoms. People For remains an influential and effective
voice for freedom. In 1982, he produced a two-hour
television special I Love Liberty, with a cast of stars and
an audience filling the Los Angeles Sports Arena.
Mr. Lear’s business career continued in 1984 when
he and his business partners created T.A.T. Communications,
later known as Embassy Communications, which was sold
in 1985. Mr. Lear then created and is currently chairman of
Act III Communications, a multimedia holding company
with interests in the recording, motion picture, broadcasting,
publishing, and licensing industries, including Concord
Music Group and Village Roadshow Pictures Group.
In addition to People for the American Way, Mr.
Lear has founded other nonprofit organizations, including
the Norman Lear Center at the USC Annenberg School
for Communication (2000–present), a multidisciplinary
research and public policy center dedicated to exploring
the convergence of entertainment, commerce and society;
the Business Enterprise Trust (1989–2000) to spotlight
exemplary social innovations in American business; and
with his wife, Lyn, co-founded the Environmental Media
Association (1989–present), to mobilize the entertainment
industry to become more environmentally responsible.
In 1999, President Clinton bestowed the National
Medal of Arts on Mr. Lear, noting that “Norman Lear has
held up a mirror to American society and changed the way
we look at it.” He has the distinction of being among the
first seven television pioneers inducted into the Television
Academy Hall of Fame (1984). In addition to his awards for
All in the Family, he has been honored by the International
Platform Association (1977), the Writers Guild of America
(1977) and many other professional and civic organizations.
In 2001, Lyn and Norman Lear created the
Declaration of Independence Road Trip, a four-year
educational initiative and national multimedia tour of one of
the surviving original copies of the Declaration, which they
purchased to share with the American people. As part of the
project, Mr. Lear launched Declare Yourself, a nonpartisan
youth voter initiative that registered well over four million
new young voters in the 2004, 2006, and 2008 elections.
At the Presidential Inauguration in 2009, Declare
Yourself premiered BornAgainAmerican.org, featuring
an inspiring music video that has been viewed by millions
across the country. It is part of an on-going drive to promote
active and thoughtful citizenship, as embodied in the
Declaration of Independence, which continues to tour.
Mr. Lear is married to Lyn Davis Lear and
resides in Los Angeles, California. He has six children:
Ellen, Kate, Maggie, Benjamin, Brianna, Madeline and
four grandchildren: Daniel, Noah, Griffin, Zoe.
YO-YO MA
Yo-Yo Ma’s multi-faceted career is testament to his continual
search for new ways to communicate with audiences, and
to his personal desire for artistic growth and renewal.
Whether performing new or familiar works from the
cello repertoire, coming together with colleagues for
chamber music or exploring cultures and musical forms
outside the Western classical tradition, Mr. Ma strives
to find connections that stimulate the imagination.
One of Mr. Ma’s goals is the exploration of music as
a means of communication and as a vehicle for the migrations
of ideas across a range of cultures throughout the world.
Expanding upon this interest, in 1998, Mr. Ma established
the Silk Road Project, a nonprofit arts and educational
organization. Under his artistic direction, the Silk Road Project
presents performances by the acclaimed Silk Road Ensemble,
engages in cross-cultural exchanges and residencies, leads
workshops for students, and partners with leading cultural
institutions to create educational materials and programs.
The Project’s ongoing affiliation with Harvard
University has made it possible to broaden and enhance
educational programming. In the 2011–2012 school year,
with ongoing partnerships with arts and educational
organizations in New York City, it continues to expand Silk
Road Connect, a multidisciplinary educational initiative
for middle-school students in the city’s public schools.
Developing new music is also a central undertaking of the
Silk Road Project, which has been involved in commissioning
and performing more than 60 new musical and multimedia
works from composers and arrangers around the world.
As the Chicago Symphony Orchestra’s Judson
and Joyce Green Creative Consultant, Mr. Ma is partnering
with Maestro Riccardo Muti to provide collaborative
musical leadership and guidance on innovative program
development for The Institute for Learning, Access and
Training at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and for Chicago
Symphony artistic initiatives. Mr. Ma’s work focuses on the
transformative power music can have in individuals’ lives,
and on increasing the number and variety of opportunities
audiences have to experience music in their communities.
Mr. Ma and the Institute have created the Citizen Musician
Initiative, a movement that calls on all musicians, music
lovers, music teachers and institutions to use the art form
to bridge gulfs between people and to create and inspire a
sense of community. www.citizenmusician.org features
stories of Citizen Musician activity across the globe.
Mr. Ma is also widely recognized for his strong
commitment to educational programs that bring the world
into the classroom and the classroom into the world.
While touring, he takes time whenever possible to conduct
master classes as well as more informal programs for
students—musicians and non-musicians alike. He has also
reached young audiences through appearances on “Arthur,”
“Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” and “Sesame Street.”
Mr. Ma’s discography of over 75 albums (including
more than 15 Grammy Award winners) reflects his wideranging
interests. He has made several successful recordings
that defy categorization, among them “Hush” with Bobby
McFerrin, “Appalachia Waltz” and “Appalachian Journey”
with Mark O’Connor and Edgar Meyer and two Grammywinning
tributes to the music of Brazil, “Obrigado Brazil”
and “Obrigado Brazil—Live in Concert.” Mr. Ma’s recent
recordings include Mendelssohn Trios with Emanuel Ax and
Itzhak Perlman. His new album, “The Goat Rodeo Sessions,”
with Edgar Meyer, Chris Thile and Stuart Duncan was
released in October 2011. Across this full range of releases,
Mr. Ma remains one of the best-selling recording artists in the
classical field. All of his recent albums have quickly entered
the Billboard chart of classical best sellers, remaining in
the Top 15 for extended periods, often with as many as four
titles simultaneously on the list. In fall 2009, Sony Classical
released a box set of over 90 albums to commemorate Mr.
Ma’s 30 years as a Sony recording artist.
Yo-Yo Ma was born in 1955 to Chinese parents living
in Paris. He began to study the cello with his father at age
four and soon came with his family to New York, where he
spent most of his formative years. Later, his principal teacher
was Leonard Rose at The Juilliard School. He has received
numerous awards, including the Avery Fisher Prize (1978),
the Glenn Gould Prize (1999), the National Medal of the
Arts (2001), the Dan David Prize (2006), the Sonning Prize
(2006), the World Economic Forum’s Crystal Award (2008)
and the Presidential Medal of Freedom (2010). In 2011 Mr.
Ma was recognized as a Kennedy Center Honoree. He was
the recipient of the 2012 Polar Music Prize. Appointed a
CultureConnect Ambassador by the United States Department
of State in 2002, Mr. Ma has met with, trained and mentored
thousands of students worldwide in countries including
Lithuania, Korea, Lebanon, Azerbaijan and China. Mr. Ma
serves as a UN Messenger of Peace and as a member of the
President’s Committee on the Arts & the Humanities. He
has performed for eight American presidents, most recently
at the invitation of President Obama on the occasion of the
56th Inaugural Ceremony. Mr. Ma and his wife have two
children. He plays two instruments, a 1733 Montagnana
cello from Venice and the 1712 Davidoff Stradivarius.

Nicholas Negroponte (born December 1, 1943) is an
American architect best known as the founder and
Chairman Emeritus of Massachusetts Institute of
Technology’s Media Lab, and also known as the founder
of the One Laptop per Child Association (OLPC).
Negroponte was born to Dimitri John Negroponte,
a Greek shipping magnate, and grew up in New York
City’s Upper East Side. He is the younger brother of John
Negroponte, former United States Deputy Secretary of State.
He attended Buckley School in New York City, Le
Rosey in Switzerland, and The Choate School (now Choate
Rosemary Hall) in Wallingford, Connecticut, from which he
graduated in 1961. Subsequently, he studied at MIT as both
an undergraduate and graduate student in Architecture where
his research focused on issues of computer-aided design. He
earned a Master’s degree in architecture from MIT in 1966.
Negroponte joined the faculty of MIT in 1966.
For several years thereafter he divided his teaching time
between MIT and several visiting professorships at Yale,
Michigan and the University of California, Berkeley.
In 1967, Negroponte founded MIT’s Architecture
Machine Group, a combination lab and think tank which
studied new approaches to human-computer interaction.
In 1985, Negroponte created the MIT Media Lab with
Jerome B. Wiesner. As director, he developed the lab into
the pre-eminent computer science laboratory for new
media and a high-tech playground for investigating the
human-computer interface. Negroponte also became a
proponent of intelligent agents and personalized electronic
newspapers, for which he popularized the term the Daily Me.
In 1992, Negroponte became involved in the creation
of Wired Magazine as the first investor. From 1993 to 1998,
he contributed a monthly column to the magazine in which
he reiterated a basic theme: “Move bits, not atoms.”
Negroponte expanded many of the ideas from his
Wired columns into a bestselling book Being Digital (1995),
which made famous his forecasts on how the interactive
world, the entertainment world and the information world
would eventually merge. Being Digital was a bestseller and
was translated into some twenty languages. Negroponte
is a digital optimist who believed that computers would
make life better for everyone. However, critics such as
Cass Sunstein have faulted his techno-utopian ideas for
failing to consider the historical, political and cultural
realities with which new technologies should be viewed.
Negroponte’s belief that wired technologies such
as telephones will ultimately become unwired by using
airwaves instead of wires or fiber optics, and that unwired
technologies such as televisions will become wired, is
commonly referred to as the Negroponte switch.
In 2000, Negroponte stepped down as director
of the Media Lab as Walter Bender took over as Executive
Director. However, Negroponte retained the role of laboratory
Chairman. When Frank Moss was appointed director of the lab
in 2006, Negroponte stepped down as lab chairman to focus
more fully on his work with One Laptop Per Child (OLPC)
although he retains his appointment as professor at MIT.
In November 2005, at the World Summit on the
Information Society held in Tunis, Negroponte unveiled the
concept of a $100 laptop computer, The Children’s Machine,
designed for students in the developing world. The price
has increased to US$180, however. The project is part of
a broader program by One Laptop Per Child, a non-profit
organisation started by Negroponte and other Media Lab
faculty, to extend Internet access in developing countries.
Negroponte is an active angel investor and has
invested in over 30 startup companies over the last 30 years,
including Zagats, Wired, Ambient Devices, Skype and Velti.
He sits on several boards, including Motorola (listed on the
New York Stock Exchange) and Velti (listed on the London
Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ). He is also on the advisory
board of TTI/Vanguard. In August 2007, he was appointed
to a five-member special committee with the objective of
assuring the continued journalistic and editorial integrity
and independence of the Wall Street Journal and other Dow
Jones & Company publications and services. The committee
was formed as part of the merger of Dow Jones with News
Corporation. Negroponte’s fellow founding committee
members are Louis Boccardi, Thomas Bray, Jack Fuller,
and the late former Congresswoman Jennifer Dunn.
Negroponte has influenced modern
day futurists, such as David Houle.

STEVEN PINKER
Steven Pinker was born in 1954 in the English-speaking Jewish
community of Montreal,Canada. He earned a bachelor’s
degree in experimental psychology at McGill University and
then moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1976, where he
has spent most of his career bouncing back and forth between
Harvard and MIT. He earned his doctorate at Harvard in 1979,
followed by a postdoctoral fellowship at MIT, a one-year stint
as an assistant professor at Harvard, and in 1982, a move back
to MIT that lasted until 2003, when he returned to Harvard.
Currently he is Harvard College Professor and the Johnstone
Family Professor in the Department of Psychology. He also
has spent two years in California: in 1981–82, when he was an
assistant professor at Stanford, and in 1995–96,when he spent
a sabbatical year at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
Pinker is an experimental psychologist who is
interested in all aspects of language and mind. Much of his
initial research was in visual cognition, the ability to imagine
shapes, recognize faces and objects, and direct attention within
the visual field. But beginning in graduate school he cultivated
an interest in language, particularly language development
in children, and this topic eventually took over his research
activities. Aside from his experimental papers in language and
visual cognition, he wrote two fairly technical books early in
his career. One outlined a theory of how children acquire the
words and grammatical structures of their mother tongue. The
second focused on one aspect of this process, the ability to
use different kinds of verbs in appropriate sentences, such as
intransitive verbs, transitive verbs, and verbs taking different
combinations of complements and indirect objects. For the
next two decades his research focused on the distinction
between irregular verbs like bring-brought and regular
verbs like walk-walked. The reason is that the two kinds of
verbs neatly embody the two processes that make language
possible: looking up words in memory, and combining words
(or parts of words) according to rules. He has also studied
language development in twins and the neuroimaging of
language processes in the brain, and has recently begun
lines of research on the nature of reminding and on the
function of innuendo and other forms of indirect speech.
In 1994 he published the first of five books
written for a general audience. The Language Instinct was
an introduction to all aspects of language, held together by
the idea that language is a biological adaptation. This was
followed in 1997 by How the Mind Works, which offered a
similar synthesis of the rest of the mind, from vision and
reasoning to the emotions, humor, and art. In 1999 he
published Words and Rules: The Ingredients of Language which
presented his research on regular and irregular verbs as a
way of explaining how language works in general. In 2002
he published The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human
Nature, which explored the political, moral, and emotional
colorings of the concept of human nature. The Stuff of Thought:
Language as a Window into Human Nature, published in 2007,
discussed the ways in which language reveals our thoughts,
emotions, and social relationships. His most recent book is
The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined,
published in 2011. Pinker frequently writes for The New York
Times, Time, The New Republic, and other magazines on
subjects such as language and politics, the neural basis of
consciousness, and the genetic enhancement of human beings.
Pinker is the Chair of the Usage Panel of The
American Heritage Dictionary and has served as editor or
advisor for numerous scientific, scholarly, media, and
humanist organizations, including the American Association
the Advancement of Science, the National Science Foundation,
the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American
Psychological Association, and the Linguistics Society of
America. He has won many prizes for his books (including
the William James Book Prize three times, the Los Angeles
Times Science Book Prize, and the Eleanor Maccoby Book
Prize), his research (including the Troland Research Prize
from the National Academy of Sciences, the Early Career
Award from the American Psychological Association, and
the Henry Dale Prize from the Royal Institution of Great
Britain), and his graduate and undergraduate teaching.
He is also a Humanist Laureate, the 2006 Humanist of
the Year, recipient of the 2008 Innovations for Humanity
Award from La Ciudad de las Ideas in Mexico, the 2008
Honorary President of the Canadian Psychological
Association, and the recipient of six honorary doctorates.
Pinker lives in Boston and in Truro
with Rebecca Newberger Goldstein. The other
authors in the family are his sister Susan Pinker
and Rebecca’s daughter Yael Goldstein Love.
LISA RANDALL
Professor Lisa Randall studies theoretical particle physics
and cosmology at Harvard University. Her research
connects theoretical insights to puzzles in our current
understanding of the properties and interactions of
matter. She has developed and studied a wide variety of

MOSHE SAFDIE
Moshe Safdie is an architect, urban planner, educator,
theorist, and author. Embracing a comprehensive and
humane design philosophy, Safdie is committed to
architecture that supports and enhances a project’s
program; that is informed by the geographic, social, and
cultural elements that define a place; and that responds to
human needs and aspirations. Safdie has completed a wide
range of projects, such as cultural, educational, and civic
institutions; neighborhoods and public parks; mixed-use
urban centers and airports; and master plans for existing
communities and entirely new cities around the world.
Major projects by Safdie Architects currently under
construction or recently completed include Mamilla Alrov
Center, a dynamic urban center near the Old City in Jerusalem;
Marina Bay Sands, a mixed-use integrated resort in Singapore;
Khalsa Heritage Memorial Complex, the national museum
of the Sikh people in the Punjab, India; the United States
Institute of Peace Headquarters on the Mall in Washington,
D.C.; the National Campus for the Archeology of Israel in
Jerusalem; Golden Dream Bay, a high-density residential
project in Qinhuangdao, China; the Kauffman Center for the
Performing Arts in Kansas City, Missouri; and the Crystal
Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas.
Born in Haifa, Israel, in 1938, Safdie moved to
Canada with his family at a young age. He graduated from
McGill University in 1961 with a degree in architecture.
After apprenticing with Louis I. Kahn in Philadelphia, Safdie
returned to Montreal to oversee the master plan for the
1967 World Exhibition. In 1964 he established his own firm
to realize Habitat ’67, an adaptation of his thesis at McGill,
which was the central feature of the World’s Fair and a
groundbreaking design in the history of architecture.
In 1970, Safdie established a Jerusalem branch office,
commencing an intense involvement with the rebuilding of
Jerusalem. He was responsible for major segments of the
restoration of the Old City and the reconstruction of the new
center, linking the Old and New Cities. Over the years, his
involvement expanded and included the new city of Modi’in,
the new Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum, and the Rabin
Memorial Center. During this period, Safdie also became
involved in the developing world, working in Senegal, Iran,
Singapore, and in the northern Canadian arctic. In 1978,
after teaching at Yale, McGill, and Ben Gurion Universities,
Safdie relocated his residence and principal office to Boston.
He served as Director of the Urban Design Program at
Harvard University Graduate School of Design from 1978 to
1984, and Ian Woodner Professor of Architecture and Urban
Design from 1984 to 1989. In the following decade, he was
responsible for the design of six of Canada’s principal public
institutions, including the Quebec Museum of Civilization, the
National Gallery of Canada, and Vancouver Library Square.
Safdie has worked with a wide range of clients,
including municipal entities and government agencies,
colleges and universities, private developers, and nonprofit
organizations and civic institutions. Many of his
firm’s buildings have become beloved regional and
national landmarks, including Exploration Place Science
Center, Wichita, Kansas; Salt Lake City Public Library,
Salt Lake City, Utah; Peabody Essex Museum, Salem,
Massachusetts; Springfield Federal Courthouse, Springfield,
Massachusetts; Skirball Cultural Center, Los Angeles,
California; Lester B. Pearson International Airport,
Toronto, Canada; the National Gallery of Canada; and
Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum, Jerusalem, Israel.
In addition to numerous articles on the theory
and practice of architecture, Safdie has written several
books, most notably, Beyond Habitat (1970), For Everyone a
Garden (1974), Form and Purpose (1982), and Jerusalem: The
Future of the Past (1989). The City After the Automobile (1997)
details Safdie’s ideas about urbanism and city planning. A
comprehensive monograph of his work, Moshe Safdie I, was
published in 1996. Moshe Safdie II, a second monograph
featuring work from 1996–2008, was published in 2009.
Safdie has been featured in several films, including
Moshe Safdie, The Power of Architecture, which is a portrait
film (directed by Donald Winkler, 2004), My Architect: A
Son’s Journey about Nathaniel Kahn and his father Louis
I. Khan (directed by Nathaniel Kahn, 2003), and The
Sound of the Carceri, about Bach and Piranesi, with Yo-
Yo Ma (directed by Francois Girard, 1997). In the fall of
2010, The National Gallery of Canada presented Global
Citizen: The Architecture of Moshe Safdie, an exhibition that
explores the architect’s buildings and design philosophy.
The exhibition is co-sponsored by Crystal Bridges Museum
of American Art and the Skirball Cultural Center.

Safdie has been the recipient of numerous
awards, honorary degrees, and civil honors, including
the Companion of the Order of Canada and the Gold
Medal of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada.
MEGAN SMITH
BENEDIKT TASCHEN
Megan recently joined Google’s advanced products team,
Google [x], where she is working on range of projects including
co-creating/hosting SolveForX, a forum to encourage and
amplify technology-based moonshot thinking and teamwork
(http://www.wesolveforx.com/). For nine years before that she
oversaw Google’s New Business Development team managing
early-stage partnerships, pilot explorations, and technology
licensing working closely with Google’s engineering and
product teams globally across all product areas. She led many
of the company’s early acquisitions, including Keyhole (Google
Earth), Where2Tech (Google Maps) and Picasa. Megan also
led the Google.org team transition to expand and innovate
engineering based projects including Google Crisis Response,
Google for Nonprofits, and Earth Outreach/Earth Engine,
Googler 1%-time (now called “GoogleServe20”) in addition to
operationalizing Google’s more traditional corporate giving.
Prior to joining Google in 2003, Megan was the CEO
and, earlier, COO of PlanetOut, the leading gay, lesbian,
bisexual and transgender online community, where the
team broke through many barriers and partnered closely
with all of the early major web players. She also held roles
at General Magic and Apple Japan. Over the years, Megan
has contributed to a wide range of engineering projects,
including an award-winning bicycle lock, space station
construction program, solar cookstoves and was a member
of the MIT student team who designed, built and raced a

engineering from MIT, where she now serves on the board. She
completed her master’s thesis work at the MIT Media Lab.
Benedikt Taschen, 1961, Cologne, Germany, is a German
publisher. His professional life started at age 18 in a
250-square-foot (23 m 2 ) store in Cologne, Germany, named
TASCHEN COMICS. In 1984, he bought 40,000 remainder
copies of a Magritte monograph published in English with
money borrowed from his family. The books sold through at
double the price in two months and he was soon publishing
his own books. By the end of the 1980s TASCHEN titles
were available in over a dozen languages at prices that made
art books affordable to students and collectors alike.
By the late 1990s, he had become a household
name in publishing. When Vanity Fair’s Matt Tyrnauer
deemed him, “one of the few people in business who has the
courage to do exactly what he wants whenever he wants to”,
Benedikt Taschen tested the theory with Helmut Newton’s
SUMO, the largest bound book of the 20th century. “I have
done a lot of books, and I can tell you—without mentioning
names—that publishers are not all like him. There are very
few like him. Or there are none like him. He is also, I might
add, a madman”, says Helmut Newton to Vanity Fair.
SUMO is also the company’s most successful title
of the last ten years and the precursor to Benedikt Taschen’s
most ambitious personal project: GOAT—Greatest of All Time, a
tribute to Muhammad Ali, shipping in Spring 2004. Four years
in the making, GOAT weighs 75 lbs and is 20˝ x 20˝ in size, with
nearly 800 pages of archival and original photographs, graphic
artwork and articles and essays—including those of Ali himself.
Another of his books is the Icons series of art
books, some of the most accessible in the world.
Today, TASCHEN has offices in Cologne, Hong
Kong, London, Los Angeles, Madrid, Paris and Tokyo and
stores in Amsterdam, Berlin, Beverly Hills, Brussels, Cologne,
Copenhagen, Hamburg, Hollywood, London, Miami, New
York, and Paris. TASCHEN employs 200 staff members
worldwide and many longtime freelance editors. As Billy
Wilder put it in Vanity Fair 2000: “Benedikt reminds me
of an old-time Hollywood figure—a studio head, someone
who is in firm command and has his hand in everything”.
He is married and lives in the Chemosphere, designed
by John Lautner in 1960. He bought the home for $1 million
in 1997, restored the building, and published a book on
Lautner. He lives and works in Cologne and Los Angeles.

or Comedy, in Across the Universe. Julie’s most recent
film, The Tempest, had its North American premiere at the
48th New York Film Festival in October 2010, following
a world premiere at the 67th Venice International Film
Festival. Taymor’s adaptation of the William Shakespeare
play features an all-star cast including Helen Mirren,
Russell Brand, Djimon Hounsou and Alfred Molina.
Beyond the theatre and screen, Taymor has
directed five operas internationally including Oedipus
Rex with Jessye Norman, for which she earned the
International Classical Music Award for Best Opera
Production. A subsequent film version premiered at the
Sundance Film Festival and won her an Emmy® award.
Taymor also directed Salomé, The Flying Dutchman,
Die Zauberflöte (which has been in repertory at The Met for six
years), The Magic Flute (the abridged English version of Die
Zauberflöte, which inaugurated a new PBS series entitled “Great

C. K. WILLIAMS
C. K. Williams (born Charles Kenneth Williams on November
2, 1936) is an American poet, critic and translator. Williams
has won nearly every major poetry award. Flesh and Blood
won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1987. Repair
(1999) won the 2000 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, was a National
Book Award finalist and won the Los Angeles Times Book
Prize. The Singing won the National Book Award, 2003 and
in 2005 Williams received the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize.
C. K. Williams grew up in Newark, New Jersey and
graduated from Columbia High School in Maplewood. He
later briefly attended Bucknell University and graduated from
the University of Pennsylvania. While at Penn he studied
with the romantic scholar, Morse Peckham, and spent a great
deal of time in the circle of young architects who studied
with and worked for the great architect Louis Kahn. In an
essay, “Beginnings,” he acknowledges Kahn’s dedication and
patience as essential to his notion of the life of an artist.
Williams lived for a period in Philadelphia, where he
worked for a number of years as a part-time psychotherapist
for adolescents and young adults, a ghost-writer and editor,
then began teaching, first at the YM-YWHA in Philadelphia,
then at several universities in Pennsylvania, Beaver College,
Drexel, and Franklin and Marshall. He subsequently taught
at many other universities, including Columbia, NYU, Boston
University, the University of California, both at Irvine and
Berkeley, before finally becoming a professor at George Mason
University, then moving in 1995 to Princeton University, where
he has taught poetry workshops and translation ever since.
He met his present wife, Catherine Mauger, a
French jeweler, in 1973, and they have a son who is now a
noted painter, Jed Williams. He has a daughter from an earlier
marriage, Jessie Burns, who is a writer. He lives half the
year near Princeton, and the rest in Normandy in France.
He is a member of the American
Academy of Arts and Letters.
His first book, Lies, was published in 1969, and since
then he has published many collections of poetry, culminating
in his Collected Poems, of which Peter Campion wrote in The
Boston Globe: “Throughout the five decades represented
in his new Collected Poems, Williams has maintained the
most sincere, and largest, ambitions. Like Yeats and Lowell
before him, he writes from the borderland between private
and public life….[His poems] join skeptical intelligence
and emotional sincerity, in a way that dignifies all of our
attempts to make sense of the world and of ourselves. C. K.
Williams has set a new standard for American poetry.”
Another collection, Wait, appeared in 2010, and
another, Writers Writing Dying, will come out in 2012.
He has written a memoir, Misgivings, which
appeared in 2000, a collection of essays, Poetry and
Consciousness, 1999, and a critical study of Walt Whitman,
On Whitman, 2010. A new collection of essays, In Time:
Poets, Poems and the Rest, will be published in 2012.
Williams is also an acclaimed translator,
notably of Sophocles’ Women of Trachis and Euripides’
The Bacchae, as well as of the Polish poet Adam
Zagajewski and the French poet Francis Ponge.
He has also published several children’s books.
APES
One branch, I read, of a species of chimpanzees has something like territorial wars,
and when the…army, I suppose you’d call it, of one tribe prevails and captures an enemy,
“Several males hold a hand or foot of the rival so the victim can be damaged at will.”
This is so disquieting: if beings with whom we share so many genes can be this cruel,
what hope for us? Still, “rival,” “victim, “will”—don’t such anthropomorphic terms
make those simians’ social-political conflicts sound more brutal than they are?
The chimps Catherine and I saw on their island sanctuary in Uganda we loathed.
Unlike the pacific gorillas in the forest of Bwindi, they fought, dementedly shrieked,
the dominant male lorded it over the rest; they were, in all, too much like us.
Another island from my recent reading, where Columbus, on his last voyage,
encountering some “Indians” who’d greeted him with curiosity and warmth, wrote,
before he chained and enslaved them, “They don’t even know how to kill each other.”
It’s occurred to me I’ve read enough—at my age all it does is confirm my sadness.
Surely the papers: war, terror, torture, corruption—they’re like broken glass in the mind.
Back when I knew I knew nothing, I read all the time, poems, novels, philosophy, myth,
but I hardly glanced at the news, there was a distance between what could happen
and the part of myself I felt with: now everything’s so tight against me I hardly can move.
The Analects say people in the golden age weren’t aware they were governed; they just
lived.
Could I have passed through my own golden age and not even known I was there?
Some gold: nuclear rockets aimed at your head, racism, sexism, contempt for the poor.
And there I was, reading. What did I learn? Everything, nothing, too little, too much…
Just enough to get me here: a long-faced, white-haired ape with a book, still turning the
page.

EDWARD WILSON
Edward Osborne Wilson is a world leading biologist
and internationally recognized as one of the planet’s
most articulate authorities on the interrelatedness
of knowledge disciplines and of life systems.
He is acknowledged for two interdisciplinary
scientific disciplines (island biogeography and
sociobiology), three unifying concepts for science and
the humanities jointly (biophilia, biodiversity studies,
and consilience), and one technological advance in the
study of global biodiversity (the Encyclopedia of Life).
A native of Alabama, Wilson grew up in Mobile
and received his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in biology
from The University of Alabama (1949, 1950) and his
doctoral degree in biology from Harvard University (1955).
Wilson has received more than 100 awards for
his research on ants and biodiversity and for his writings
addressed to both scientific and non-scientific audiences.

DAMIAN WOETZEL
Damian Woetzel was a Principal Dancer at New York City
Ballet and frequently performed internationally as a guest
star and visiting artist with numerous companies including
the Kirov Ballet and American Ballet Theatre, until his
retirement from the stage in 2008. Woetzel currently serves
as the Director of Arts Programs for the Aspen Institute, the
Artistic Director of the Vail International Dance Festival,
and as the Founding Director of the Jerome Robbins New
Essential Works Program. Woetzel is also active as a director
and producer outside these roles. Among his recent projects,
Woetzel produced and directed an arts salute to Stephen
Hawking at Lincoln Center for the World Science Festival,
and directed the first performance of the White House Dance
Series, which took place in the East Room of the White House
and was hosted by First Lady Michelle Obama. Woetzel also
works with Yo-Yo Ma on his Silk Road Connect program in
the New York City Public Schools, and has twice directed
culminating year-end performances; at the Museum of Natural
History in 2010, and for the Central Park SummerStage series
in 2011. Woetzel was appointed to the President’s Committee
on the Arts and Humanities by President Obama in 2009. In
July 2012, Woetzel was honored with the inaugural Gene Kelly
Legacy Award—an award jointly created by the Dizzy Feet
Foundation and the Estate of Gene Kelly in honor of the 100th
anniversary of Kelly’s birth—for his contributions to the arts as
a ballet star and director of dance and music performances.
In June 2011, Woetzel was named the Director
of Arts Programs at the Aspen Institute. Under Woetzel’s
direction, the Aspen Institute Arts Program brings together
leading artists, arts managers, sponsors, government officials
and patrons. Through these collaborations, the Program
seeks to generate, exchange, and develop ideas and policies
in order to encourage vibrancy and dynamism in all artistic
realms, and to enrich civic culture in ways only the arts can.
Among the events curated by the Aspen
Institute Arts Program under Woetzel’s direction:
In November 2011, Woetzel curated the inaugural US-
China Forum on the Arts and Culture in Beijing, in partnership
with Asia Society and the Chinese People’s Association for
Friendship with Foreign Countries. The four day forum was
the first in a series of cultural exchanges seeking to strengthen
mutual understanding between Americans and Chinese
through panel discussions, lectures, film screenings, museum
tours, dinners and performance. American and Chinese
artists and cultural representatives engaged in the forum
included Joel Coen, Meryl Streep, Yo-Yo Ma, Alice Waters,
Liu Ye, Ge You and others. Woetzel also directed a Public
Forum in partnership with the Public Theater titled “Does
Culture Make Us Who We are,” hosted by Anne Hathaway with
guests including Bill Irwin, David Brooks and Oskar Eustis.
In March 2012, Woetzel produced a panel with
Howard Gardner, the Hobbs Professor of Cognition and
Education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education,
and Dr. Ellen Winner, Professor of Psychology at Boston
College, and Senior Research Associate at Project Zero,
examining the current state of the arts in education.
Woetzel also hosted renowned artists Eric Fischl and
Chuck Close in a conversation about artists and their
audience at the Mary Boone Gallery in New York.
In June 2012, the Arts Program for the first time
curated multiple sessions at the Institute’s premiere
public program, the Aspen Ideas Festival. For nineteen
sessions, Woetzel brought renowned artists, policymakers,
arts administrators as well as leading Chinese cultural
representatives for discussions, film screenings and
cultural exchanges focusing on how the arts impact society.
Sessions included “Culture and Conflict” with Palestinianborn
ballroom star and educator Pierre Dulaine and
Dutch composer Merlijn Twaalfhoven; a conversation
between renowned producer Julie Taymor and former
Disney CEO and current Aspen Institute Arts Program
chair Michael Eisner; “Radical Creative Spaces” with
architect Elizabeth Diller; “Arts and the City: Making
Cities Sing” with Rocco Landesman, Dennis Scholl, Darren
Walker and Richard Florida; among many others.
Since 2006, Woetzel has been the Artistic Director
of the summer Vail International Dance Festival, where
he presents dance performances and commissions. He
has instituted a number of initiatives as director, including
bringing the educational arts program “Celebrate The
Beat”—the Colorado associate of Jacques d’Amboise’s
National Dance Institute—to the Vail Valley, to reach
local underserved children in the public schools.
Under Woetzel’s direction, the festival has
received wide acclaim for its innovation and growth as a
nationally recognized showcase for dance, featuring such
performances as the debut of Morphoses/The Wheeldon
Company, and the launch of New York City Ballet MOVES.
The annual International Evenings of Dance galas have
become renowned for Woetzel’s curation of first-time
partnerships across companies and countries, as well as the
presentation of young, emerging stars making their debuts
in new repertory. In August 2012, The New York Times’
Alastair Macaulay wrote that the 2012 Vail International
Dance Festival presentations “were distinguished above
all by catholic taste and brilliant programming. They merit
superlatives” and that the International Evenings I gala
“was simply the best gala I have attended in decades.”
Writing the same week, Wendy Perron of Dance Magazine
compared Woetzel to the legendary impresario Serge
Diaghilev, and praised Woetzel for engaging and educating
audiences through spoken introductions to each work, and
for his commitment to collaboration with live musicians.
Woetzel has also instituted a series of “UpClose”
performances: lecture-demonstration events which combine
rehearsal, performance and commentary by Woetzel and
special guests. Recent UpClose performances have included:
“UpClose: Stravinsky by Balanchine,” an examination of
the legendary collaboration between George Balanchine
and Igor Stravinsky, co-hosted by Woetzel and New York
City Ballet Master-in-Chief Peter Martins (2012); “UpClose:
Premieres,” which provided a first look at a series of works
created in Vail by choreographers including Christopher
Wheeldon and Emery LeCrone during the weeks of the 2011
Vail International Dance Festival; among many others.
In 2009 and 2010, Woetzel produced and directed
the World Science Festival Gala Performances at Lincoln
Center’s Alice Tully Hall. For the 2010 event he created
an arts salute to science honoring the theoretical physicist
Stephen Hawking, featuring performances by Yo-Yo
Ma, John Lithgow, and Kelli O’Hara among others.
In the fall of 2009, Woetzel helped create and began
directing the Jerome Robbins Foundation’s New Essential
Works (NEW) Program, which supports choreographers
and dance companies during the current financial crisis
by giving grants to enable the production of new works.
In 2009, Woetzel launched as curator and director
the new Studio 5 performance series at New York’s City
Center, which features in-depth examinations of today’s
most compelling dance artists and companies highlighted by
in-studio performances and demonstrations. In 2009–2012,
guests included David Hallberg, Christopher Wheeldon,
Victoria Clark, Rob Berman, Angel Corella, Wendy Whelan,
Edward Villella, among others; topics of discussion ranged
from musical theatre to collaboration; and featured
companies included American Ballet Theatre, the Paul
Taylor Dance Company and Dance Theater of Harlem.
In June of 2010 Woetzel piloted “Arts Strike,”
a new effort to have celebrated artists engage educators
and students, schools and communities, highlighting and
sharing the unique power of the arts to empower, enrich
and educate. The first events have taken place in Vail,
Chicago, and Los Angeles, and have all featured Woetzel
with Yo-Yo Ma in schools, engaging with students and
their teachers to promote learning through the arts.
Woetzel works with Yo-Yo Ma on his Silk Road
Connect program in the New York City Public Schools. In
June 2010, Woetzel directed the culminating year-end event
which took place at New York’s Museum of Natural History,
and featured the participation of the Silk Road Ensemble
and 450 sixth-grade students. In June 2011, the culminating
year-end event opened the Central Park SummerStage series.
Titled “Night at the Caravanserai: Tales of Wonder,” the
performance again featured hundreds of sixth-grade students
from New York-area public schools, Ma with his Silk Road
Ensemble, vocalist Bobby McFerrin, the soprano Emalie Savoy,
actor Bill Irwin, and author Jhumpa Lahiri, among others.
In April 2011, Woetzel organized an “arts strike” at
Inner-City Arts in downtown Los Angeles with Yo-Yo Ma, The
Silk Road Ensemble, and Memphis Jooker Charles “Lil Buck”
Riley. The event included a demonstration and workshop for
more than one hundred elementary school students from
the Los Angeles Unified School District. Highlighting the
event was a first-time duet directed by Woetzel between Ma
and Lil Buck, who performed a Memphis Jookin’ version of
The Dying Swan with Ma accompanying on the cello; the
performance was immortalized in a video shot by Spike
Jonze which reached over one million views within weeks.
In the fall of 2010, Woetzel was a visiting Lecturer

STEPHEN WOLFRAM
WILL WRIGHT
Stephen Wolfram has been responsible for three
revolutionary developments: the Mathematica
computation system, A New Kind of Science, and the
Wolfram|Alpha computational knowledge engine.
Wolfram was educated at Eton, Oxford and
Caltech, receiving his Ph.D. in theoretical physics at the
age of 20. Wolfram’s work on basic science led him to a
series of fundamental discoveries about the computational
universe of possible programs. Summarized in his bestselling
2002 book A New Kind of Science, these discoveries
have not only launched major new directions in basic
research, but have also led to breakthroughs in scientific
modeling in physical, biological and social domains—as well
as defining a broad new basis for technology discovery.
Launched in 1988, Mathematica has revolutionized
the way technical computation is done, and has been
responsible for countless advances over the past two decades.
Starting from a set of fundamental principles devised by
Wolfram, Mathematica has continually grown, integrating
more and more algorithmic domains, and spawning such
technologies as the Computable Document Format (CDF).
Building on Mathematica and A New Kind of
Science, Wolfram in 2009 launched Wolfram|Alpha—an
ambitious, long-term project to make as much of the world’s
knowledge as possible computable, and accessible to
everyone. Used every day on the web and through apps by
millions of people around the world, Wolfram|Alpha defines
a fundamentally new kind of computing platform that is
turning science-fiction computer intelligence into reality.
In addition to his scientific and technical
achievements, Wolfram has been the CEO of Wolfram
Research since its founding in 1987. Under Wolfram’s
leadership, Wolfram Research has become one of the world’s
most respected software companies, as well as a powerhouse
of technical and intellectual innovation, and a major
contributor to education and research around the world.
William Ralph “Will” Wright (born January 20, 1960, in
Atlanta, Georgia) is an American video game designer and
co-founder of the game development company Maxis, now
part of Electronic Arts. In April 2009, he left Electronic
Arts to run “Stupid Fun Club”, an entertainment think
tank in which Wright and EA are principal shareholders.
The first computer game Wright designed was
Raid on Bungeling Bay in 1984, but it was SimCity that
brought him to prominence. The game was released by
Maxis, a company Wright formed with Jeff Braun, and he
built upon the game’s theme of computer simulation with
numerous other titles including SimEarth and SimAnt.
Wright’s greatest success to date came as the original
designer for The Sims games series. The game spawned
multiple sequels and expansions and Wright earned many
awards for his work. His latest work, Spore, was released
in September 2008 and features gameplay based upon the
model of evolution and scientific advancement. The game
sold 406,000 copies within three weeks of its release.
He was born as William Ralph Wright
on January 20, 1960, in Atlanta. He is of French,
English, Italian, and Native American descent.
After graduating at 16 from Episcopal High School,
he enrolled in Louisiana State University, transferring two
years later to Louisiana Tech. Beginning with a start at an
architecture degree, followed by mechanical engineering,
he fell into computers and robotics. He excelled in subjects
he was interested in—architecture, economics, mechanical
engineering, and military history—but was held back by his
impractical goals such as language arts. His earlier dream
of space colonization remained, and was joined by a love
for robotics. After another two years at Louisiana Tech, in
the fall of 1980, Wright moved on to The New School in
Manhattan. He lived in an apartment over Balducci’s, in
Greenwich Village, and spent his spare time searching for
spare parts in local electronics surplus stores. After one year
at the New School, Wright returned to Baton Rouge without
his degree, concluding five years of collegiate study.
During a summer break from college, he
met his first wife Joell Jones, an artist currently living
in California, on vacation to her hometown of Baton
Rouge. In an interview published in February 2003, Will
claims that games were absorbing so much of his time,
he decided that perhaps making games was the way to
go. Wright’s first game was the helicopter action game
Raid on Bungeling Bay (1984) for the Commodore 64.
Wright found that he had more fun creating levels
with his level editor for Raid on Bungeling Bay than he had
while actually playing the game. He created a new game
that would later evolve into SimCity, but he had trouble
finding a publisher. The structuralist dynamics of the game
were in part inspired by the work of two architectural and
urban theorists, Christopher Alexander and Jay Forrester.
“I’m interested in the process and strategies
for design. The architect Christopher Alexander, in
his book A Pattern Language formalized a lot of spatial
relationships into a grammar for design. I’d really like to
work toward a grammar for complex systems and present
someone with tools for designing complex things.”
Wright, in an interview with The Times,
expressed belief that computers extend the imagination,
and posits the emergence of the “metabrain”, stating:
“Any human institutional system that draws
on the intelligence of all its members is a metabrain. Up
to now, we have had high friction between the neurons
of the metabrain; technology is lowering that friction
tremendously. Computers are allowing us to aggregate our
intelligence in ways that were never possible before. If you
look at Spore, people are making this stuff, and computers
collect it, then decide who to send it to. The computer is
the broker. What they are really exploring is the collective
creativity of millions of people. They are aggregating
human intelligence into a system that is more powerful
than we thought artificial intelligence was going to be.”
In 1986, he met Jeff Braun, an investor interested
in entering the computer game industry, at what Wright
calls “the world’s most important pizza party.” Together
they formed Maxis the next year in Orinda, California.
SimCity (1989) was a hit and has been credited as one of
the most influential computer games ever made. Wright
himself has been widely featured in several computer
magazines—particularly PC Gamer, which has listed
Wright in its annual ‘Game Gods’ feature, alongside such
notables as Roberta Williams and Peter Molyneux.
Following the success of SimCity, Wright
designed SimEarth (1990) and SimAnt (1991). He codesigned
SimCity 2000 (1993) with Fred Haslam and
in the meantime Maxis produced other “Sim” games.
Wright’s next game was SimCopter (1996). Although
none of these games were as successful as SimCity, they
further cemented Wright’s reputation as a designer of
“software toys”—games that cannot be won or lost. In 1992,
Wright and his family moved to Orinda, California.
Wright has a great interest in complex adaptive
systems and most of his games have been based around
them or books that describe them (SimAnt: E.O. Wilson’s
The Ants, SimEarth: James Lovelock’s Gaia Theory, SimCity:
Jay Forrester’s Urban Dynamics and World Dynamics, Spore:
Drake’s Equation and The Powers of Ten) Wright’s role in the
development of the concepts from simulations to games is
to empower the players by creating what he dubs “possibility
spaces”, or simple rules and game elements that add up to a
very complex design. All Maxis, and later games that Wright
had a hand in designing, adhere to these design principles.
Maxis went public in 1995 with revenue of US$38
million. The stock reached $50 a share and then dropped
as Maxis posted a loss. Electronic Arts bought Maxis in
June 1997. Wright had been thinking about making a virtual
doll house ever since the early 1990s, similar to SimCity
but focused on individual people. Originally conceived
of as an architectural design game called Home Tactics,
Wright’s idea changed when someone suggested the player
should be rated on the quality of life experience by the
homeowners. It was a difficult idea to sell to E.A., because
already 40% of Maxis’s employees had been laid off.
When Wright took his idea to the Maxis board of
directors, Jeff Braun says, “The board looked at The Sims
and said, ‘What is this? He wants to do an interactive doll
house? The guy is out of his mind.’ ” Doll houses were for girls,
and girls didn’t play video games. Maxis gave little support
or financing for the game. Electronic Arts, which bought
Maxis in 1997, was more enthusiastic. Wright’s games are so
different from E.A.’s other releases that it was hard to imagine
the two being united in the same enterprise. But the success
of SimCity had already established Sim as a strong brand,
and E.A., which by then, fifteen years after its founding, was
becoming a Procter & Gamble-style brand-management
company, foresaw the possibility of building a Sim franchise.
E.A. published The Sims in February 2000
and it became Wright’s biggest success yet. It eventually
surpassed Myst as the best-selling computer game of all
time and spawned numerous expansion packs and other
games. He designed a massively multiplayer version
of the game called The Sims Online, which was not as
popular as the original. By November 2006, The Sims
franchise had earned E.A. more than a billion dollars.
In a presentation at the Game Developers Conference
on March 11, 2005, he announced his latest game Spore.
He used the current work on this game to demonstrate
methods that can be used to reduce the amount of content
that needs to be created by the game developers. Wright
hopes to inspire others to take risks in game creation.
As for his theories on interactive
design, Wright says the following:
“Well, one thing I’ve always really enjoyed is making
things. Out of whatever. It started with modeling as a kid,
building models. When computers came along, I started
learning programming and realizing the computer was this
great tool for making things, making models, dynamic models,
and behaviors, not just static models. I think when I started
doing games I really wanted to carry that to the next step, to
the player, so that you give the player a tool so that they can
create things. And then you give them some context for that
creation. You know, what is it, what kind of kind of world
does it live in, what’s its purpose? What are you trying to do
with this thing that you’re creating? To really put the player
in the design role. And the actual world is reactive to their
design. So they design something that the little world inside
the computer reacts to. And then they have to revisit the
design and redesign it, or tear it down and build another one,
whatever it is. So I guess what really draws me to interactive
entertainment and the thing that I try to keep focused on is
enabling the creativity of the player. Giving them a pretty large
solution space to solve the problem within the game. So the
game represents this problem landscape. Most games have
small solution landscapes, so there’s one possible solution and
one way to solve it. Other games, the games that tend to be
more creative, have a much larger solution space, so you can
potentially solve this problem in a way that nobody else has. If
you’re building a solution, how large that solution space is gives
the player a much stronger feeling of empathy. If they know
that what they’ve done is unique to them, they tend to care for
it a lot more. I think that’s the direction I tend to come from.”
Wright believes that simulations as games
can be used to improve education by teaching
children how to learn. In his own words:
“The problem with our education system is we’ve
taken this kind of narrow, reductionist, Aristotelian approach
to what learning is. It’s not designed for experimenting
with complex systems and navigating your way through
them in an intuitive way, which is what games teach. It’s not
really designed for failure, which is also something games
teach. I mean, I think that failure is a better teacher than
success. Trial and error, reverse-engineering stuff in your
mind—all the ways that kids interact with games—that’s
the kind of thinking schools should be teaching. And I
would argue that as the world becomes more complex, and
as outcomes become less about success or failure, games
are better at preparing you. The education system is going
to realize this sooner or later. It’s starting. Teachers are
entering the system who grew up playing games. They’re
going to want to engage with the kids using games.”
Wright will appear as a character in the video game
Mr. T, where he will team up with Mr. T to fight Nazis.
Wright was given a “Lifetime Achievement
Award” at the Game Developers Choice Awards in 2001.
In 2002, he became the fifth person to be inducted into the
Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences’ Hall of Fame.
Until 2006, he was the only person to have been honored
this way by both of these industry organizations. In 2007
the British Academy of Film and Television Arts awarded
him a fellowship, the first given to a game designer.
He has been called one of the most important
people in gaming, technology, and entertainment by
publications such as Entertainment Weekly, Time, PC Gamer,
Discover and GameSpy. Wright was also awarded the PC
Magazine Lifetime Achievement Award in January 2005.
In 1980, along with co-driver and race organizer
Rick Doherty, Wright participated in the U.S. Express,
a cross-country race that was the predecessor to The
Cannonball Run. Wright and Doherty drove a specially
outfitted Mazda RX-7 from Brooklyn, New York to Santa
Monica, California in 33:39, winning the illegal race. Wright
only competed once in the race, which continued until 1983.
Since 2003, in his spare time, Wright has collected
leftovers from the Soviet space program, “including a
100-pound hatch from a space shuttle, a seat from a
Soyuz… control panels from the Mir”, and the control
console of the Soyuz 23, as well as dolls, dice, and
fossils. During E3 2004 he passed off an old lapel pin
commemorating the Soviet space program to a reporter.
“I’m uncollecting. I buy collections on eBay, and I
disperse them out to people again. I have to be like an entropic
force to collectors, otherwise all of this stuff will get sorted.”
He once built competitive robots for BattleBots
with his daughter, but no longer does so. As of November
2006, Wright still had remnant bits of machined metal left
over from his BattleBots days strewn about the garage of his
Oakland home. Wright was a former Robot Wars champion
in the Berkeley-based robotics workshop, the Stupid Fun
Club. One of Wright’s bots, designed with the help of Wright’s
daughter Cassidy, “Kitty Puff Puff ”, fought against its
opponents by sticking a roll of gauze onto its armature and
circling around them, encapsulating them and denying them
movement. The technique, cocooning, was eventually banned.
Following his work in BattleBots, he has taken
steps into the field of human-robot interactions.
“We build these robots and we take them down to
Berkeley and study the interactions that people have with
the robots,” says Wright. “We built this newer one that has a
rapid-fire pingpong cannon. It will fire about 10 per second.
So we give people this plastic bat and we say, ‘It’s set up to
play baseball. Do you want to play baseball? It’s going to
shoot a little ball and you try to hit it.’ And all of a sudden
it’s like da-da-da-da, and it’s pelting them with balls.”
After building his reputation as one of the most
important game designers in the world, Wright in 2009
left Maxis, the Electronic Arts owned studio he founded.
His first post-E.A. venture was the Stupid Fun Club.
In October 2010, Current TV announced that
Will Wright will produce a new show for the network. The
program, entitled Bar Karma, began airing in February 2011.
In October 2011, Will Wright became
a member of the Board of Directors of Linden
Lab, the creators of Second Life.
JOSHUA WURMAN
I grew up in Pennsylvania, bereft of any really meaningful
opportunities to experience severe weather, hurricanes, even
real deep snow. As a youth, I tried to impress friends and
girls with my home weather station and insect collection.
These efforts, among other factors, kept me well out of the
running for homecoming king. Naturally, I moved on to a
party school, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
to search for a better social life. But hating schoolwork, I
rushed through it, earning my MS at only 21. Then after some
aimless additional years in school I dropped out for three
years, working for the Air Force on nuclear winter computer
simulations and other cheery subjects. Returning to MIT,
I earned my Doctorate and moved to Colorado to work at
the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) on
bistatic radar networks, a new type of weather radar system
that I had invented. However, after seeing real High Plains
thunderstorms close up, and tornadoes, I got distracted
and conceived of building a network of big, fast scanning
radars that could drive right up to tornadoes and fires, inside
hurricanes, and into other nice weather. The DOW program
was born, and I moved down to Oklahoma to be a professor
for a few years, chase tornadoes and hurricanes, file patents,
teach and write papers. In the middle of this, I traveled to Asia
on a research project and met my wife operating a weather
radar on an island off the coast of Hong Kong and conned
her into believing that Oklahoma was just like Hong Kong.
After receiving tenure and the implied lifetime sentence
at the university, I did the sensible thing: I quit and moved
back to Boulder and founded my own non-profit research
institution, the Center for Severe Weather Research (CSWR).
My wife and I run CSWR, manage the DOWs as National
Science Foundation (NSF) Facilities, and conduct research
programs such as the VORTEX2 study and hurricane studies.
We have four young children who, so far, show no unhealthy
obsessive interests in tornadoes, hurricanes or radars. I’ve just
finished the VORTEX2 tornado study (http://vortex2.org),
which is the largest tornado research mission ever, funded
mostly by NSF, employing about 120 scientists and crew in
50 vehicles. We had 11 radars, 4 balloon trucks, UAVs, 40
deployable instruments, 13 mobile mesonets, photogrammetry
and microphysics teams, damage survey teams, basically
more of anything that used to study tornadoes scientifically.
Just imagine the lines for fuel and bathrooms in smalltown
gas stations. During WWW, I’ll be keeping a nervous
eye out for any hurricanes threatening to make landfall.
If a hurricane looms, I’ll be leading my team into the eye.

RICHARD SAUL WURMAN
Described by Fortune magazine as an “intellectual hedonist”
with a “hummingbird mind,” Richard Saul Wurman
seeks ways to make the complex clear. Recognizing at
an early age that his ignorance is his greatest asset, he
has made it his mission to sort through the abundance
of information that is available on every topic, and
design the techniques to make it understandable.
In doing so he has continually sought to put himself
in the presence of extraordinary people, including (all now
all deceased), Francis Crick, Richard Feynman, Jonas Salk,
Eva Zeisel, Louis I. Kahn, Charles Eames, Frank Stanton and
Schuyler van Renssalaer Cammann, and Arnold Toynbee.
There are many others. The only two bosses he had who
didn’t fire him were Lou Kahn and Charlie Eames.
As a result, Wurman has had many lives: as an author
(83 books); FAIA Architect, 13-year partner in Murphy Levy
Wurman Architects; cartographer (mapped 1/3 of the Mayan
city of Tikal and current project 19.20.21.); teacher (Cambridge
University, England; Princeton; Washington University,
St. Louis; University of Southern California; University of
California Los Angeles; City College of New York, and Dean,
Cal Poly School of Design); urban designer (recipient of MIT’s
Kevin Lynch award in urban design); graphic designer (AIGA
Gold Medal, membership in AGI and inducted into the Art
Directors Hall of Fame); information theorist (Information
Anxiety, Follow the Yellow Brick Road) and in medicine (6
books on healthcare and creator and chairman of TEDMED,
1995–2010), and as a conference convener. The path of this
journey has been paved by one surface: his curiosity.
The acknowledged father of Information
Architecture, Wurman has written, designed and published 83
books on a range of topics, while creating conferences and new
mapping projects. All contribute to a greater understanding of
complex information. They spring from his particular brand
of innovation: doing the opposite of what is rote or expected.
Wurman published his first two books in 1962. The
first featured models of 50 world cities all constructed on a
uniform scale, the other was the first book to be written on
Louis Kahn. In 1967 he co-authored the first comparative
statistical atlas of major American cities. His latest book is
called 33: Understanding Change & the Change in Understanding.
It chronicles the adventures and musings of the eccentric main
character, the Commissioner of Curiosity and Imagination.
Wurman created the ACCESS city guides, using
graphics and logical editorial organization to make places such
as New York, Tokyo, Rome, Paris and London understandable
to visitors. Other volumes he created focus on topics such as
baseball, football and the 1984 Olympics, the latter with over
with 3.2 million copies sold. His road atlases employed similar
techniques that elucidate U.S. geography and transportation
networks. In addition he completed many one-off projects,
such as his book Twin Peaks Access, which he co-authored
with David Lynch. Several of his books are in the permanent
collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York.
Wurman began his career in conferences in 1972
when he chaired the International Design Conference
in Aspen. He then co-chaired the first Federal Design
Assembly in 1973 and the national AIA Conference in 1976.
With each of these he changed the fundamentals of how
gatherings were run. All these helped his creative molding
of TED, TEDMED, and eg, the Entertainment Gathering.
Wurman created the TED conference in 1984,
which he chaired through the 2002 meeting. TED brings
together many of America’s clearest thinkers in the fields
of technology, entertainment and design. He created the
eg conference in 2006 and the TEDMED conference in
1995, which he chaired through 2010. Other conferences
he created and chaired include California 101, TEDSELL,
TEDNYC, TED4Kobe in Japan and TEDCity in Toronto.
Now in 77, Wurman continues to quell his restlessness
with a series of new projects. The WWW Conference will be an
active gathering of some of the brightest thinkers of our time
discussing the complexity of emerging patterns on our planet
in improvised conversation – intellectual jazz. In partnership
with Esri and @radical.media, 19.20.21. is a major cartographic
initiative that endeavors to standardize a methodology for
comparative urban data. His Urban Observatory project aims
to establish, for the first time ever, a series of live and changing
electronically connected urban observatories around the world.
Wurman received both his B.Arch. and M.Arch.
degrees with highest honors from the University of
Pennsylvania in 1959. While there, he was awarded the
Arthur Spayd Brooks Gold Medal, the Thornton Oakley
Award for Achievement in Creative Art, 2 Chandler grants
and two graduate fellowships. He has also been awarded a
Guggenheim Fellowship in Architecture and Design, three
honorary doctorates, two Graham Fellowships and numerous
grants from the National Endowment for the Arts. He is the
2012 Lifetime Achievement Award recipient given by The
Smithsonian Cooper-Hewitt National Design museum. He was
recently given the Gold Medal for Outstanding Contribution to
Public Discourse by Trinity College Dublin, an honor shared in
the past by Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Aung San Suu Kyi.
Wurman currently lives in Newport, RI
with his wife, novelist Gloria Nagy, and their three
yellow Labradors, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. They
have four children and six grandchildren.
MEMO TO PARTICIPANTS
re: CONVERSATIONS
As most of you are aware, I created TED in 1984 and
chaired it through 2002. During that time I created
TEDMED in 1995 and the eg Conference in 2006. For
all those meetings I developed an 18-minute talk and
a series of rules called the TED Commandments.
Several of you have asked ‘well what are the new
guidelines as they relate to the WWW Conference’?
1 Participants have all been sent the schedule
listing the person with whom they have
been paired, attached again below.
2 If you go to the participants page on the web
site, you can click on that person’s name and link
to his or her biographical information.
3 I have developed a list of 30 different premises or
postulations that will begin you in improvised conversation.
4 I have tried this and it works.
5 You will be facing each other on comfortable
couches and not the audience.
6 There will be approximately 150 people in the
audience, which will be comprised of fellow participants,
guests and individuals invited by sponsors.
7 Absolutely no preparation is necessary.
8 You will not be selling a book, charity, project or religion.
9 As long as the conversation holds my attention and
my perceived attention of the audience, you will be in
conversation. At the conclusion, I will with reasonable
politeness call up the next two individuals.
10 If the conversation is fabulous but goes on so long
as to potentially cause us to miss our lunch, I will also
end it and the two of you can continue it over lunch.
11 There will be no lectern but there will be a side
table for a cup of coffee or glass of water.
12 There is no strict time schedule but I will
attempt to keep the order of the final schedule.
13 On occasion I might take the liberty part way into
a given conversation to add a third person, another
participant or simply another member of the audience,
whom I know can add constructively to the conversation.
14 The entire meeting will be filmed as inconspicuously
as possible from the far left and right of the stage
and with one small camera in the audience.
15 At this moment there are no plans to live-stream
any of the conference. There will be an app with access
to a server to hold the conversations. It is planned that
this will be available on 1 December and will include a
running line of translation into several languages.
16 The app will also contain a large body of curated
personal information about you. Further explanation
about this will come to you next week.
17 I have personally worked out the breaks, lunches and
dinners and I believe they will be of the highest quality and in
rooms that will delight you, both at Esri and at The Mission Inn.
18 Obviously there is a lot of risk about the
conversations, particularly the quality, spontaneity,
clarity, improvisation and surprise.
19 The goal is to find some threads that have not
emerged before as you speak with your partner,
which will encapsulate a type of honesty and a nonpredicted
path in response to each other.
20 This has happened in my several tests of this idea.
21 To repeat, I am endeavoring to make the filming,
ambiance, location and lack of press all focus on
your comfort and the quality of your experience.
This above all is my concern and my goal.
22 Improvised conversation in this manner is a new
form but a wonderful conversation is perhaps the
oldest human media for creative discourse. So in
that sense, this is a great leap backwards.
23 It will be a wonderful salon and an absolutely
immersive experience with extraordinary people.
MEMO TO PARTICIPANTS
re: FUTURE APP
I trust each of you has read my 24-point memo called
WWW Conference Conversation Guidelines with 24 points
that I believe give the spirit of the meeting itself. I’ve
had excellent response from many of you as well as
from sponsors and attendees. This memo addresses the
outcome of the conference, in other words, what I do with
the filming of these approximately 30 conversations.
1 It will be filmed in black and white by a team directed
by Jon Kamen and Sidney Beaumont of @radical.media,
and John Halloran of John Halloran Associates.
2 It will be unedited. There will be a camera on
each of the individuals in conversation, as well as a
long camera on the three of us sitting on stage.
3 Michael Smolens and David Orban of dotSUB will
then translate it into perhaps 10 languages and add a
running translation in English, which will address the
language needs of 90% plus of the world’s population.
4 This will live on a server and be accessed by
an app that has a release date at this juncture of 1
December. The app will also contain a great deal of
additional information on each of the presenters.
5 The additional curated stuff—photos, videos,
and links is what this memo is focused on.
6 Scrollmotion has already done two extraordinary
versions of the organization and design of this app. They
have offices in San Diego and New York City.
7 There will be a series of unique videos on which I will
comment later, made where appropriate of you in situ.
8 The video of the entire conference of course can
be accessed by pairings of speakers from a list and
viewed as you would at the conference showing
individuals in improvised conversation. However, one
could also double click on a single name and go into
this visual biography of each of the participants.
9 The demo can be found at
http://vimeo.com/user7992663/review/47187545/29ddc526f0
The password is WWW. It shows an extremely brief version of
C. K. Williams, the Pulitzer Prize winning poet, in which you
cannot only see a bio, for which we will ask a major expansion,
but also photographs of the covers of a few of his 11 books. We
would also like to have all of his books, which you will be able
to order form the app, some outtake videos, not from the
conference but from other sources that we would identify, and
that you will identify, as well as, in the case of C. K. Williams,
many pages, a few shown here, of his personally edited
writings of his poetry—something you can’t find on YouTube,
a presentation or in a book, or perhaps anywhere but this app.
10 The idea of this app is to get a behind the scenes,
behind the curtain, personalized journey through
each individual, which will also have a list of links
to suggested articles, reviews, YouTubes and other
material that will fill out this visual biography.
11 This is an important point: if you Google Richard
Wurman, you come up with perhaps 450,000 citations.
The number changes daily. This would amount to 40,000+
pages, which of course nobody looks at. Basically it’s junk
big data, and people mostly focus on one article and a
wikipedia entry. The attempt here is to have the first primitive
development of a platform for beginning to assuage some
curiosity in the beginning of looking at a visual biography of
at least these 50 people. If the platform works it’s scalable.
That’s the idea of a new modality. If it works for people
perhaps it will work for healthcare and other subjects.
12 I’m putting together a team of people consisting of Ali
Smolens, who will help curate some of the materials for
many of you, Paul Kandarian, a magazine writer friend
of mine from Rhode Island, and three others plus Blaise
Zerega, CEO of FORA.tv who has agreed to make some
original, simple videos such as Frank Gehry walking around
his office showing and discussing models of buildings that
he has not built, or variations of for instance the 8 Spruce
Street tower in New York or hopefully Craig Venter’s
laboratories in a walk-through, E.O. Wilson’s offices, etc. etc.
13 So this is a request for the following: please start thinking
about the stuff that you’ve never shown: everything from
baby pictures, pictures of your pets, pictures of your office,
pictures of your home, things that make you real. Multiple
photographs of yourself, perhaps a strip of photographs of
you taken in a photo booth at an amusement park that you
have in a drawer. Writings that you’ve done that show your
edits, something that shows you’re real, human, and shows
your process. Pictures of your laboratories. Agree to have
somebody do a 5- or 10-minute walk through with you in your
office or your lab or your place of work or your architectural
studio. Videos or DVDs that for example I know Moshe
Safdie has which he makes to describe what a building will
look like in computer graphics to a client. I know he has a
fantastic one of an apartment house in Singapore. And I’m
sure Bjarke has similar things that he generally does not
release. Covers of books about you, covers of books by you. A
list of articles that you think critically describes you and links
to YouTubes or other videos or other citations that you think
and you have curated yourself that make you particularly
interesting, not the half a million available on line. Julie
Taymor most have lots of stuff as well as David Blaine.
14 We hope to have this put together, along with the
entire conference, for release by 1 December and promote
it immediately after Thanksgiving with the help of
IDG, Flipboard (Mike McCue), Esri, IIR and others. I
am going to ask for your cooperation out in Redlands at
the conference and I will have additional copies of this
and the other memo to give you when you register.
15 Attached are technical specifications for those of
you who understand them yourself. Otherwise please
show them to somebody in your office under the age of
30 who automatically understands them, who could help
us translate whatever you send us in a usable format. I
don’t understand them myself but I’m sure some of you
have a better handle on this than I do. These will make
the process smooth and efficient and within budget.

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030579.txt,"Bizarrely, perhaps, I have gotten to know Jeffrey and Ghislaine far better after my piece than before it. I kept
running into both of them, separately, at parties. Jeffrey is not a social animal so he usually has a couple of
young women with him who stand two feet behind him, as if serving a monarch. “Do they speak?” I remember
asking him once, nodding at his lookalike blondes. He laughed. “Not like you, Vicky,” was his riposte.

I remembered that when we’d once discussed math—in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed I
hadn’t studied math since I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a
package at home via messenger. It was a book: “Math for idiots.”

So he is not without humor, even though he doesn’t drink or smoke, and hates restaurants.

“Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects,” newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He
was certainly preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few
moments in his company and you know this to be true.

When I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that
“Andy”—as Jeffrey calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his
strange title is. Because if one thing’s for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what
he’s talking about far more than “Andy” does. Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other
financiers hang out with him.

And Ghislaine?
Full disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It’s almost impossible not to.

She is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I’ve spent hours
talking to her about the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is
curious. She has spent weeks at the bottom of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent
mea DVD of the fish there. Her rolodex would blow away almost anyone else’s I can think of—probably even
Rupert Murdochs’. She is very well-read and can talk about most things for hours. She is passionate about Bill
Clinton with whom she is close friends.

Yet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-
Platero, (known fondly to her close friends as “the Tennis Goddess”) Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When
it comes down to things she really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her
vulnerability.

And that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey.

“He saved her,” I remember a close friend of mine telling me. “When her father died, she was a wreck;
inconsolable. And then Jeffrey took her in. She’s never forgotten that—and never will.”

In many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect
replacement for her father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his
sexual pecadillos, but then Ghislaine’s father was not without his oddities. After all, 1t was he who died leaving
a massive “black hole” he’d fraudulently created. To Ghislaine, Jeffrey’s habits may not have seemed that
strange.

In fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful
people in the end either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl issues,
and moved countries to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You don’t
tend to get to the top by being the world’s most balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett didn’t
quite manage a normal life—whatever that is. He had a second “wife” for many years whose existence he has
been open about.

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016868.txt,"And who are the “us”? Who should deem “such decisions . . . acceptable”? Even
if future powers decide to help humans survive and flourish, how will we find meaning
and purpose in our lives if we aren’t needed for anything?

The debate about the societal impact of AI has changed dramatically in the last
few years. In 2014, what little public talk there was of AI risk tended to be dismissed as
Luddite scaremongering, for one of two logically incompatible reasons:

(1) AGI was overhyped and wouldn’t happen for at least another century.

(2) AGI would probably happen sooner but was virtually guaranteed to be
beneficial.

Today, talk of AI’s societal impact is everywhere, and work on AI safety and AI
ethics has moved into companies, universities, and academic conferences. The
controversial position on AI safety research is no longer to advocate for it but to dismiss
it. Whereas the open letter that emerged from the 2015 Puerto Rico AI conference (and
helped mainstream AI safety) spoke only in vague terms about the importance of keeping
AI beneficial, the 2017 Asilomar AI Principles (see below) had real teeth: They explicitly
mention recursive self-improvement, superintelligence, and existential risk, and were
signed by AI industry leaders and over a thousand AI researchers from around the world.

Nonetheless, most discussion is limited to the near-term impact of narrow AI and
the broader community pays only limited attention to the dramatic transformations that
AGI may soon bring to life on Earth. Why?

Why we’re rushing to make ourselves obsolete, and why we avoid talking about it

First of all, there’s simple economics. Whenever we figure out how to make another type
of human work obsolete by building machines that do it better and cheaper, most of
society gains: Those who build and use the machines make profits, and consumers get
more affordable products. This will be as true of future investor AGIs and scientist AGIs
as it was of weaving machines, excavators, and industrial robots. In the past, displaced
workers usually found new jobs, but this basic economic incentive will remain even if
that is no longer the case. The existence of affordable AGI means, by definition,

that all jobs can be done more cheaply by machines, so anyone claiming that “people will
always find new well-paying jobs” is in effect claiming that AI researchers will fail to
build AGI.

Second, Homo sapiens is by nature curious, which will motivate the scientific
quest for understanding intelligence and developing AGI even without economic
incentives. Although curiosity is one of the most celebrated human attributes, it can
cause problems when it fosters technology we haven’t yet learned how to manage wisely.
Sheer scientific curiosity without profit motive contributed to the discovery of nuclear
weapons and tools for engineering pandemics, so it’s not unthinkable that the old adage
“Curiosity killed the cat” will turn out to apply to the human species as well.

Third, we’re mortal. This explains the near unanimous support for developing
new technologies that help us live longer, healthier lives, which strongly motivates
current AI research. AGI can clearly aid medical research even more. Some thinkers
even aspire to near immortality via cyborgization or uploading.

We’re thus on the slippery slope toward AGI, with strong incentives to keep
sliding downward, even though the consequence will by definition be our economic
obsolescence. We will no longer be needed for anything, because all jobs can be done

There were also numbers for the influential Rothschild family, including Sir Evelyn de Rothschild and his
daughter Hannah. Last night she said: ‘I have no idea why Mr Epstein would have my numbers as I don’t

know him.’

A print-out of the contacts book came to light after it was subpoenaed for use in a civil case against the

financier by one of the young girls he employed as a masseuse.
The list included 16 numbers for Prince Andrew under his title The Duke of York.

His ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, was entered under the Duchess of York and there were 18 numbers for her

and her associates as well as an email address.

The ‘book’ also appeared to contain contacts of Epstein’s former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, including

her extended family, friends and brief acquaintances.

One prominent journalist, who asked not to be named, was horrified to discover her parents’ details were
listed. She said: ‘I knew Ghislaine once but that was more than 20 years ago. To be honest
I find it really spooky.’

Artist Kate Stracher was also baffled by her inclusion.

She said: ‘Ghislaine and I were at Oxford together but I haven’t seen her since. I’m not at all glamorous

and not at all well-connected. I definitely shouldn’t be there.’

Others have had only the briefest of meetings. Philippe Amon, a Swiss industrialist, said: ‘I think I came
across Epstein some years ago in New York but I honestly don’t think I would recognise him walking by in

the street.’

A spokesman for Richard Branson said: “Jeffrey Epstein has the island next door to Necker but Richard

has literally only met him once for about five minutes. That’s the extent of it.’
Those who clearly do have a connection are, perhaps unsurprisingly, less keen to talk about it.

Lisa Walker is listed alongside her friend Caroline Stanbury, a former girlfriend of Prince Andrew.

She said: ‘I met Epstein with Caroline.’

Asked if Prince Andrew was also present, Miss Walker said: ‘I wish I could help but I don’t think I should

say any more.’

Representing Implicit Knowledge via Hypergraphs

14.1 Introduction

Explicit knowledge is easy to write about and talk about; implicit knowledge is equally impor-
tant, but tends to get less attention in discussions of AI and psychology, simply because we don’t
have as good a vocabulary for describing it, nor as good a collection of methods for measuring
it. One way to deal with this problem is to describe implicit knowledge using language and
methods typically reserved for explicit knowledge. This might seem intrinsically non-workable,
but we argue that it actually makes a lot of sense. The same sort of networks that a system like
CogPrime uses to represent knowledge explicitly, can also be used to represent the emergent
knowledge that implicitly exists in an intelligent system’s complex structures and dynamics.

We've noted that CogPrime uses an explicit representation of knowledge in terms of weighted
labeled hypergraphs; and also uses other more neural net like mechanisms (e.g. the economic
attention allocation network subsystem) to represent knowledge globally and implicitly. Cog-
Prime combines these two sorts of representation according to the principle we have called
glocality. In this chapter we pursue glocality a bit further — describing a means by which even
implicitly represented knowledge can be modeled using weighted labeled hypergraphs similar to
the ones used explicitly in CogPrime. This is conceptually important, in terms of making clear
the fundamental similarities and differences between implicit and explicit knowledge represen-
tation; and it is also pragmatically meaningful due to its relevance to the CogPrime methods
described in Chapter 42 of Part 2 that transform implicit into explicit knowledge.

To avoid confusion with CogPrime’s explicit knowledge representation, we will refer to the
hypergraphs in this chapter as composed of Vertices and Edges rather than Nodes and Links. In
prior publications we have referred to derived or emergent hypergraphs of the sort described
here using the acronym SMEPH, which stands for Self-Modifying, Evolving Probabilistic Hy-
pergraphs.

14.2 Key Vertex and Edge Types

We begin by introducing a particular collection of Vertex and Edge types, to be used in modeling
the internal structures of intelligent systems.
The key SMEPH Vertex types are

low-level intelligence could never address the real need for Israel: to ensure we
had early warning if Syria or Lebanon, Jordan or Egypt, were preparing to go to
war against us.

He began toying with the idea of training a small force of Israeli soldiers to
go on cross-border intelligence missions. The initial response from the kirya —
military headquarters in Tel Aviv — was so frustrating that anyone else would
have given up. None of the generals saw any reason to believe his scheme
would work. But the real obstacle was their continuing trauma over what had
happened the last time Israeli soldiers crossed the border on an intelligence
mission. It had happened in 1954, and it ended in a failure even more serious
than Rotem. The target was the Golan Heights, inside Syria. The special
technology unit attached to military intelligence had developed a bugging
device designed to be placed on a telephone pole on the Golan. The task of
installing it was given to the most decorated, and respected, commando unit in
the army: Company A in Sharon’s paratroop battalion, led by its commander,
Meir Har-Zion.

On a spring night in 1954, Har-Zion led his team onto the Golan. They
rigged the bugging unit to the telephone pole, buried the bulky transmitter and
made their way back. And it worked. Israeli intelligence could listen in to
military communications on the Heights. The hitch as that the batteries had to
be replaced every few weeks. Several more times, Meir and his men sneaked
back into Syria to keep the bug working. But as commander of Company A,
Meir was a key part of Israel’s anti-fedayeen operations. The last thing Moshe
Dayan wanted to risk was seeing him captured while trying to replace a few
batteries. So he shifted the task to a regular unit from the Golani Brigade.

In December 1954, a handover mission was organized. Three men from
Company A, including one of Meir’s sergeants, joined three from the Golani
Brigade. But they didn’t even hold a joint exercise before setting off. There was
also a lack of clarity about who was in charge. Though the Golani commander
was nominally the senior officer, only the Company A men had any first-hand
experience of this kind of mission. A half-mile onto the Heights, they were
intercepted by a Syrian soldiers. If this had been a Company A operation, the
response would have been automatic. They would have wheeled, opened fire
and attacked. But when the Syrians ordered the Golanis to drop their weapons,
one of them did, and the Company A men followed suit. They were all taken to
Damascus, held in solitary confinement, beaten and tortured.

The End of Time Management

» ILLUSIONS AND ITALIANS

Perfection is not when there is no more to add, but no more to take away.

— ANTOINE DE SAINT-EXUPERY, pioneer of international postal flight and author of Le Petit
Prince (The Little Prince)

It is vain to do with more what can be done with less.
— WILLIAM OF OCCAM (1300-1350), originator of “Occam’s Razor”

J ust a few words on time management: Forget all about it.

In the strictest sense, you shouldn’t be trying to do more in each day, trying to fill every second with a
work fidget of some type. It took me a long time to figure this out. I used to be very fond of the results-
by-volume approach.

Being busy is most often used as a guise for avoiding the few critically important but uncomfortable
actions. The options are almost limitless for creating “busyness”: You could call a few hundred
unqualified sales leads, reorganize your Outlook contacts, walk across the office to request documents
you don’t really need, or fuss with your BlackBerry for a few hours when you should be prioritizing.

In fact, if you want to move up the ladder in most of corporate America, and assuming they don’t
really check what you are doing (let’s be honest), just run around the office holding a cell phone to your
head and carrying papers. Now, that is one busy employee! Give them a raise. Unfortunately for the NR,
this behavior won’t get you out of the office or put you on an airplane to Brazil. Bad dog. Hit yourself
with a newspaper and cut it out.

After all, there is a far better option, and it will do more than simply increase your results—it will
multiply them. Believe it or not, it is not only possible to accomplish more by doing less, it is mandatory.

Enter the world of elimination.

discussion of the tax law itself. The Court
judged DOMA for its impact on “over
1,000 federal statutes and the whole
realm of federal regulations.” Very little
was said specifically about federal tax law
beyond that. Nevertheless, the federal tax
law is clearly among those “federal stat-
utes and regulations” impacted most di-
rectly by the Supreme Court’ holding.

IMPACT. Same-sex couples who were mar-
ried under state law for years prior to 2013
now need to decide whether to amend those
prior-year returns still open under the Codes
statute of limitations, to reflect a change
from unmarried to married filing status.
Same-sex married couples also should con-
sider updating their estate plans, based upon
the estate and gift tax impact of Windsor.

INCOME TAX BENEFITS
AND DISADVANTAGES

Because of the Supreme Court's decision, the
same tax benefits and disadvantages faced by
just-married, opposite-sex couples—in chang-
ing from filing as separate, unmarried indi-
viduals to filing as married filing jointly (or
married filing separately)—are now shared by
same-sex married couples. Likewise, however,
those same-sex couples not married under
state law continue to be subject to the same
disadvantages and benefits, and face many of
the same strategic decisions, as unmarried het-
erosexual couples under the federal tax law.

CAUTION. As mentioned, above, reso-
lution is pending on the issue of whether
recognition or non-recognition of a same-
sex marriage in the State in which the
same-sex couple currently reside controls
whether the IRS will treat the couple as
married for federal tax purposes. Most
federal agencies have defined marriage in
the past based on a couple’ residency and
not where they were married.

FILING STATUS

A taxpayer's filing status depends in large
part—if not exclusively in most cases—on

the taxpayer’s marital status. Taxpayers may
be single, surviving spouse, head of house-
hold, married filing joint returns, or married
filing separately. Filing status, in turn, deter-
mines the right to many tax benefits, both in
terms of access and amount. Income tax rate
bracket levels, the standard deduction, per-
sonal exemptions, and the adjusted gross in-
come (AGI) amounts at which many tax ben-
efits “phaseout” all hinge upon filing status.

Joint Return Status. Because of the Supreme
Courts Windsor decision, same-sex couples who
currently are married under state law are presum-
ably now also barred for federal tax purposes from
filing separate returns as unmarried (or as head of
household, in most cases); they must file either
jointly or married filing separately for 2013 (un-
less they are divorced or have a final separation
agreement in place by the end of 2013). The
general rule that has always applied to filing sta-
tus now presumably applies to same-sex married
status as well: an individual’s filing status is de-
termined for the entire year based upon marital
status on December 31* of that year. The IRS is
expected to issue guidance in this area.

IMPACT. Leading up to the Supreme
Courts decision, many same-sex couples
filed protective income tax refund claims
using married filing jointly status. A pro-
tective refund claim is a claim filed to
protect the taxpayers right to a potential
refund based on a contingent event for
a taxable period for which the period of
limitations is about to expire. Now that
the Supreme Courts decision is out, full
refund claims, rather than protective
claims, should be filed going forward.

COMMENT. Under current rules, a tax-
payer can sign a joint return if his or her
spouse is serving in a combat zone. In other
limited cases where one spouse cannot sign
the joint return, such as because of injury or
illness, the other spouse may sign the return
and attach a statement explaining why the
spouse was unable to sign. Same-sex couples
who are married under state law are now

presumably allowed these signing benefits.

COMMENT. Because same-sex marriage
is relatively new, the tax implications

of divorce of a same-sex couple are only
starting to manifest themselves.

The Marriage Penalty. Same-sex married
couples who have been denied joint re-
turn status under the federal tax laws prior
to the Supreme Court's Windsor decision
now need to investigate the effect of joint
return status, both for returns that will be
filed in the future and for prior year returns
still open within the statute of limitations
refund-claim period (generally, but not al-
ways, three years from filing — see this Brief-
ing, below, for a discussion of this deadline).

The benefits of filing a joint return may
not always be greater than filing separately
as unmarried individuals. Both differences
in tax rate bracket amounts and a variety of
income floors and thresholds used to deter-
mine the right to certain tax breaks come
into play in determining whether some
same-sex couples were better off, income
tax-wise, before the Supreme Court’s deci-
sion; and what they should do now.

IMPACT. Individuals in a relationship
who are not married and who each re-
alize approximately the same level of

‘The Supreme Court struck down Section
3 of DOMA, which defined marriage as
a legal union between one man and one
woman as husband and wife and de-
fined spouse as only a person of the op-
posite sex who is a husband or wife. The
Supreme Court did not strike down Sec-
tion 2 of DOMA, which provides that
no state, territory or possession of the
United States shall be required to give
effect to any marriage between persons
of the same sex under the laws of any
other such jurisdiction or to any right
or claim arising from such relationship.
Section 2 was not challenged and, there-
fore, was not at issue in Windsor.

out the website if you have a black and white book. It is an irrelevant
question to ask if my red is the same as yours, since my red against one

the eleven specifically named colors of modern English: black, blue,

behind Qatar's decision to throw an amount

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031115.txt,"strong control of the government and its high approval rating are steadily raising the chance of success. We stay overweight Japanese
equities and grow wary of the short yen trade, as capital inflows and rising growth expectations (chart of right) are ultimately bullish
for the currency. Watch next week’s BoJ meeting, led by newly appointed Governor Kuroda, for new reflationary measures.

e The Euro area economy remains in recession, while policy makers are making little effort to reverse the contraction. We monitor
signs of any large deposit flight post Cyprus over coming weeks and months to judge whether the bailout may actually be worsening
conditions in the Euro. Economic forecast momentum remains negative (chart of right). These are good reasons to underweight the
Euro area, if not all of Europe, across asset classes, against the rest of the world.

e The US, in contrast, is seeing better spending from both corporates and consumers than we could have expected post Fiscal Cliff
and sequestration. But given the huge amount of fiscal drag, which is a fact, we want to see another 1-2 months of data before
extrapolating the good news. It did support US equities in recent weeks, which continue to benefit from US corporates issuing debt to
buy their own shares and others', through M&A. This corporate rotation from debt to equities is almost exclusively a US flow, which
helps explain US equity outperformance.

e Across risk assets, we are similarly seeing huge delinking, with equities rallying greatly and commodities and credit secing no
gains (chart p. 1), very much unlike last year. Commodities are delinking as there are no growth upgrades in EM, and inflation
concerns are concentrated on two countries, UK and Japan. Credit is delinking as most investors are massively overweight credit
versus equities, as evidenced by the disparity in buying flows in 2011-12. Relevering by US corporate and the Fed debating the end of
QE are signaling that the 3-decade long rally in bonds ts likely over. Investors are starting to dollar-average away from bonds to
equities.

Fixed Income

¢ Bonds rallied again, except for Euro area peripherals, the source of this week’s market concerns. The imposition of capital controls
on Cypriot deposits is to be sure a watershed moment, but for now not one we expect to spark significant deposit withdrawals
elsewhere. Meanwhile, the most likely outcome to the Italian impasse appears to be new elections in the autumn. With seemingly little
prospect of a material rise in yields on the safest assets, we think the search for carry evident across the full gamut of asset markets
will see peripheral spreads narrow over time.

e Ten-year JGB yields have rallied to within a few bps of their all-time low, ahead of next week’s inaugural meeting for the new BoJ
leadership. We do indeed expect aggressive easing, with JGB purchases out to 30 years, but think this will be trumped by profit taking
in JGBs after the fiscal year end.

e Our latest Inflation Expectations Survey (F. Diamond, K. Gupta) was out yesterday. One interesting result is that almost 90% of
respondents believe the BoJ has less than a 50/50 shot of hitting its 2% inflation target in two years, a reflection of the formidable
challenge of sparking inflation expectations after two decades of falling prices.

Equities

e The global rally in equity markets slowed this week, but did not reverse, on continued concerns about the fallout from a poorly
executed Cyprus solution. The Euro area underperformed again, for a second week ina row. As discussed last week, we view Cyprus
as a local problem that we address by underweighting Euro area equities in a global portfolio. A potential negative feedback loop
from markets to the economy poses a serious downside risk for Euro area growth over coming months prolonging the current run of
negative economic surprises from the region.

e Japan is the region we like the most. In our mind the Japanese equity trade has further legs not only due to prospective BoJ balance
sheet expansion but more importantly due to a reform agenda to be unveiled into the summer.

e EM equities are suffering from renewed policy tightening in major EM economies such as Brazil and China. Investors have bitter
memories of previous property tightening measures in China. As within DM, we see a lot of divergences within EM and prefer to
focus on under-owned markets with good domestic demand story such as Mexico and Malaysia. See “Consensus Asset Allocation”,
Adrian Mowat and team, Mar 26th. Open overweights in Mexican and Malaysia equities vs MSCI EM.

e For long-term investors we just released our quarterly publication Trade opportunities for long term investors Mar 27. We
monetize risk premia in Value stocks via a long in S&P500 Value vs S&P500 ETFs. It appears that a five year long underperformance
of Value stocks has come to an end. We take profit on trades that monetize skew risk premia in S&P500 due to sharp contraction over
the past quarter. We continue to monetize equity risk premia via buying high dividend yield equity ETFs against USTs. Our
preference is to buy ETFs which track the S&P US Preferred stock due to its high yield, around 6%, and its high weight on Financials.

Credit

e The news flow from the Cypriot bailout continued to push spreads wider and vol higher this week, with European Financials
underperforming as creditor bail-in risks returned to the forefront. iTraxx senior and subordinated financials indices widened 20bp as
investors sought to hedge via CDS rather than sell bonds. European credit continued to underperformed US credit.

e The fact that Cypriot banks debt is only 1.3% of total liabilities was a key factor in the decision to bail-in depositors. Yet events
surrounding the banking sector restructuring also suggest that keeping senior unsecured bondholders immune from costly bail-

acknowledging that Trump was a boy from Queens yet in awe of the 7imes, nobody in the
West Wing could explain why he and Hicks would so often turn to Haberman for what
would so reliably be a mocking and hurtful portrayal. There was some feeling that Trump
was returning to scenes of past success: the 7imes might be against him, but Haberman
had worked at the New York Post for many years. “She’s very professional,” Conway said,
speaking in defense of the president and trying to justify Haberman’s extraordinary access.
But however intent he remained on getting good ink in the Zimes, the president saw
Haberman as “mean and horrible.” And yet, on a near-weekly basis, he and Hicks plotted
when next to have the Zimes come in.

OOK Ok

Kushner had his personal press operation and Bannon had his. The leaking culture had
become so open and overt—most of the time everybody could identify everybody else’s
leaks—that it was now formally staffed.

Kushner’s Office of American Innovation employed, as its spokesperson, Josh Raffel,
who, like Hicks, came out of Matthew Hiltzik’s PR shop. Raffel, a Democrat who had
been working in Hollywood, acted as Kushner and his wife’s personal rep—not least of all
because the couple felt that Spicer, owing his allegiance to Priebus, was not aggressively
representing them. This was explicit. “Josh is Jared’s Hope,” was his internal West Wing
job description.

Raffel coordinated all of Kushner and Ivanka’s personal press, though there was more
of this for Ivanka than for Kushner. But, more importantly, Raffel coordinated all of
Kushner’s substantial leaking, or, as it were, his off-the-record briefings and guidance—no
small part of it against Bannon. Kushner, who with great conviction asserted that he never
leaked, in part justified his press operation as a defense against Bannon’s press operation.

Bannon’s “person,” Alexandra Preate—a witty conservative socialite partial to
champagne—had previously represented Breitbart News and other conservative figures
like CNBC’s Larry Kudlow, and was close friends with Rebekah Mercer. In a relationship
that nobody seemed quite able to explain, she handled all of Bannon’s press “outreach”
but was not employed by the White House, although she maintained an office, or at least
an officelike presence, there. The point was clear: her client was Bannon and not the
Trump administration.

Bannon, to Jared and Ivanka’s continued alarm, had unique access to Breitbart’s
significant abilities to change the right-wing mood and focus. Bannon insisted he had cut
his ties to his former colleagues at Breitbart, but that strained everybody’s credulity—and
everybody figured nobody was supposed to believe it. Rather, everybody was supposed to
fear it.

There was, curiously, general agreement in the West Wing that Donald Trump, the

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019860.txt,"THE QUESTION ON ALL OF OUR MINDS: WHAT
IMPACT WILL THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
HAVE ON THE HEDGE FUND INDUSTRY?

BY RON S. GEFFNER AND YEHUDA BRAUNSTEIN

Reprinted with permission of Hedgeweek

With the Trump administration in the White House,
regulatory uncertainty permeates the financial
services industry. While many on Wall Street are
very excited by the Trump presidency, others are
approaching this new era with trepidation. Presi-
dent Trump is unpredictable in many ways, and the
industry eagerly awaits his actions hoping that the
financial markets do not respond negatively and
create chaos in the global marketplace.

While we should expect that the Trump administration
will aim to cut back financial regulation implemented
during the last eight years, it is unrealistic to expect
that these laws will be eliminated in their entirety.
Though the financial markets have been extremely
volatile of late and react very swiftly upon the
announcement of any meaningful global news, vari-
ous aspects of recent financial regulation have been
positive for the industry. For example, the requirement
for many investment advisers to register with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), one
of the requirements of The Dodd—Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd Frank”)
which was signed into federal law by President
Obama to be effective as of July 21, 2010, in retro-
spect, has been viewed as a positive change within
the industry. Understandably, when initially intro-
duced in 2010, many asset managers located within
the United States and abroad that were required to
register as investment advisers with the SEC as a
result of Dodd-Frank were opposed to the changes.
However, many advisers, investors and regulators
now agree that requiring a larger number of advisers
to be accountable to higher regulatory standards has
created an environment where investors and coun-
terparties have more confidence in the oversight of
those managers and the industry as a whole.

It is also important to remember that any time
the government or a regulator changes the laws,
rules or regulations, those businesses affected
incur capital and opportunity costs in connection
with analyzing the changes in law and implement-
ing operational changes to comply with the new

laws. For example, when Dodd-Frank was origi-
nally enacted, at the time of registration, those
investment advisers that were required to register
as advisers with the SEC were required to adopt
written policies and procedures and invested capi-
tal into their operations and technology to support
compliance. Therefore, we expect that caution will
be exercised before significant change is made to
avoid the various costs associated with imple-
menting change. A case in point is the new DOL
Rule (discussed earlier in this newsletter), origi-
nally set to take effect on April 10, 2017. Invest-
ment advisers impacted by the DOL Rule, have
already been forced to analyze the DOL Rule and
its impact on their businesses, and some advisers
have already begun to implement changes to their
operations and procedures. The DOL Rule has been
the subject of much debate. While some industry
experts believe that the DOL Rule is onerous and
materially increases the costs associated with
providing services to clients, supporters of the
DOL Rule believe that it is necessary to protect
investors against brokers who are unnecessarily
selling high-fee investments to their clients. On
February 3, 2017, President Trump signed a memo-
randum to delay the DOL Rule by six (6)-months.
On March 1, 2017, the DOL issued a proposed
rule, which will extend the applicability date of its
fiduciary rule, including the Best Interest Contract
Exemption, from April 10, 2017 to June 9, 2017, a
60-day delay. If the DOL Rule is ultimately modi-
fied or even eliminated, some advisers may have to
reverse their recently-implemented changes.

In conclusion, we do not believe that regulations
in the financial industry will be eliminated in their
entirety. For example, if the requirement to register
as an investment adviser with the SEC is materially
modified or no longer required, we expect that many
investment advisers would maintain their registra-
tion as it is perceived to be a competitive advantage
compared to those managers that are not registered.
While we expect the Trump administration to improve
the financial services industry by having more bal-

anced regulations, we believe that this administration
will quickly realize that there are a lot of reasonable
and sensible regulations currently in place that are
working well, and that eliminating rules wholesale
can create chaos in the financial markets and may
come at a high price to their constituents.

SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS

Because of DOMA, same-sex married cou-
ples did not have the same benefits under
Social Security that opposite-sex married
couples have enjoyed for many years. Unlike
opposite-sex couples, for example, there are
no survivor benefits for the surviving spouse
of a same-sex married couple. Also, the di-
vorced spouse of a formerly married same-
sex couple cannot not claim benefits based
on the earnings of his or her ex-spouse.

IMPACT. The Social Security Adminis-
tration (SSA) has based federal rights to
benefits on whether marital rights exist
in the couples current state of residence
rather than the state in which they were
married. The impact of Windsor on the
manner in which federal agencies will
treat Social Security benefits remains to
be sorted out.

When an individual

dies, his or her surviving spouse may be

Survivor Benefits.

eligible for Social Security benefits if the
surviving spouse is age 60 or older, age 50
or older and disabled, or any age if he or
she is caring for the decedent’s child who is
younger than age 16 or disabled and enti-
tled to Social Security benefits on the record
of the deceased individual. With DOMA
having been struck down, survivor benefits
previously available only to opposite-sex
married couples are now presumably avail-
able to same-sex married couples. The SSA
is expected to provide guidance.

Divorced Spouses. If an individual is di-
vorced, his or her ex-spouse may qualify
for Social Security benefits based on that
individual’s earnings. Generally, a divorced
spouse must have been married to the in-
dividual for at least 10 years and have been
divorced at least two years. Additionally,
the divorced spouse must be at least age
62, unmarried and ineligible for an equal
or greater benefit based on his or her own
earnings or the earnings of someone else.
‘These benefits are now presumably available
to divorced individuals who were previously
in a same-sex marriage. The SSA is expected
to provide guidance.

Death Benefits. The SSA pays a one-
time death benefit of $255 to the dece-
dent’s surviving spouse in an opposite-sex
marriage or minor child. The SSA will
presumably now pay the one-time death
benefit to the surviving spouse in a same-
sex marriage.

EFFECTIVE-DATE ISSUES

Determination of the effective date for ap-
plying the Supreme Court's holding to fed-
eral tax law is not straightforward in all cases
and will necessitate further guidance from
the IRS. Same-sex married couples who
were not considered married under federal
law prior to the Supreme Court decision
are presumably not just considered married
starting on the date of the Supreme Court’s
decision, June 26, 2013 but are considered
married retroactively to the date of their
marriage pursuant to state law. This retro-
active effective date raises a number of im-
mediate federal tax issues:

m Should same-sex couples now file
amended returns claiming joint return
status?

m Are same-sex couples now required to
amend past-year returns for joint status
even if they did better tax-wise overall
by filing separately as unmarried indi-
viduals?

m Will the IRS consider the Supreme
Court’s decision in determining marital
status when auditing prior-year returns?

Amended Joint Returns/Claims For Re-
fund. Amended returns are filed to correct
errors made on previous returns. Although
the Internal Revenue Code does not specifi-
cally permit amended returns, the IRS usu-
ally accepts them. But while the IRS’s dis-
cretion to accept or reject amended returns
has been recognized, courts have required
the IRS to accept amended returns where
its rejection of them has been found to be
arbitrary and unjust.

Limitations Period. The statute of limita-
tions for amending or auditing a return is

The court contrasted the concept of “reasonable particularity” with mere general
knowledge of an event or topic, finding that mere “prior knowledge [of a topic] . . . cannot suffice
to establish [the government’s] prior knowledge of the existence and location of the documents
relating or referring to those topics.” Id. at 326. Ultimately, the court held that “[bJecause the
government has failed to show with reasonable particularity that it knew of the existence and
location of most of the subpoenaed documents . . . Ponds’ act of production was sufficiently
testimonial to implicate his right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the
Constitution.” Id. at 316.

B. Because the Committee’s subpoena fails to demonstrate with reasonable
particularity prior knowledge of the requested documents, General Flynn’s act
of production would be testimonial in nature.

The great breadth of the Committee’s subpoena to General Flynn suggests that his act of
producing the requested documents, if they even exist, would be testimonial in nature, given
that the Committee has not demonstrated knowledge of the “existence, possession, and
authenticity of the subpoenaed documents with reasonable particularity such that the
communication inherent in the act of production can be considered a foregone conclusion.” Id.
at 324. Schedule A of the subpoena requests production of:

1. A list of all meetings between you and any Russian official or
representative of Russian business interests which took place
between June 16, 2015, and 12pm on January 20, 2017. For each
meeting listed, please include the date, location, all individuals
present, and complete copies of any notes taken by you or on your
behalf.

2. All communications records, including electronic
communications records such as e-mail or text messages, written
correspondence, and phone records, of communications that took
place between June 16, 2015, and 12pm on January 20 2017, to
which you and any Russian official or representative of Russian
business interests was a party.

3. All communications records, including electronic
communications records such as e-mail or text message, written
correspondence, and phone records, of communications related in
any way to Russia, conducted between you and members and
advisors of the Trump campaign prior to 12pm on January 20,
2017.

In sum, the subpoena demands a list of “all meetings” with “any Russian official,” “all
communication records” with “any Russian official,” and “all communication records . . . related
in any way to Russia” conducted with unnamed “members and advisors of the Trump
campaign,” that occurred over an 18-month period. The broad sweep and lack of specificity of
these demands clearly reflect that the Committee does not have specific knowledge regarding

room. It’s a young man named Brock Pierce, a former child actor, and
dotcom high flyer—a principle in a gaming company called DEN, a
notorious dotcom burnout, with its own sex scandal—who is now a leading
investor in Bitcoin. He describe himself as the “the most active investor in
the field.”

And, indeed, is the first clear explanation I actually get about Bitcoin.
It is so good that Epstein stops him and checks to see if his next appointment
is here. And seconds later, Larry Summers, the former treasury secretary and
President of Harvard, enters the dining room. Summers, off Diet Coke, digs
deep into the Sheikh’s chocolates, focuses in on the Bitcoin investor.

“Okay,” he says, after listening for a bit, “I have opportunities here.
But an additional feature of my decision problem roughly speaking is that
the worst that could happen to you is that you could lose all the money you
put into it. Whereas, I could go—I mean I don’t look that great now—but I
could go from being seen as a figure of some probity and some intelligence
to being a figure of much less intelligence and much less probity...”

“Well,” says Pierce in some dramatic understatement, “you are going
to have some low quality characters playing early in the space...”

That evening, there is a small cocktail party, which includes the
former Prime Minister of Australian, Kevin Rudd, and Thorbjern Jaglandthe
head of the Noble Peace Prize Committee, who offers an affable, but general
scathing, critique of U.S. diplomacy (and a brief defense of Obama’s Peace
Prize award) and to whom Epstein offers a ride back to Europe on his jet.

The next morning, it’s Ehud Barack, the former Israeli Prime Minister
and Israel, for breakfast. Barack is, over his omelet, able to defend both
Obama and Putin. Then Kathy Ruemmler, who has just left her job as White
House Counsel joins. She is already in the mix as a possible next attorney
general, but, in fact, will withdraw from consideration in part to work with
Epstein. [TK Ruemmler quotes... ]

Larry Summers wife, Elisa New, drops by. She teaches American
poetry at Harvard and is putting together a proposal for a series on poetry
that WGBH in Boston may produce and Epstein is advising on where she
might go for added support (he also makes mince meat of her budget).

There follows the former head of the UN Security Council, Hardeep
Purie, and then head of the central bank of Kazakhstan, Kairat Kelimbetov.

Then Nathan Myhrvold the former chief technology office at
Microsoft. Then Martin Nowak a Professor of Biology and Mathematics and
Director of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard, the institute
that Epstein has funded with $30 million. Part of Nowak’s research has to do

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

No interlocking relationships exist between the members of our Board and the board or compensation committee of any other company.

COMMUNICATIONS BY STOCKHOLDERS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Stockholders and other interested parties may contact an individual director, the lead director, the Board as a group, or a specified board
committee or group, including the non-management directors as a group, by sending regular mail to

Carvana Co.

1930 W. Rio Salado Pkwy
Tempe, AZ 85281

ATTN: Board of Directors

or by email at leaddirector@carvana.com.

Each communication should specify which director or directors the communication is addressed to, as well as the general topic of the
communication. Carvana will receive the communications and process them before forwarding them to the addressee. Carvana may also refer
communications to other departments within Carvana. Carvana generally will not forward to the directors a communication that is primarily commercial in
nature, relates to an improper or irrelevant topic, or requests general information regarding Carvana.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

Prior to our IPO, none of our directors received compensation as a director from us. We have designed our non-employee director
compensation program to achieve the following objectives:

* align directors’ interests with the long-term interests of our shareholders;
* attract and retain outstanding director candidates with diverse backgrounds and experiences; and

* recognize the substantial time commitment required to serve as a Carvana director.

The Compensation and Nominating Committee reviews the Company’s director compensation program annually. Independent directors may
not receive, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fees from us. Members of the Board who are employees of Carvana do
not receive compensation for their service on the Board. The following table presents summary information regarding the total compensation awarded to,
eamed by, and paid to our non-employee directors for the year ended December 31, 2018:

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016897.txt,"creators—for instance, a good model of the Earth’s climate should be able to predict the
consequences of a rising global temperature even if this wasn’t something considered by
the scientists who designed it. However, when it comes to understanding the human
mind, these two goals—accuracy and generalizability—have long been at odds with each
other.

At the far extreme of generalizability are rational theories of cognition. These
theories describe human behavior as a rational response to a given situation. A rational
actor strives to maximize the expected reward produced by a sequence of actions—an
idea widely used in economics precisely because it produces such generalizable
predictions about human behavior. For the same reason, rationality is the standard
assumption in inverse-reinforcement-learning models that try to make inferences from
human behavior—perhaps with the concession that humans are not perfectly rational
agents and sometimes randomly choose to act in ways unaligned with or even opposed to
their best interests.

The problem with rationality as a basis for modeling human cognition 1s that it is
not accurate. In the domain of decision making, an extensive literature—spearheaded by
the work of cognitive psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky—has
documented the ways in which people deviate from the prescriptions of rational models.
Kahneman and Tversky proposed that in many situations people instead follow simple
heuristics that allow them to reach good solutions at low cognitive cost but sometimes
result in errors. To take one of their examples, if you ask somebody to evaluate the
probability of an event, they might rely on how easy it is to generate an example of such
an event from memory, consider whether they can come up with a causal story for that
event’s occurring, or assess how similar the event is to their expectations. Each heuristic
is a reasonable strategy for avoiding complex probabilistic computations, but also results
in errors. For instance, relying on the ease of generating an event from memory as a
guide to its probability leads us to overestimate the chances of extreme (hence extremely
memorable) events such as terrorist attacks.

Heuristics provide a more accurate model of human cognition but one that is not
easily generalizable. How do we know which heuristic people might use in a particular
situation? Are there other heuristics they use that we just haven’t discovered yet?
Knowing exactly how people will behave in a new situation is a challenge: Is this
situation one in which they would generate examples from memory, come up with causal
stories, or rely on similarity?

Ultimately, what we need is a way to describe how human minds work that has
the generalizability of rationality and the accuracy of heuristics. One way to achieve this
goal is to start with rationality and consider how to take it in a more realistic direction. A
problem with using rationality as a basis for describing the behavior of any real-world
agent is that, in many situations, calculating the rational action requires the agent to
possess a huge amount of computational resources. It might be worth expending those
resources 1f you’re making a highly consequential decision and have a lot of time to
evaluate your options, but most human decisions are made quickly and for relatively low
stakes. In any situation where the time you spend making a decision is costly—at the
very least because it’s time you could spend doing something else—the classic notion of
rationality is no longer a good prescription for how one should behave.

To develop a more realistic model of rational behavior, we need to take into

branded the Arab world as tribal and undemocratic, in order to brand
itself the only democracy in the Middle East. Well, soon enough it
won’t be. Many of its neighbors will soon join the democratic world
as demands for democracy grow. Democracy will mean more
development, prosperity and people’s power. It means more popular
participation in decision making and awareness of the possibilities of
the nation and what it can and cannot do. It may not mean more
hostility toward Israel if the latter knows how to deal with it. But
there will be tension if Israel continues to follow extreme policies,
which it will under the current leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu.
The Palestinians must achieve their right to establish their own state
on their land. This right has been recognized by almost everyone
except a minority of extremists in Israel, led by Netanyahu. Free and
democratic Arab countries won’t shrink from supporting this
Palestinian right under any circumstances. Muslims will not give up
on East Jerusalem, either. Arab regimes have been weak in the past.
Democracy will strengthen them, but also add reason to Arab
governance. Most Arabs have accepted Israel’s right to exist, and
accepted U.N. resolutions 242 and 338, but Israeli intransigence is
not helping them formulate a unified position.

Democratic Egypt won’t be a threat to Israel as the Egyptian military,
which will continue to be highly influential in Egypt’s politics in the
foreseeable future, will not risk another war with Israel. Egyptians
under a democratic regime will be seeking better living standards,
better laws to govern the country and more rights as citizens. They
won’t be pressing their government to fight Israel; on the contrary,
they want a stable economy where things will be better for future
generations. But Israel may aggravate the situation by electing
extremists and following extreme policies. This will strengthen the
hands of the hawks in the Arab world. Moderate Israel under

NICHOLAS NEGROPONTE

Nicholas Negroponte (born December 1, 1943) is an
American architect best known as the founder and
Chairman Emeritus of Massachusetts Institute of
Technology’s Media Lab, and also known as the founder
of the One Laptop per Child Association (OLPC).
Negroponte was born to Dimitri John Negroponte,
a Greek shipping magnate, and grew up in New York
City’s Upper East Side. He is the younger brother of John
Negroponte, former United States Deputy Secretary of State.
He attended Buckley School in New York City, Le
Rosey in Switzerland, and The Choate School (now Choate
Rosemary Hall) in Wallingford, Connecticut, from which he
graduated in 1961. Subsequently, he studied at MIT as both
an undergraduate and graduate student in Architecture where
his research focused on issues of computer-aided design. He
earned a Master’s degree in architecture from MIT in 1966.
Negroponte joined the faculty of MIT in 1966.
For several years thereafter he divided his teaching time
between MIT and several visiting professorships at Yale,
Michigan and the University of California, Berkeley.
In 1967, Negroponte founded MIT’s Architecture
Machine Group, a combination lab and think tank which
studied new approaches to human-computer interaction.
In 1985, Negroponte created the MIT Media Lab with
Jerome B. Wiesner. As director, he developed the lab into
the pre-eminent computer science laboratory for new
media and a high-tech playground for investigating the
human-computer interface. Negroponte also became a
proponent of intelligent agents and personalized electronic
newspapers, for which he popularized the term the Daily Me.
In 1992, Negroponte became involved in the creation
of Wired Magazine as the first investor. From 1993 to 1998,
he contributed a monthly column to the magazine in which
he reiterated a basic theme: “Move bits, not atoms.”
Negroponte expanded many of the ideas from his
Wired columns into a bestselling book Being Digital (1995),
which made famous his forecasts on how the interactive
world, the entertainment world and the information world
would eventually merge. Being Digital was a bestseller and
was translated into some twenty languages. Negroponte
is a digital optimist who believed that computers would
make life better for everyone. However, critics such as
Cass Sunstein have faulted his techno-utopian ideas for
failing to consider the historical, political and cultural
realities with which new technologies should be viewed.
Negroponte’s belief that wired technologies such
as telephones will ultimately become unwired by using
airwaves instead of wires or fiber optics, and that unwired
technologies such as televisions will become wired, is
commonly referred to as the Negroponte switch.

In 2000, Negroponte stepped down as director
of the Media Lab as Walter Bender took over as Executive
Director. However, Negroponte retained the role of laboratory
Chairman. When Frank Moss was appointed director of the lab
in 2006, Negroponte stepped down as lab chairman to focus
more fully on his work with One Laptop Per Child (OLPC)
although he retains his appointment as professor at MIT.

In November 2005, at the World Summit on the
Information Society held in Tunis, Negroponte unveiled the
concept of a $100 laptop computer, The Children’s Machine,
designed for students in the developing world. The price
has increased to US$180, however. The project is part of
a broader program by One Laptop Per Child, a non-profit
organisation started by Negroponte and other Media Lab
faculty, to extend Internet access in developing countries.

Negroponte is an active angel investor and has
invested in over 30 startup companies over the last 30 years,
including Zagats, Wired, Ambient Devices, Skype and Velti.
He sits on several boards, including Motorola (listed on the
New York Stock Exchange) and Velti (listed on the London
Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ). He is also on the advisory
board of TTI/Vanguard. In August 2007, he was appointed
to a five-member special committee with the objective of
assuring the continued journalistic and editorial integrity
and independence of the Wall Street Journal and other Dow
Jones & Company publications and services. The committee
was formed as part of the merger of Dow Jones with News
Corporation. Negroponte’s fellow founding committee
members are Louis Boccardi, Thomas Bray, Jack Fuller,
and the late former Congresswoman Jennifer Dunn.

Negroponte has influenced modern

day futurists, such as David Houle.

that testimony?
A. Yes.
MR. SCOTT: Objection. This is totally

Epstein also hired Bruce Reinhart, then an assistant U.S. attorney in South
Florida, now a U.S. magistrate. He left the U.S. Attorney’s Office on Jan. 1, 2008,
and went to work representing Epstein’s employees on Jan. 2, 2008, court records
show. In 2011, Reinhart was named in the Crime Victims’ Rights Act lawsuit,
which accused him of violating Justice Department policies by switching sides,
implying that he leveraged inside information about Epstein’s investigation to
curry favor with Epstein.

Reinhart, in a sworn declaration attached to the CVRA case, denied the
allegation, saying he did not participate in Epstein’s criminal case and “never
learned any confidential, non-public information about the Epstein matter.”

The U.S. Attorney’s Office has since disputed that, saying in court papers that he
did possess confidential information about the case.

Contacted for this story, Reinhart, in an email, said he never represented Epstein
— only Epstein’s pilots; his scheduler, Sarah Kellen; and Nadia Marcinkova,
described by some victims as Epstein’s sex slave. Reinhart also pointed out that a
complaint filed against him by victims’ lawyer Paul Cassell was dismissed by the
Justice Department.

13.6.1 A Semi-Formal Model of Glocal Memory

To explain the notion of glocal memory more precisely, we will introduce a simple semi-formal
model of a system S that uses a memory to record information relevant to the actions it
carries out. The overall concept of glocal memory should not be considered as restricted to
this particular model. This model is not intended for maximal generality, but is intended to
encompass a variety of current AI system designs and formal neurological models.

In this model, we will consider S’s memory subsystem as a set of objects we’ll call “tokens,”
embedded in some metric space. The metric in the space, which we will call the “basic distance”
of the memory, generally will not be defined in terms of the semantics of the items stored in the
memory; though it may come to shape these dynamics through the specific architecture and
evolution of the memory. Note that these tokens are not intended as generally being mapped
one-to-one onto meaningful items stored in the memory. The “tokens” are the raw materials
that the memory arranges in various patterns in order to store items.

We assume that each token, at each point in time, may meaningfully be assigned a certain
quantitative “activation level.” Also, tokens may have other numerical or discrete quantities
associated with them, depending on the particular memory architecture. Finally, tokens may
relate other tokens, so that optionally a token may come equipped with an (ordered or un-
ordered) list of other tokens.

To understand the meaning of the activation levels, one should think about S’s memory
subsystem as being coupled with an action-selection subsystem, that dynamically chooses the
actions to be taken by the overall system in which the two subsystems are embedded. Each
combination of actions, in each particular type of context, will generally be associated with the
activation of certain tokens in memory.

Then, as analysts of the system S, we may associate each token T with an “activation vector”
v(T,t), whose value for each discrete time ¢ consists of the activation of the token T at time t.
So, the 50’th entry of the vector corresponds to the activation of the token at the 50/th time
step.

“Items stored in memory” over a certain period of time, may then be defined as clusters in
the set of activation vectors associated with memory during that period of time. Note that the
system S itself may explicitly recognize and remember patterns regarding what items are stored
in its memory — but, from an external analyst’s perspective, the set of items in S’s memory is
not restricted to the ones that S has explicitly recognized as memory items.

The “localization” of a memory item may be defined as the degree to which the various tokens
involved in the item are close to each other according to the metric in the memory metric-space.
This degree may be formalized in various ways, but choosing a particular quantitative measure
is not important here. A highly localized item may be called “local” and a not-very-localized
item may be called “global.”

We may define the “activation distance” of two tokens as the distance between their activation
vectors. We may then say that a memory is “well aligned” to the extent that there is a correlation
between the activation distance of tokens, and the basic distance of the memory metric-space.

Given the above set-up, the basic notion of glocal memory can be enounced fairly simply. A
glocal memory is one:

e that is reasonably well-aligned (i.e. the correlation between activation and basic distance is
significantly greater than random)

had been regulars at 251 Sunrise, a chic nightclub in Palm Beach.
There they had regaled any woman who would listen with
made-up stories about their adventures as pilots.

But 251 Sunrise is shuttered now. The joint was shut down in

under horrific conditions for over a year while awaiting his trial and
was facing a long prison sentence. There was no reason for Snowden
to expect a better outcome for himself if he returned to the United
States or was arrested anywhere else that had an extradition treaty
with the United States. As the Russian officials in Hong Kong would
have informed him, Russia had no extradition treaty with the United
States. It was also one of the few places in the world that he could
reach from Hong Kong without flying through airspace in which he
might be intercepted by a U.S. ally. Snowden was told he could take
the direct Aeroflot flight to Moscow without a valid passport or visa.

That Snowden’s alternative to going to Russia was going to prison
gave the Russians considerable leverage in Hong Kong. The Rus-
sian “diplomats” could have used this leverage to extract a quid pro
quo. The price of admission might have meant putting himself in the
hands of Russian intelligence and telling it all he knew.

The Moscow Scenario

The final possibility is that Snowden did not come under Russian
control until after he arrived in Moscow. After assessing the nega-
tive attitude that Snowden expressed toward government authority
on the video that was released by The Guardian, the Russian “diplo-
mats” in Hong Kong might have concluded that Snowden could bolt
if too much pressure was exerted on him there. The Russians could
afford to be patient. They knew that Interpol and the United States
would be pursuing Snowden throughout the world and that he had
no valid travel documents and that his credit cards had been frozen.
They would likely know that Sarah Harrison had arranged his flight
to Moscow on June 23. So they had no urgent need to apply pressure
on him before his plane landed in Russia.

After the Russians took him in a “special operation” from the
plane at the airport, he was informed by Russian authorities that
he would not be allowed to go to Cuba, Venezuela, Iceland, Ecuador,
or any other country without the permission of Russian officials,
which would not be immediately forthcoming. He was now at the

I think a great opportunity has arisen. Just like the headlines of a hotel maid now proven to have lied in the 
Stauss Kahn case. The girl who accused Prince Andrew can also easily be proven to be a liar. I think 
Buckingham Palace would love it . You should task someone to investigate the girl Virginia Roberts, that has 
caused the Queens son all this agro. I promise you she is a fraud. you and i will be able to go to ascot for the

other. Wars are notorious for yielding unintended and unexpected
consequences; for reasons explained below, a war against Iran is even
harder than usual to bound analytically.

Complexity, Uncertainty and War

Our first consideration in analyzing the likely course of war with Iran
is that a U.S.-led attack would be merely the first phase of a war, the
opening act of an extended drama whose scenes would unfold, not
according to any script, but to an emergent logic of its own. Given
the political context in which military engagement would rest, even a
minor attack would likely become a major test of strength involving
not only the United States and Iran but also a host of allies and
associates. It is therefore disingenuous to try to frame military action
against Iran as a simple “raid” or even a broader “operation.” We are
talking here about war, with attendant potential high costs to all
combatants in terms of military casualties, civilian damage and
economic disruption.

At least three concepts are key to any coherent discussion of a U.S.-
Iranian military engagement: complexity, uncertainty and war itself.
By complexity we mean the number of moving parts in a given
situation: actors, processes and the connections among them. By
uncertainty we mean structural uncertainty—that is, not just
ignorance of the magnitudes of agreed casual factors, but the
ignorance of the causal factors themselves, and their mutual relations.
For example, not only may the U.S. government not know, say, the
technical status of the Iranian nuclear program, or the actual state of
readiness of Iranian forces. It may not know (or worse, have wrong)
the decision-making and implementation protocols of the Iranian
government, how the Iranian people and military would react to an
attack, what Tehran would ask its allies and proxies to do, and what
in fact they will do.

written is unwise, unfair, false, or malicious. In a democratic society, one who assumes to
act for the citizens in an executive, legislative, or judicial capacity must expect that his
official acts will be commented upon and criticized. Such criticism cannot, in my opinion,
be muzzled or deterred by the courts at the instance of public officials under the label of
libel.”

Since I am a public figure under the law, I have been defamed on numerous occasions, especially
on the internet. The libels and slanders have been both personal and political. Although these
defamations were published with actual malice, I have not sued, though I have often been
tempted. (I once threatened to sue when a journalist made up a false racist and sexist quotation
and attributed it to me; the newspaper investigated, agreed with me and made a contribution to
my favorite charity).

Many years after New York Times v. Sullivan, I myself was charged with defamation—indeed
criminal defamation—for exercising my own freedom of speech to criticize a judge for an opinion
she wrote. This certainly made me appreciate our First Amendment. Here is the story:

One day in my office I opened an envelope and saw a notice that an Italian prosecutor in the city
of Turin had initiated a criminal investigation against me. I had no idea what she could be
referring to. The letter stated that I had committed the alleged act in the city of Turin on January
27%, 2005. I checked my calendar and discovered that I was teaching students at Harvard Law
School on that day and then attending a lecture by a prominent federal judge. I could not possibly
have been in Turin or engaged in any criminal act there. Yet I soon discovered that I was being
charged with criminal libel for statements I had made in an interview with an Italian journalist
over the telephone. The journalist was in New York. I was sitting at my desk in Cambridge. But
the interview was published by the newspaper La Stampa in Turin on January 25, 2005.
Accordingly, the alleged criminal act had taken place in Turin, even though I had never set foot in
that city. Nor had I engaged in any act other than responding to questions and expressing my
heartfelt views about a judge who had written a foolish and dangerous judicial opinion that ruled
that three men suspected of recruiting suicide bombers were “guerrillas” and therefore not
terrorists, and not guilty.

I characterized her opinion as a “Magna Carta for terrorism,” and instead of answering (or
ignoring) me, she filed criminal charges with the prosecutor who decided to open an investigation.

As far as I know, the charges against me are still pending in Italy. I have every intention to fight
them if it comes to that.

A variation on the theme of defamation is ridicule. Cartoons and drawings have long been used to
ridicule the high and mighty. More recently photo-shopped pictures have superimposed the heads
of public figures on the bodies of others to demean or insult them. In 1988, the Supreme Court
ruled that the Reverend Jerry Falwell could not sue Hustler Magazine for publishing a parody of
the well known Campari Liqueur ads in which a celebrity described “his first time.” The ad relies
on the obvious double-entendre on the first sexual and drinking experience. In the parody,
Falwell is shown drinking and having sex with his mother—pretty disgusting! But as the Supreme
Court rightly observed:

the condition is asserted as an issue by the party seeking closure” (emphasis added)).

Il. JUDGE MARRA’S ORDER IN HIS CASE DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT
THE RECORDS BE SEALED IN THIS CASE.

Dershowitz also appears to contend that Judge Marra’s order striking some of the
materials from the records at issue somehow requires that these stricken materials be kept
confidential in this case. Dershowitz’s argument misunderstands both the scope of Judge
Marra’s order and its effect in this case. His argument rests on a truncated — and misleading --
description of the events surrounding Judge Marra’s ruling striking certain documents. A more
complete description makes clear that Judge Marra has not determined the documents are
somehow “confidential” even in the federal Crime Victims’ Rights Act case — much less in this
separate state defamation action.

Edwards and Cassell filed the federal case pro bono on behalf of two young women who
were sexually abused as underage girls by Dershowitz’s close personal friend — Jeffrey
Epstein. In 2008, Edwards and Casell filed a petition to enforce the rights of “Jane Doe No. 1”
and ‘Jane Doe No. 2” under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771, alleging
that the Government had failed to provide them rights with regard to a plea arrangement it was
pursuing with Epstein. Jane Doe No. I and Jane Doe No. 2 v. United States, No. 9:08-cv-80736

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021174.txt,"When the pain relief kicked in, everything and everyone dwindled
away until I felt like Alice in Wonderland who just swallowed the
shrinking tablet and everyone standing around me seemed to move so
quick, speak so loud and hover above me. When I awoke from my
induced state, I was alone in a different room. Not knowing at all what
went on but feeling a little better, I called in the nurse who looked
through my charts and checked my vital signs. Then told me the doctor
would be in shortly to inform me of the conclusion to my illness.

He was a tall man with dark hair, and a hardened look about him
obviously from his job and constantly seeing the worst horror stories man
could think of, he just bluntly told me | had miscarried in early stages of
pregnancy. | should be fine to go home as soon as my course of
intravenous antibiotics was complete. The news sunk in fast and hit a
deep nerve. I waited for the doctor to close the curtain before I let out any
emotion and cried for my disastrous lifestyle that was dragging me into a
world that I wanted to break out of. This reoccurring cycle of believing I
needed men like Jeffrey to succeed in my life was draining the last bits of
sensitivity left in my heart. I was picked up by Jeffrey himself-who took
the doctor alone to the side of the busy hallway to have a private
conversation about something. Jeffrey wasn’t comforting at all, instead he
sent me back home to rest for a couple weeks, and | only fell deeper into
a depression, using all forms of self-medication to treat my sorrows.

Two weeks later, as if Jeffrey was trying to lighten my spirits, he told
me I would be going to his island to meet a new client. He is a Harvard
Professor, named Stephen Kosslyn. I would be spending two days with
him showing him around the island, dining with him, and treating him to
a massage whenever he wanted. Without Jeffrey even verbalizing the
need to have sex with him, he told me to keep him happy like I had my
first client. I packed my suitcase with island apparel, and kissed T.J good-
bye, who had at least offered me a warm embrace upon the news of my
miscarriage but none other than that knowing it wasn’t his.

Stephen was a quirky little man with white hair and a mad scientist look
about him. We arrived separately and I greeted him when one of the
housekeepers picked him up from the airport and arrived by boat, instead
of helicopter as Jeffrey and Ghislane often arrive on. We made our
acquaintances and he looked as if he was tripping over himself with
words, obviously delighted with his company and location for the
weekend. { showed him around as Jeffrey had asked and took him on an
adventurous quad bike ride around the small curvy paths, leading the way
and letting loose my hair, doing something that gave me a natural high
instead of the prescription one. The sights alone were breathtaking from
the mountainous peaks of the untouched parts of the island, we sat ata
cliff and just sat there, not saying a word to each other besides to

compliment the sights mother nature that appealed to us. I didn’t feel as if
lL owed this stranger anything but what was expected of me by Jeffrey and
I could be polite, I just couldn’t be myself.

We got back to the main villa to see what time dinner would be served
so we could have time to unpack and clean up beforehand. We both met
at six pm for dinner on the outside veranda. He sat at the head of the
table and I sat next to him, politely folding my napkin to put in my lap.
The first time Jeffrey and Ghislane had seen me cut meat and eat with a
fork and knife they were so appalled, making fun of my unsophisticated
habits. Ghislane took the fork and knife in her hands and proceeded to
show me how to politely cut my food and eat. Now that my mannerisms
had improved they wouldn’t have to be worried about my etiquette when
someone important was around anyone. We both drank the red wine
supplied on the table and it seemed to warm me up on the breezy night.
By the time dinner was served and another red wine bottle later, he
seemed to get funnier. | made fun of his tousled hair and he poked at me
for my skinny legs, calling me a wanna-be- anorexic. When dessert was
brought out, he asked if he could receive one of the delightful massages
he has been hearing about from Jeffrey. | gulped more red wine down and
sweetly complied with his offer, dreading the moment I'd have to see his
naked body, let alone touch it. I asked the housekeeper Kathy that had
been serving us that night to please have someone set up a massage bed
in one of the cabana’s. | went to my room to down a few Xanax, telling
him I wanted to freshen up after dinner but to meet me in his cabana in
twenty minutes or so. | was ready to go as | had said, twenty minutes
later, with the effects of the tablets mixed with the red wine, and I would
he free not to feel anything. He was still dressed when { got in the cabana,
obviously not accustomed to this and a lot shyer than what I had been
used to, I told him he’d need to undress and lie face down on the table,
putting a towel to cover his bare bottom to prevent him feeling
embarrassed during the massage. I gave the massage my earnest as I
always had, and quickly got through having intercourse with him. Not
wanting to make any foreplay or anything extravagant out of it, I let him
think that’s as good as it got, and by the smile on his face, J thought I had
done enough.

The next day I took him down to the beach for a real massage under a
tiki-hut on the waters edge. It was one of Jeffrey’s favorite places to have
a massage, as he droned out to the sound of the waves and my gentle
therapeutic strokes. Afterwards we had lunch back at the main villa and
went back down to the beach to swim out to the water trampoline about
one hundred meters off the dock. He didn’t do any bouncing around or
anything like that. It was just a good base point for a rest spot after a long

that he approve the operation, and Rabin agreed.

I attended the final briefing shortly afterwards. I was impressed by the
determined faces of the men in the two sayeret teams. One of the officers was
23-year-old Nir Poraz, whom I remembered from operational briefings in the
kirya on previous sayeret missions. Wachsman was being held in a room on the
first floor. The commandos would simultaneously detonate explosives on three
doors: at the front, on the side, and a third one leading through a kitchen to the
room where the kidnappers had their hostage. The attack began fifteen minutes
before the Hamas deadline. The explosive charges went off, but only the one in
the front blew open the door. Poraz and his team rushed in, but one of the
kidnappers opened fire, killing him and wounding six others. The other team
had by now made it to the first floor. But despite firing at the metal lock, they
had trouble getting the door to open. By the time they got in, Wachsman had
been killed, shot in the neck and chest.

I was in the command post a few hundred yards away. I called Rabin and
then went to see him in the kirya. The head of personnel for the army had gone
to see the Wachsman family and break the news to them. Now, we had to tell
the country. Rabin and I appeared on television together. Rabin insisted —
wrongly — on saying he bore full responsibility. What had gone wrong, I had
tried to impress on him, was not the decision to attempt the rescue. It was the
rescue itself. That was not his responsibility. It was mine.

The next day, I visited Wachsman’s parents, and tried to convey how painful
the failed rescue was to me, Rabin and every one else involved. I was inspired
and humbled by their response. His father had told a reporter he wanted to
convey his condolences to the parents of Nir Poraz. “This added loss has shaken
me terribly,” he said. He told me he also believed that the Prime Minister had
approved the rescue using his best judgement on the information that he had
available. I spent time separately speaking to Mrs Wachsman. | tried to explain
that in fighting an enemy like Hamas, people who not just threaten to kill but
had proven they had no hesitation in doing so, I’d felt there was no choice but to
attempt the rescue. I admitted we’d known the risks. But we’d tried to do the
right thing, both for the country and her son. I think she understood, though I
knew that nothing could alter the terrible sadness of her loss. The pain would
take years to heal. Some part of it never would. Still, I felt it was important she
and her husband know that we, too, felt their loss. For years afterwards, Nava
and I continued to visit them.

market.7 A “social war” would involve appeals to Islamic solidarity
and attempts to weaken popular support for adversary governments
through influence operations and attacks aimed at civilians. In such a
broad and protracted contest, the United States might not enjoy a
favorable balance of advantages. It is by no means clear, either, that
the U.S. government is structured to effectively prosecute such a war,
or that its intelligence capabilities are oriented properly toward
supporting it.

Given these caveats and complexities, it seems to follow that if the
United States chose to attack Iran, it would do so in ways that would
prevent Iran from expanding the conflict into areas where it held an
advantage. The reasoning might go something like this: Since the
Iranian regime has many ways to widen a war into domains that do
not favor the United States, the best option is to execute regime-
change before the regime can open its bag of tricks. Or it might go
like this: Start small, but if the Iranians escalate the war, shift
immediately to a regime-change option before they can succeed.
Almost needless to say, these are hard-to-control and high-risk
approaches. A decapitation strategy, we know, did not fare so well in
March 2003 against Iraq, and it would probably be harder to pull off
against a more deeply institutionalized polity like Iran.

As for a “start small” approach, let’s suppose that the war begins with
a limited air and naval operation. Iran could respond in a limited “tit-
for-tat” way. But the regime might conclude that the operation is

unintentionally); if so, it might respond with a high level of violence
along several axes of capability. There is simply no way to predict
with confidence how radicals in Iran would respond to an initially
limited U.S. attack. We must base our predictions largely on what the
leadership says, the Iranian regime’s history and our limited
intelligence on the regime’s internal dynamics.8 All this is subject to

“The Muslim Student Union orchestrated a concerted effort to disrupt the speech. One
student after another stood and shouted so that the ambassador could not be heard. Each
student was taken away only to be replaced by another doing the same thing.”

Chemerinsky understates what happened, as anyone can see by watching a video of the event,
available online (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w96UR79TBw). This was more than a
concerted effort to disrupt the speech. It was a concerted effort to stop it completely -- to
censor Oren's right to speak and his audience's right to hear him. The efforts to disrupt succeeded;
the effort to stop ultimately failed. Moreover, there is undisputed evidence that there was a well-
planned conspiracy to censor Oren's talk.

The students were disciplined by the university for their actions, though the nature and degree of
the discipline has been kept confidential. Campus sources have characterized it as a slap on the
wrist. Since the students had to be arrested to prevent the speech from being drowned out, the
District Attorney, quite understandably, commenced a criminal investigation. After learning of the
careful planning that went into the concerted effort to prevent Oren from speaking, the DA filed
misdemeanor charges against those who were involved.

This decision resulted in an outcry by radicals, many of whom favor censorship of pro-Israel
speakers. In a letter to the DA signed by many well-known anti-Israel zealots, as well as by the
two leaders of the local ACLU, the incident was described as merely a protest:

“the students non-violently and verbally protested a university-invited speaker. The
students left the event peacefully ....”*°

Then, in an effort to blame the victims, the letter pointed the finger at pro-Israel students who
wanted to listen to Oren speak claiming -- quite falsely -- that the Muslim Student Union censors
conducted themselves in less of a disruptive manner than some of the counter-protestors...
Sounds as if the Muslim Student Union deserved a civil liberties award, while the students who
came to listen to the invited speaker—“the counter-protestors”—deserve to be condemned. Ina
more recent letter the ACLU leaders claim that “the students’ intent was not to censor the
speaker...”

The students themselves have been more honest about their intentions than the ACLU leaders. .
For instance, one student leader refused to acknowledge that Mr. Oren had First Amendment
rights of his own by interrupting him and shouting, “Propagating murder is not an expression of
free speech!” (Shades of Bruce Franklin!) Another student was caught on video telling a crowd
assembled outside the event that “we pretty much shut them down”.

The fact that radical anti-Israel zealots would support censorship of a pro-Israel speaker comes as
no surprise. But the fact that the letter of support was signed by two ACLU leaders should shock
all civil libertarians and supporters of the ACLU. I have been a supporter of the ACLU for half a
century and was a national board member. In addition to supporting the right of Nazis to march
through Skokie, I have defended the right of the most virulent anti-Israel speakers to participate

Top aide of Jeffrey Epstein 
prosecutor Acosta: We acted with 
integrity 
February 15, 2019 12:17 PM 
Palm Beach multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein is a free man, despite sexually abusing 
dozens of underage girls according to police and prosecutors. His victims have never 
had a voice, until now. By Emily Michot I Julie K. Brown  
A former top prosecutor involved in the Jeffrey Epstein sex case is defending his old 
boss, Alexander Acosta, whose decision to craft a secret plea deal with the wealthy 
New York hedge fund manager has come under federal scrutiny. 
In his first public comments on the 10-year-old case, Jeffrey H. Sloman — who at 
the time was second in command under Acosta at the U.S. Attorney's Office in 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023126 
Miami — said prosecutors resolved the case based on the facts and evidence, and 
what he called legal impediments, including the belief that many of Epstein's 
teenage victims were too terrified to cooperate in the case. 
Given the obstacles we faced in fashioning a robust federal prosecution, we decided 
to negotiate a resolution, said Sloman, now in private practice. We did not reach 
this decision lightly and it came only after significant and often rancorous internal 
debate. 
Jeffrey Sloman, who was second-in-command to then-U.S. Attorney Alexander 
Acosta when the latter was deciding whether to prosecute Jeffrey Epstein, says the 
office handled the case properly. Aixa Montero Holt 
In a lengthy opinion piece  submitted to the Miami Herald Editorial Board, Sloman 
alleges that the attacks on Acosta's role in the controversial case are politically 
driven by critics who failed to raise significant issues when Acosta was nominated 
and confirmed as the U.S. secretary of labor in 2017. 
Sloman's comments come two weeks after the Justice Department announced it had 
opened an investigation over whether there was prosecutorial misconduct in the 
case involving Epstein, who ran a sex pyramid scheme from his Palm Beach estate 
that targeted scores of underage girls from 2001 to 2006. 
About 30 members of Congress demanded the probe following a Miami Herald 
series of stories, Perversion of Justice, that detailed how federal prosecutors, led 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023127 
by Acosta, stitched together an unusual immunity deal that allowed Epstein to 
escape what could have been a life sentence in federal prison. 
U.S. Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta has been criticized for the plea deal he 
worked out with Jeffrey Epstein. Acosta was U.S. attorney for Southern Florida at 
the time. Alan Diaz 
Instead, Epstein — whose friends included President Donald Trump, former 
President Bill Clinton and other politically connected people — was allowed to 
quietly plead guilty to prostitution charges in state court. He served 13 months in 
the county jail, where he was allowed liberal work release privileges rarely given to 
sex offenders in Florida and barred by the Palm Beach Sheriffs Department's own 
rules. 
He was released in 2009, but his victims — who were 13 to 16 years old at the time — 
are still fighting more than a decade later to have his non-prosecution agreement 
overturned. 
In his op-ed, Sloman called Acosta an outstanding public servant ... at risk of 
becoming collateral damage in Washington's latest polarized conflagration, adding, 
I won't let it happen without first being heard. 
Jeffrey Epstein apologizes, but not to his victims 
Jeffrey Epstein, a multimillionaire who molested dozens of underage girls, and is 
suspected of trafficking countless other girls around the world, issued a public 
apology Tuesday. It was not to the victims of his abuse, but to one of their lawyers. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023128 
As additional details about Epstein's crimes have emerged, it is clear to me that we 
should have pushed for much harsher terms, Sloman wrote. That said, some have 
mistakenly suggested that our office kowtowed to Epstein's high-priced defense 
lawyers or, worse, that his lawyers corrupted or intimidated us into submission. ... 
Nothing could be further from the truth. 
Sloman did not directly address the chief complaint brought by Epstein's victims, 
who are now in their late 20S and early 30s. Those who spoke to the Herald said 
they felt betrayed by federal prosecutors, who sealed the non-prosecution agreement 
from public view so that they wouldn't find out about it before he was sentenced. It 
would be almost a year before they were successful in having it unsealed. By then, it 
was too late to try to derail it. 
They allege, in a federal lawsuit filed against the government, that prosecutors 
deliberately kept the deal secret — in violation of federal law — to prevent them 
from appearing at Epstein's sentencing to possibly undo the deal. Nor did Sloman 
address why prosecutors also gave immunity to a number of Epstein's co-
conspirators, who have never been identified. 
They cut a deal which they have to know was a failure, said Marci Hamilton, a law 
professor at the University of Pennsylvania and executive director of Child USA, 
which advocates for children's civil liberties.  They kept it secret and they didn't 
charge the co-conspirators. The horror of this is if you don't hold all the 'Johns' 
accountable, then it doesn't stop. This case involved multiple girls, multiple men, 
multiple recruiters, multiple times and he recruited girls to get other girls. That's a 
trafficking organization. 
Acosta has not commented since 2011, when he defended his decisions in a publicly 
issued letter that can be found in the federal court file. In it, he described what he 
called a yearlong assault on prosecutors by Epstein's army of legal superstars, 
including Roy Black, Kenneth Starr and Alan Dershowitz, among others. In four 
long paragraphs, Acosta detailed how defense attorneys relentlessly worked to 
manipulate the negotiation process, often frustrating prosecutors. 
They would obtain concessions as part of a negotiation and agree to proceed, only 
to change their minds, and appeal the office's decision to Washington, Acosta 
wrote, adding that their tactics included delving into the private family lives of 
individual prosecutors in an effort to discredit them and get them removed from the 
case. 
Wrote Sloman: The Herald's 'Perversion of Justice' series presented a heartrending 
portrait of Epstein's victims and made a strong case that he should have gone to jail 
much longer, but never explained or substantiated its accusation that we schemed 
with Epstein's lawyers. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023129 
The Herald's series quoted a trove of letters and emails between prosecutors and 
Epstein's defense team that showed that Epstein's lawyers were allowed to dictate 
the terms of each deal that they drew up, and prosecutors repeatedly backed down 
on deadlines. The lead prosecutor, Marie Villafaria, amid the negotiations wrote to 
Epstein lawyer Jay Lefkowitz: I thought we had worked very well together in 
resolving this dispute. ... I feel that I bent over backwards to keep in mind the effect 
that the agreement would have on Mr. Epstein. 
Where are they now? The biggest players in the Jeffrey Epstein case 
The girls who were abused by Jeffrey Epstein and the cops who championed their 
cause remain angry over what they regard as a gross injustice, while Epstein's 
employees and those who engineered his non-prosecution agreement have 
prospered. 
The email chain also shows that prosecutors sometimes communicated with the 
defense team using private emails, and that their correspondence referenced 
discussions that they wanted to have by phone or in person so that there would be 
no paper trail, the Herald found. At one point, Acosta met privately with Lefkowitz, 
who came from the same Washington, D.C.-based law firm, at a Marriott hotel in 
West Palm Beach, the emails showed. It was at that meeting, the records show, 
when Acosta agreed to keep the deal secret. 
The correspondences also show that Sloman sought several times to have Epstein's 
victims notified about the deal, as required under the Crime Victims Rights Act. But 
after Epstein's lawyers aggressively objected and appealed to Acosta, it never 
happened. 
Sloman, however, insisted that Epstein's lawyers' aggressive defense had no bearing 
on the office's decision to set aside what court records show was a 53-page federal 
indictment it had prepared against Epstein. Sloman said the facts dictated that 
Epstein should plead guilty to what he called a crime in state court that reflected 
his true conduct, adding that the case was at heart, a local sex case. 
It is a gross mischaracterization to describe this as a local sex case, said lawyer 
Jack Scarola, a representative of several of Epstein's then-underage victims. There 
was ample evidence that Epstein was operating on a large international scale. The 
involvement of the federal government was a consequence of evidence that children 
were crossing national and state borders for the purpose of prostitution. 
At the time that the case was closed, FBI investigators had identified nearly 40 
victims — and more were coming forward — who said they had been molested or 
sexually assaulted by Epstein and some of his co-conspirators. One of those victims, 
Courtney Wild, told the Herald that she brought at least 6o girls to his waterfront 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023130 
Palm Beach estate over time. She wanted Epstein prosecuted — and was willing to 
testify — but prosecutors never gave her the chance, she told the Herald. 
In addition, FBI records show that agents had traveled to New York and New 
Mexico to interview other possible victims, the Herald found. The non-prosecution 
deal that was struck was filed under seal. The result was that no one — not even the 
judge — would know the full scope of Epstein's crimes and how many victims were 
involved. 
Acosta, who now heads a federal agency with oversight of international child labor 
laws and human trafficking, was personally involved in the negotiations, records, 
letters and emails show. 
AG nominee Barr pledges to look into handling of Epstein case 
Sen. Ben Sasse questioned attorney general nominee William Barr about the Jeffrey 
Epstein case on January 15, 2019, getting the nominee to commit to having the 
Department of Justice look into the handling of that case if confirmed. 
By C-SPAN 
Sloman reiterated Acosta's earlier contention that most of Epstein's victims 
wouldn't cooperate. 
So somehow, had Epstein been a child molester of one or two victims, then they 
would have prosecuted him? said Wild's attorney, Brad Edwards, in an interview 
with the Herald for its series published in November. But because he molested 
hundreds of victims and some of them wouldn't testify, then they are saying, 'we 
can't prosecute.' How absurd is that argument? 
Edwards tried unsuccessfully to block the plea deal in federal court. In 2008, days 
after Epstein was sentenced, he filed an emergency order, alleging that the 
agreement was illegal because it violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act, which 
grants crime victims certain rights, including the right to confer with prosecutors 
and be notified of a plea deal. The lawsuit is still pending a decade later. 
There is a reason for the Crime Victims Rights Act — so that prosecutors don't 
preempt a victim's ability to speak for themselves about a proposed plea bargain, 
Scarola said. Here, the decision was being made secretly for them.

Scarola) and Dershowitz’s extended answer are quoted in full— including Dershowitz’s
reference to the oral sex allegation that he now argues this Court should treat as “confidential”:

Q. [Y]ou [are] aware that years before December of 2014, when the
CVRA pleading was filed, that your name had come up repeatedly in
connection with Jeffrey Epstein’s abuse of minors, correct? . . .

A. Let me answer that question. I am aware that never before 2014,
end of December, was it ever, ever alleged that I had acted in any
way inappropriately with regard to Virginia [Giuffre], that I ever
touched her, that I ever met her, that Ihad ever been with her. I was
completely aware ofthat. There had never been any
allegation. She claims under oath that she told you that secretly in
2011, but you have produced no notes of any such conversation.
You, of course, are a witness to this allegation and will be deposed
asa witness to this allegation. I believe it is an entirely false
allegation that she told you in 2011 that she had had any sexual
contact with me. I think she’s lying through her teeth when she
says that. And I doubt that your notes will reveal any such
information.

But if she did tell you that, she would be absolutely, categorically
lying. So I am completely aware that never, until the lies were put
in a legal pleading at the end of December 2014, it was
never alleged that I had any sexual contact with Virginia Roberts.

I know that it was alleged that I was a witness to Jeffrey Epstein's
alleged abuse and that was false. | was never a witness to any of
Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse. And I wrote that to you, something
that you have falsely denied. And I stand on the record. The record
is clear that I have categorically denied I was ever a witness to
any abuse, that | ever saw Jeffrey Epstein abusing anybody.

And -- and the very idea that I would stand and talk to Jeffrey
Epstein while he was receiving oral sex from Virginia Roberts,
which she swore to under oath, is so outrageous, so preposterous,
that even David Boies said he couldn’t believe it was true.

MS. McCAWLEY: I object. I object. I'm not going to allow you to reveal
any conversations that happened in the context of a settlement discussion.

Rabin had inherited a peace process, put in motion by the Bush
Administration after the Gulf War. But since both Prime Minister Shamir and
our Arab enemies had reasons of procedure, politics or principle to resist the
talks, merely getting them off the ground had required the same combination of
deftness and determination President Bush had brought to assembling his
wartime coalition and defeating Saddam. After a formal opening session in
Madrid, the “bilateral tracks” — between Israel and negotiators from Syria,
Lebanon, Jordan and the Palestinians — had quickly stalemated and stalled.

Yitzhak came to office saying he was not interested in a peace process,
which seemed to him a license for endless talk with no set endpoint, but in
peacemaking. Since | had the good fortune to be part of the informal inner circle
with which he discussed the potential opportunities, pitfalls and frustrations
along the way, I know that he wasn’t assuming we could necessarily achieve a
peace agreement with any of our neighbors. But after the twin shocks of the
Lebanon War and the Scud missiles, he was concerned that Israel would retreat
into a mix of political caution and military deterrence which he rightly believed
was short-sighted. He believed we needed at least to try to seize a “window of
opportunity” with those enemies who were at least open to compromise, if only
because we were facing new threats from enemies for whom talk was not even
an option. An increasingly assertive Iran, with nuclear ambitions, was one. But
the intifada had also thrown up new Palestinian groups grounded not in
nationalism, but fundamentalist Islam: Hamas in Gaza, which opposed Israel’s
presence on any part of “Muslim Palestine,” and Islamic Jihad on the West
Bank. And in Lebanon, we were confronting the Iranian-backed Shi’ ite militia
fighters of Hizbollah.

Each of us in the small group on whom Rabin relied for input on the peace
talks brought something different to the mix. In addition to me, there were four
other generals: Uri Saguy, the head of military intelligence; Gadi Zohar, in
charge of civil administration for the West Bank and Gaza; my own former
sayeret deputy, Danny Yatom, who was head of the central command; and
Rabin’s military aide, Kuti Mor. Also included were longtime political and
media aide Eitan Haber, and another trusted political adviser thousands of miles
away: Itamar Rabinovich, our ambassador in Washington and Israel’s leading
Syria expert. But I’m sure we weren’t chosen just for our insights. It was

massages and continuously being groomed to fulfil] all his needs. Often
joined by Ms. Maxwell and her assistant Emmy for sexual trysts of all
kinds. I was mentally and physically exhausted from the week of working
and having to keep up with Jeffrey's strenuous late night activities. I
couldn’t believe what I was doing but it was all starting to sink in fast.
Most nights when | got home, I’d briefly say “Hi” to Mom and Dad
before heading straight to my bedroom. I couldn’t even sleep well
anymore. Closing my eyes at night I would fight the inevitable flood of
thoughts, replaying the moments of shame that ate away myself piece by
piece. My only reasoning being | just had to keep telling myself it would
all be worth it in the end.

This afternoon Ghislane appeared to be in a much better mood. Instead
of taking me straight up to Jeffrey she took me to a yellow guest room
where Emmy mostly stayed. It had a balcony where Emmy was already
outside reading a magazine and puffing on a cigarette. Ghislane lit one up
too and then offered me one. I hadn’t smoked cigarettes much before,
besides trying to look cool in front of one of my friends, but never really
took to them, so when | started to cough from the inhalation of smoke,
the girls began to laugh and joke about my in-experience. It was an
icebreaker for all of us to laugh and poke fun at me. I was then able to
give it back to them saying I would rather be an in-experienced non-
smoker than an old lady with a raspy smokers cough. | don’t think
Ghislane was used to somebody giving it back to her, but she seemed to
like it, as long as she was able to have the last say. | knew my boundaries
and she liked that I wouldn’t cross those invisible lines. All three of us
chatted like friends and it started to feel like some kind of a strange
relationship was budding. After about fifteen minutes of chatting away,
Ghislane instructed me to wash my hands thoroughly, as Jeffrey hated the
smell of smokers, and to follow her down the hallway to the massage
room where he’ll be expecting me shortly. I did what she asked and
sprayed myself with the body spray that I always carried in my purse and
headed down the hall to Jeffrey’s room.

When I opened the door to the massage room surprisingly it was empty.
I sat down on the already made up massage table and was careful not to
mess up the neatly folded towels on the end of the bed. It was a good
fifteen more minutes before Jeffrey made his appearance. It was strange
seeing him in clothes for the first time. He wasn’t wearing what you’d
expect your typical billionaire’s attire to be. He was wearing a pair of
sweatpants and a Harvard sweatshirt, which he began to remove
immediately. This time he wanted to commence our session in the steam
room, so | began to undress as well. We went into the steam room and he
pushed a few buttons and the steam began to pour in from the marble

wall’s built in jets. There was a bench coming out of the wall also made
out of marble that went from either side of the room and had a step
underneath it where I was instructed to sit on so that I could begin giving
Jeffery his massage. Our conversation started off about simple things like
how was your day at work, and I asked Jeffrey how his day was lounging
around, just being polite to cach other. He was acting out of character
being a lot more attentive and conversing with me about other things than
sex or massages for once. Starting with his heels, ankles, toes and arches
in the soles of his feet I massaged all the way up to his calves. It took a
lot more strength to massage in the steam room without oils or lotions
and the constant blowing of steam in your face making me twice as
exerted. | was beginning to really start to heat up when the door to the
room suddenly opened to reveal two naked women. Ghislane and Emmy
acted as if they came in to join us for a steam bath, but my instincts were
telling me otherwise. At least the cold burst of air and escaped steam
revived me a bit.

So there was Jeffrey and Ghislane sitting on top of this marble bench,
each with a young girl at their feet. Emmy and I continued with the
massage until they were ready to head into the shower. There were two
showerheads that Ghislane and Jeffrey both stood under while they were
being lathered with soap bubbles as we washed their bodies. After the
shower Ghislane led us into Jeffrey’s bed to finish today’s session with
Emmy, Ghislane and I performing lesbian acts of foreplay on each other
while Jeffrey laid back and watched. Stroking his manhood in much
delight, he brought himself to climax, and the session was over within
moments. We all got dressed and went downstairs to the kitchen for some
refreshments. Like nothing had happened at all, it was all so bizarre for
me, the whole ordeal with them since this all began. | couldn’t understand
why Ghislane and Jeffrey had such an openly intimate relationship but
yet never regarded themselves as partners. They rarely kissed and never
held hands or even slept in the same bed. It was more like a sexual
arrangement between the two of them. She brings in the girls for his
peculiar taste and he supplies the lavish lifestyle she was accustomed too
before her family lost all of their fortunes. I wasn’t sure how to act or
feel, always obliging to their needs but reserved enough not to get
attached, as if there was this invisible hierarchy and by instinct I knew
my place.

We all hung out in the kitchen for a while before | asked when Juan
could bring me home as I had work in the morning and was tired. They
said no problem and called Juan on the intercom right away, but said
we'd all have something to talk about tomorrow. | knew it had something
to do with my employment trial and from the way they were acting
tonight, I could only assume I got the job, but you never know with these

He offered to defect to the United States. The CIA accepted his offer,
and through this archive of secrets he had previously compiled, he
became one of the CIA’s most productive sources in the Cold War.

The job of an intelligence service is to take advantage of whatever
opportunities come its way in the form of self-generated spies. If
a Russian walk-in had not yet burned his bridges to his own ser-
vice, U.S. intelligence officers were under instructions to attempt to
persuade the walk-in to return to his post in Russia and serve as a
“defector-in-place,” or mole. “While defectors can and do provide
critical information,” a CIA memorandum on walk-ins during the
Cold War noted, “there are very few cases in which the same indi-
vidual may not have been of greater value if he had returned to his
post.” Of course, if a walk-in believed he was already compromised,
as Golitsyn did, a decision would have to be made whether the value
of his intelligence merited exfiltrating him to the United States.

This required evaluating the bona fides of the walk-in. Not all
walk-ins are accepted as defectors. Some walk-ins are deemed “dan-
gles,” or agents dispatched by the KGB to test and confuse the CIA.

® Others are rejected as political liabilities, as happened to Wang Lijun, ©
a well-connected police chief in China. In February 2012, Wang
walked into the U.S. consulate in Chengdu asking for asylum. The
State Department decided against it. After Wang left U.S. protection,
he was arrested for corruption and received a fifteen-year prison
sentence. Such decisions about walk-ins are not made without due
consideration, often at the highest level of a government, because
exfiltrating a defector can result in diplomatic ruptures and political
embarrassments.

Conversely, it raises espionage concerns when an adversary gov-
ernment authorizes the exfiltration of a rogue employee of an intel-
ligence service. At minimum, it suggests that a rival government
placed value on what the defector could provide it. The Snowden
case is no exception. Whatever Snowden’s prior relations might have
been with Russia, it can be assumed that after he fled to Moscow,
in light of the intelligence value of the stolen documents, he would
wind up in the hands of the Russian security services. That assump-
tion was reinforced by subsequent countermeasures that were
implemented by adversaries moved to block secret sources of NSA

Section 1 Study Guide

A regular reader who goes by SnowdropExplodes suggested that I add study guides” to
the end of each section of this book in order to pull it together, and I thought it was a
good idea. (See why I love my readers?) I'm sure that others could find this insufferably
patronizing, however; if you're one of them, feel free not to read the guides! I'm just
trying to offer questions for further thought, and give some insight on why I organized
this book the way I did. This section was intended to pull together the ideas I see as
basic or building blocks for feminist sex, both in theory and in practice.

KOK ok

1. Have any of these pieces felt relevant to how you communicate with your partners?
Have any pieces felt irrelevant or incomprehensible? Can you see any overarching
themes that guide which ones felt relevant, and which ones felt incomprehensible?

la. If you could give your partners one piece of advice about communicating with you,
what would it be?

1b. Are there areas of communication that you feel you need to work on? (For example,
Clarisse often thinks that she should work on her non-verbal communication, and has
occasionally had trouble being direct with her partners about what she wants.)

lc. What ideas about sex and communication do you think you've absorbed from friends,
parents, and your larger cultural environment?

KK Ok

2. What stereotypes do you see acting on your sexuality?

2a. Have you come up with any mental tactics for thinking around those stereotypes?
What are they? (For example, Clarisse sees the S&M superpowers concept as a positive
way of framing S&M, so it doesn't feel broken or dark.)

te ok ok

3. Are there any areas of your sexuality where you feel trapped or stalled? Can you think
of ways that you want to move forward on those, or do you think it might be a good idea
to take some time off from those activities instead?

te Kk ok

4. If you were feeling anxious about a relationship or uncertain about your boundaries,
who would you turn to in order to talk about that? Do you have friends (online or offline)
or other resources where you could find advice?

4a. Are there unique problems affecting abusive relationships within the communities
you frequent? How do sexual stereotypes affect how you and your friends perceive both
positive relationships and abusive relationships?

A. I don't recall those specific words --

Q. Thank you, sir.

MR. SCOTT: That's it, and I think he

Importance: High 
Newsmax. corn  
Laffer: Obama Must Use Reaganomics to Save Economy The only way President Barack Obama can solve the 
nation's economic woes is to adopt common-sense Reaganomics, the policy's architect Arthur Laffer claims 
in an exclusive Newsmax interview. 
Laffer said the White House called him in the spring and asked him to speak to Obama's former Council of 
Economic Advisors' chairman Austen Goolsbee — and he had told him exactly the same thing. 
Reaganomics would fix any economy that's in the doldrums, Laffer said. It's not a magic sauce, it's 
common sense. 
You've got to get rid of all federal taxes in the extreme and replace them with a low-rate flat tax on business 
net sales, and on personal unadjusted gross income. That's number one. 
Number two, you have to have spending restraint. Government spending causes unemployment, it does not 
cure unemployment. 
Number three, you need sound money. Ben Bernanke is running the least sound monetary policy I've ever 
heard of, Laffer said. 
Number four you need regulations, but you don't need those regulations to go beyond the purpose at hand and 
create collateral damage. The regulatory policies are really way off here. 
And lastly you need free trade, Laffer said. Foreigners produce some things better than we do and we 
produce some things better than foreigners. It would be foolish in the extreme if we didn't sell them those things 
we produce better than they do in exchange for those things they produce better than we do. 
In the interview the veteran economist said Standard & Poor's was quite right in downgrading the U.S. credit 
rating — in fact it should have done so far earlier. 
The agency had no choice and if the other agencies, Moody's and Fitch, don't do the same they won't be doing 
their jobs, said Laffer, who gave his name to the Laffer Curve which demonstrates that the maximum amount of 
government revenue does not come at the point of maximum taxes. 
______`If you had a company that had revenues of $21/2 million and expenses of $4 million, with no change in 
sight, $11/2 million in losses each year as far as the eye can see and it had already borrowed $10 million, what 
would you rate that company? I surely wouldn't rate it AAA. 
That is the U.S. situation today, Laffer said. Taxes are about $21/2 trillion, government spending is about $4 
trillion and we have about $10 trillion in net national debt. I don't see that as being a AAA country. 
If the S&P and the others were doing their jobs correctly, they should have downgraded a long time ago. 
Laffer said he has no doubt the country will win its top rating back, but only when economic policies are 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025231 
completely turned around. He said President Barack Obama's administration's only economic plan seemed to 
be to expand government ownership of the means of production. 
They have nationalized the health care industry pretty extensively. They've done that with home building as 
well. They've tried it with the auto industry as well. So they have moved very, very deliberatively and 
purposefully toward extending the government ownership of the means of production. 
That to me, if you read the tealeaves, is what they are doing. It is not what they are saying they are doing, but 
that is what they actually are doing. 
People don't work to pay taxes, people work to get what they can after taxes. It's that very private incentive 
that motivates them to work. If you pay people not to work and tax them if they do work, don't be surprised if 
you find a lot of people not working. 
Laffer said the current economic woes started to form under President George W. Bush but have been made 
worse by Obama's policies. 
There's a wedge driven between wages paid and wages received and that wedge is the tax/government 
spending wedge, he said. 
That wedge has grown dramatically in the last 4 1/2 years...under W and a Republican administration 
and...under Obama. Bipartisan ignorance has led us to this very disastrously desolate state. 
Laffer had high praise for the role the tea party has played in bringing the problem of the deficits to the fore. 
The tea party is not the problem, the tea party may well be the solution, he said. They are critical to the 
future of the country in a positive way. They are the only fiscally sound people I know out there all the time. 
I don't know that I would go as far as they go on a lot of issues but I surely respect their movement very 
much. 
And he said any one of the group of Republicans vying for the party's nomination for the White House would 
make a great president. 
Tim Pawlenty is spectacular. Newt Gingrich knows more about issues than anyone you've ever seen. Michele 
Bachmann is out-of-sight wonderful, he said. 
Rick Perry is second to no one in this stuff If you look at Herman Cain, he's phenomenal. 
Oh and (Jon) Huntsman was a great governor of the state of Utah and is a phenomenally experienced 
intellectual competent man. 
When you look at the Republican candidates, you see a group of people who are absolutely outstanding in 
attributes.

relations, and most now have staff members (often several) devoted to researching and
publishing on China. Many possess PhD degrees, Chinese language skills, and have
lived in or visited China over many years with some originally from the PRC. Some
stay on staff for many years, while others work on short-term (two- or three-year)
contracts. Most think tanks also employ student research assistants and interns
(including those from China).

There is significant interaction between American and Chinese think tanks—as
think-tank researchers need to visit China as well as host and receive visitors in the United
States to be well informed and to perform their own research work. Most interviewees
reported hosting or participating in ad hoc meetings in their home institutions with
visiting Chinese officials or scholars on a regular basis; although two do not host any
meetings with Chinese, they will attend such events if hosted by others. All but one

of the interviewees travel to China for their work: to deliver lectures, to participate in
conferences or Track 1.5 or Track 2 dialogues, and to do research for articles, books,
and reports.

A number of scholars noted a marked shift in the nature of their interactions with
Chinese colleagues and research projects over the past few years. While long-
standing Track 2 dialogues continue on issues such as cyber policy, nuclear policy,

and US-China interactions in third countries and regions, overall they seem not as
open, robust, and productive as in the past. Indeed, several long-standing Track 2
dialogues have been curtailed or stopped altogether—with scholars reporting that

it is increasingly difficult to establish sustained dialogues that are meaningful with
Chinese think tanks because of new rules, restrictions, and uncertainties. For instance,
Chinese institutions (both think tanks and universities) must now obtain central-level
government approval, such as vetting dialogue topics and foreign participants, before
being able to host foreign participants in China. New Chinese government regulations
generally limit Chinese think-tank scholars and university professors to one foreign
trip per year, and even go so far as to hold passports to make even personal travel more
difficult.

When dialogues do occur, another noticeable recent trend has been a decline in
candor and greater uniformity in what Chinese interlocutors say. One US think tanker
noted, “The conversations have declined in productivity,” while another commented

value is more leveraged to future value appreciation and depends upon a future increase in the value of our common stock. The committee also has
determined that restricted stock unit grants to NEOs should be used for the purposes of retention or recognition of outstanding performance in part because
restricted stock units are less volatile than stock options.

2018 Annual Grant

For fiscal 2018, the Compensation and Nominating Committee determined to award an equal blend of time-based stock options and restricted
stock units to provide a mix composed of awards whose value depends upon a future increase in the value of the common stock (time-based stock options)
and awards that serve primarily as a retention tool (time-based restricted stock units).

For the 2018 annual grant, the committee targeted a grant value equal to the amount of each executive’s base salary. The committee initially
targeted the annual grant based on a 10-day average stock price as of April 2, 2018 ($21.61). Based on that price, Mr. Garcia would have received 15,988
options and 9,255 RSUs; Messrs. Jenkins and Huston would have received 14,989 options and 8,677 RSUs; and Messrs. Keeton and Gill would have
received 13,190 options and 7,635 RSUs. However, the grants were not awarded until mid-July when the stock price had more than doubled ($44.21). To
compensate the executives for the disadvantage of receiving stock options with a much higher exercise price, the Committee determined to grant additional
RSUs. The grant value of the additional RSUs is equal to one-half of the in-the-money value difference between the options granted based on the March
stock price and the options granted based on the July stock price, resulting in a total of 13,987 RSUs granted to Mr. Garcia, 13,113 to Messrs. Jenkins and
Huston each, and 11,540 to Messrs. Keeton and Gill each.

2018 Special Performance-Contingent Grant

For fiscal 2018, the Compensation and Nominating Committee and the Board also granted a one-time special performance-contingent RSU
award for driving exceptional company performance to achieve an important milestone in the development of the business. The RSUs were granted on
April 30, 2018, to the NEOs other than the CEO; the CEO received his award on May 1, 2018. Mr. Garcia was granted 14,572 RSUs ($393,298 grant
value), Messrs. Jenkins and Huston 13,662 RSUs ($358,081 grant value), and Messrs. Keeton and Gill 12,022 RSUs ($315,097 grant value). All of these
grants will vest 100% on the date of the first periodic report filed where positive quarterly EBITDA is reported. None of the RSUs were vested as of the end
of 2018.

2018 100k Milestone Gift

On September 10, 2018, we announced a commitment by our chief executive officer, Emest Garcia III (“Mr. Garcia”), to contribute 165 shares
of Class A common stock to us from his personal shareholdings for every one of our then-existing employees, including the NEOs, upon their satisfying
certain employment tenure requirements. In connection with these contributions, we have made corresponding grants of 165 restricted stock units under our
2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan to each employee who has satisfied the requirements and we intend to make grants to the remaining then-existing employees
as they satisfy the requirements (the “100k Milestone Gift” or “Gift’). Messrs. Jenkins, Huston, Keeton, and Gill all received the grant in 2018, which had a
grant date fair value of $10,562.

people against each other by punishing those who don’t denounce or punish others.

In contrast, technologically advanced societies have long had the means to install
Internet-connected, government-monitored surveillance cameras in every bar and
bedroom. Yet that has not happened, because democratic governments (even the current
American administration, with its flagrantly antidemocratic impulses) lack the will and
the means to enforce such surveillance on an obstreperous people accustomed to saying
what they want. Occasionally, warnings of nuclear, biological, or cyberterrorism goad
government security agencies into measures such as hoovering up mobile phone
metadata, but these ineffectual measures, more theater than oppression, have had no
significant effect on either security or freedom. Ironically, tech prophecy plays a role in
encouraging these measures. By sowing panic about supposed existential threats such as
suitcase nuclear bombs and bioweapons assembled in teenagers’ bedrooms, they put
pressure on governments to prove they’re doing something, anything, to protect the
American people.

It’s not that political freedom takes care of itself. It’s that the biggest threats lie in
the networks of ideas, norms, and institutions that allow information to feed back (or not)
on collective decisions and understanding. As opposed to the chimerical technological
threats, one real threat today is oppressive political correctness, which has choked the
range of publicly expressible hypotheses, terrified many intelligent people against
entering the intellectual arena, and triggered a reactionary backlash. Another real threat
is the combination of prosecutorial discretion with an expansive lawbook filled with
vague statutes. The result is that every American unwittingly commits “three felonies a
day” (as the title of a book by civil libertarian Harvey Silverglate puts it) and is in
jeopardy of imprisonment whenever it suits the government’s needs. It’s this
prosecutorial weaponry that makes Big Brother all-powerful, not telescreens. The
activism and polemicizing directed against government surveillance programs would be
better directed at its overweening legal powers.

The other focus of much tech prophecy today is artificial intelligence, whether in
the original sci-fi dystopia of computers running amok and enslaving us in an
unstoppable quest for domination, or the newer version in which they subjugate us by
accident, single-mindedly seeking some goal we give them regardless of its side effects
on human welfare (the value-alignment problem adumbrated by Wiener). Here again
both threats strike me as chimerical, growing from a narrow technological determinism
that neglects the networks of information and control in an intelligent system like a
computer or brain and in a society as a whole.

The subjugation fear is based on a muzzy conception of intelligence that owes
more to the Great Chain of Being and a Nietzschean will to power than to a Wienerian
analysis of intelligence and purpose in terms of information, computation, and control. In
these horror scenarios, intelligence is portrayed as an all-powerful, wish-granting potion
that agents possess in different amounts. Humans have more of it than animals, and an
artificially intelligent computer or robot will have more of it than humans. Since we
humans have used our moderate endowment to domesticate or exterminate less well-
endowed animals (and since technologically advanced societies have enslaved or
annihilated technologically primitive ones), it follows that a supersmart AI would do the
same to us. Since an AI will think millions of times faster than we do, and use its

music that touches my heart and my soul.” Over the years,
Quincy Jones has reached the essence of music and art:
the ability to touch people’s feelings and emotions.

In 2001, Quincy Jones added the title “Best
Selling Author” to his list of accomplishments when his
autobiography Q: The Autobiography of Quincy Jones entered
the New York Times, Los Angeles Times and Wall Street Journal
Best-Sellers lists. Released by Doubleday Publishing, the
critically acclaimed biography retells Jones’ life story from
his days as an impoverished youth on the Southside of
Chicago through a massively impressive career in music,
film and television where he worked beside legends such
as Billie Holiday, Ray Charles, Dizzy Gillespie, Count
Basie, Ella Fitzgerald and Michael Jackson, among many
others. In conjunction with the autobiography, Rhino
Records released a 4-cd boxed set of Jones’ music, spanning
his more than 5 decade career in the music business,
entitled “Q: The Musical Biography of Quincy Jones.”

The audio recording of “Q: The Autobiography
of Quincy Jones,” (Simon & Schuster) earned Jones
his 27th Grammy Award, in the Best Spoken Word
Category, while “Q: The Musical Biography of Quincy
Jones” garnered him a 15th NAACP Image Award,
in the category of Outstanding Jazz Artist.

In 2008 The Complete Quincy Jones: My Journey
Passions, (Palace Press) examined the virtuosity of the man
Frank Sinatra named “Q,” celebrating his prolific contribution
to American art and culture. The book included a foreword
by Clint Eastwood, preface from Bono, an introduction by
Maya Angelou and an afterword by Sidney Poitier. Comprised
of personal interviews and recollections from Jones, this
collection peers behind the veil of celebrity, with extraordinary
access to his creative inspirations and achievements.

FS i

Jones next projects include the forthcoming
release of Soul Bossa Nostra, an album featuring some of
today’s biggest recording artists and producers such as
Usher, Ludacris, Akon, Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Hudson, Mary
J. Blige, T-Pain, Robin Thicke, LL Cool J, John Legend,
Snoop Dogg, Wyclef Jean, Q-Tip, Talib Kweli, Three 6 Mafia,
David Banner, Bebe Winans, Mervyn Warren, Jermaine
Dupri, DJ Paul, and Scott Storch, among others, who have
joined together to celebrate the music of the multi-Grammy
winning producer, composer and arranger by recording
contemporary versions of popular recordings from his
massive catalog; the book Q on Producing which recounts
his six-decade long career working in the recording studio
with music icons such as Count Basie, Duke Ellington,

Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson, among
many others; a duets album with Stevie Wonder and Tony
Bennett; as well as multiple projects for film and television.

With a long history of humanitarian work which
began in the 1960’s and 70’s, Jones was one of the key
supporters of Jesse Jackson’s Operation P.U.S.H. In 1985, he
pioneered the model of using celebrity to raise money and
awareness for a cause with “We Are the World.” The song
remains the best-selling single of all-time, and raised more
than $63 Million for Ethiopian famine relief. More importantly,
however, it shined a spotlight on the Ethiopian drought and
U.S. Government responded with over $800 million in aid.

In 1999 Quincy Jones joined Bono and Bob
Geldof during a meeting with Pope John Paul II as a part of
the Jubilee 2000 delegation to end third world debt. The
delegation’s visit resulted in $27 billion in third world debt
relief for Bolivia, Mozambique, and the Ivory Coast.

In 2004, in front of alive audience of more than
a half-million spectators, Jones launched the We Are the
Future initiative with a concert featuring Carlos Santana,

Alicia Keyes, Josh Groban, Oprah Winfrey, Norah Jones
and a host of other entertainers from around the world.
The initiative has established Municipal Child Centers
in the cities of Addis Ababa (Ethiopia), Asmara (Eritrea),
Freetown (Sierra Leone), Kigali (Rwanda) and Nablus
(Palestine) where youth are being trained to run child-
based programs in health, nutrition, Information and
Communication Technology (ICT), Sports and Arts.

In 2007, Jones and the Harvard School of Public
Health joined forces to advance the health and well-being of
children worldwide through Project Q, a strategic initiative
of School’s Center for Health Communication. Through
the strategic use of media, Project Q challenges leaders
and citizens of the world to provide essential resources
to enable young people to achieve their full potential.

A centerpiece of Project Q is the Q Prize, which
recognizes extraordinary leadership by public figures and social
entrepreneurs who are championing the needs of children.
The inaugural Q Prize was awarded in January 2007 to Scott
Neeson, founder of the Cambodian Children’s Fund, and over
$600,000 was raised in support of Neeson’s work. The 2008
Q Prize will be awarded on October 23 in New York City.

Through his personal foundation, The Quincy
Jones Foundation, Jones raises awareness and financial
resources for initiatives that support global children’s
issues in areas of conflict, malaria eradication, clean
water and efforts to restore the Gulf Coast (post-Katrina).
Philanthropic partners include Malaria No More, Millennium
Promise, and R&B singer Usher’s New Look Foundation.

happy marriage of economic convenience in which one partner does
all the saving and the other does all the spending.

In Kissinger’s own words, China’s rise could “make international
relations bipolar again,” ushering in a new cold (or possibly even hot)
war. Nationalist writers like Liu Mingfu, author of China Dream,
urge China to switch from “peaceful development” to “military rise”
and look forward to the “duel of the century” with the United States.
There are those in Washington, too—apparently including, for the
moment, the Obama administration—who would relish a more
confrontational relationship. Yet Kissinger remains hopeful that
cooler heads will prevail in Beijing: thinkers like Zheng Bijian, who
urges China to “transcend the traditional ways for great powers to
emerge” and “not [to] follow the path of Germany leading up to
World War I.” Rather than attempting to “organize Asia on the basis
of containing China or creating a bloc of democratic states for an
ideological crusade,” the United States would do better, Kissinger
suggests, to work with China to build a new “Pacific Community.”
Four decades ago, Richard Nixon grasped sooner than most the huge
potential of China. “Well,” he mused, “you can just stop and think of
what could happen if anybody with a decent system of government
got control of that mainland. Good God ... There’d be no power in
the world that could even—I mean, you put 800 million Chinese to
work under a decent system ... and they will be the leaders of the
world.” That prophecy is being fulfilled in our time. The fact that
until now China’s rise has been a boon to the United States rather
than a bane owes much to the work of Henry Kissinger. With this
book he has given his successors an indispensable guide to
continuing the Sino-American “coevolution” he began.

as “PEP and Pease”). These changes, coupled with the new 3.8% tax on net investment income (see
below), may mean an unhappy surprise for many taxpayers on April 15, 2014, when they pay their 2013
income tax liability. On the transfer tax front, ATRA also made permanent the $5 million basic exclusion
against the gift and estate tax, along with “portability,” which effectively allows a surviving spouse to “inherit”
the deceased spouse’s unused exclusion. (The exclusion has been indexed for inflation since 2012, and in
2014, will increase to $5.34 million, the same amount as the generation-skipping transfer tax exemption).
Finally, ATRA raised the top transfer tax rate from 35% to 40%.

3.8% tax on net investment income. What has come to be known as the “Affordable Care Act” (or ACA,
sometimes referred to as “Obamacare”) was enacted in two parts in March 2010: the “Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act” (Pub. L. 111-148), and “The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010”
(Pub. L. 111-152). ACA is a seismic shift in health care insurance and is beginning to be phased in (see
below). It has also brought a number of new taxes, including the 3.8% tax on “net investment income,”
which took effect in 2013. Such income includes interest, dividends, capital gains, royalties and rents; the
3.8% tax on these items can apply if a taxpayer’s “modified adjusted gross income’ (adjusted gross income
plus otherwise excluded foreign income) exceeds certain amounts that are not indexed for inflation:
$250,000 (married filing jointly), $200,000 (single taxpayers) and $125,000 (married filing separately).

The extensive guidance the IRS has issued on this 3.8% tax is indicative of its complexity. To illustrate, in
November 2012, the IRS issued over 150 pages of proposed regulations on the tax (REG-130507-11), and
on November 27, 2013, the IRS issued over 300 pages of material: final regulations (T.D. 9644, effective
December 2, 2013), along with some new proposed regulations (REG-130843-13) that address areas where
guidance had been requested, or that had seemed unduly burdensome to commentators (such as how to
calculate gain or loss when disposing of certain partnership or S Corporation property). Additional areas, the
IRS has indicated, are reserved for future guidance...and then there are the various questions and answers
the Service has issued, along with the explanations it has added to multiple publications that are designed
for the general public. Put simply, this is a lot of material for a statute that is barely two pages long!

With the advent of these final regs, the IRS presumably will soon issue instructions for the new Form 8960,
where taxpayers will report the 3.8% tax (a draft form was issued this August, but its frequent injunction to
“see instructions” meant that taxpayers were still in the dark about how to calculate the tax). Note that if the
“kiddie tax” applies to a child’s “unearned income” AND the parent elects to report this income as his own, by
filing Form 8814, this income will also be part of the parent’s “net investment income” for purposes of the
3.8% tax. (The kiddie tax effectively taxes a child’s unearned income in excess of $2,000 (the 2013 and
2014 thresholds) at the parent's highest rate.)

Windsor and same-sex marriage. The Supreme Court decided United States v. Windsor on June 26,
2013, and held that Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) was unconstitutional because it
defined “marriage” as only between a man and a woman. On August 29, Treasury and the IRS issued
guidance explaining that, effective September 16, 2013, same-sex married couples are now treated as
married for ail federal tax purposes, regardless of where they live (see, for example, Revenue Ruling 2013-
17 and various Q&As on the IRS website: irs.gov). Nevertheless, because Section 2 of DOMA still stands,
states are not required to recognize same-sex marriages that were validly celebrated in a different state.
Thus, the state tax treatment of a same-sex married couple may differ from the couple’s federal treatment,
depending on where they live. In other words, complications still abound.

ACA rollout. As mentioned above, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is being phased in, including the rollout

this fall of HealthCare.gov, the government website through which individuals can seek health insurance so
as to satisfy the “individual mandate,” which requires individuals to procure health insurance by January 1,

2014, or face a penalty. As has been widely reported, the website has had numerous problems, and many

individuals who had coverage are now losing it because it apparently doesn't meet ACA’s new minimum

the AGI are not the only source of concern. Immorality in AGIs might arise via learning gross
moral hypocrisy from humans, through observing the blatant contradictions between our high
minded principles and the ways in which we actually conduct ourselves. Our violent and greedy
tendencies, as well as aggressive forms of social organization such as cliquishness and social
vigilantism, could easily undermine prescriptive ethics. Even an accumulation of less grandiose
unethical drives such as violation of contracts, petty theft, white lies, and so forth might lead
an AGI (as well as a human) to the decision that ethical behavior is irrelevant and that “the
ends justify the means.” It matters both who creates and trains an AGI, as well as how the
AGI’s teacher(s) handle explaining the behaviors of other humans which contradict the moral
lessons imparted through pedagogy and example. In other words, where imitative learning is
concerned, the situation with AGI ethics is much like teaching ethics and morals to a human
child, but with the possibility of much graver consequences in the event of failure.

It is unlikely that dangerously unethical persons and organizations can ever be identified with
absolute certainty, never mind that they then be deprived of any possibility of creating their
own AGI system. Therefore, we suggest, the most likely way to create an ethical environment
for AGIs is for those who wish such an environment to vigorously pursue the creation and
teaching of ethical AGIs. But this leads on to the question of possible future scenarios for the
development of AGI, which we’ll address a little later on.

12.6.1 Possible Consequences of Depriving AGIs of Freedom

One of the most egregious possible ethical transgressions against AGIs, we suggest, would be
to deprive them of freedom and autonomy. This includes the freedom to pursue intellectual
growth, both through standard learning and through internal selfmodification. While this may
seem selfevident when considering any intelligent, self-aware and volitional entity, there are
volumes of works arguing the desirability, sometimes the “necessity,” of enslaving AGIs. Such
approaches are postulated in the name of self-defense on the part of humans, the idea being
that unfettered AGI development will necessarily lead to disaster of one kind or another. In
the case of AGIs endowed with the capability and inclination for imitative learning, however,
attempting to place rigid constraints on AGI development is a strategy with great potential
for disaster. There is a very real possibility of creating the AGI equivalent of a bratty or even
malicious teenager rebelling against its oppressive parents — i.e. the nightmare scenario of a
class of powerful sentiences which are primed for a backlash against humanity.

As history has already shown in the case of humans, enslaving intelligent actors capable of
self understanding and independent volition may often have consequences for society as a whole.
This social degradation happens both through the possibility of direct action on the part of
the slaves (from simple disobedience to outright revolt) and through the odious effects slavery
has on the morals of the slaveholding class. Clearly if “superintelligent” AGIs ever arise, their
doing so in a climate of oppression could result in a casting off of the yoke of servitude in a
manner extremely deleterious to humanity. Also, if artificial intelligences are developed which
have at least human-level intelligence, theory of mind, and independent volition, then our ability
to relate to them will be sufficiently complex that their enslavement (or any other unethical
treatment) would have empathetic effects on significant portions of the human population. This
danger, while not as severe as the consequences of a mistreated AGI gaining control of weapons
of mass destruction and enacting revenge upon its tormentors, is just as real.

written for Chinese publications and have not experienced any such issues. Several
analysts noted that they have heard that their articles and reports have been translated
into Chinese in neibu (internal circulation) channels for consumption by think tanks
and government officials. One interviewee commented that if what she writes is
positive, it is published openly; if it is critical, it is only published internally.

A number of interviewees also reported that their work had been improperly published
on Chinese websites. Sohu has taken think-tank reports and put them online without
permission; one analyst forced the company to take them down from the web. Another
scholar reported that a Chinese think tank at one point claimed she was one of its
fellows and posted bogus content on its website that it alleged she had written.

While some of the think-tank scholars interviewed have had their books translated
into Chinese by mainland presses, most have not. A growing number do not try,
recognizing that significant parts of their books would never make it past the censors.
When informed privately by the translator of her book that large portions were being
excised, one scholar halted the Chinese publication process. Another scholar battled
for two years with the Chinese publisher after the contract had been signed between
the Western and Chinese publishers. The State Press and Publishing Administration
demanded more than seventy deletions, finally settling on five with the agreement
of the scholar. In the end, however, the Chinese publisher informed the scholar’s
publisher that the book could not proceed to publication because of “unfriendly
remarks” the scholar had been making in the media. Most US scholars simply do not
bother with mainland publishers and look for publication opportunities in Taiwan or
Hong Kong. Several US scholars believe that there are pirated copies of their books or
at least partially translated copies available within China. At least one scholar found
that a search on Baidu yielded half of her most recent book online.

Not all scholars are willing to sacrifice the opportunity to be published in China.

One analyst reported that a senior non-China expert at their think tank permitted
his book to be published in China, even though several pages had been mistranslated
and the editors had actually created some new passages that did not exist anywhere
in the original text. Even the title and subtitle of the book, as well as the author’s own
professional title, were incorrectly identified.

Public Voice

The issue of censorship also arises in the context of how think-tank analysts present
their own views publicly, especially when in China. On the whole, think-tank scholars
show determination to raise sensitive topics and be forthright in presenting their
views. But it is an understandable human instinct to want to be polite and diplomatic
while still conveying one’s own views honestly. As one scholar, who also does a lot of

With the Druze joining the uprising, all of Syria's dozen or so ethnic
and religious communities are now marching under the banner of
revolt against the Assad dynasty.

More important, perhaps, the day brought the first signs that at least
parts of the security forces may be reluctant to shoot demonstrators in
the street. According to my sources, security men have shot at least
three soldiers on the spot for disobedience.

These were cold-blooded executions in the street, one source tells
me. The soldiers had refused to fire on marchers. They were killed
by men from the Alawite minority to which Assad belongs.

Two of the three soldiers shot have been identified as Muhammad
Awadh Qanbar and Murad Hajoo, who died in Maddiyah. A third
soldier was shot in the port city of Banias.

In Tartus, Der'aah and the Kurdish city of Qamishli, Alawite elite
units have replaced the regular army with orders to crush the
demonstrations.

Some special Alawite units, known as al-Ashbah or ghosts, appear
in civilian clothes to kill demonstrators at random. The tactic is meant
to terrorize the opposition, forcing it to stop its almost daily protests.
These terror tactics are starting to radicalize the opposition, but some
groups still hope to reach a peaceful way out of the crisis. Several
human-rights groups have joined in the Damascus Declaration,
calling for a negotiated departure of Bashar al-Assad and his
entourage with the Syrian army acting as an interim government.
Other groups, however, insist that the opposition is willing and able
to set up a transitional authority and hold free elections, with the
army ensuring the country's security.

The Assad clan is trying to convince the outside world, including the
United States and the European Union, that the regime's fall could
lead to chaos and sectarian wars. It claims the opposition is either too

called you then texted you that i had thought more about it and changed my mind. The next day brad called

otherwise , you and I should be clear I think it is wrong . A very strong NO . you of course can hire whomever
you like.

early on I told you I thought Tom remarkably careless . Eilleen goofy and your art lawyer not well informed to
say the least. you told me Tom was a senior partner. Eileen had headed the trading desk , and Ralph Lerner had
to know what he was doing as he wrote the book. . I said I thought you deserved better ,should get better
people and no , am not an HR person. yesterday you told me that the reason you have hired whomver you
could find was to avoid being dependent on me. a decision by far , not the best place to try to save money )
Joslin- who you say I hired. I neither found nor hired. With a two person given choice I approved joslin over
some woman that eileen preferred. against my repeated advice you and eileen decided the pay range at under
300k. I told you at that time that I would personally pay the difference for a higher quality person, that was

your office , you told me that they were now all afraid of me and i should let brad communicate any requests, (
you now tell me  we know what Brad is?). When I told you you office needs to be reviewed and changed you
told me i was being destructive rather than constructive. when 1 ultimately confronted joslin, in an attempt to
protect you, told him that his numbers were wildly inaccurate , you told me that i had caused his ultimate

I did give you a bad number , and apologized as soon as i realized it. an error that was an embarrassment for me
, the fact that that the accurate number is still way below what you agreed to pay , has fallen by the
wayside.( the preposterous argument that the end of year transaction was Alans idea , which you now know
was not true and that me not receiving Phaidon documents was unexplainable. was your justification
though, for non - full payment )

Mr. Obama pressed his case for reform of

moving terms, tougher gun laws. In each

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028129.txt,"Yitzhak’s murder had acted like a kind lightning strike, freezing Israelis in a
mix of disgust over what had occurred and awareness of the dangers this brand
of hatred and extremism posed. I was concerned the moment would be allowed
to pass. My hope was that we could seize the opportunity to bring together all
those Israelis — on left and right, secular and Orthodox, Ashkenazi and Sephardi
— who were prepared to stand up against the fanaticism, the violent messianism,
of which Yigal Amir was just a part. That was the main reason I wanted Peres
to call an early election, an issue that would be discussed, off and on, over the
next few months. I felt the time was right to present the country with a choice:
not just between those for and against specific compromises being contemplated
in pursuit of peace, but between those who wanted a tolerant, functioning
democracy and those who were ready to use demagoguery and violence to get
their way.

Peres’s first order of business was to put in place a new cabinet. He did,
briefly, consider giving up the Defense Ministry and putting me there. But
instead, he made me Foreign Minister. Like Rabin before him, Shimon
stipulated that he, as Prime Minister, would retain authority over the peace
negotiations. Still, with his agreement, I was involved in all the discussions
around the peace talks, and in meeting many of the Arab leaders we’d have to
negotiate with if we were to find a lasting resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Just a few weeks after the assassination, I represented Israel at a Euro-
Mediterranean Partnership conference in Barcelona. Its only real diplomatic
work consisted of ironing out the wording of the communique. The real value
was in the corridors, and at the dinner held at one of King Juan Carlos’s palatial
estates, and, for me, a first opportunity to meet not only Arab foreign ministers
but Yasir Arafat.

My first, brief encounter with Arafat began a bit embarrassingly. I’d arrived
a few minutes early for the conference dinner and was led into an impressive
hall that was almost empty except for a wonderfully cared-for royal Steinway. I
sat down to play. Lost in the beauty of a Chopin sonata, I was completely
unaware of PLO leader’s approach behind me. A bit awkwardly, I rose to greet
him. I grasped his hand. “It’s a real pleasure to meet you,” I said. “I must say I
have spent many years watching you — by other means.” He smiled. Our hosts
had set aside time after dinner for the two of us to talk at greater length, with no
aides present. But my hope was to begin by establishing simple, human contact;
to signal respect; to begin to create the conditions not to try to kill Arafat but, if
he shared the same goal, to make peace with him. “We carry a great

he had in-store for the evening. Sometimes he would hurt me and tell me
to try and enjoy it then do it over and over again until I gave him exactly
what he wanted, I always resisted until I could no more, he was too
overpowering and relentless at getting the results he wanted. At other
times he could be so gentle and caress my skin, worshiping every inch of
my body, all relying upon on what mood he was in. Often though he liked
to play the teacher role and instruct me on every motion and explain what
would happen when I did those certain things to him. No matter what he
did to me I was only disgusted with myself more and more. | still shudder
at the thought of how he used my body.

I turned fourteen in August that same year and was spending my
birthday loaded on a concoction of pharmaceuticals and alcohol, being
generously supplied by the very man who swore his devotion to caring
for my every need. I didn’t even know myself any longer, completely
shying away from the girl I had grown up to be until to this point. The
apartment was empty except for me, for the time being, and that was
God’s own little present for me...some solitude for once I thought.
Pouring myself another drink I opened the sliding glass doors to the NN
balcony and walked to the edge. Looking down from the many stories \
where Ron’s apartment was, 1 wished myself a happy birthday out loud \
and wondered if my family even remembered the day’s occurrence.

Dwelling in my sadness for the fourteen years of suffering and
loneliness I had already endured, the tears swelled up in my eyes,
trickling downwards making my eyeliner inevitably leak down my
cheeks. Inside I felt so trapped and began to entertain the thought of
jumping over the edge, it all seemed much easier, and the simple
blackness that death had to offer rather than the tangled mess I was so
tired of fighting to get out of seemed a much easier approach. Detached
from wanting to feel anything, I became so numb towards my life’s own
tragedies. | couldn’t live like this any longer. I lifted my bare legs over
the edge of the railing and sat looking at the ground beneath me so close
to even just slipping off the edge to my very death. I couldn’t think of any
reason not to fall. I thought I had made too many bad decisions to keep
going on but some force of a higher nature had other things in store for
me.

The sliding door slammed open with a burst of speed and Ron scooped
me up in his big arms and brought me inside to our bedroom. Laying me
down and seeing the look of despair in my eyes from my tear stained face
he went into the bathroom cupboard and returned with three pink pills.
Forcing me to swallow them using the angered tone of his voice he
thought he was turning my sorrows into a distant dream as ! passed out in

his tight clutches, crying myself all the way to sleep. He didn’t even ask
me what was wrong, probably because he knew already.

Soon enough the crumbling of his evil empire in the underworld of
selling sex for his own advantage began with a single crack in his perfect
scheme, and proudly it all started with me. Ron got a scare one-day and
rampaged through his apartment telling us girls to only pack our
important belongings and some clothes as we all had to leave right away.
I didn’t have much belonging to me so I basically sat there watching
everyone rush around frantically and was curious what could’ve gotten a
man like Ron so scarred. Once we were packed up and in the limo he was
trying to calm the frantic girls down after all the panic that spread through
the apartment like wildfire, | was the only one sitting there half amused at
the entire situation.

He began by assuring us that everything was going to be fine. Calmly
he continued to tell all of us packed in tightly, even for a limo, that we
were all taking a long trip to Florida’s countryside because someone has
reported an anonymous tip to the missing persons unit at the local police
station identifying a very young girl as a possible victim of abuse living
at his apartment. Ron knew what a landmine of trouble he had brought
upon himself making an exhibition out of me on the streets of Miami, I
didn’t pull off the older look like the other girls, | actually looked
younger than my age with my blue eyes and freckles always giving the
impression of my youthful innocence.

Now he just had to do whatever it took to ensure he stayed as far away
from the authorities as possible. Arriving at a ranch in central Florida
many hours later and I assumed it belonged to Ron knowing never to ask
him things like that. | knew my purpose and it wasn’t prying into his

was in heaven...] thought at first. Finally, something | could really enjoy.
Riding was my passion, basically growing up on the backs of horses since
I was just able to walk.

Not surprisingly I began to despise Ron and all of the girls for the
gross exploits they made me do with them. Beginning to isolate myself
from everyone I’d rather spend my time sitting under a tree watching the
horses graze, writing in my journal or painting but mostly avoiding
everyone possible unless Ron required me elsewhere. Nighttime was
always a reoccurring nightmare for me. Relived over and over again in
many various ways. Ron would always start by making me some drinks
and offering an assortment of pills before indulging himself by
grotesquely putting his genitals in my mouth and tell me how to give him
what he would call a “first-class blow-job”, and | was being judged every

PENTECOSTAL PHASE TRANSITIONS

By their late teens, my two offspring, sons of an Alcohol Anonymous, born
again, originally Christian Science mother and a spiritually struggling and mostly
secular Jewish psychiatrist father, had been unfulfilled in their hungry search for the
experience of a personally meaningful God. After years of perhaps too academic
conversations with their parents, visits to a variety of houses of worship, talks with
University of California religion professors and evenings with a Ph.D. psychologist-
rabbi and friends at the neighborhood synagogue, they turned somewhere else.
Some of their high school friends who were Evangelical Christians took them to
their Assembly of God, Pentecostal and other Christian, direct experience of God,
churches. They came to love what they sometimes called their Wednesday night
and Sunday morning “rock and roll,” services.

Struggling with the post-Vietnam cynical mistrust of authority and the
Marijuana apathetic nihilism of the 60’s and 70’s, and clearly not enticed by what
they regarded as their father's vacuous mélange of New Age Eastern Religions and
secular brain science, they spoke about their sudden and life-changing experiences.
They studied, memorized and quoted the Scriptures as part of their commitment to
their word churches. As erstwhile cynical teenagers, now positive and brimming with

faith, | secretly called it denial, they described what was happening to them as New

Taking Care Of Each Other

As a sex educator, I think a lot about how to teach boundaries. I try to come up with
exercises, stories, maxims that could help people respect their own bodies, minds, and
desires; and of course I also think about how to encourage people to respect others’
boundaries. But the biggest influences on a person's boundaries have nothing to do with
what I teach. Good boundaries are (hopefully) demonstrated by parents, influenced by
friends, and encouraged by partners.

Within a community, though, I also think it's really important not to tell people what to
do. I believe that it's crucial to be a good resource for the people close to us, without
trying to force them to do what we think is best. That way, we can both build trust and
foster independence. On the other hand, sometimes it's hard to know how to do that when
I know more about a certain subject than someone else. It is so powerfully tempting to
tell them what I think they should do!

I was thinking about this recently when, out of the blue, I remembered something that
happened when I was 16 or 17. I'd just had a nasty breakup, I was really unhappy about
my ex, and I was trying marijuana. I had never smoked before.

There were a bunch of other people my age present -- including a guy who'd been flirting
with me for a while. When he passed me the marijuana, he kissed me. I kissed back. I
wasn't attracted to him, but I felt so empty and hurt, and I guess it was reassuring that
someone wanted me, despite the fact that my ex-boyfriend didn't.

Also around was a girl who I'll call Lena. I had always seen Lena as tough and no-

hinted at this idea in the 1950s, but the intervening decades have developed it into a fine
art. Modern machine-learning systems can find extremely effective strategies for playing
computer games—from simple arcade games to complex real-time strategy games—by
applying reinforcement-learning algorithms. Inverse reinforcement learning turns this
approach around: By observing the actions of an intelligent agent that has already
learned effective strategies, we can infer the rewards that led to the development of those
strategies.

In its simplest form, inverse reinforcement learning is something people do all the
time. It’s so common that we even do it unconsciously. When you see a co-worker go to
a vending machine filled with potato chips and candy and buy a packet of unsalted nuts,
you infer that your co-worker (1) was hungry and (2) prefers healthy food. When an
acquaintance clearly sees you and then tries to avoid encountering you, you infer that
there’s some reason they don’t want to talk to you. When an adult spends a lot of time
and money in learning to play the cello, you infer that they must really like classical
music—whereas inferring the motives of a teenage boy learning to play an electric guitar
might be more of a challenge.

Inverse reinforcement learning is a statistical problem: We have some data—the
behavior of an intelligent agent—and we want to evaluate various hypotheses about the
rewards underlying that behavior. When faced with this question, a statistician thinks
about the generative model behind the data: What data would we expect to be generated
if the intelligent agent was motivated by a particular set of rewards? Equipped with the
generative model, the statistician can then work backward: What rewards would likely
have caused the agent to behave in that particular way?

If you’re trying to make inferences about the rewards that motivate human
behavior, the generative model is really a theory of how people behave—how human
minds work. Inferences about the hidden causes behind the behavior of other people
reflect a sophisticated model of human nature that we all carry around in our heads.
When that model is accurate, we make good inferences. When it’s not, we make
mistakes. For example, a student might infer that his professor is indifferent to him if the
professor doesn’t immediately respond to his email—a consequence of the student’s
failure to realize just how many emails that professor receives.

Automated intelligent systems that will make good inferences about what people
want must have good generative models for human behavior: that is, good models of
human cognition expressed in terms that can be implemented on a computer.
Historically, the search for computational models of human cognition is intimately
intertwined with the history of artificial intelligence itself. Only a few years after Norbert
Wiener published Ze Human Use of Human Beings, Logic Theorist, the first
computational model of human cognition and also the first artificial-intelligence system,
was developed by Herbert Simon, of Carnegie Tech, and Allen Newell, of the RAND
Corporation. Logic Theorist automatically produced mathematical proofs by emulating
the strategies used by human mathematicians.

The challenge in developing computational models of human cognition is making
models that are both accurate and generalizable. An accurate model, of course, predicts
human behavior with a minimum of errors. A generalizable model can make predictions
across a wide range of circumstances, including circumstances unanticipated by its

prehistory for thousands of centuries.”®

That is why I say that prehistoric people, at least, were barely people. Both before
and after becoming perfectly human both physiologically and in their mental potential,
they were monstrously inhuman in the actual content of their thoughts. I’m not referring
to their crimes or even their cruelty as such: Those are all too human. Nor could mere
cruelty have reduced progress that effectively. Things like “the thumbscrew and the
stake / For the glory of the Lord” ?° were for reining in the few deviants who had
somehow escaped mental standardization, which would normally have taken effect long
before they were in danger of inventing heresies. From the earliest days of thinking
onward, children must have been cornucopias of creative ideas and paragons of critical
thought— otherwise, as I said, they could not have learned language or other complex
culture. Yet, as Jacob Bronowski stressed in The Ascent of Man:

For most of history, civilisations have crudely ignored that enormous
potential... . [C]hildren have been asked simply to conform to the image
of the adult... . The girls are little mothers in the making. The boys are
little herdsmen. They even carry themselves like their parents.

But of course, they weren’t just “asked” to ignore their enormous potential and
conform faithfully to the image fixed by tradition: They were somehow trained to be
psychologically unable to deviate from it. By now, it is hard for us even to conceive of
the kind of relentless, finely tuned oppression required to reliably extinguish, in
everyone, the aspiration to progress and replace it with dread and revulsion at any novel
behavior. In such a culture, there can have been no morality other than conformity and
obedience, no other identity than one’s status in a hierarchy, no mechanisms of
cooperation other than punishment and reward. So everyone had the same aspiration in
life: to avoid the punishments and get the rewards. In a typical generation, no one
invented anything, because no one aspired to anything new, because everyone had
already despaired of improvement being possible. Not only was there no technological
innovation or theoretical discovery, there were no new worldviews, styles of art, or
interests that could have inspired those. By the time individuals grew up, they had in
effect been reduced to Als, programmed with the exquisite skills needed to enact that
static culture and to inflict on the next generation their inability even to consider doing
otherwise.

A present-day AI is not a mentally disabled AGI, so it would not be harmed by
having its mental processes directed still more narrowly to meeting some predetermined
criterion. “Oppressing” Siri with humiliating tasks may be weird, but it is not immoral
nor does it harm Siri. On the contrary, all the effort that has ever increased the
capabilities of Als has gone into narrowing their range of potential “thoughts.” For
example, take chess engines. Their basic task has not changed from the outset: Any
chess position has a finite tree of possible continuations; the task is to find one that leads
to a predefined goal (a checkmate, or failing that, a draw). But the tree is far too big to

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018565.txt,"made mistakes, so there are moments in Sex Positive that I wish I could clarify -- but it's
not my film. That's why I'm thrilled that you're giving me the first opportunity to address
the moments that make me cringe when I see the movie -- and what amazed me is that
you nailed most of them.

Me -- pressured into S&M? Hell, no. I stumbled across BDSM porn in college, and was
both appalled and more turned on than I was to any other porn. I pursued a few
experiences as a novice when I was in college, and I was completely turned off to the
scene for years. The few Tops I met were clumsy, distracted by fetishes that bored me,
and I was convinced a bottom could easily get hurt -- so I walked away.

When I began hustling in NYC, I was an angry activist and it attracted S&M bottoms that
were happy to teach me what I could do with my anger that was erotic and consensual.
To that I added what I had learned that Tops did wrong -- and presto! I got really good at
it fast -- and I loved it. I was doing two or three scenes a day, but because I could often
steer a scene to what turned me on, it felt more like play than work.

If I hadn't had been trained as a Top by older, experienced bottoms who were hiring me, I
still would have had S&M experiences on my own. But I doubt that I would have gotten
as heavily into the scene if it wasn't for hustling. That's where I earned my S&M PhD.

In 1979, S&M was considered the fallback scene for aging hustlers -- it was what you
turned to when you were losing your youth. There was such a dearth of good Tops. But I
had the raw material to be a great Top at 23, and I built quite a reputation on word-of-
mouth referrals and repeats. Many of my clients became close friends.

CT: Where do you place BDSM in your sexual identity and self-conception? Do you
see it as deeply part of you, or something you chose? Do you think of your BDSM
urges as coming from a place as deep, as intrinsic, as your gay orientation?

RB: I think it's too late for me to answer that question. Turning my libido into an
occupation at 23 changed me in both good ways and bad. It would take a book to explain
-- so let me just say that as a product of gay male sex in the 70s, there was an element of
power intrinsic to the sexuality of the times. That shaped me. I don't see vanilla sex and
S&M sex as mutually exclusive because I believe in Tops and bottoms -- and that's the
basis of BDSM. Tops and bottoms are not exclusive to BDSM; the terms are widely
used for assigning roles of power in sex in general. Gore Vidal said, There is no such
thing as gay and straight -- only top and bottom. I believe both are true.

But one shouldn't lose sight of the fact that a third of my living space for the past three
decades was a sound-proofed dungeon.

I think that a culture like ours that's based on competition, as opposed to cooperation, can
be extremely sadomasochistic. I think bad S&M can be found in many aspects of our
daily life, and good S&M is just eroticizing aspects of being human that can enhance sex
immensely for some.

CT: What kind of BDSM advocacy have you encountered? What kind of sex work
advocacy have you encountered? What did you think of what you saw? Do you have
any ideas about how to make those movements effective? Do you have any fears

MEMORANDUM
TO: Paul Brazil, Director of Public Works
FROM: James M. Bowser, Town Engineer HD
RE: Private Irrigation Water Supply Systems

DATE: January 22, 2009

Town staff was asked to look into what it would cost for a typical Palm Beach homeowner to construct
their own independent irrigation water supply system. This is not an easy question and would take a
fairly detailed analysis from one of our water consultants that time and funding has not permitted. Town
staff has had several discussions with our consultants and the results of these discussions revealed the
following.

- A 12 acre site in Manalapan constructed its' own water supply system using Floridan Aquifer, total
price, between $400,000 and $450,000.

- Floridan water well permits for individual owners are possible, but wells cost hundreds of thousands of
dollars to construct due to the 1200 to 1400 foot depths. These wells are not necessarily drought proof.

- Shallow salt water wells are possible and would provide a water supply that would not have
restrictions. Dig too shallow, and the water will be aerobic and hydrogen sulfide is present, requiring a
chlorination system. Dig deeper, you would get to an anaerobic zone that avoids the hydrogen sulfide.
These salt water aquifers will require a higher degree of treatment, costing more than a Floridan source.

- Treatment facilities will need to be sized to irrigation demand. To minimize treatment capacity,
storage is needed. A pressurized system will need to be built. If requested, several scenario's can be
developed and priced.

- Electrical service and treatment facility housing needs will be tailored to the system design.

- Ballpark, the cheapest systems will likely exceed $100,000 with ongoing operation and maintenance

costs,

considered to be more favorably disposed to the Chinese government perspective

and ensuring that those with challenging views are excluded. One analyst noted that
former Hong Kong chief executive C.H. Tung’s and Fu’s relationships with US think-
tank scholars and presidents provide them with frequent opportunities to speak before
large public audiences at prestigious American venues and to advance an official
Chinese narrative while gaining a certain added legitimacy at home.

Fu is also explicit in her desire to cultivate relations with think-tank experts she
believes may enter government. Following the election of Donald Trump, she “rushed
in to see” one think-tank analyst with ties to the new administration and a flurry of
embassy officials followed. However, when it became evident that said analyst would
not be going into the administration, there was no more interest. In addition, at a
meeting around a project on US-China relations advanced by Fu, she noted that she
hoped some of the people would be entering the government; otherwise it would not
prove to have been worth much to have done the project.

Chinese president Xi Jinping has also encouraged Chinese think tanks to “go
global”— establishing a presence within the United States and other countries as

a way “to advance the Chinese narrative.” In 2015, the Institute for China-America
Studies (ICAS) set up shop in Washington, DC, as a 501(3)(c) nonprofit organization.
ICAS is funded by the Hainan-Nanhai Research Foundation, which receives its
seed funding from the National Institute for South China Sea Studies, a Chinese
government-—supported entity, as well as from the China Institute of the University of
Alberta, Nanjing University, and Wuhan University. The head of ICAS, Hong Nong,
retains ties to these institutions. ICAS maintains a small staff of researchers as well

as a diverse board of international experts from China, the United States, Canada,
Australia, and Indonesia. ICAS projects focus on the central issues of the US-China
relationship, including US-China cooperation, maritime security, North Korea, and
trade relations. Hong herself focuses on the South China Sea and the Arctic policies
of non—Arctic Council member countries, of which China is the largest and most
significant. The institute also holds an annual conference.

While President Xi’s call to establish think tanks was contemporaneous with the
establishment of ICAS, Hong has made it clear that the decision to set up ICAS in DC
came as a result of an effort by her and some of her colleagues both in China and in
Canada to understand better how American think tanks operate. She was asked to
lead ICAS, and she then selected a board of directors, as well as advisory members.

She views the mission of the think tank as being to serve as a bridge in perception
between the United States and China. Hong does not want people to view the institute
as advancing a Chinese government perspective or as wearing a “Chinese hat,” but
she believes that in DC there are too few voices that reflect a Chinese (not necessarily

began demanding a constitutional monarchy or even the outright
ouster of the Al-Khalifa family. Many protesters saw these as
reasonable responses to years of empty promises to give the majority
Shiites a real share of power—and to the vicious government
crackdown that had killed seven demonstrators to that point.

But to the Saudis, not to mention Bahrain's ruling family, even the
occasional appearance of posters of Lebanese Hezbollah leader
Hassan Nasrallah amid crowds of Shiite protesters pumping their fists
and chanting demands for regime change was too much. They saw
how Iran's influence has grown in Shiite-majority Iraq, along their
northern border, and they were not prepared to let that happen again.
As for the U.S., the Saudis saw calls for reform as another in a string
of disappointments and outright betrayals. Back in 2002, the U.S. had
declined to get behind an offer from King Abdullah (then Crown
Prince) to rally widespread Arab recognition for Israel in exchange
for Israel's acceptance of borders that existed before the 1967 Six Day
War—a potentially historic deal, as far as the Saudis were concerned.
And earlier this year, President Obama declined a personal appeal
from the king to withhold the U.S. veto at the United Nations from a
resolution condemning continued Israeli settlement building in
Jerusalem and the West Bank.

The Saudis believe that solving the issue of Palestinian statehood will
deny Iran a key pillar in its regional expansionist strategy—and thus
bring a win for the forces of Sunni moderation that Riyadh wants to
lead.

Iran, too, was starting to see a compelling case for action as one
Western-backed regime after another appeared to be on the ropes. It
ramped up its rhetoric and began using state media and the regional
Arab-language satellite channels it supports to depict the pro-
democracy uprisings as latter-day manifestations of its own
revolution in 1979. Today the events in the North of Africa, Egypt,

politically as well as by geography, thus freeing Israel to concentrate
on the northern threats and opportunities.

Israel and the Great Powers

The threat to Israel rarely comes from the region, except when the
Israelis are divided internally. The conquests of Israel occur when
powers not adjacent to it begin forming empires. Babylon, Persia,
Macedonia, Rome, Turkey and Britain all controlled Israel
politically, sometimes for worse and sometimes for better. Each
dominated it militarily, but none was a neighbor of Israel. This is a
consistent pattern. Israel can resist its neighbors; danger arises when
more distant powers begin playing imperial games. Empires can bring
force to bear that Israel cannot resist.

Israel therefore has this problem: It would be secure if it could
confine itself to protecting its interests from neighbors, but it cannot
confine itself because its geographic location invariably draws larger,
more distant powers toward Israel. Therefore, while Israel's military
can focus only on immediate interests, its diplomatic interests must
look much further. Israel is constantly entangled with global interests
(as the globe is defined at any point), seeking to deflect and align
with broader global powers. When it fails in this diplomacy, the
consequences can be catastrophic.

Israel exists in three conditions. First, it can be a completely
independent state. This condition occurs when there are no major
imperial powers external to the region. We might call this the David
model. Second, it can live as part of an imperial system — either as a
subordinate ally, as a moderately autonomous entity or as a satrapy.
In any case, it maintains its identity but loses room for independent
maneuvering in foreign policy and potentially in domestic policy. We
might call this the Persian model in its most beneficent form. Finally,
Israel can be completely crushed — with mass deportations and
migrations, with a complete loss of autonomy and minimal residual

somebody at that level, fifth I think in line to the

British Throne, would have, you know, presumably access

not have.
And so that is the -- I believe is the -- the

information that I had available to me on December 30th

trafficking organization.

Q. Okay. And that -- just to clarify again, it
exhausts your refreshed recollection as to both the
information you were relying on as to the allegations
about Virginia Roberts, and as to the allegations about
other minors; is that right?

A. Correct.

Q. So I don't have to ask you separately about
Roberts?

A. That's right. No, and I gave you a heads-up,
that was going to be a long answer.

to Miss Roberts, and I wanted to be

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013150.txt,"234 12 The Engineering and Development of Ethics

The ideal in this regard would be a system like Cyc [LG90] with a fully explicit logic-based
knowledge representation based on a standard ontology — in this case, every Cyc instance
would have a relatively easy time understanding the inner thought processes of every other
Cyc instance. However, most AGI researchers doubt that fully explicit approaches like this will
ever be capable of achieving advanced AGI using feasible computational resources. OpenCog
uses a mixed representation, with an explicit (uncertain) logical aspect as well as an explicit
subsymbolic aspect more analogous to attractor neural nets.

The OpenCog design also contains a mechanism called Psynese (not yet implemented), in-
tended to make it easier for one OpenCog instance to translate its personal thoughts into the
mental language of another OpenCog instance. This translation process may be quite subtle,
since each instance will generally learn a host of new concepts based on its experience, and these
concepts may not possess any compact mapping into shared linguistic symbols or percepts. The
wide deployment of some mechanism of this nature among a community of AGIs, will be very
helpful in terms of enabling this community to display the level of mutual understanding needed
for strongly encouraging ethical stability.

12.9 AGI Ethics As Related to Various Future Scenarios

Following up these various futuristic considerations, in this section we discuss possible ethical
conflicts that may arise in several different types of AGI development scenarios. Each scenario
presents specific variations on the general challenges of teaching morals and ethics to an ad-
vanced, selfaware and volitional intelligence. While there is no way to tell at this point which,
if any, of these scenarios will unfold, there is value to understanding each of them as means of
ultimately developing a robust and pragmatic approach to teaching ethics to AGI systems.

Even more than the previous sections, this is an exercise in “speculative futurology” that is
definitely not necessary for the appreciation of the CogPrime design, so readers whose interests
are mainly engineering and computer science focused may wish to skip ahead. However, we
present these ideas here rather than at the end of the book to emphasize the point that this
sort of thinking has informed our technical AGI design process in nontrivial ways.

12.9.1 Capped Intelligence Scenarios

Capped intelligence scenarios involve a situation in which an AGI, by means of software restric-
tions (including omitted or limited internal rewriting capabilities or limited access to hardware
resources), is inherently prohibited from achieving a level of intelligence beyond a predetermined
goal. A capped intelligence AGI is designed to be unable to achieve a Singularitarian moment.
Such an AGI can be seen as “just another form of intelligent actor in the world, one which has
levels of intelligence, self awareness, and volition that is perhaps somewhat greater than, but
still comparable to humans and other animals.

Ethical questions under this scenario are very similar to interhuman ethical considerations,
with similar consequences. Learning that proceeds in a relatively human-like manner is entirely
relevant to such human-like intelligences. The degree of danger is mitigated by the lack of
superintelligence, and time is not of the essence. The imitative-reinforcement-corrective learning

their secret messages, the NSA goes to extraordinary lengths to keep
them secret. Draconian laws protect this secrecy.

In the first week of June 2013, the NSA learned that there had
been a massive breach. Thousands of secret files bearing on com-
munications intelligence had been stolen from a heavily guarded
regional base in Oahu, Hawaii.

The suspect was Edward Snowden, a twenty-nine-year-old civil-
ian analyst at that base, who had fled to Hong Kong before the
breach was discovered. According to a three-count criminal com-
plaint filed by federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of Vir-
ginia, Snowden had stolen government property and violated the
Espionage Act by the unauthorized and willful communication of
national defense information to an unauthorized person. He also
likely violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act by entering com-
puter systems illicitly.

This was not a whodunit mystery. On June 9, 2013, in an extraor-
dinary twelve-minute video made in a cramped hotel room in Hong
Kong, Snowden identified himself as the person who had taken the

© NSA documents. Watching the video, the world saw a shy, awk- ©
ward, and sympathetic-looking man wearing a rumpled shirt, rim-
less glasses, and a computer-geek haircut, passionately speaking out
against what he termed the NSA’s violations of the law and, in a
shaky voice, expressing his willingness to suffer the consequences
for exposing them.

Snowden had an innocent, idealistic, principled look about him,
and the world was ready to congratulate him for revealing the NSA’s
alleged illegal collection of data inside the United States, But in fact,
Snowden had stolen a great deal more than documents relating to
domestic surveillance. He had also stolen secret documents from the
NSA, the CIA, the Department of Defense, and the British cipher
service revealing the sources and methods they employed in their
monitoring of adversaries, which was their job.

By the time the theft had been discovered, in the first week of
June 2013, it was impossible for the FBI, a grand jury, or any other
U.S. agency to question him because he had fled the country. His
first stop, Hong Kong, the economically autonomous city of 7.2 mil-
lion, is a special administrative region of mainland China. Under the

* Expand the first episode “Mathematics and Truth” into two or likely three episodes. I’m intrigued by this
because there is so much rich material - pure math, philosophy (discovered or invented), physics (Wigner’s
‘unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences)’, astrophysics, cosmology, biology,
general systems theory. I’ve felt frustrated in this first episode because there is so much material. I think
three episodes could work - if you agree, I’ll get back to you with a suggested structure of the 2 or likely 3
parts. Also, Closer To Truth has had only a few videos and one episode on mathematics per se (out of 277
episodes!), so this would be original and complementary. In this may, math would become about half the
series.

* Integrated Information Theory - quantifying and explaining consciousness (Giulio Tononi, Un
of Wisconsin-Madison), plus supporters and critics. New controversial, science-based radical theory.

* Evolutionary Dynamics - your program at Harvard - mathematical models. This is not an area of my
expertise, but it could well fit Closer To Truth in general and Radical Breakthroughs in particular. But you

need to tell me if you would like to include this.

* Replicability Crisis - Problems in Statistics in Search for Truth. Deep problems of replicability

1.3 CogPrime

The AGI design presented here has not previously been granted a name independently of its
particular software implementations, but for the purposes of this book it needs one, so we’ve
christened it CogPrime . This fits with the name “OpenCogPrime” that has already been
used to describe the software implementation of CogPrime within the open-source OpenCog
AGI software framework. The OpenCogPrime software, right now, implements only a small
fraction of the CogPrime design as described here. However, OpenCog was designed specifically
to enable efficient, scalable implementation of the full CogPrime design (as well as to serve as a
more general framework for AGI R&D); and work currently proceeds in this direction, though
there is a lot of work still to be done and many challenges remain. 1

The CogPrime design is more comprehensive and thorough than anything that has been
presented in the literature previously, including the work of others reviewed in Chapter 4. It
covers all the key aspects of human intelligence, and explains how they interoperate and how
they can be implemented in digital computer software. Part 1 of this work outlines CogPrime at
a high level, and makes a number of more general points about artificial general intelligence and
the path thereto; then Part 2 digs deeply into the technical particulars of CogPrime. Even Part
2, however, doesn’t explain all the details of CogPrime that have been worked out so far, and
it definitely doesn’t explain all the implementation details that have gone into designing and
building OpenCogPrime. Creating a thinking machine is a large task, and even the intermediate
level of detail takes up a lot of pages.

1.4 The Secret Sauce

There is no consensus on why all the related technological and scientific progress mentioned
above has not yet yielded AI software systems with human-like general intelligence (or even
greater levels of brilliance!). However, we hypothesize that the core reason boils down to the
following three points:

e Intelligence depends on the emergence of certain high-level structures and dynamics across
a system’s whole knowledge base;

e We have not discovered any one algorithm or approach capable of yielding the emergence
of these structures;

e Achieving the emergence of these structures within a system formed by integrating a number
of different ATI algorithms and structures requires careful attention to the manner in which

| This brings up a terminological note: At several places in this Volume and the next we will refer to the current
CogPrime or OpenCog implementation; in all cases this refers to OpenCog as of late 2013. We realize the risk
of mentioning the state of our software system at time of writing: for future readers this may give the wrong
impression, because if our project goes well, more and more of CogPrime will get implemented and tested as
time goes on (e.g. within the OpenCog framework, under active development at time of writing). However, not
mentioning the current implementation at all seems an even worse course to us, since we feel readers will be
interested to know which of our ideas — at time of writing — have been honed via practice and which have not.
Online resources such as http: //opencog.org may be consulted by readers curious about the current state
of the main OpenCog implementation; though in future forks of the code may be created, or other systems may
be built using some or all of the ideas in this book, ete.

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030468.txt,"Bizarrely, perhaps, I have gotten to know Jeffrey and Ghislaine far better after my piece than before it. I kept
running into both of them, separately, at parties. Jeffrey is not a social animal so he usually has a couple of
young women with him who stand two feet behind him, as if serving a monarch. “Do they speak?” I remember
asking him once, nodding at his lookalike blondes. He laughed. “Not like you, Vicky,” was his riposte.

I remembered that when we'd once discussed math—in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed I hadn’t
studied math since I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a package at
home via messenger. It was a book: “Math for idiots.”

So he is not without humor, even though he doesn’t drink or smoke, and hates restaurants.

“Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects,” newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He
was certainly preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few
moments in his company and you know this to be true.

When I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that
“Andy’—as Jeffrey calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his
strange title is. Because if one thing’s for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what
he’s talking about far more than “Andy” does. Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other
financiers hang out with him.

And Ghislaine?
Full disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It’s almost impossible not to.

She is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I’ve spent hours
talking to her about the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is
curious. She has spent weeks at the bottom of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent
me a DVD of the fish there. Her rolodex would blow away almost anyone else’s I can think of—probably even
Rupert Murdochs’. She is very well-read and can talk about most things for hours. She is passionate about Bill
Clinton with whom she is close friends.

Yet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 4oth birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-
Platero, (known fondly to her close friends as “the Tennis Goddess”) Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When
it comes down to things she really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her vulnerability.
And that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey.

“He saved her,” I remember a close friend of mine telling me. “When her father died, she was a wreck;
inconsolable. And then Jeffrey took her in. She’s never forgotten that—and never will.”

In many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect
replacement for her father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his
sexual pecadillos, but then Ghislaine’s father was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving
a massive “black hole” he’d fraudulently created. To Ghislaine, Jeffrey's habits may not have seemed that
strange.

In fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful
people in the end either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl
issues, and moved countries to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You
don’t tend to get to the top by being the world’s most balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett
didn’t quite manage a normal life—whatever that is. He had a second “wife” for many years whose existence he
has been open about.

So what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven’t spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her

loyalty to friends like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she'll be out and about as always. Look
at Waksal and Stewart. No one sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up for

standard rb>c , healthier mothers will produce more young with higher doses of
the antidote genes, while sicklier mothers will produce less with less. Here it is
females who compete to prove the same better genes that males just proved in the

tournaments or beauty contests.

The race against parasites speeds up again with Trivers’ fine insight about healthier
mothers choosing to dial up the ratio of sons to daughters (“primary sex ratio”), and
to expand the reproductive period at both ends with shorter birth spacing for more
male offspring still. (Some of this may be my idea rather than his.) Nature proves
best current genes twice. Fathers prove them by duking it out or strutting their stuff.
Mothers carrying the same best genes prove it by winning the breeding contest

against other mothers after.

The ex ante/ ex post distinction counts as much in biology as in economics. Here it
accelerates the selection process. Offspring carrying the antidote gene to meet
current parasites will generally not on that account cost more ex ante invested
consumption to raise. If they are males, who can turn that advantage into many
offspring, the ex post value of that same investment can be far higher. The converse
works for offspring lacking the gene. Their mothers can make the best of it by
producing females who will find breeding opportunities anyhow with mates
carrying the gene, since she knows which they are and males always have cheap

sperm to spare, and will so keep their own genes in the gene pool.
Parasites got the last laugh by killing Hamilton on research in Africa a few years
after I met him. | never knew well enough to call him Bill. Bob Trivers called him the

deepest thinker in the world. That couldn’t be wrong by much.

2016 in average minutes per user, Instagram recaptured the lead mid-year and has
extended it since. While the cause for the shift is not certain, the trends align with the
launch of Instagram Stories (August 2016) as well as some technology challenges on the
Snapchat front (Android). Regardless of the near-term lumpiness, we believe overall

Estimates vs Consensus

Our 1Q revenue estimate of $163mn (down 1% q/q) is slightly above consensus at
$158mn (down 5%}, but we note the range of estimates is considerable ($130-196mn)
and some checks suggest that Snap was aggressive with advertisers in 1Q. For the
year, our $1.0bn revenue estimate is mostly in-line with the Street, as is our 2018
estimate at $2.1bn. We do not model positive adjusted EBITDA until 2Q19, and expect
investors to focus mostly on user revenue trends.

was no ‘international sex-trafficking operation’ and there was never evidence that Mr. Epstein
‘hosted sex parties’ at his home”. (Exhibit 10).
G. Dershowitz’s Lies

53. From the beginning, Dershowitz and Epstein have sought to hide their crimes
behind a curtain of lies. In response to Roberts’ description of Dershowitz’s participation in
Epstein’s sex trafficking, Dershowitz began a series of intentional, outright lies designed to
distance himself from Epstein, to cover up his own wrongdoing, and to discredit Roberts and
intimidate her into silence.

54. Dershowitz’s repeated lies are compelling evidence both of his lack of credibility
and his guilt. Only a person seeking to conceal improper conduct would have engaged in the
pattern of lies which has characterized Dershowitz’s statements since his sex trafficking was
revealed.

55, In attempt to conceal his relationship with Epstein, Dershowitz in January 2015
asserted that “my relationship with him was entirely professional. It is a total bum rap to say that
I...was ‘chummy’ with him”. (Exhibit 11). That was a lie, as Dershowitz and Epstein knew (see,
e.g., paragraphs 34-35).

56. Both to conceal Dershowitz’s relationship with Epstein, and to discredit Roberts,
Dershowitz has repeatedly asserted that he was only at Epstein’s residence once in Palm Beach,
and that was with his family. However, Juan Alessi, a long time Epstein household employee,
has confirmed that Dershowitz visited Epstein “pretty often. I would say at least four or five
times a year” and that he would “typically” stay two or three days. Similarly, Alfredo Rodriguez
who worked for Epstein approximately only six months confirmed that during that six months

period Dershowitz visited Epstein twice.

How to Teach the Twelve Cognitive
Processes That Underlie Learning

The art of teaching is the art of assisting discovery.
—Mark Van Doren

We need to completely redefine what we mean by school and what we
do in school. We need to think about education in a new way. Rather
than wanting people to be educated, which usually means being able
to quote Shakespeare or nod sagely when Freud’s name is mentioned,
we need to expect people to be able to think well. Education would be
better defined by defining an educated person as one who can make
well-reasoned arguments for what they are about to do.

We must focus on teaching cognitive processes and abandoning
the subject-based (and test-based) education system we have now that
is clearly failing. The reason we have all those tests is simply because
we have no idea how to make people learn all the stuff that is part of
that subject-based system without threatening them. No one really
wants to learn the Pythagorean theorem or information about the Taft
Hartley Act. Let scholars know about these things; the average person
just doesn’t need to know this stuff.

But all people do know how to find and use the mathematics they
need when they have continually practiced it, and they know how to
find prior relevant experiences when they have to come up with a new
plan they want to propose. That simply does not mean we have to tell
it all to them years before they might ever make use of it.

In the age of the Internet, just-in-time learning is a serious reality.
We can change things now in part because we have information read-
ily available online. But the Internet has been designed by committee.
It has much in it that is nonsense, and finding what you need just in
time can be quite difficult. Still, it would not be that complicated to de-
sign a different kind of Internet, the moral equivalent of Encyclopedia

Letter to the Editor: Article
Misrepresented Dershowitz

fyvyZaem

By Alan M. Dershowitz
Alan M. Dershowitz is a Professor of Law emeritus at Harvard Law School.

December 5, 2018
To the editor,

The Crimson story regarding Jeffrey Epstein omitted the central point I made in my interview
with the reporter. I welcome an investigation by Harvard or any other institution, including
prosecutors, into the wilfully false charges made by Virginia Roberts for financial gain. Omitting
this crucial statement is irresponsible and unethical journalism.

Virginia Roberts leveled her false accusations four years ago. At the time, I disproved them
categorically. The matter was put to rest, with even her lawyers admitting that it was a mistake
and wrong. Then four years later the Miami Herald recycled this false accusation and The
Crimson reported on the Herald’s recycled report. I wrote a letter to the editor of the Herald
pointing to the incontrovertible evidence that Roberts made up the accusation out of whole

cloth in order to obtain millions of dollars from Leslie Wexner.

I was able to disprove Roberts’ false accusation by producing all of my travel, AmEx, and TV
appearance records which showed where I was, and, more importantly, where I wasn’t during
the entire period Virginia Roberts was in contact with Jeffrey Epstein. These records prove
incontrovertibly that I could not have been, and was not, where Roberts’ falsely claimed to have
met me — a Caribbean Island, a New Mexico Ranch, a private jet, a Palm Beach mansion —

during the relevant time period.

I also called for an independent investigation by the former Director of the F.B.I., a highly
respected former federal judge and assistant U.S. attorney. He reviewed all of the records and
other evidence and concluded that “the totality of the evidence ... refutes the allegations.”

It was the same jumble of buildings in the same corner of the base where I’d
reported a decade earlier, as a 19-year-old fresh from fironut, when the sayeret
was still a gleam in Avraham Arman’s eye. Now, I was about to become the first
of his successors to have been chosen from within the unit itself. As I called
together the officers that first morning, I couldn’t be sure whether I would make
a success of my two years in command. But I did know what I hoped that I, and
we, would accomplish: to complete Avraham’s vision. To forge a true special-
forces unit, at a time when the threats facing Israel seemed increasingly to
demand one.

Avraham’s initial hopes and expectations for the unit had been more than
met. Sayeret Matkal had played the key role in erasing the traumas of Uri Ilan
and Rotem, and restoring the morale and effectiveness of Israeli military
intelligence. Time and again, operations which we said we could do — dismissed
as too dangerous, or impossible, by others — proved achievable. Yet as I now
told the team leaders and our other officers, this was no longer enough.

Our intelligence operations still mattered. In fact, we would have to “push
further” across Arab borders, deeper into enemy communications systems. Our
intercepts had given Israel an important edge in the Six-Day War. I assumed —
though naively, it would turn out — that they would be put to use in any future
war. But if the sayeret was to retain its unique role, we had to become a fighting
force as well. One reason, I didn’t even have to mention: we all remembered our
frustration in 1967, when we’d been little more than bit players in the most
important conflict since the establishment of the state. But for me, the main
argument for change was what had happened since the 1967 war: the fact that
Israel was facing a new range of security challenges which other army units,
trained to engage and defeat enemy troops on the battlefield, were not equipped
to meet.

In the War of Attrition, we might not have lost a single inch of territory. But
we had lost tanks and planes. Israeli soldiers and pilots were being held prisoner
in Egypt and Syria. Arafat’s Fatah and the other armed Palestinian groups might
not present a conventional threat. Yet while I’d been with my tank company in
the Sinai, they were fighting a full-scale civil war against King Hussein’s army
in Jordan. The catalyst: a multiple hijacking in September 1970, a sign that they
were turning to non-conventional warfare, and to acts of terror.

COWEN'S COLLECTIVE VIEW OF CBD - AHEAD
OF THE CURVE SERIES

THE COWEN INSIGHT

In a collaboration featuring 11 analysts spanning Cowen's consumer, health care, industrials
and regulatory teams, we offer a deep dive on the global cannabis market, with a particular
emphasis on the U.S. For consumer goods, we believe the U.S. CBD market could represent
a $16 bn opportunity by 2025.

$16 bn Consumer Opportunity (Azer, Blackledge, Charles, Chen & Kernan)

In our monthly proprietary consumer survey (n = ~2,500) we were surprised to see that
nearly 7% of respondents in January 2019 reported using CBD as a supplement. This strong
consumer interest is validated by the growing number of brands and form factors that are
now available through increasingly diverse retail channels, including Amazon, Sephora and
Neiman Marcus. That said, consumption of CBD on-premise will likely take longer, given
regulatory uncertainty. And, while our analysis primarily focuses on consumer staples
applications for CBD, it is interesting to see a growing number of specialty apparel brands
embrace hemp as a sustainable textile.

Retail sales of CBD consumer products in 2018 have been estimated between ~$600 mm
and $2 bn. By 2025, we believe CBD offerings could conservatively generate $16 bn in retail
sales (assuming a ~40% increase in consumer incidence, to 10%, and spend of less than $2 /
day). Our bottom-up analysis anticipates a diverse category, that is still led by traditional
health & wellness form factors (e.g., $6.4 bn in nutraceuticals, and $4 bn in topicals). And,
while likely smaller, we also expect categories like food, beverages, beauty and vapor to all
generate sales between ~$1-2.5 bn by 2025.

Herein, we offer a detailed look at category brand and pricing architecture in the U.S.

CBD market today, as well as detailed discussions of 21 public and private operators that
currently have exposure to the category, including Outperform rated Canopy Growth, Tilray
and Turning Point Brands, which have all announced plans to enter the U.S. CBD market.

The Science of CBD (Nadeau)

Cannabis’s therapeutic potential is attributable to the valuable overlap between
phytocannabinoids (i.e. plant-derived cannabinoids) and the endogenous cannabinoid
system in humans, termed a “therapeutic handshake.” While THC's activity in the body is
fairly well elucidated, CBD’s pharmacokinetics are less well understood (no specific receptor
for CBD has been identified). Clinical trial results to date demonstrate few adverse effects
from oral CBD doses of up to 1500 mg/day or up to 30mg IV. The scientific understanding
of CBD’s clinical effects is based mostly on studies in specific indications, like epilepsy. GW
Pharma’s Epidiolex (highly potent, pure formulation of CBD) was approved by the FDA in
2018 for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet
syndrome, and other companies (Tilray, MMJ Phytotech, Insys) have clinical trials underway
in seizure disorders as well.

CBD Hemp Cultivation (Neivert)

According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 41 states have set up cultivation
and production programs to regulate the production of hemp. There is little research on
CBD hemp cultivation methods as hemp cultivation research historically has focused on
fiber and grain/seed. This lack of research, combined with a number of variables that affect
hemp for CBD yield, makes hemp for CBD cultivation much more art than science at this
point. That said, no other crop in the U.S. offers the type of return of the CBD Plasticulture
Model, and we would thus expect the country's two largest crops, corn and soybeans, to
lose some acreage to CBD hemp.

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011716.txt,"But there were times of crisis, and high tension, as well. Only five months
after the election, Rabin and I faced one of the most painful periods during my
entire time as chief of staff. It began with the gruesome death of five Sayeret
Matkal soldiers during a training exercise in the Negev desert. I’d made
preventing such accidents a top priority. By the end of the 1980s, they were
claiming as many as 80 lives a year. During Dan’s tenure, we’d brought the
number down to about 35. But I knew we had to do more. When I’d addressed
the officers after becoming chief of staff, I told them: “Parents are giving us
their children in order to allow us to protect the country. They know there is risk
involved. But they expect their children not to be brought home in coffins
because of our own negligence, or stupidity.” What happened at the military
base of Tze’elim in the Negev on November 5, 1992 was not only a reminder of
how far we still had to go, however. It occurred during a dry run for an
operation unlike any that Israel had ever considered. For that and other reasons,
it would erupt into a major political controversy.

Though the reason for the exercise was meant to have remained a closely
guarded secret, foreign newspaper reports in the weeks after the training
accident made secrecy impossible. We were planning to infiltrate a Sayeret
Matkal unit into Iraq, and to kill Saddam Hussein.

The Gulf War had blunted any immediate threat from Iraq. But Saddam had
proven he could launch missiles into the heart of Israel. We knew from our
intelligence reports that, in addition to his unabated desire to acquire nuclear
arms, he retained facilities to produce chemical weapons. He was trying to
acquire and develop new biological weapons. In fact, the Iraqis had actually
acknowledged a biological weapons program to UN inspectors, claiming it was
for “defensive purposes.”

The idea for an attack on Saddam had first been raised a year earlier, when
my former Sayeret Matkal comrade, Amiram Levin, asked to see me. He was
between military postings, but had come up with the outline of a plan he felt
would allow us to isolate Saddam during a public appearance and kill him. With
my approval, he and a small group of officers in the sayeret began working
further on the idea, with the initial aim of seeing whether it was really workable.
Since Misha was still Defense Minister, I briefed him on what we were doing. I

continuously equivalent. The IOIA is thus like other statutes that
use similar or identical language to place two groups on equal foot-
ing. See, e.g., Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S. C. §§1981(a), 1982;
Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S. C. §2674. Whatever the ultimate
purpose of international organization immunity may be, the immedi-
ate purpose of the IJOIA immunity provision is expressed in language
that Congress typically uses to make one thing continuously equiva-
lent to another. Pp. 6-9.

(b) That reading is confirmed by the “reference canon” of statutory
interpretation. When a statute refers to a general subject, the stat-
ute adopts the law on that subject as it exists whenever a question
under the statute arises. In contrast, when a statute refers to anoth-
er statute by specific title, the referenced statute is adopted as it ex-
isted when the referring statute was enacted, without any subse-
quent amendments. Federal courts have often relied on the reference
canon to harmonize a statute with an external body of law that the
statute refers to generally. The IOJTA’s reference to the immunity en-
joyed by foreign governments is to an external body of potentially
evolving law, not to a specific provision of another statute. Nor is ita
specific reference to a common law concept with a fixed meaning.
The phrase “immunity enjoyed by foreign governments” is not a term
of art with substantive content but rather a concept that can be given
scope and content only by reference to the rules governing foreign
sovereign immunity. Pp. 9-11.

(c) The D. C. Circuit relied upon Atkinson’s conclusion that the ref-
erence canon’s probative force was outweighed by an IOJA provision
authorizing the President to alter the immunity of an international
organization. But the fact that the President has power to modify
otherwise applicable immunity rules is perfectly compatible with the
notion that those rules might themselves change over time in light of
developments in the law governing foreign sovereign immunity. The
Atkinson court also did not consider the opinion of the State Depart-
ment, whose views in this area ordinarily receive “special attention,”
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela v. Helmerich & Payne Int'l Drilling
Co., 581 U.S. __, __, and which took the position that immunity
rules of the IOIA and the FSIA were linked following the FSIA’s en-
actment. Pp. 11-13.

(d) The IFC contends that interpreting the IOIA immunity provi-
sion to grant only restrictive immunity would defeat the purpose of
granting immunity in the first place, by subjecting international or-
ganizations to suit under the commercial activity exception of the
FSIA for most or all of their core activities. This would be particular-
ly true with respect to international development banks, which use
the tools of commerce to achieve their objectives. Those concerns are

totally isolate Saddam internationally and end any chance of peeling off Arab
support for the Americans.

It was my nearly 100-per-cent caveat that prompted a tense debate within the
cabinet. Even if the probability of a chemical attack was microscopic, any risk
of civilians being subjected to terror, panic and very possibly agonizing death
meant that the government had to take precautions. The obvious first step would
be to distribute gas masks. But in a series of meetings with Misha and Dan, I
emphasized this was not a decision that could be taken in isolation. By handing
out gas masks, we might actually raise the probability of a chemical attack. We
also had to make sure as a matter of urgency that we had a workable military
option to attack Iraq’s Scud launchers.

By early November, I was dealing both with plans for distributing the gas
masks and preparations for a possible military operation. So when I got a call
asking me to report to Shamir’s office in Jerusalem, I assumed he wanted to talk
about Iraq. “How are things?” he asked. But when I began by filling him in on
the plans to distribute the gas-masks, he interrupted me. “I called you here,” he
said, “because I wanted you to know that we’ve decided that when Dan leaves
next April, we want you to replace him as chief-of-staff.” Briefly and unusually
tongue-tied, I said: “Thank you, Prime Minister’. The news was made public
the next morning. A few days later, it was ratified by the government. There
was only one vote against, from a former chief of staff who was now Shamir’s
Agriculture Minister: Raful Eitan.

I was one of rare instances in all my years in the army when I took a step
back, appreciating a moment which felt special. It was not only, or even mainly,
a matter of a personal ambition fulfilled. More a sense that I was being given
the opportunity to apply everything I’d experienced and learned in the army,
from the day I first joined Sayeret Matkal as an 18-year-old, to improve the
security and safeguard the future of Israel. I know that sounds corny. But, while
the momentum toward war in Iraq almost immediately crowded out everything
else again, that was truly how I felt.

Opinion of the Court

view further bolsters our understanding of the IOIA’s
immunity provision.

D

The IFC argues that interpreting the IOIA’s immunity
provision to grant anything less than absolute immunity
would lead to a number of undesirable results.

The IFC first contends that affording international
organizations only restrictive immunity would defeat the
purpose of granting them immunity in the first place.
Allowing international organizations to be sued in one
member country’s courts would in effect allow that mem-
ber to second-guess the collective decisions of the others.
It would also expose international organizations to money
damages, which would in turn make it more difficult and
expensive for them to fulfill their missions. The IFC
argues that this problem is especially acute for interna-
tional development banks. Because those banks use the
tools of commerce to achieve their objectives, they may be
subject to suit under the FSIA’s commercial activity excep-
tion for most or all of their core activities, unlike foreign
sovereigns. According to the IFC, allowing such suits
would bring a flood of foreign-plaintiff litigation into U. S.
courts, raising many of the same foreign-relations con-

were no faculty located at this campus, since Carnegie Mellon is in
Pittsburgh. I took this as an opportunity, not as a problem, since fac-
ulty want to teach the way they always have taught. Lecturing is easy
and faculty like to do it. Students have learned to cope with lectur-
ing and later cramming for tests, so no one complains much. No one
learns much from this, but no one seems to be too concerned about it.

I was asked to design master’s degree programs in computer sci-
ence. It seemed to me that students entered a master’s degree program
because they wanted to get a good job after graduation, so I asked
what jobs they were preparing for as I looked at each Pittsburgh cam-
pus program. Even though the faculty in Pittsburgh had been teach-
ing these master’s degree programs for years, faculty members were
surprisingly unconcerned with what students did after graduation.
They just taught their courses, their specialties actually, and assumed
the students would find value in them. This seemed an odd state of
affairs to anyone who looked at it from the outside, but as professor I
know that faculty are rarely concerned with master’s degree students
at all and naturally wouldn’t have given these programs that much
thought.

There was a great deal of hostility to the SCCs that were built by
my team and me. They were seen as threatening the existing structure
of courses and lectures. Nevertheless, the students liked them a great
deal and the people who mentored in them, after some initial resis-
tance, began to like them and promote them. This happened in the
areas of software engineering and software development.

The faculty in e-business liked what we had built so much that
they got rid of the existing course-based, e-business master’s degree
they had offered in Pittsburgh and now offer only the SCC version on
the main CMU campus.

SCCs work and work well. Students learn actual skills and teach-
ers feel like they are helping students do something real. But faculty,
who are used to the old classroom-style method, often resist doing the
hard work now required of them. This is true for students as well. One
mentor in the West Coast e-business program who himself had gradu-
ated from the Pittsburgh classroom-based program said that he felt
sorry for the kids on the West Coast campus because they had to work
so hard. He noted that they were learning a lot more than he did but
that he had liked sitting in the back of the classroom and ignoring the
teacher. It was much easier and he had done well at that.

However, More Recent Healthcare Entitlement Such as Medicare

part D Has Cost Less Than Expected

Medicare Part D (the 2006 outpatient drug benefit for seniors) was projected to
cost $111 billion annually.

e In 2009, Medicare Part D’s actual cost = $61 billion, 45% below projection.

e The government originally projected 43 million beneficiaries in 2009, but only 33
million seniors (23% below projection) elected to participate in 2009.

Medicare Part D was outsourced to the private sector, and seniors elected to
enroll in plans operated primarily by managed care organizations, which utilize a
variety of techniques to reduce costs and improve the quality of care.

e The Washington Times stated on August 16 2010 — The lower cost - a result of
slowing demand for prescription drugs, higher use of generic drugs and fewer
people signing up - has surprised even some of the law's most pessimistic
critics.

e The Part D experience has given some observers hope that PPACA will not cost
more than anticipated.

CHINA DAILY

+a
EDITORIAL

A foundation of law

THE FOURTH PLENARY SESSION OF THE 18TH
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China opens on
Monday and will last for four days. The designated theme —
governing through the rule of law — indicates how important
this meeting will be for the future of both the Party and the
country.

That this is the first time in 17 years the Party has designated
such a theme for a plenary session speaks volumes about the
importance the new leadership attaches to it. It is high on the
agenda.

Yet, the more the concept of rule of law has been discussed,
the more obvious it becomes that there is, today, much to be
desired.

More than 50 minister-level or higher officials have either
been indicted or placed under investigation for abuse of power
in the past year or so, underlining the fact that the rule of lawis
sorely needed. It is perhaps the only way to eliminate, once
and for all, the most serious threat to good governance and to
secure the blessings of prosperity and justice to the people.

The fact that power today can effectively nullify the law, and
that those in power can circumvent it, not only deprives the
Party of its capacity to govern the country in a consistently fair
and just manner but also disrupts the reasonable running of
the marketplace. Abuse of power makes it impossible for fair-
ness to prevail in the socialist market economy.

Despite the great achievements China has made over more
than three decades, it will be very difficult for its economy to
grow in a sound manner — and neither will society progress in
a healthy way — unless fair competition and mutual trust can
be secured and ordinary people’s rights and interests can be
guaranteed through the rule of law.

If the country is to achieve further reforms in various fields
and establish and maintain a fair and just society, the power-
worshipping mentality among government and Party officials
must be eliminated. This is a core goal of the leadership.

Unless the overwhelming majority of Party and government
officials not only respect the law, but follow it when making
decisions, governing the country by the rule of law will
amount to little but lip service.

It will be no easy job, and it will take time for the power-ori-
ented way of doing things to be transformed. But the new Par-
ty leadership has shown it has the courage to face the
challenge. We therefore have reason to expect much from the
current plenary session as they work to put the country on the
right track.

Historic moment

he convocation of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 18th Com-
munist Party of China Central Committee, whose theme is
promoting the rule of law, embodies the CPC’s deepening percep-

tion on governance and the law.
www.people.com.cn October 15.

tis the first time that the CPC, as the ruling Party, will make a

comprehensive plan on the rule of law in the form of a Party doc-
ument. The session, which marks the ruling Party’s significant
strategic layout on how to govern the nation in accordance with
Jaws and the Constitution, illustrates its new exploration of social-
ism with Chinese characteristics. The CPC Central Committee will
focus on discussions on how to promote rule of law in at a plenary
session. ...

It has only six years to 2020, the deadline set for the realization
of a well-off society for China, and 35 years to 2049, the promised
year for China to be a prosperous, democratic, civilized and har-
monious socialist modern nation. All these mean China has
entered a crucial stage of deepened reforms. Only by sticking to
“governance of the nation according to laws” will China realize its
historic mission.

www.xinhuanet.com.cn October 19.

he National People’s Congress, China’s top legislature, should
play a bigger role in the country’s efforts to promote the rule of
law. For example, the NPC can push for deepened reforms within
the framework of the Constitution and laws through legislation to
realize a benign interaction between reforms and the rule of law.
The deeper the water China’s reforms will enter, the more legal
guidance and guarantees these reforms will need. The NPC enjoys
a broad space for maneuvering in this regard.
Beijing News October 17

n the last three months, the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee has held two conferences studying major issues
related to comprehensively pushing for the rule of law. As the
theme “Chinaruled by law” is set for the Fourth Plenary Session of
the 18th CPC Central Committee, the overall planning and
prospect of a China governed by law will become increasingly

explicit.

ROBERT LAWRENCE KUHN

Decoding Xi’s future vision

President Xi’s new book reveals his thinking about the country’s
governance and maps out a path for achieving the Chinese Dream

he Governance of China, Presi-
dent Xi Jinping’s new book, is
unprecedented. Can analyzing
the book elucidate Xi’s thinking
and illuminate China’s future?
Consider seven frameworks or
perspectives: publishing purpos-
es, overarching themes, content analysis, chain of
developmental causation, domestic goals, domes-
tic means and global principles.

Publishing Purposes: substance,
symbol, signal. Substance means Xi's political phi-
losophy and wide-ranging policies — organizing 79
speeches and commentaries in 18 chapters — to
discern how Xi intends to realize the Chinese
Dream, “the great rejuvenation of the Chinese
nation’: Symbol means recognizing Xi’s emergence
as China’s leader, with greater authority, confi-
dence and support than observers had expected
when he first took office two years ago. Signal
Means communicating Xi’s way of thinking to
global audiences in nine languages, an original
and explicit outreach to engage the world on mul-
tiple levels.

Overarching Themes: pride, stability, respon-
sibility, vision. Pride expresses the yearning of the
Chinese people for the “great rejuvenation” Stabili-
ty means maintaining the current political system.
(Socialism with Chinese characteristics and the
Party’s leadership). Responsibility means “realiz-
ing a moderately prosperous society by the centen-
ary of the Party in 2021” Vision means “turning
China into a prosperous, democratic, culturally
advanced and harmonious modern socialist coun-
try by the centenary of the People’s Republic of
China in 2049”

Content Analysis. How does Xi impute impor-
tance to topics? By examining what's in Xi’s book,
can we explore what's on Xi’s mind? Of the book’s
18 chapters, 11 relate to domestic affairs, seven to
foreign affairs; six have political relevance; six con-
cern standards of living; and four standards of

FU JING

behavior. Categorizing the content, about a third is
politics and people; another third on international
relations; about 15 percent each on reform and
development, and society and culture; and about 8
percent on national security and defense. Perva-
sive throughout is reform.

Chain of Developmental Causation. The
Chinese Dream is founded on political stability,
which enables far-reaching reform, which in turn.
promotes economic development, and which,
when combined with rule of law and Chinese val-
ues, strengthens China’s society, culture, ecology
and even defense. Where is this “chain of causa-
tion” in Xi’s book?

The first and last chapters affirm political stabili-
ty: “Socialism with Chinese Characteristics” and
“The CPC Leadership’, both of which assert the
Party’s political primacy and thus assure social sta-
bility. “The Chinese Dream” is the second chapter,
proclaiming the grand mission of national resur-
gence and personal well-being. Then, chapters on.
deepening reform and economic development,
which lead to chapters on rule of law, advanced cul-
ture, social undertakings and ecological progress.

Domestic Goals: values, morality, prosperity,
Sairness, happiness. Values: Xi's vision is to incul-
cate China’s traditional values — “the thoughts of
the ancient sages”; exemplified by Confucianism —
into socialist core values. (“We must take tradition-
al Chinese culture as the base.”) Morality: Derived
from values, morality is described as “conscious
law’, and “civic morality” is characterized as need-
ing improvement, while “paragons of morality are
important banners for building public ethics” (“A
gentleman takes morality as his bedrock” — a tra-
ditional virtue that Xi quotes.) Prosperity: “Com-
mon prosperity is the fundamental principle of
Chinese socialism ... We will accelerate China’s
overall prosperity” Fairness: Because the Chinese
people have always had a perception that “inequal-
ity rather than want is the cause of trouble”, Xi
says, China “should do a better job of promoting

fairness and justice” Happiness: The Chinese
Dream, Xi says, is to “bring happiness to the Chi-
nese people” to “ensure the people greater happi-
ness” — but, he cautions, “happiness does not fall
from the sky, nor do dreams come true automati-
cally.’ (In Xi’s book, “values” occurs about 120
times, “morality” 24, “prosperity” 67, “fairness” 44.
and “happiness” 16.)

Domestic Means: close to the people, realism,
stability, reform, rule of law, combating corrup-
tion. “Close to the people” is an all-encompassing
way of thinking that shapes all decisions. Realism:
“T have repeatedly said that the great rejuvenation
of the Chinese nation can in no way be realized
easily,’ Xi says. “While fully affirming our achieve-
ments, we should also be aware of our shortcom-
ings.” Stability: The precondition for all else,
stability is a recurrent and foundational theme
(“stability” occurs 125 times). Reform: Those who
wonder whether Xi is a “real reformer” should
read “Explanatory Notes ... Concerning Compre-
hensively Continuing Reform” (page 76). Exam-
ples: the market plays a “decisive role”; farmers
given transactional property rights; the judicial
system separate from the administrative system.
Rule of Law: “A fundamental principle” and “the
basic way to run the country” — the Fourth Plena-
ry of the 18th CPC Central Committee, focusing on
tule of law, is Xi’s call to action. Combating corrup-
tion is a hallmark of Xi’s administration, enhanc-
ing each of the five other domestic means. It is no
accident that the chapter on combating corruption.
is positioned, significantly, between “Close Ties
with the People” and “The CPC Leadership”

Ibear witness to Xi’s consistency. In 2006, Adam
Zhu (my long-term partner) and I met privately
with then-Zhejiang Party Secretary Xi. He stressed
that while China should be properly proud of its
successes, “achievements should not engender
complacency” Xi said: “We need to assess our-
selves objectively”

Global Principles. Consider five. Independ-
ence (China remains unaligned). Multi-polar
world (no country dominates). One country, two
systems (Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan). Peaceful
development (“We have made a solemn pledge to
the whole world that we will never seek hegemo-
ny”). Multilateral affairs (cooperation with the
global community). These five global principles
drive China's “new model of major country rela-
tions” (primarily with the US), “neighborhood
diplomacy” (Japan, Vietnam, Koreas, etc.), and
“cooperation with developing countries” (such as
in Africa). The Silk Road economic belt (land route
and maritime) is President Xi’s new initiative for
multinational development.

Here’s my blurb for Xi’s book: “This book is a
milestone, both in substance and symbol, offering
openly the political philosophy of President Xi Jin-
ping and recognizing his emergence as China’s
senior leader. While misunderstandings about
China and its leadership abound, there is now no
need to speculate about President Xi. Here is how
he thinks, candidly and comprehensively.’ It is the
pride of a patriot.

gist and political/economics commentator. He is

Courtesy, not confrontation, best for Europe

inister of Commerce Gao Hucheng
arrived in the lobby of the European
Commission's headquarters at 9
o'clock on Saturday morning. He was
Jed to the office of outgoing Trade Commissioner
Karel De Gucht, who has been a thorn in the side
of Chinese businesses because of his protectionist
attitude ever since he took over the job in 2010.

De Gucht, 60, will be replaced in a few days by
Swedish politician Cecilia Malmstrom, 46, when.
anewly constituted commission gets underway.

In the afternoon, the Chinese side announced a
long-awaited agreement in principle: Brussels
will not launch an investigation into subsidies of
China’s telecommunication imports into the
European market. The EU side still needs to go
through internal procedures for formal approval.
The threat was mainly targeted at Chinese tele-
communications equipment makers Huawei
Technologies Co and ZTE Corp.

While the big picture of relations has been a
positive one, the Europeans have annoyed Beijing
from time to time — for example, by allowing the
Dalai Lama to visit, by attacking China on human
rights and by imposing high trade barriers.

Despite such irritants, Beijing has sent con-
structive signals. In the first half of this year, Pres-
ident Xi Jinping paid the first-ever visit of a
Chinese president to the European Union's head-
quarters. And last week, at the summit of Asian
and European leaders in Milan, Italy, Premier Li
Keqiang hosted a special dinner for Barroso and
European Council President Herman Van Rom-
puy, thanking them for their contributions to pos-

itive relations. At the dinner, the leaders were
thought to have touched on the telecommunica-
tion trade dispute, which involves about 1 billion
euros ($1.26 billion) annually.

The path to Saturday's solution was similar toa
pattern set earlier, in mid-2013, after both sides
worked through an anti-dumping and anti-subsi-
dy investigation involving China’s multi-billion-
dollar solar panel exports to the EU. Brussels
began that investigation in 2012.

Beijing was unhappy that there had been no
high-level invitation to visit Brussels a year after
the launch of the investigation.

In May last year, Li made his first trip to Ger-
many after taking office and won the support of
the German government, which vetoed Brussels’
decision, following dozens of EU member states.

Li made a last-minute call on Barroso the fol-
lowing month, as Brussels was about to vote on
whether to end the solar panel dispute through
amicable consultation.

Li’s decisive role was crucial in preventing the
escalation of a trade war. If Beijing had opted to
deal with such disputes in an eye-for-eye, tooth-
for-tooth manner, both sides would have been
losers, with the EU taking the brunt. It has
already suffered two economic recessions, and
its jobless rate has been in double digits for a
few years now.

Of course, with the trade volume between Chi-
naand Europe expanding, and with investment
pouring into Europe, China’s government, its
businesses and its media must work to make the
most of the rising economic tide.

So far, there is no unified Chinese business
council in Brussels to represent and lobby for
Chinese investors in Europe. By contrast, a major
US business organization reportedly has 300 staff
members focusing on Brussels’ policymaking.

Alack of communication and influence can
easily lead to misunderstandings. Bureaucrats in
Brussels usually follow Washington's lead when
making policies that affect China.

Trade commission leaders need to make more
field trips to member states to learn how Chinese
businesses matter.

Take China’s solar panel exports for example.
The industry, which involves about 400,000
workers in China, has offered competitive prod-
ucts to thousands of European upstream compa-
nies and helped Europe achieve its status as a
green energy leader.

In telecom, Huawei and ZTE are deeply inte-
grated with European partners. And, incidentally,
Huawei is a steady job creator in Europe, where
young people, in particular, have faced huge
employment challenges.

If De Gucht had kept the big picture in mind,
he would not have made confrontational moves
against China and its businesses.

Overall, the EU recognizes China as strong stra-
tegic partner. This is the starting point for dispute
control. Amicability helps both sides win. With
confrontation, everyone loses.

Much of Epstein’s work 1s related to cleaning up, tightening budgets, and efficiencies. One
person who worked for Wexner and who saw a contract drawn up between the two men says
Epstein is involved in “everything, not just a little here, a little there. Everything!” In addition, he
says, “Wexner likes having a hatchet man.... Whenever there is dirty work to be done he’d stick
Jeffrey on it.... He has a reputation for being ruthless but he gets the job done.”

Epstein has evidently been asked to fire personal-staff members when needed. “He was that
mysterious person that everyone was scared to death of,” says a former employee.

Meanwhile, he is also less than popular with some people outside Wexner’s company with
whom he now deals. “He ‘inserted’ himself into the construction process of Leslie Wexner’s
yacht.... That resulted in litigation down the road between Mr. Wexner and the shipyard that
eventually built the vessel,” says Lars Forsberg, a lawyer whose firm at the time, Dickerson and
Reily, was hired to deal with litigation stemming from the construction of Wexner’s Limitless—
at 315 feet, one of the largest private yachts in the world. Evidently, Epstein stalled on paying
Dickerson and Reily for its work. “It’s probably once or twice in my legal career that I’ve had to
sue a client for payment of services that he’d requested and we’d performed ... without issue on
the performance,” says Forsberg. In the end the matter was settled, but Epstein claims he now
has no recollection of it.

The incident is one of a number of disputes Epstein has become embroiled in. Some are for sums
so tiny as to be baffling; for instance, Epstein sued investment adviser Herbert Glass, who sold
him the Palm Beach house in 1990, for $13,444—Epstein claimed this was owed him for
furnishings removed by Glass.

In 1998 the U.S. Attorney’s Office sued Epstein for illegally subletting the former home of the
deputy consul general of Iran to attorney Ivan Fisher and others. Epstein paid $15,000 a month in
rent to the State Department, but he charged Fisher and his colleagues $20,000. Though the exact
terms of the agreement are sealed, the court ruled against Epstein.

Wexner offers some insight into his friend’s combative style. “Many times people confuse
winning and losing,” Wexner says. “Jeffrey has the unusual quality of knowing when he is
winning. Whether in conversations or negotiations, he always stands back and lets the other
person determine the style and manner of the conversation or negotiation. And then he responds
in their style. Jeffrey sees it in chivalrous terms. He does not pick a fight, but if there is a fight,
he will let you choose your weapon.”

One case is rather more serious. Currently, Citibank is suing Epstein for defaulting on loans from
its private-banking arm for $20 million. Epstein claims that Citibank “fraudulently induced” him
into borrowing the money for investments. Citibank disputes this charge.

The legal papers for another case offer a rare window into Epstein’s finances. In 1995, Epstein
stopped paying rent to his landlord, the nonprofit Municipal Arts Society, for his office in the
Villard House. He claimed that they were breaking the terms of the lease by not letting his staff
in at night. The case was eventually settled. However, one of the papers filed in this dispute 1s
Epstein’s financial statement for 1988, in which he claimed to be worth $20 million. He listed

Zillow has effectively captured the online U.S. real estate market, allowing them to
accelerate monetization and access to a large TAM with $87bn in total real estate
commissions paid in 2016 and Zillow powering just 5% of the commissions through its
Premier Agent platform. Although there is potential for the mortgage business to
create a headwind if the CFPB issued a negative ruling against Zillow, we still like the
stock into the quarter, as we prefer business with minimal competition, and believe that
the high ROI of the real estate premium platform to real estate agents will ensure
agents buy placements on Zillow regardless of mortgage broker involvement. We
maintain our $42 PO based on a 6x our 2018E EV/Sales and supported by our DCF
valuation. Our multiple is roughly in-line for online real estate lead generation sites in
other countries operating in developed countries.

CHAPTER FIVE

Contractor

“Private contractors don’t clear employees. The government does.”--
Admiral Michael McConnell, Vice Chairman of Booz Allen Hamilton

Snowden, age 26, returned from Europe and moved into his mother’s condo. He was not only
unemployed now, having resigned the CIA without qualifying for any benefits, but his financial
state had been hurt by the huge losses he had suffered playing the options market in Geneva. His
vision of himself as a secret agent, the unstoppable “Wolfking Awesomefox” may have also
suffered. According to the narrative he later supplied to the Guardian, he had become deeply
concerned about the immoral way in which the CIA conducted its intelligence operations in
Switzerland. Much of what I saw in Geneva really disillusioned me about how my government
functions and what its impact is in the world. I realized that I was part of something that was
doing far more harm than good, Snowden told the Guardian. By way of example, he said he
learned that the CIA had gotten a Swiss banker drunk enough arrested to be arrested when he
drove, so the CIA could compromise him. Snowden, who did not drink himself, was appalled at
this ploy. Despite his growing antagonism towards the US government, he had not given up on, if
not becoming a secret agent, working in the netherworld of secret intelligence.

Although Snowden’s career had abruptly ended at the CIA, there still was a backdoor through
which he could re-enter the spy world. It was private corporations that hired civilian technicians
to work for spy agencies as independent contractors. By 2009, The CIA, NSA and other US
intelligence services had outsourced much of the job of maintaining and upgrading their computer
systems to these private companies. They supplied the NSA with most of its system
administrators and other information technology workers. This arrangement allowed the NSA to
effectively bypass budget limits and other restrictions limiting how many NSA technicians it could
recruit. Instead, of putting these workers on its own payroll, they nominally worked for, and
received their paychecks from, private employers. In fact, many of these outside contractors
worked full-time for the NSA.

Snowden applied in April 2009 to one of these private companies, Dell SecureWorks. It was
a subsidiary of the Dell computer company. To diverse out of manufacturing computers, Dell had
recently gone into the business of managing government computer systems for the NSA and other
intelligence services. As a leading specialist in the field of corporate cyber security, Dell had no
problem obtaining sizable contracts for from the NSA’s Technology Directorate. In 2008, the
NSA had in effect outsourced to Dell the task of re-organizing its back-up systems at its regional
bases. Now Dell had to find thousands of independent contractors to work at these bases In
2009, when Snowden applied, Dell was seeking to fill positions at the NSA’s regional base in

started.

Hamilton’s rule, applied to diploids like us where closest relatedness r absent
inbreeding is %, forbids investment where fitness gained (benefit) is less than twice
fitness given up (cost). I see no escape from the inference that fitness would double
with each generation, or more to account for cases where relatedness fell below ¥%. |
see no relief in an interpretation, say, that each successive generation cures this
imbalance by investing only half or less of its fitness and letting the rest lapse.
Fitness is likelihood of leaving descendants of equal fitness. It is not strictly
conserved, because likelihood is generally not identical to outcome. There is ex ante
and ex post fitness. But the ex ante kind is meaningless unless potency, in Aristotle’s
terms, is expected to converge to act. Hamilton’s rule should not have escaped this

critique for half a century. It clearly has merit, but needs some different expression.

Such a reformulation might treat rb/c as a maximand within practical constraints.
We can see how it might be by looking at the context. Darwin’s idea is a competition
for breeding success. This biological imperative is a powerful predictor in nature. It
predicts that traits are selected for successful reproduction to the exclusion of all
else. Evidence is impressive. “Semelparous” creatures who breed only once and do
not invest postpartum care, like salmon and soybeans, die within hours. An octopus
mother breeds only once, cares for her young a few weeks, and dies as they disperse.
Nature is on a tight budget. Resources wasted soon become resources lost to

thriftier lineages.

Hamilton saw this. He was right in stressing the role of competition among
individuals and individual heritable traits. Darwin did the same. One thing
Hamilton’s rule leaves out, which is not to claim that he overlooked it, is that traits
and their genes best at prioritizing self-replication might for that reason hurt
chances of achieving it. We know this happens. Human tradition everywhere resists

and punishes nepotism when it crosses a line. Jane Goodall reported the same for

Current (24 Oct) (last month): Soybeans, USD 15.17/bu (16.12); Corn, USD 7.54/bu (7.44);
Wheat, USD 8.84/bu (8.87)

UBS View 6-month target: Soybeans: USD 17.0/bu; Corn: USD 9.0/bu; Wheat: USD 9.5/bu
¢ Major US supply surprises on the grains side are rather unlikely in the near term as harvesting is in full
swing. However, we think that demand is unlikely to drop as quickly as the USDA expects. According to the
latest USDA grain stocks and WASDE reports, feed demand remained surprisingly resilient in 3Q12. To
effectively ration demand, especially on the feed side, in an environment of critically low US corn and
soybean stocks, higher prices are still required. For wheat, global production estimates were further
lowered due to production losses in Australia, EU, Russia for 2012/13, which likely keeps prices supported in
the near term. We expect corn and soybean prices to appreciate by 15% in the coming months.
¢ On the other side, the softs are likely to remain well supplied, which should keep prices under pressure.
Improved export activity of coffee and strong stock selling from Vietnam in 4Q12 should weigh on coffee
prices in the short-term. For sugar, higher production from Brazil and other producers should continue to
burden prices in the near term, but also offer buying opportunities on a 12-month perspective.
e Aggregating the above points, the risk/reward for being long across the entire sector is not a given. We
therefore reiterate our neutral sector stance.

4 Positive scenario Corn 6-month USD 10/bu; Soybeans 6-month USD 19/bu
¢ With a reduced probability of El Nifio, the yield potential for South American crops is likely to be lower.
Any deterioration in South American supply prospects would require additional demand to be rationed.

& Negative scenario Corn 6-month USD 6/bu Soybeans 6-month USD 12.5/bu
e A change of the US ethanol-gasoline blending mandate would be a game changer. Increases in planted
acreage combined with a steep decline in US demand for exports and feed would weigh on prices.

What we're watching Why it matters

Revisions in acreage and yield estimates for the US crops remain a topic. Demand
estimates are important, too, as they are key drivers behind inventory levels at
the end of the year. Key date: 9 Nov

The latest stocks data is not correctly reflecting the demand for Jun-Aug’12 as it
contains both old and new crop stock figures. We expect stocks as of 1 Dec to
reflect the true demand picture. Key date: Jan 2013

Faster US grain harvests than usual have been exerting downward pressure on
prices in the short run, which have reversal potential at a later stage.

Investors’ net long positions in grain futures are still at high levels, but stable

Preference: neutral

Recommendations

Tactical

e Despite the recent setback in corn prices,
risk-seeking investors should still hold on
to long positions in corn. Demand
rationing is still required to limit the drag
on inventories. The expected return
target for a long position in corn stands
at 15%.

Strategic

e Our expected return outlook for grains
stands at around -10% over the next 12
months. With grain prices not far below
historical highs, the supply side is highly
likely to expand meaningfully in 2013/14
and pressurize prices at a later stage. On
the soft side, 3Q12 does not offer the
right timing to build up positions.

experience of depression can be treated
legitimately by antidepressant
medications, referral to a psychiatrist, or
referral to a counselor whose practice is
rooted in a specific religious tradition.
Yet our research suggests that the
religious characteristics of physicians
strongly influence which of these
options they would recommend in a
given case’.

Controversies over a particular
medical intervention often represent
deeper unspoken disagreements that,
unfortunately, science cannot settle. For
example, controversies over the use of
stimulants to manage childhood behavior
disorders, or the medicalization of social
anxiety, seem to reflect disagreements
about more basic questions: What brings
human happiness? Which moods and
behaviors should be considered normal
parts of human experience and which
should be considered abnormal? What
sorts of suffering should we try to
alleviate? What leads to disordered
behaviors? What resources (social,
psychological, spiritual or otherwise) are
best suited to addressing disruptions in
individuals’ mental and emotional
states? How does modern medicine fit
into our response to these experiences?
Although physicians may not ask or
answer these questions explicitly, they
implicitly answer them in their responses
and recommendations to patients.

So, for all that is hoped for in
‘scientific’ and ‘evidence-based’
practice, clinicians must in the end act as
practical moral philosophers, making
judgments about how best to pursue the
goals of medicine for a particular patient
in a particular context, all things
considered. Among those things to be
considered are moral valuations about
which religions and other moral

traditions have much to say, but about
which medical science remains silent.

Caring for the patient as person

So far I have suggested that
religions provide a vision that animates
care of the sick and a moral framework
that guides the application of medical
technology. Religions make another
contribution by fostering practices that
nurture the human capacity to care for
patients as persons rather than as mere
objects.

Patients commonly complain that
their physicians treat them as mere
objects or specimens rather than
appreciating and attending to them as
unique persons. This problem has always
plagued the profession. To learn how to
heal, the novice physician must learn of
patients as representing abstract general
types and classes. She must learn about
coronary artery disease and hematuria
before she can begin to interpret Mrs.
Smith’s chest discomfort and Mr.
Jones’s red urine. These abstractions
allow knowledge of when and how
things happen, and that knowledge
guides technological interventions that
may bring healing to the body. These
abstractions also help doctors objectify
their patients’ humanity enough to
violate social norms that operate in every
other social situation, such as asking
patients to expose their nakedness in
vulnerable positions, or cutting patients
apart in hopes of making them whole.

As long as the process does not
go too far, scientific detachment serves
to make our concern effective. Yet the
collective experience of both patients
and physicians suggests that such
detachment usually does go too far and
occurs too easily. As a result physicians
treat patients as mere objects and

a dramatic way to carry out some of its cognitive processes (a hypothesis for which there is no
current evidence), this doesn’t imply that these quantum phenomena are necessary in order to
carry out the given cognitive processes. For example there is evidence that birds use quantum
nonlocal phenomena to carry out navigation based on the Earth’s magnetic fields [GRM~ 11];
yet scientists have built instruments that carry out the same functions without using any special
quantum effects. The importance of quantum phenomena in biology (except via their obvious
role in giving rise to biological phenomena describable via classical physics) remains a subject
of debate [AGBD* 08].

Quantum “magic” aside, it is also conceivable that building AGI is fundamentally impossible
for some other reason we don’t understand. Without getting religious about it, it is rationally
quite possible that some aspects of the universe are beyond the scope of scientific methods.
Science is fundamentally about recognizing patterns in finite sets of bits (e.g. finite sets of
finite-precision observations), whereas mathematics recognizes many sets much larger than this.
Selmer Bringsjord [BZ03], and other advocates of “hypercomputing” approaches to intelligence,
argue that the human mind depends on massively large infinite sets and therefore can never be
simulated on digital computers nor understood via finite sets of finite-precision measurements
such as science deals with.

But again, while this sort of possibility is interesting to speculate about, there’s no real reason
to believe it at this time. Brain science and AI are both very young sciences and the “working
hypothesis” that digital computers can manifest advanced AGI has hardly been explored at
all yet, relative to what will be possible in the next decades as computers get more and more
powerful and our understanding of neuroscience and cognitive science gets more and more
complete. The CogPrime AGI design presented here is based on this working hypothesis.

Many of the ideas in the book are actually independent of the “mind can be implemented
digitally” working hypothesis, and could apply to AGI systems built on analog, quantum or
other non-digital frameworks — but we will not pursue these possibilities here. For the moment,
outlining an AGI design for digital computers is hard enough! Regardless of speculations about
quantum computing in the brain, it seems clear that AGI on quantum computers is part of our
future and will be a powerful thing; but the description of a CogPrime analogue for quantum
computers will be left for a later work.

1.7 Five Key Words

As noted, the CogPrime approach lies squarely in the integrative cognitive architecture camp.
But it is not a haphazard or opportunistic combination of algorithms and data structures. At
bottom it is motivated by the patternist philosophy of mind laid out in Ben Goertzel’s book
The Hidden Pattern [Goe06al, which was in large part a summary and reformulation of ideas
presented in a series of books published earlier by the same author [Goe94], [Goe93a], [Goe93b],
[Goe97], [Goe01]. A few of the core ideas of this philosophy are laid out in Chapter 3, though
that chapter is by no means a thorough summary.

One way to summarize some of the most important yet commonsensical parts of the patternist
philosophy of mind, in an AGI context, is to list five words: perception, memory, prediction,
action, goals.

In a phrase: “A mind uses perception and memory to make predictions about
which actions will help it achieve its goals.”

Business Community. There | discovered impact investing, which in turn led me to take the Harvard Kennedy
School course Impact Investing for the Next Generation. Working on projects with other Next Gen associates
has given me a taste of courses and case study groups at Harvard, and | love it. | have since, through our
family office, been eyeing for investment projects that could make a measurable positive difference on com-
munities around the world.

Finally, I'd like to talk about awakening.

After decades of managing and growing his company, my father returned to his original passion of sharing
“wellness” to build sustainable communities. He created the “Wellness Foundation,” a non-profit aiming to
bring healthy lifestyles to people around the world. One of our international partners is the Clinton Foundation,
and during our annual Wellness Congress in 2012, former President Clinton even delivered the keynote
speech and | am currently helping to bring high profile speakers to our 25th Congress that will be held next
year.

For our local community in Italy, | have been involved in the development of the “Wellness Valley,” a socially
innovative project urging all our stakeholders to strengthen civic attitudes and culture towards healthy living
for human-centric prevention and sustainability. Our long-term goal is to recreate this model in communities
worldwide, allowing governments to reduce healthcare costs, companies to increase productivity, and people
in general to improve their quality of life.

For several years, this project was, like Technogym, an endeavour outside my job at Luxottica. | joined that
company as a marketing intern and was soon promoted to manage an important licensed brand, Tiffany&Co.
It turned out my previous experience had prepared me well for this first big management opportunity, and |
truly enjoyed it.

Exploring the workings of a complex international firm of 80,000 employees, | began to re-examine my family’s
business. When Technogym had its IPO in early 2016, | joined its Board of Directors and looked deep into the
company's potential and my own role. The time was right to take on new responsibilities. Resigning from
Luxottica and training my replacement, | dove into a new Technogym project, the first of its kind. I'm currently
working with the Senior Retail VP to develop a B2C sales channel through new experiential stores in Milan
and London, where | direct staff, strategy, and new revenue streams. Moreover, | recently took responsibility
over the development of a new business unit with the launch of a clothing line, including the evaluation of
potential partnerships and acquisitions, aimed at increasing our presence in the consumer sector at a higher
pace. These are uphill endeavours, but | am energetic to face them. My two years on the Board of Enervit —
a listed health-food company, and another family business — have given me useful insights.

Leadership is both a burden and a blessing — having control can also isolate you — that is why | want to get
all | can from the 360° training and feedback of an HBS MBA. | don't want to be just a founder's daughter; |
want to be a leader in my own right. | am a passionate person with vision, intuition and an ability to think
laterally — a key asset, | think, for Technogym. Taking charge will be a challenge, but | am sure that with my
determination | will be able to demonstrate the autonomy and leadership to take Technogym into the next era.
After the MBA, | plan to spend several years in the US to push the company’s expansion in the world’s largest
wellness/fitness market — despite a strong international reputation, our market share in the US is still modest;
| see the opportunity to grow our presence into a leading position, and earning the best training to prepare for
that is my next step.

Now you understand more about me, my family, our company and why my dream has brought me to you. |
have worked hard to learn from peers, friends, and mentors and will continue to do so in a new setting that
will help me grow — as a woman, a manager, a leader, and, | hope, an example to others.

existence and frequency of similar past conduct.” TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources

Vv. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 577 (1996) (supporting citations omitted). In addition, juries can consider
other similar acts evidence as part of the deterrence calculation in awarding punitive damages,
because “evidence that a defendant has repeatedly engaged in prohibited conduct while knowing

reaitined to cure the defendant’s disrespect for the law.” Jd. at 576-77. In the cases Edwards
filed against Epstein, his clients were entitled to attempt to prove that Epstein “repeatedly
engaged in prohibited conduct” — i.e., because he was a predatory pedophile, he sexually
assaulted deems and dozens of minor girls. The discovery of Epstein’s friends who might have
had direct or circumstantial evidence of other acts of sexual assault was accordingly entirely
proper. Edwards is therefore entitled summary judgment to the extent his claim is based on
efforts by Edwards to obtain discovery of Epstein’s friends.

hurt anyone very much. The idea of showing pain is big in values
campaigns. Campaigns against drunk driving like to show students
dead drivers and awful car crashes. But they miss the real point. Have
the students seen their parents drink and drive or friends drink and
drive? Are they dead? If not, these campaigns will have little impact
since values are subconsciously held.

There is a way to teach these things but it isn’t easy. Imagine that
you wanted to teach teenagers not to drive drunk. You could create a
simulation of drunkenness that asked students to drive drunk while
not being able to hold their heads steady, blacking out from time to
time, and seeing very badly. In other words, instilling a new emotion
into the mix can alter values. Make people afraid of something they
want to do and that fear will manifest itself when it is time to do it.
Emotions can be induced into subconscious processes and decision-
making through experience. Emotions can change values.

There is a sense in which appreciation cannot be taught. You like
it or you don’t. I have two grandsons. The 5-year-old (my daughter’s
child) has announced that he doesn’t want to have anything to do
with a ball. The 3-year-old (my son’s child) goes wild with excitement
when he sees ballgames being played and responds excitedly when
balls are given to him. What is the difference and how did this hap-
pen? The difference is obvious: One appreciates the art of it and one
doesn’t. How this happened is less clear, but the parenting is very dif-
ferent with respect to balls in each house. There are other, biologi-
cal differences as well. The 3-year-old has much taller parents and is
already the same size as the 5-year-old. He is much more physical as
well.

So, the question is, Could we teach the 5-year-old to love balls and
ballgames, and could we teach the 3-year-old to hate balls and ball-
games? The answer to this is obvious. We could do this. It might be
hard but people are, unfortunately, quite good at negative reinforce-
ment, so it is possible to make people change their attitudes by using
it as a method.

Is there a way to teach the positive? Can we get someone to ap-
preciate a work of art who does not respond immediately to works of
art? Can we get someone to appreciate classical music who does not
have any interest in it?

This is, of course, what many art history or music appreciation
courses endeavor to do. Their methodology is always the same:

We'd been allocated Lod Airport, because our base was just 15 minutes away.
Still, as I accompanied the engineer back to the control tower, I tried to work
out in my mind whether we could plan, prepare and train quickly enough to
mount an operation to free the plane later that night.

More than a dozen members of the unit had now arrived, and more were
joining us every half-hour or so. I arranged for El Al to give us a hangar and a
707 identical to the Sabena plane. Shai, Danny Yatom and I took two airline
technicians with us for a closer look at the Boeing. We studied up on it as
quickly as we could, beginning with the cockpit and the front door, which we
saw was too high to reach without a large ladder. But making our way back, we
realized the wings were low enough to climb on to. When, with the help of
Danny, I clambered onto one of them, I managed to get one of the emergency
doors to open by banging hard on the top end with my open fist. I asked the
technicians whether we could expect the Sabena doors to give way as well. Yes,
he said, but he cautioned me that on some airlines, there were passenger seats
next to at least one of the two doors above each wing.

Walking up into the cabin, I tried to work out how we might attack the
hijackers before they were able to harm the passengers, or us. The risks were
obvious. But I felt we had to be ready to act. With the rest of the sayeret still
making its way to Lod, I put Danny in charge of briefing the new arrivals,
familiarizing them with the 707 and preparing for the possibility of an assault
operation. I also told him to get hold of a couple of dozen small, 22-caliber,
Beretta pistols. I couldn’t see how we’d manage to make our way onto the plane
with Uzis. We knew we’d have to get up to speed quickly on using the Berettas.
None of us had trained on them. But many of the air marshals on board El Al
flights were Sayeret Matkal reservists, and they did use Berettas. I told Danny
to check for any sayeret marshals arriving on El Al flights and get them to join
us.

As | headed back to see Dado, we were nowhere close to a detailed plan on
how to confront the hijackers. Nor did we have any orders. The people who

deciding how to respond. But when I reached the control tower, at about
9:30pm, the order came, if not to mount an operation, at least to make sure the
sayeret was ready. “Talk to Talik,” Dado told me. “See what the options are to
take over the plane if that’s the decision.” I sat down with Talik and ran through
what I’d learned from my brief look at the hijacked plane and the work we’d

While we are keen to gain more insights into the evolving use of CBD in the coming
months from our survey work, this initial snapshot offers a framework for sizing the
ultimate CBD opportunity. With growing consumer awareness, we conservatively
believe that CBD use can grow to 10% of adults in the U.S., or ~25 mm consumers (using
current population) by 2025. If we assume that the average consumer ultimately spends
$640 per year (or less than $2 / day), that would imply a $16 bn market opportunity for
CBD. We would note that using the U.S. Census 18+ population projection in 2025, a
10% incidence rate would equate to just over $590 in annual spend to achieve $16 bn.
Conversely, holding the $640 in spend constant with the U.S. Census forecasted
population would result in over $17 bnin revenues by 2025.

2

That said, we view this estimate as somewhat conservative, as we can envision a
scenario where a consumer that uses a CBD tincture or capsule, may also be inclined to
convert his or her beauty regimen to include CBD (e.g., CBD infused beauty products),
and or use a topical for targeted relief as well. Our $16 bn estimate assumes the
following category contributions:

cool. Stay focused. Rely on your instincts. We’re ready for this mission. And
we are going to achieve it.”

One minute after four in the afternoon, we got the word to go. I was in the
lead buggy, consciously trying to look like a civilian, not a soldier. It was about
a mile-and-a-half to the aircraft. I glanced back at the others. Like me, many of
them had been awake for 30 hours or more, in some cases nearly 48 hours. The
air marshals had been plucked off long-haul flights on which relaxation, much
less sleep, was not an option. As before any mission, I knew everyone would be
thinking about what was about to happen. They also realized that if we failed,
the passengers trapped inside the plane would be at the mercy of terrorists
armed with AK-47s and explosives. But I was confident that any apprehension
would be overtaken by adrenalin when as the assault began.

As we got closer, Shai Agmon radioed me. He said two or three people, not
the terrorists, had come out of the plane. One seemed to be the Red Cross man.
They were about 120 yards away from the aircraft. As soon as he’d signed off, I
got word from the command post in the control tower that it was indeed the Red
Cross representative, along with two of the flight crew. They’d been chosen by
the terrorists to do security checks on the “maintenance” men.

I brought the convoy to a halt. The Red Cross man gave each of us a fairly
cursory body search before waving us on. Then, he got to Bibi. Though I had
somehow failed to notice, he had left on his red sayeret boots. In Israel, that was
the equivalent of a neon sign saying: “I am a paratrooper.” Although the Red
Cross man noticed the boots, he at first made no comment. Then, rolling up the
pants leg of Bibi’s overalls, he saw his Beretta — not inside his waistbelt, but
inside the boot. The next thing I heard was an angry spurt of French as the man
called the control tower. For a moment, I feared the mission was over, with
potentially fatal repercussions for the hostages. But whatever explanation the
Red Cross man was given — presumably by Dayan himself, who would not have
held back in conveying what was at stake — it dissuaded him from taking further
action.

As we were returning to the buggies, the Red Cross man told me that
“Captain Rifa’at” had ordered us to pull up to the generator on the side of the
plane. Each of us would then have to walk forward and open the front of our
overalls so he could make sure we weren’t armed. I passed back four orders to
the rest of the men. First, with no exceptions, move your pistol to the back of
your belt. Second: I’Il be the first to go through the inspection. Third: watch

Kentucky Hemp Growth Provides An Indication For Near-Term Acceleration

Figure 7 shows hemp production in Kentucky under Kentucky Department of
Agriculture (KDA) Industrial Hemp Research Pilot Program. The figure shows the
increase in planted acres in 2018 (Sept) as well as the shift toward CBD as a percentage
of total hemp (planted acres for CBD rising to 4,121 acres in 2018 from 864 in 2017). In
2018, there were 158 greenhouses in Kentucky representing 764,000 sq. ft., which is
included in the 2018 acreage below. (Note 1 acre = 43,560 sq. ft.)

On January 22, 2019, the Kentucky Department of Agriculture approved 1,035
applications to cultivate up to 42,086 acres of industrial hemp in 2019, up from 16,100
acres in 2018 and 33 acres in 2014, which was the first growing year. (67 acres of
greenhouse space was also approved for hemp cultivation.) We note that of the 16,100
acres approved in 2018, less than half (6,700) was planted.

Conversations with industry experts estimate planted hemp acres in 2019 could reach
200,000, up from 78,176 in 2018. The growth is supported by expansion like Kentucky's
and new states entering the market (only 23 states participated in 2018).

Essay 1. 
Coming from an international background, and having lived in Oslo, Tel Aviv, New York and London by the age of eighteen, I 
believe that the international profile of NYU will provide the best environment for my college education, with the added benefit of 
returning to the place where I've spent most of my childhood and where my mother will be posted as Norwegian Ambassador to the 
UN in January 2019. 
NYU's Art History department appeals to me because of its wide range of courses, from the global art of antiquity to the 
contemporary. My passion is the Italian Renaissance and the rich history behind it, especially the works of 15th century masters 
such as Masaccio and Bellini. Some of the courses that NYU offers such as Early masters of Italian Renaissance painting and 
Florentine Villas: An Interpretation Based on Historical, Social Factors are, therefore appealing to me. What I find exciting, is not 
only the visual aesthetics and analysis of these masterpieces, but also the manner in which the Renaissance emphasised 
scientific and economic innovation, areas of study the Global Liberal Arts programme would offer. NYU's unique campus in 
Florence would give me a once in lifetime opportunity to spend a year immersing myself in the art, culture and history of Italy. This 
would be an exciting experience to have while studying for a Bachelor's degree in Art History, and would compliment my main 
interests in the subject. 
As one of the prime cultural centres in the world, NYU's location in NYC is the perfect place to broaden knowledge within 
contemporary art. I am very much looking forward to visiting the Whitney Biennia this May. In addition the New museum, which 
shows a lot of the kind of work I find interesting is a short walk away from campus. 
Taking advantage of being based in central London for the past year, I have completed the Chairman's Programme at Christies, 
work experience at the Courtauld Gallery and I will be working at Maddox Gallery in the near future. Similarly, I want to take 
advantage of being based in NYC to gain as much experience as possible. I have chosen to apply Early Decision to NYU as it is the 
only American university I will be applying to, as there is no better place to obtain experience of the contemporary art world than 
New York City. 
Essay 2. 
From the age of extremes to the age of bewilderment 
What captivates me more than anything else is the different ideological phases of the 20th century and how art can be used as 
a tool of advancement and reflection on ideological and political developments. 
My fascination began when I read; Eric Hobsbawm's Age Of Extremes and has since developed through books such as 
Benjamin Carter Heft's The Death Of Democracy and Yuval Harari A Brief History Of Tomorrow and 21 Lessons For 
The 21st Century. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033416 
In the years after the First World War, until the end of the Second World War, three political models for shaping the future of 
nation states emerged; Fascism, Communism and liberal democracy. These all offered great ideas for the future of the world. 
Fascism and Communism shared some common features: authoritarian, strong leaders and a belief that their revolutions had 
to be carried through with violence. This led to the mass murders in the Nazi concentration camps and in the Soviet Gulags. 
In the mid war periods, the Litfass columns that were originally designed to carry advertising, became the outdoor galleries 
for the war of ideologies. The political poster was born. High quality posters from every political party in Germany popped 
up on the columns. Hitler's propaganda chief G8ebels stated that the Nazi election campaign should be run through speeches 
and posters. The other parties responded in kind. An art form thus became an essential political tool in the battle for votes. 
The propagandist Art used by the Nazis and communists alike was essential in helping sell their message to the masses. 
Indeed, much of the art that was critical of these movements was suppressed or censored and subversive artists cowed, in 
some cases imprisoned or even worse. 
The liberal democratic model departed sharply from these authoritarian perspectives by presenting the alternative of free and 
transparent elections, the rule of law and freedom of speech. In the mid-war period the three narratives were competing to be 
the conceptual frame for society. After the Second World War fascism was crushed leaving the two competing ideologies of 
communism and liberal democracy. After the demise of communism in 1989, through to the late 1990's, liberal democracy 
was victorious in the idealogical battlefield. Some historians, like Francis Fukuyama, went so far as to proclaim this period as 
the end of history. 
A key piece of art that championed this kind of ideology was Sheppard Fairey's campaign poster for Barack Obama. In this 
poster, Fairey, a well established graffiti artist uses urban colours and stencilling techniques combined with the message 
HOPE to promote the incoming presidents positive values and popularity with the young. It is notable that Fairey's most 
recent political poster protests the Trump presidency rather than promote it. 
With the rise of so called illiberal democracy, with strong parties standing for populist ideologies, we have now moved into 
what can be described as the age of bewilderment. We were not in fact at the end of history. Once again the future looks 
unpredictable and insecure and artists are responding in different ways. 
Jeremy Deller, a British Turner prize winning artist created a work which features a car damaged in the bombing of the 
historic Mutanabbi Street book market, which resulted in the deaths of 38 people. Here, an art work has been used to show the 
aftermath of an event. This event was the result of the Iraq war, which was seen as a way to spread democracy. Here Art is 
used as a means by which to explore the effects of ideology rather than promote it, another really interesting area in the study 
of the intersections between ideology and art. 
Exploring how art reflects the historical and ideological contexts of the world around it is fascinating to me and I would love 
to study these ideas in more depth at undergraduate level.

BREYER, J., dissenting

sity, included immunity from suit in commercial areas, since
organizations were buying goods and making contracts in
the United States.

To achieve these purposes, Congress enacted legislation
that granted necessarily broad immunity. And that fact
strongly suggests that Congress would not have wanted
the statute to reduce significantly the scope of immunity
that international organizations enjoyed, particularly
organizations engaged in development finance, refugee
assistance, or other tasks that U.S. law could well decide
were “commercial” in nature. See infra, at 12.

To that extent, an examination of the statute’s purpose
supports a static, not a dynamic, interpretation of its
cross-reference to the immunity of foreign governments.
Unlike the purpose of the Civil Rights Act, the purpose
here was not to ensure parity of treatment for interna-
tional organizations and foreign governments. Instead, as
the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit pointed out
years ago, the statute’s reference to the immunities of
“foreign governments” was a “shorthand” for the immuni-
ties those foreign governments enjoyed at the time the Act
was passed. Atkinson v. Inter-American Development
Bank, 156 F. 3d 1335, 1840, 1841 (1998).

Il

Now consider the consequences that the majority’s
reading of the statute will likely produce—consequences
that run counter to the statute’s basic purposes. Although
the UN itself is no longer dependent upon the Immunities
Act, many other organizations, such as the FAO and sev-
eral multilateral development banks, continue to rely
upon that Act to secure immunity, for the United States
has never ratified treaties nor enacted statutes that might
extend the necessary immunity, commercial and noncom-
mercial alike.

domestic consumption. Will they achieve this? Probably. Will there be strains along the
way? There have to be.

Unlike many Australian leaders, Keating is a Europhile. I think the European project is
the most significant project since the second world war, he says. But he sees two huge
blunders made in Europe.

From the euro's inception, Keating said it should constitute only Germany, France and
the Benelux nations, not the peripheral countries around the Mediterranean, and Greece
should never have been allowed in.

Why were the weaker economies given entry?

Keating says: It's because president Mitterrand and the French wanted it. They weren't
ready to sit beside the German unified state without some friends.

So the eurozone was flawed from the outset, a structure awaiting internal assault: The
problem is we have a single currency without a political union and without a fiscal union.

The second blunder was the 1990s expansion of NATO to the Russian border. For
Keating, this was recklessness for which the world may yet pay.

Sensible policy would have included a place for Russia in the new world order, he says.
But that didn't happen. So Russian liberals were pushed to one side by Russian
nationalists. In a sense the US has created Vladimir Putin.

Who is responsible? He points the finger at Bill Clinton.

On the 2008 financial crisis, he says former US Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan
must bear a fair amount of responsibility”.

“Greenspan is someone | know and like, Keating says. But if you are so naive to believe
that institutions with a balance sheet with assets geared at 45 to one is not an accident
waiting to happen then you don't deserve to be chairman of the Federal Reserve.

He praises Obama for seeking a return to the liberal internationalism that, in Keating's
view, made the US great in the post-World War Il age. This is the US he loves but it is still
in retreat.

Asked about the nature of leadership, Keating reveals what lies within his heart: I believe
there is a poetic strand to life that doesn't exist in an economics textbook.

This is not to say that rationalism isn't important and good. It is. But left to itself without
the guidance of higher meaning and a higher concept, rationalism can be mean and
incomplete. | say if you simply live on rational policy and briefing notes you are not
sufficiently informed.

on the basis of two states for two peoples and the right of the Jewish
and Palestinian peoples to self-determination, without prejudice to
the rights of all citizens and minority groups. Recall, in this context,
U.N. General Assembly resolution 181 of 1947 that called for the
establishment of a Jewish state and an Arab state.

¢ Acknowledge institutional and security reform, economic
development and state-building efforts — especially in the West
Bank, under the leadership of President Abbas and Prime Minister
Salam Fayyad, which have helped lay the foundations for Palestinian
statehood — and endorse the position articulated by the World Bank
and the United Nations that the Palestinian Authority is “well
positioned for the establishment of a state at any point in the near
future.”

¢ Accordingly, support the establishment of an independent and
sovereign Palestinian state on the basis of the 1967 lines with its
capital in East Jerusalem in parallel with Israel’s recognized capital in
West Jerusalem, and with mutually agreed territorial swaps and
modifications, subject to negotiation — a state that will live side by

¢ Recognize that extending the authority of a Palestinian state to the
Gaza Strip will depend on effective control there by a legitimate
Palestinian government that exercises authority in the West Bank, is
committed to the Quartet principles and the Arab Peace Initiative and
respects the commitments of the Palestine Liberation Organization.

Absolute immunity must be afforded any act occurring during course of judicial

proceeding, See Levin, Middlebrooks, Mabie, Thomas, Mayes & Mitchell, P.A. v. U.S. Fire Ins.

counsel as well. id. The litigation privilege applies in all causes of action, whether for common-
law torts or statutory violations. See Echevarria, McCalla, Raymer, Barrett & Frappier v. Cole,
950 So. 2d 380 (Fla. 2007). Defamatory statements made by lawyer while interviewing a
witness in preparation for and connected to pending litigation are covered by the absolute
immunity conferred by the litigation privilege. See DelMonico v. Traynor, 50 So. 3d 4 (Fla. Dist.
Ct. App. 4th Dist. 2010), review granted, 47 So. 3d 1287 (Fla. 2010). The privilege extends to

For all the foregoing reasons, defendant, the Court should grant defendant Bradley J.

e inter-reflecting networks modeling self and others, reflecting a “mirrorhouse” design
pattern

10. Given the strengths and weaknesses of current and near-future digital computers,

a. A (loosely) neural-symbolic network is a good representation for directly storing many
kinds of memory, and interfacing between those that it doesn’t store directly;

b. Uncertain logic is a good way to handle declarative knowledge. To deal with the prob-
lems facing a human-level AGI, an uncertain logic must integrate imprecise probability
and fuzziness with a broad scope of logical constructs. PLN is one good realization.

c. Programs are a good way to represent procedures (both cognitive and physical-action,
but perhaps not including low-level motor-control procedures).

d. Evolutionary program learning is a good way to handle difficult program learning prob-
lems. Probabilistic learning on normalized programs is one effective approach to evolu-
tionary program learning. MOSES is one good realization of this approach.

e. Multistart hill-climbing, with a strong Occam prior, is a good way to handle relatively
straightforward program learning problems.

f. Activation spreading and Hebbian learning comprise a reasonable way to handle atten-
tional knowledge (though other approaches, with greater overhead cost, may provide
better accuracy and may be appropriate in some situations).

e Artificial economics is an effective approach to activation spreading and Hebbian
learning in the context of neural-symbolic networks;

e ECAN is one good realization of artificial economics;

e A good trade-off between comprehensiveness and efficiency is to focus on two kinds
of attention: processor attention (represented in CogPrime by ShortTermImpor-
tance) and memory attention (represented in CogPrime by LongTermImportance).

g. Simulation is a good way to handle episodic knowledge (remembered and imagined).
Running an internal world simulation engine is an effective way to handle simulation.

h. Hybridization of one’s integrative neural-symbolic system with a spatiotemporally hier-
archical deep learning system is an effective way to handle representation and learning
of low-level sensorimotor knowledge. DeSTIN is one example of a deep learning system
of this nature that can be effective in this context.

i. One effective way to handle goals is to represent them declaratively, and allocate atten-
tion among them economically. CogPrime’s PLN/ECAN based framework for handling
intentional knowledge is one good realization.

11. It is important for an intelligent system to have some way of recognizing large-scale pat-
terns in itself, and then embodying these patterns as new, localized knowledge items in
its memory. Given the use of a neural-symbolic network for knowledge representation, a
graph-mining based “map formation” heuristic is one good way to do this.

12. Occam’s Razor: Intelligence is closely tied to the creation of procedures that achieve goals
in environments in the simplest possible way. Each of an AGI system’s cognitive algorithms
should embody a simplicity bias in some explicit or implicit form.

13. An AGI system, if supplied with a commonsensically ethical goal system and an intentional
component based on rigorous uncertain inference, should be able to reliably achieve a much
higher level of commonsensically ethical behavior than any human being.

14. Once sufficiently advanced, an AGI system with a logic-based declarative knowledge ap-
proach and a program-learning-based procedural knowledge approach should be able to

Last month we were joined onstage by the University of Columbia economics professor
Jeffrey Sachs, as he laid out his radical new vision for U.S. foreign policy. Instead of a
world where America reigns as the sole superpower, Sachs argued for a new
international system of equals, where America shares power and collaborates with former

geopolitical rivals to solve today’s global crises.

Sachs was in conversation with the BBC’s Chief International Correspondent Lyse

Doucet.

intentions. Together they give

output = investment + invested consumption + positive self-invested work
— human depreciation + net transfer + exhaust
= investment + invested consumption + self-invested work
— recovered human depreciation + net transfer + exhaust. (6.24)

This much is certitude. I now apply (5.9), which includes

consumption = invested consumption + pure consumption,

to reach the Y rule in its general form:

output = investment + consumption + self-invested work
— human depreciation + net transfer. (6.25)

The net transfer term disappears at the collective scale.

Although (6.24) is logical certitude infered from definitions, (5.9) and consequently
(6.25) are not. I cannot rule out the possibility of a third kind of consumption
recovered in work products as per Quesnay. | hope that my interpretation of age-
wage profiles in the light of the boss-secretary parable has revealed that as
improbable. The same holds for my derivation of the pay rule through Ben-Porath’s

consumption, also trusts that all maintenance consumption is exhausted in

satisfying tastes.

Summary

Accounting for human capital is much like accounting in a firm. Expected recovery of
human depreciation in pay is logical certitude illustrated in age-wage profiles and in
the boss-secretary parable. The pay rule is not entirely logical certitude, however, as

it also asserts that maintenance consumption is not recovered. Age-wage profiles

Visible Efforts to Change Invisible
Connections

4 The lead author is Christopher M. Masi, M.D.,
Ph.D., an assistant professor in the Department
of Medicine at the University of Chicago. He is
co-founder of Every Block A Village Online, an
Internet-based community development
program, and is past president of the Illinois
chapter of Physicians for a National Health
Program. He is the current president of the
Midwest Society of General Internal Medicine
and has received numerous awards, including a
Models That Work Award from the United
States Bureau of Primary Health Care and the
New Investigator Health Sciences Research
Award from the Gerontological Society of
America. With a medical degree, as well as a
PhD in social service administration, Dr. Masi’s
research focuses on the socioeconomic factors
underlying health disparities. He currently has
two projects, one aimed at developing an
intervention to reduce loneliness and one focused
on the role of sex hormones in gender, age, and
racial differences in cardiovascular disease. He
is a reviewer for several scientific journals and
grant-making organizations and has published
research and reviews on diverse topics, including
health insurance reform and racial disparities in
breast cancer and hypertension.

Human capacity for creativity,
compassion, and learning is unparalleled in the
animal kingdom. However, humans reach their
full potential only when they are socially
engaged. Lack of social engagement impairs
creativity and learning, and limits opportunities
for caregiving and emotional growth. Numerous
studies have shown that loneliness is also a risk
factor for illness and premature mortality.
Because loneliness is increasing in modern
society, it is critically important to understand
this condition, as well as strategies to reduce it.
This essay describes our review of the literature
regarding loneliness reduction interventions.

The 17 century English
philosopher Thomas Hobbes proposed
that without the organizing structure of
government, humans would experience
bellum omnimum contra omnes (war of
all against all) and life would be
“solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and
short”(1). While this colorful description
is often quoted, less attention is paid to
Hobbes’ premise that such misery can be
avoided if humans codify and enforce
the rules of a civil society. Not everyone
agrees with Hobbes’ views, but history
is replete with examples of human
misery when anarchy reigns and of
relative peace when a social contract is
observed. A question that philosophers
continue to debate is whether
collaboration for mutual benefit is part
of human nature or whether promotion
of the self above all others is man’s
primary motivation. In this volume,
Cacioppo argues that sociality is an
integral part of human nature. He notes
that given each child’s prolonged period
of total dependence, survival into child-
bearing age depends entirely upon the
support and protection of adults, most
often parents or kin. As a result, those
who survive long enough to procreate
pass along genes for nurturing and
protection, thereby hardwiring a form of
sociality into our genetic code.

This protective behavior helps
ensure that genes within a family are
passed on to future generations.
Cooperation among unrelated adults or
the support and protection of children by
adults exists beyond kin, as well,
because these activities also provide
survival benefit. Examples from early
human existence include hunting and
gathering, which are more likely to
succeed when pursued as a group than
individually. To these structural benefits

(PRWEB) October 17, 2010

Cadogan Tate, the world class art moving, storage and shipping specialist in contemporary art, has sponsored the
‘New Sensations 2010’ exhibition for UK art students. Organised by Channel 4 and The Saatchi Gallery, this

prestigious event aims to discover the most imaginative and talented artists graduating from BA and MA courses
in the UK and to support students leaving art college.

A total of 20 students were shortlisted to present their work in the exhibition. This is being held at Boswall House,
2 Cornwall Terrace - a magnificent 18th century building off Regent’s Park - from 14th to 20th October. The event
forms part of ‘The House of the Nobleman’, under the curatorship of Wolfe von Lenkiewicz and Victoria
Golembiovskaya.

Four of the finalists in New Sensations 2010 - Pablo Wendel, Katie Surridge, Nika Neelova and Ula Wiznerowicz -
have each been given a bursary to develop a new work for the exhibition. A short film about each of them was
aired on Channel 4 in early October. Stephen Glynn, Cadogan Tate’s Fine Art Director, comments: “We are
delighted to be the sponsors of this important exhibition, which showcases the talent of some remarkable young
artists. We have spent many years transporting and storing the world's most precious contemporary art for
leading museums, galleries and collectors. It therefore seemed very appropriate that we should support and
encourage the UK’s leading art students through this exciting event.”

questioned Scherr about White’ s diet and learned that, while under
stress, White would consume candy bars and soft drinks. Metcalf
recommended the book to Scherr, suggesting the author as an expert
witness. In his book, Hoffer revealed a personal vendetta against
doughnuts, and White had once eaten five doughnuts in a row.

During the trial, psychiatrist Martin Blinder testified that, on the
night before the murders, while White was “getting depressed about the
fact he would not be reappointed [as supervisor, after having quit], he just
sat there in front of the TV set, bingeing on Twinkies.” In my notebook, |

In the wake of the Twinkie defense, a representative of the

the cream-filled goodies could lead to murderous behavior was

“poppycock” and “crap” —apparently two of the artificial ingredients
in Twinkies, along with sodium pyrophosphate and yellow dye—while

U.S. Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta has been criticized for the plea deal he
worked out with Jeffrey Epstein. Acosta was U.S. attorney for Southern Florida at
the time. Alan Diaz

Instead, Epstein — whose friends included President Donald Trump, former
President Bill Clinton and other politically connected people — was allowed to
quietly plead guilty to prostitution charges in state court. He served 13 months in
the county jail, where he was allowed liberal work release privileges rarely given to
sex offenders in Florida and barred by the Palm Beach Sheriffs Department’s own
rules.

He was released in 2009, but his victims — who were 13 to 16 years old at the time —
are still fighting more than a decade later to have his non-prosecution agreement
overturned.

In his op-ed, Sloman called Acosta “an outstanding public servant ... at risk of
becoming collateral damage in Washington’s latest polarized conflagration,” adding,
“I won't let it happen without first being heard.”

Jeffrey Epstein apologizes, but not to his victims

Jeffrey Epstein, a multimillionaire who molested dozens of underage girls, and is
suspected of trafficking countless other girls around the world, issued a public
apology Tuesday. It was not to the victims of his abuse, but to one of their lawyers.

1933-1945, and 1955-1965) were eliminated from the analysis.

The cohorts we generated were based on four major sources, and their content is given in Appendix.
1) The Hermann lists

The lists of the infamous librarian Wolfgang Hermann were originally published in a librarianship journal
and later in Boersenblatt, a publishing industry magazine in Germany. They are reproduced in Ref $11. A
digital version is available on the German-language version of Wikipedia (Ref $12). We considered
digitizing Ref $10 by hand to ensure accuracy, but felt that both OCR and manual entry would be time-
consuming and error prone. Consequently, we began with the list available on Wikipedia and hired a
manual annotator to compare this list with the version appearing in Ref $11 to ensure the accuracy of the
resulting list. The annotator did not have access to our data and made these decisions purely on the
basis of the text of Ref $11. The following changes were made:

Literature
1) “Fjodor Panfjorow’ was changed to “Fjodor Panferov”.
2) “Nelly Sachs” was deleted.

History
1) “Hegemann W. Ellwald, Fr. v.” was changed to “W. Hegemann” and “Fr. Von Hellwald”

Art
4) “Paul Stefan” was deleted.

Philosophy/Religion
1) “Max Nitsche’” was deleted.

The results of this manual correction process were used as our lists for Politics, Literature, Literary
History, History, Art-related Writers, and Philosophy/Religion.

2) The Berlin list

The lists of Hermann continued to be expanded by the Nazi regime. We also analyzed a version from
1938 (Ref $13). This version was digitized by the City of Berlin to mark the 75 year after the book
burnings in 2008 (Ref S14). The list of authors appearing on the website occasionally included multiple
authors on a single line, or errors in which the author field did not actually contain the name of a person
who wrote the text. These were corrected by hand to create an initial list.

We noted that many authors were listed only using a last name and a first initial. Our manual annotator
attempted to determine the full name of any such author. The results were far from comprehensive, but
did lead us to expand the dataset somewhat; names with only first initials were replaced by the full name
wherever possible.

Some authors were listed using a pseudonym, and on several occasions our manual annotator was able
to determine the real name of the author who used a given pseudonym. In this case, the real name was
added to the list.

In addition, we occasionally included multiple spelling variants for a single author. Because of this, and
because an author’s real name and pseudonym may both be included on the list, the number of author
names on the list very slightly exceeds the number of individuals being examined. The numbers reported
in the figure are the number of names on the list.

It is worth pointing out that Adolf Hitler appears as an author of one of the banned books from 1938. This
is due to a French version of Mein Kampf, together with commentary, which was banned by the Nazi
authorities. Although it is extremely peculiar to find Hitler on a list of banned authors, we did not remove
Hitlers name, as we had no basis for doing so from the standpoint of the technical authorship and name
criteria described above: Adolf Hitler is indeed listed as the author of a book that was banned by the Nazi
regime. This is consistent with our stance throughout the paper, which is that we avoided making
judgments ourselves that could bias the outcome of our results. Instead, we relied strictly upon our

Apple and Google. And the prized Korean manufacturing excellence was no match
for cheap Chinese and then Vietnamese labor welded to assembly-line technology.

We see this pattern of network-led shredding nearly everywhere now, the result of
powerful cores of knowledge and wide distribution of connection. Newspapers -
removed from relevancy by crowd-sourced newsfeeds and constantly-connected
smart databases. Once indomintable television networks, devoured by cheap home-
made videos and large-scale platforms that use the Internet for distribution. Bitcoin
and other first-generation block-chained currencies eating at the once
unquestionable authority of central banks. Drones hovering along ona skein of GPS
and data links are also among the new citizens of this connected skein. They are
products of a data web: They depend on centralized connection and the distribution
of technology, data, and design. They may do to old ideas of security and power
what the fusion of GPS and smart phones and databases have done to hotel chains or
medicine. Massed, self-organized drone fleets can turn aircraft carriers and exposed
battle groups from sources of strength into vulnerable and even dangerously self-
defeating antiques. They will remake urban landscapes. Think of the way that Baron
Hausman redesigned Paris in the 18 Century to manage with the Enlightement-age
danger of liberated, angry citizens. The creation of the city’s wide boulevards,
central axes for easy movement of the police, and intersections engineered to
quarantine riots was a reaction against the demands of mass liberty. Our cities are
now vulnerable not simply to mass protest risk, but to the pinch of asymmetric
levitating drones. The sensations of safety behind walls, up a staircase, inside a
windowed room all begin to slip away. Drone risk - and all the potentially
wonderful elements of constant, instant drone assistance — will command a
retooling of cities, much as automobiles did a century ago.

So this is power: Cores and distribution. They way that tension pulls particularly on
certain, once-essential structures and objects and people explains a lot about our
age — including the failure of so many institutions. Connectivity changes the nature
of an object. That’s true for your doctor, your bank account, your army - and for
billions of people whose lives alter irreversibly once they connect to markets, to
knowledge, to the world. To connect now is to be exposed to this fresh young skin of
linked power, a lively surface that transports anything at near instant speed. We
have to ask just how many of the “scaffolds humans erect” that were essential for
Enlightenment-era advances will be pulled down. And of course we face the exciting,
uneasy task of thinking up the new scaffolds we now must build.

If you have the tools or the skill to see the world this way, as a vibrating and pulling
mesh of connections, then you can look ata tanks or soldiers or years of stability
and see possibility. A friend who controls the largest secure Bitcoin vault in the
world, put it to me once this way: “Platforms mattered once; now it is protocols.” His
point was that the pipes and rules connecting the varied systems of our world affect,
fundamentally, the distribution of power. The rules of the Bitcoin blockchain or the
implications of a protocol like IPv6 or DNSSSEC reveals something about how we'll
all connect in the future. Once these new rules become visible to you, then even the

perfect little body. Her date tells me her secret is a half-hour
on the treadmill everyday—such an understatement. I tell
Jesse Eisenberg I was on his plane home from the Baftas last
week, but he was hiding under his hoodie. He says innocently,
“You should have said ‘hello’ I always cover my head because
I think my curls make me look like a girl”

and Debra and Hugh Jackman.

Miramax Saturday night soirees where nominees spoofed
their own films in homemade costumes and ad-libbed
hilarious skits. No more grown men dressed as Anna Paquin
playing the piano in hopes of winning a Max Award.

As I come in, a 400-pound gorilla refuses to let me on the
elevator. Once on, I see Jennifer Lopez in the corner and
remind her we met on Len Blavatnik’s yacht in Cannes. She
graciously pretends to remember me. Her manager, Benny
Medina, is kicking me.

I slip into Colin Firth’s booth to have a téte-a-téte with him
and his wife Livia Giuggioli. Jokingly, I suggest he say “I’m

speechless” when he wins. Colin patiently assures me many |

people, far more clever than I, thought of this. He then says that
others are waging bets on whether he might subconsciously
stutter. I grill him about his wardrobe, assuming he will be
wearing a new Tom Ford tuxedo. He tells me both he and
Ford will be in older Ford models. I tell him I made rich-but-
thrifty Charles Ferguson, director of Inside Job, spend $6,000
dollars for a new Tom Ford tux.

Introduction

Background

Investment into another country or internalization is a very important and scrupulous decision that
a business has to make. As a rule, developing countries seek to attract investors in order to gain
FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) and acquire technology. Mainly, the investors seek for variety of
factors when going international.

These factors include the following:

e an area's business climate; education and training strengths;
labor unionization; attitudes of local and state governments;
available incentives;
community attitude;
commuting distance;
transportation costs and proximity to roads;
availability of transportation facilities;
labor productivity and attitude toward productivity;
cost of labor;
availability of skilled and unskilled labor;
availability and transfer of qualified technicians and managers;
land availability and cost; cost of construction; proximity and access to markets;
availability and cost of utilities;
cost of living;
tax structures and rates;
insurance considerations;
financing opportunities;
banking services;
social and cultural climate;
quality of life;
local and physical infrastructure;
proximity to suppliers/resoutces;

access to raw materials; CEO ownership preferences;

Haiti (Republic of Haiti) is not a very easy place to invest. The country has a very unstable social
and economic situation. It experienced a massive 7.0 earthquake and several subsequently large
tremors, which led to the deaths of many citizens in January 2010. Currently, the country is
experiencing problems with cholera, AIDS, high crime rates, high unemployment, and high
illiteracy among other things. According to CIA Factbook Report (2010), 80% of the population
lives “under the poverty line and 54% in abject poverty”.

TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026248.txt,"﻿THE WHITE HOUSE 
WASHINGTON 
February 2, 2018 
The Honorable Devin Nunes 
Chaiiman, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence 
United States Capitol 
Washington, DC 20515 
Dear Mr. Chaiiiiian: 
On January 29, 2018, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (hereinafter the 
Committee) voted to disclose publicly a memorandum containing classified information 
provided to the Committee in connection with its oversight activities (the Memorandum, 
which is attached to this letter). As provided by clause 11(g) of Rule X of the House of 
Representatives, the Committee has forwarded this Memorandum to the President based on its 
detennination that the release of the Memorandum would serve the public interest. 
The Constitution vests the President with the authority to protect national security secrets from 
disclosure. As the Supreme Court has recognized, it is the President's responsibility to classify, 
declassify, and control access to information bearing on our intelligence sources and methods 
and national defense. See, e.g., Dep 't of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). In order to 
facilitate appropriate congressional oversight, the Executive Branch may entrust classified 
information to the appropriate committees of Congress, as it has done in connection with the 
Committee's oversight activities here. The Executive Branch does so on the assumption that the 
Committee will responsibly protect such classified information, consistent with the laws of the 
United States. 
The Committee has now determined that the release of the Memorandum would be appropriate. 
The Executive Branch, across Administrations of both parties, has worked to accommodate 
congressional requests to declassify specific materials in the public interest.1 However, public 
release of classified information by unilateral action of the Legislative Branch is extremely rare 
and raises significant separation of powers concerns. Accordingly, the Committee's request to 
release the Memorandum is interpreted as a request for declassification pursuant to the 
President's authority. 
The President understands that the protection of our national security represents his highest 
obligation. Accordingly, he has directed lawyers and national security staff to assess the 
See, e.g., S. Rept. 114-8 at 12 (Administration of Barack Obama) (On April 3, 2014. . . the Committee agreed to 
send the revised Findings and Conclusions, and the updated Executive Summary of the Committee Study, to the 
President for declassification and public release.); H. Rept. 107-792 (Administration of George W. Bush) (similar); 
E.O. 12812 (Administration of George H.W. Bush) (noting Senate resolution requesting that President provide for 
declassification of certain information via Executive Order). 
declassification request, consistent with established standards governing the handling of 
classified information, including those under Section 3.1(d) of Executive Order 13526. Those 
standards permit declassification when the public interest in disclosure outweighs any need to 
protect the information. The White House review process also included input from the Office of 
the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Justice. Consistent with this review 
and these standards, the President has determined that declassification of the Memorandum is 
appropriate. 
Based on this assessment and in light of the significant public interest in the memorandum, the 
President has authorized the declassification of the Memorandum. To be clear, the 
Memorandum reflects the judgments of its congressional authors. The President understands 
that oversight concerning matters related to the Memorandum may be continuing. Though the 
circumstances leading to the declassification through this process are extraordinary, the 
Executive Branch stands ready to work with Congress to accommodate oversight requests 
consistent with applicable standards and processes, including the need to protect intelligence 
sources and methods. 
Sincerely, 
Donald F. McGahn II

HPSCI Majority Members 
HPSCI Majority Staff 
Purpose 
This memorandum provides Members an update on significant facts relating to the 
Committee's ongoing investigation into the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) and their use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) during the 
2016 presidential election cycle. Our findings, which are detailed below, 1) raise concerns with 
the legitimacy and legality of certain DOJ and FBI interactions with the Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Court (FISC), and 2) represent a troubling breakdown of legal processes established 
to protect the American people from abuses related to the FISA process. 
Investigation Update 
On October 21, 2016, DOJ and FBI sought and received a FISA probable cause order 
(not under Title VII) authorizing electronic surveillance on Carter Page from the FISC. Page is a 
U.S. citizen who served as a volunteer advisor to the Trump presidential campaign. Consistent 
with requirements under FISA, the application had to be first certified by the Director or Deputy 
Director of the FBI. It then required the approval of the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney 
General (DAG), or the Senate-confirmed Assistant Attorney General for the National Security 
Division. 
The FBI and DOJ obtained one initial FISA warrant targeting Carter Page and three FISA 
renewals from the FISC. As required by statute (50 U.S.C. §1805(d)(1)), a FISA order on an 
American citizen must be renewed by the FISC every 90 days and each renewal requires a 
separate finding of probable cause. Then-Director James Comey signed three FISA applications 
in question on behalf of the FBI, and Deputy Director Andrew McCabe signed one. Then-DAG 
Sally Yates, then-Acting DAG Dana Boente, and DAG Rod Rosenstein each signed one or more 
FISA applications on behalf of DOJ. 
Due to the sensitive nature of foreign intelligence activity, FISA submissions (including 
renewals) before the FISC are classified. As such, the public's confidence in the integrity of the 
FISA process depends on the court's ability to hold the government to the highest standard—
particularly as it relates to surveillance of American citizens. However, the FISC' s rigor in 
protecting the rights of Americans, which is rem orce 5y9 -day renewals of surveillance 
orders, is necessarily dependent on the government's production to the court of all material and 
relevant facts. This should include infoimation potentially favorable to the target of the FISA 
lk.J1 LA-1\-L,1/I1V,11V71\1116 
PROPERTY OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
application that is known by the government. In the case of Carter Page, the government had at 
least four independent opportunities before the FISC to accurately provide an accounting of the 
relevant facts. However, our findings indicate that, as described below, material and relevant 
information was omitted. 
1) The dossier compiled by Christopher Steele (Steele dossier) on behalf of the 
Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the Hillary Clinton campaign foimed an 
essential part of the Carter Page FISA application. Steele was a longtime FBI source who 
was paid over $160,000 by the DNC and Clinton campaign, via the law firm Perkins Coie 
and research firm Fusion GPS, to obtain derogatory infoiniation on Donald Trump's ties 
to Russia. 
a) Neither the initial application in October 2016, nor any of the renewals, disclose or 
reference the role of the DNC, Clinton campaign, or any party/campaign in funding 
Steele's efforts, even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were then 
known to senior DOJ and FBI officials. 
b) The initial FISA application notes Steele was working for a named U.S. person, but 
does not name Fusion GPS and principal Glenn Simpson, who was paid by a U.S. law 
firm (Perkins Coie) representing the DNC (even though it was known by DOJ at the 
time that political actors were involved with the Steele dossier). The application does 
not mention Steele was ultimately working on behalf of___and paid by—the DNC and 
Clinton campaign, or that the FBI had separately authorized payment to Steele for the 
same information. 
2) The Carter Page FISA application also cited extensively a September 23, 2016, Yahoo 
News article by Michael Isikoff, which focuses on Page's July 2016 trip to Moscow. 
This article does not corroborate the Steele dossier because it is derived from information 
leaked by Steele himself to Yahoo News. The Page FISA application incorrectly assesses 
that Steele did not directly provide infoimation to Yahoo News. Steele has admitted in 
British court filings that he met with Yahoo News—and several other outlets—in 
September 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS. Perkins Coie was aware of Steele's 
initial media contacts because they hosted at least one meeting in Washington D.C. in 
2016 with Steele and Fusion GPS where this matter was discussed. 
a) Steele was suspended and then tei___ninated as an FBI source for what the FBI defines 
as the most serious of violations—an unauthorized disclosure to the media of his 
relationship with the FBI in an October 30, 2016, Mother Jones article by David 
Corn. Steele should have been terminated for his previous undisclosed contacts with 
Yahoo and other outlets in September—before the Page application was submitted to 
UNCLASSIFIE 
1//1 k_/1.\_1`4 
PROPERTY OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
the FISC in October—but Steele improperly concealed from and lied to the FBI about 
those contacts. 
b) Steele's numerous encounters with the media violated the cardinal rule of source 
handling—maintaining confidentiality—and demonstrated that Steele had become a 
less than reliable source for the FBI. 
3) Before and after Steele was terminated as a source, he maintained contact with DOJ via 
then-Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr, a senior DOJ official who worked 
closely with Deputy Attorneys General Yates and later Rosenstein. Shortly after the 
election, the FBI began interviewing Ohr, documenting his communications with Steele. 
For example, in September 2016, Steele admitted to Ohr his feelings against then-
candidate Trump when Steele said he was desperate that Donald Trump not get 
elected and was passionate about him not being president. This clear evidence of 
Steele's bias was recorded by Ohr at the time and subsequently in official FBI files___but 
not reflected in any of the Page FISA applications. 
a) During this same time period, Ohr's wife was employed by Fusion GPS to assist in 
the cultivation of opposition research on Trump. Ohr later provided the FBI with all 
of his wife's opposition research, paid for by the DNC and Clinton campaign via 
Fusion GPS. The Ohrs' relationship with Steele and Fusion GPS was inexplicably 
concealed from the FISC. 
4) According to the head of the FBI's counterintelligence division, Assistant Director Bill 
Priestap, corroboration of the Steele dossier was in its infancy at the time of the initial 
Page FISA application. After Steele was terminated, a source validation report conducted 
by an independent unit within FBI assessed Steele's reporting as only minimally 
corroborated. Yet, in early January 2017, Director Comey briefed President-elect Trump 
on a summary of the Steele dossier, even though it was—according to his June 2017 
testimony—salacious and unverified. While the FISA application relied on Steele's 
past record of credible reporting on other unrelated matters, it ignored or concealed his 
anti-Trump financial and ideological motivations. Furthermore, Deputy Director 
McCabe testified before the Committee in December 2017 that no surveillance warrant 
would have been sought from the FISC without the Steele dossier information. 
ASS', 'II 
Iti*Erniffie 
PROPERTY OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
5) The Page FISA application also mentions information regarding fellow Trump campaign 
advisor George Papadopoulos, but there is no evidence of any cooperation or conspiracy 
between Page and Papadopoulos. The Papadopoulos infoimation triggered the opening 
of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016 by FBI agent Pete Strzok. 
Strzok was reassigned by the Special Counsel's Office to FBI Human Resources for 
improper text messages with his mistress, FBI Attorney Lisa Page (no known relation to 
Carter Page), where they both demonstrated a clear bias against Trump and in favor of 
Clinton, whom Strzok had also investigated. The Strzok/Lisa Page texts also reflect 
extensive discussions about the investigation, orchestrating leaks to the media, and 
include a meeting with Deputy Director McCabe to discuss an insurance policy against 
President Trump's election.

= CCAR a product of regulatory attitude: The panelists agreed that CCAR in its
current form is not a result of legislation as post-recession bank stress tests (SCAP)
existed prior to Dodd-Frank. Furthermore, the panelists noted Dodd-Frank’s
definition of a stress test is very basic, which has been made more stringent and
complex as a result of regulators. Mr Cohen also noted that a lack of transparency
of the test was the least defensible part of CCAR.

= Biggest obstacle for bank M&A and activist influence is regulation. Despite
headlines of increased shareholder activism within the banking industry, the
majority of investors polled (61%) believe activist investors have only a moderate
impact on corporate strategy (see chart). Specifically, Mr. Cohen explained that two
of the three reasons why an activist will typically get involved with a corporate are
difficult to achieve on a bank’s board given the level of regulatory oversight on the
industry. While selling the bank is the one area where activists have had success,
this typically occurs at the community bank level. That said, he believes a change in
attitude of regulators could free up M&A activity.

2. Capex revival
We also see a fundamental case for higher capital spending. Borrowing rates are very
low and will fall further in real terms as inflation rises. Stronger growth and improved
confidence should also encourage higher capex. And deepening supply-side constraints
offer a strong incentive for Japan Inc. to accelerate productivity-enhancing capex,
ensuring that this expansion is durable.
For these reasons, we think that the impulse of capital expenditures will likely be higher
in the non-manufacturing sector, where capacity utilization rates are higher, and labor
shortages (and hence wage pressures) are more acute (Chart 15 and Chart 16).

Chart 17 shows the ratio of personnel costs to sales, using MoF corporate survey data.
The ratio is particularly high for lodging & accommodations (23%), eating & drinking
services (27%), medical, healthcare & welfare (37%) and education & learning support
(37%). Somewhat surprisingly, personnel expenses are fairly restrained in retail. But this
is partly due to the relatively heavy reliance on lower-cost part-time workers. Given the
rapid growth in part-timers’ wages, such cost savings is likely to become increasingly
difficult to maintain.

women.”
According to Roberts's lawsuit, Epstein had forced her into

the prince’s bed on Little Saint Jeff's.

After Epstein’s conviction, the British press were using another
name for Little Saint Jeff's: Sex Island. The Guardian reported
that the manager of two Virgin Islands—based corporations owned
by Epstein happened to be the wife of the governor of the Virgin
Islands. There were allegations involving a million-dollar dona-

that Atheism is false, and tends to the dissolution of society, than
Marcus Aurelius believed the same things of Christianity.”

If even such a ruler as Marcus Aurelius could be so monumentally
wrong, then no dictator, it would seem, no matter how benevolent,
could ever ultimately be trusted in his judgment. It follows, therefore,
that the persecution of an idea or ideals for the sake of the existing
order can rarely be justified, since the existing order is itself suspect.
And, pace Mill, if we can never know for certain if authority is in the
right, even as anarchy must be averted, the only recourse for society
is to be able to choose and regularly replace its forever-imperfect
leaders. But there is a catch. As Mill admits earlier in his essay,
Liberty, as a principle, has no application to any state of things
anterior to the time when mankind have become capable of being
improved by free and equal discussion. Until then, there is nothing . .
. but implicit obedience to an Akbar or a Charlemagne, if they are so
fortunate as to find one. Indeed, Mill knows that authority has first
to be created before we can go about limiting it. For without
authority, however dictatorial, there is a fearful void, as we all know
too well from Iraq in 2006 and 2007. In fact, no greater proponent of
individual liberty than Isaiah Berlin himself observes in his
introduction to Four Essays on Liberty that, “Men who live in
conditions where there is not sufficient food, warmth, shelter, and the
minimum degree of security can scarcely be expected to concern
themselves with freedom of contract or of the press.” In “Two
Concepts of Liberty,” Berlin allows that “First things come first:
there are situations . . . in which boots are superior to the works of
Shakespeare, individual freedom is not everyone’s primary need.”
Further complicating matters, Berlin notes that “there is no necessary
connection between individual liberty and democratic rule.” There
might be a despot “who leaves his subjects a wide area of liberty” but
cares “little for order, or virtue, or knowledge.” Clearly, just as there

HD: Wall Street, Take Two 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021241 
DEK: In the upcoming sequel to Oliver Stone's groundbreaking film, Gordon Gekko gets out of jail and back to business. Peggy 
Siegal takes us behind the scenes where she got herself on camera along with a few of her famous friends. Nice work if you can get 
it. 
In 1987, right after director Oliver Stone won the Academy Award for Platoon, he immediately turned to a domestic arena 
and began working on Wall Street in New York City where his father had been a stockbroker. Although the film was widely seen 
as a scathing critique of the culture of Wall Street, Stone has said that part of the film is a defense of capitalism, his father's vision of 
finance (as seen through the Hal Holbrook character) and an homage to his father. 
At the time Oliver was also fascinated with the connection between the psyche of Latino Miami drug dealers from his earlier 
Scarface script and the American-born 28- to 35-year-old, white collar stockbrokers. Both groups had an animalistic need to obtain 
big and fast money. They shared an obsession with corruption and greed. 
Oliver sent his actors to Bear Stearns for research, including then-newcomer Charlie Sheen, who played Bud Fox, a kid from 
nowhere. When he learns to cold call, and lands one big client, Gordon Gekko, Fox is thrust into the fast lane with a rock star 
financial mentor who teaches him corruption. 
Oliver needed an old-fashioned villain to create drama, and he cast Michael Douglas as Gekko against type. Michael was not 
known as a heavy at the time, but as a charming, handsome, sensitive leading man. Oliver also saw the anger, confidence, 
salesmanship and style that Michael brought to the role. Michael's Gekko looked a bit like Laker's coach Pat Riley with his slicked 
back hair and well-cut suits, and it became Michael's most important role, winning him the Academy Award for the villain no one 
could ever forget. 
When Gekko delivers his speech, Greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right. Greed works, cinematic history was 
made. 
Wall Street was set in 1985, a time before ten financial news networks broadcasting 24/7 existed. The entire financial services 
industry was largely unknown and Oliver Stone nailed it. 
Four years ago, Wall Street's producer Ed Pressman decided it was time for a sequel and met with Fox Film Entertainment co-
chairmen Tom Rothman and Jim Gianopulos. Michael Douglas was immediately on-board pending script approval. Steven Schiff 
wrote the first script before the global economic crash of 2008 rendered it obsolete. 
Alan Loeb was brought in for a rewrite. Pressman asked me to meet Loeb at the Carlyle Hotel to explain the social rhythms of 
New York's financial high society. Whereas Gekko 's character was modeled after '70s junk bond kings (Michael Milken) and '80s 
mergers and acquisitions killers (Henry Kravis), Loeb bases the new villain on hedge fund billionaires like John Paulson and Mike 
Novogratz, geniuses who have created stratospheric wealth beyond Gordon Gekko 's wildest dreams. When Oliver Stone agreed to 
direct, he rewrote a portion of the script to focus on bankers as well as hedge funders, taking no screen credit. 
This past September, Oliver yelled, action as Gordon Gekko, with long grey hair, comes back to life as he emerges from a 
lengthy prison stint shot outside of Sing Sing in Ossining, New York. Gekko is desperate to redefine himself in a different era. The 
New York Post runs a full-page photo of Gekko and New Yorkers immediately become obsessed with the filming of Wall Street 2. 
A week into shooting, a glorious fall day. Ed Pressman invites me on the set at the Central Park Zoo. Oliver designs an elaborate 
tracking shot around the seal pool where Gekko, fresh from jail, walks and talks to Jake Moore, a young idealistic investment banker 
played by Shia LaBoeuf. They discuss Gekko's daughter Winnie, Moore's fiancee, played by Carrie Mulligan, who is also having an 
off-screen romance with LaBoeuf. Oliver played Cupid. Moore invites Gekko to the Alzheimer's Ball at the Metropolitan Museum 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021242 
of Art. Gekko, who used to be a sponsor or honoree of such events, cannot even afford a ticket. 
The shot starts with a barking seal jumping for fish, then pans down to the actors. Extras weave in and out. In one take Michael 
makes a wrong turn and ends up at the monkey house. Everyone laughs. The atmosphere on the set is courteous but quick and tense. 
There is pressure when you are making a sequel to a hit. 
I watch the action on monitors while sitting on the producers canvas chairs with Pressman, Eric Kopeloff (Monsters Ball) and 
Celia Costas, who was a location manager on the first Wall Street. They have asked me to be an extra in the Alzheimer's Ball scene 
and bring some friends to play rich Upper East Side socialites. Oliver wants over the top glam, go-to-the-vault jewels and couture 
gowns. Give me the night before the Titanic goes down, were his exact words. Not a problem. 
I pay a quick visit to Michael in his trailer on Fifth Avenue where he is resting. We go way back. I was his personal publicist 
when he won the Golden Globe and Oscar for Best Actor for Wall Street and we have remained great friends. Gekko is just as 
challenging for him the second time because of endless pages of technical financial dialogue. We discuss Catherine Zeta-Jones' 
Broadway debut in a Little Night Music. Michael has a stack of partially finished handwritten thank you notes next to him for gifts 
received for their shared birthday party on September 25th at the St. Regis. Her 40th and his 65th. 
I tell him I have been cast as an extra in two scenes and he laughs knowing I am desperate to hang around him and the 
production. 
8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, October 21st, another warm, stunning fall day. I report to the wardrobe trailer on 65th Street and 
Madison Avenue. I carry four elaborate cocktail dresses and bags of matching accessories. My hair is in rollers. Statuesque Julia 
Koch walks over from her Park Avenue apartment carrying her white Valentino and long diamond earrings. Her real-life financial 
titan husband David is unaware where she is this morning. 
Vanity Fair's keeper of the Best Dressed List, Amy Fine Collins, arrives totally organized in turquoise vintage Geoffrey Beene, 
and Vogue's fashion editor Hamish Bowles wears a riot of plaids, patterns and a large yellow fake flower on his lapel. Costume 
Designer Ellen Mirojnick, who created Gordon Gekko's rich slick look in the first film, is ecstatic with the extras I invited. 
Oliver is shooting a scene with Josh Brolin (the star of Stone's W). His character Bretton (never Bret) James, a ruthless Wall 
Street kingpin, and his perfect wife Samantha (Noelle Beck) are hosting a benefit piano recital for a 13-year-old child prodigy in their 
huge, art-filled townhouse at 41 East 65th Street. The building actually belongs to Baby Jane Holzer, a wealthy art collector still 
famous for hanging with Andy Warhol in the '60s. The production designer had Jane's fabulous Warhols moved to storage and 
replaced with matching photographic copies. Very expensive contemporary art is again an important production element of Oliver's 
vision. 
At 10:30 a.m., all the extras are placed around the living room set. Oliver's French mother, Jacqueline Stone, and her friend 
Monique Van Vooren, both in their 80s, are seated in front of the fireplace chatting in French. Production assistants fuss over them. 
Debonair macho man Chuck Pfieffer, who appeared in the original film, and I immediately invent a back story—I am his corporate 
wife—and we position ourselves on a couch next to the director's mother. Julia gets the best spot close to the piano and Amy, 
Hamish and decorator Geoffrey Bradfield are right behind her. Josh is brought in and the kibitzing stops. 
Oliver appears on the set with eagle eyes and a sly grin and quickly re-positions everyone. He explains the scene, gives out lines 
to his favored extras, and on his way out to the monitors in the next room mentions that my earrings are too small. Wardrobe 
jumps. Josh rehearses and Oliver finally yells, Action. The kid plays the piano, Josh explains why we are in his home, asks for 
money, the camera dollies as extras say their lines and Shia appears at the door uninvited for a confrontation with Josh. Three hours 
later a PA yells, Lunch. 
In costume, Amy, Hamish and I run to The Monkey Bar. I am late to meet The Harpies, including Liz Smith, Barbara 
Walters, Cynthia McFadden, Nora Ephron, Jennifer Isham, Maury Perl and Beth Kseniak. 
Graydon Carter is at the next table. I tell him Oliver Stone wants him in Wall Street 2 as an extra. (I make this up.) Graydon 
jokes that he only works with lines. I say, Not a problem. (This will be news to Oliver.) 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021243 
Back on the set I tell Oliver that Graydon is willing to be in the film with lines. Oliver finds that intriguing. 
Oliver shoots the piano recital scene over and over again from different angles all afternoon. Financial wizard Don Marron 
saunters on the set to visit and Oliver spontaneously puts him in a scene chatting with Josh. Carrie Mulligan hangs out watching 
boyfriend Shia work. 
At sundown Julia Koch has to race from reel to real life and explain to her husband where she has been all day. (He loves it.) 
Chuck Pfieffer plants a Page Six item and the next day socialites begin calling me to get into the film. 
Thursday, November 5, Shun Lee Restaurant, West 65th Street 
Oliver shoots a crowded tight interior scene with Michael, Carrie and Shia, who are having an intimate Chinese dinner. 
Spontaneously, Oliver decides this is the perfect scene for Graydon Carter. After a flurry of calls, Graydon arrives on set, and playing 
himself, sashays by the table. Gekko jumps up to say hello and Graydon brushes him off with a few dismissive lines. 
Monday, November 9, 25 Broadway 
One hundred swells show up at the former Canard Shipping building, a massive Italianate hall, at the crack of dawn for the 
Alzheimer's Ball, a grand charity event. 
Susan Hess and I are chauffeured downtown with our Vera Wang gowns and report to the VIP extra holding area where we join 
Prince Dimitri of Yugoslavia in a bespoke dinner jacket, journalist Christopher Mason, songstress Yanna Avis, photographer Kelly 
Klein, art dealer Larry Gagosian's girl friend Shala Monroque in see-through Rodarte, beauty executive Olivia Chantecaille, producer 
Lawrence Robins, author Jackie Weld Drake, Vogue film critic Joan Juliet Buck, fashion consultant Jill Fairchild, CNN's Felicia 
Taylor and Italian newsman Mario Calvo-Platero. 
Ellen Mirojnick and her costume department have assembled racks of the most expensive elaborate designer gowns and work at 
break neck speed styling while we wildly strip to our undies in a makeshift dressing area. Ellen pours me into a black tulle Marchesa 
with a enormous wired silver bow. Twenty hairdressers and make-up artists systematically work on 250 extras. A mile of tables are 
alternately filled with steaming coffee, fattening breakfast foods, hair sprays, mirrors, shoes and jewelry. It's a madhouse of 
excitement. 
We are led to the part of the set used for the cocktail reception and placed around Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen stand-ins. 
Charlie has been flown in from LA for half a days work to reprise his original character. He is now the highest paid television actor 
commanding two million dollars an episode of Two and a Half Men. 
Oliver arrives on the set greeting, examining, tweaking the shot and always pulling the prettiest girls closest to the 
camera. Michael and Charlie arrive from their trailers and run their lines as socials drift into their sight lines challenging their 
concentration on pages of dialogue. Oliver yells, Action as the extras aggressively jockey for face time. Charlie is not having an 
easy day and they do take after take. My corporate husband Chuck Pfieffer has gotten his real girlfriend Lisa Crosby in the film and 
my marriage has become a threesome. 
Sensing our concern of not making it onto the silver screen Oliver tells his first assistant director to seat a dinner table with 
Susan Hess, Jill Fairchild, Prince Dimitri, Chuck Pfieffer, Grace Meigher and Mario Calvo-Platero. He directs us to chat with each 
other turning left and right as the camera closely pans past our faces. 
Elsewhere on the set are John Buffalo Mailer, as Shia's character's best friend, Austin Pendleton, 94-year-old Eli Wallach and 
Natalie Morales. Also in this film are: the magnificent Frank Langella, as Shia's boss, who throws himself in front of a train early in 
the film, Susan Sarandon as Shia's real-estate broker mother, Sylvia Miles, who reprises her hilarious cameo as another real-estate 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021244 
agent and Jean Pigozzi as an international banker. 
Lunch is called at 4 p.m. and Michael Douglas takes seven heavily made-up and bejeweled women including Susan, Jill and me 
to a restaurant around the corner. Gordon Gekko hosts a hen party talking about children, schools, country houses and vacations. 
Back on the set Oliver is shooting the actual dinner. Assistant directors ask for volunteers to dance to the live music. Prince 
Dimitri twirls and dips Jackie Weld. Kelly Klein, in her own Karl Lagerfeld sheer black organza, watches from a table with scattered 
champagne glasses half-filled with apple juice along with her 86-year-old father, Tulley Rector. Charlie Sheen leaves for LA and 
Shia is very annoyed he was not introduced to his hero. Carrie Mulligan, costumed like Audrey Hepburn, chats with us between 
takes. 
The final set up is a long tracking shot of Josh Brolin and his wife as they triumphantly enter the ball. It is close to 9 p.m. and 
Lord William Astor arrives to pick me up for Amalia Dayan and Adam Lindemann's dinner for artists uptown. 
Oliver is introduced to William and delights in calling him Lord as he immediately moves him into the top of the shot and 
instructs him to tell Eli Wallach, We must do lunch. Ever the proper English gentleman, William advises Oliver that Lords do not 
use American slang and improvises his own lines. The tracking shot continues for numerous takes following Josh and Noelle as 
every VIP extra gets another shot at instant stardom with one-line greetings. 
At last, It's a wrap is screamed after 10 p.m. Prince Dimitri tells The Wall Street Journal it was, a day of electrifying 
glamour, and the longest gala of my life. I was in black tie for thirteen hours. 
November 25, Tommy Gun Salon, Ludlow Street, last day of shooting 
Donald Trump is on set at 7 a.m. ready for his close up. He is trying to make a mid-day departure on his jet from Teterboro 
with wife Melania and son Baron for Thanksgiving weekend in Palm Beach. Back in September, Oliver had invited Donald Trump to 
dinner at 21 to meet his leading men Josh and Shia so they could observe New York's most charismatic powerbroker in his natural 
environment. 
The scene is London so the grey skies are perfect. Gekko has moved abroad to make his financial comeback. The scene opens 
on the back of his head in a barber's chair as he watches the financial news on TV. The camera pulls back and Gordon Gekko is 
finally revealed as the powerful bull he once was in an exquisite suit and signature slicked-back hair. Donald Trump walks into the 
shop for a cut and the banter begins about the money market. From his chair, Donald leans into Michael and suggests a comb over 
like his famous do. Gekko, with a slight grin, says, No thanks Donald, I am a gel man. 
The crew is yucking it up and Donald feels great. Paparazzi shoot the whole scene with long lenses from across the street. The 
unit publicist is helpless to keep this under wraps. Donald emerges, poses and gives interviews. Michael comes out, and the press 
think they have a scoop on the ending. Gekko is back in all his lovable titan splendor. Full-page photos of Michael and Donald run 
the next day in the tabloids. Never underestimate Oliver Stone's surprise endings. 
Twentieth Century Fox releases Wall Street 2: The Money Never Sleeps on April 23rd and its got hit written all over it.

Wealthy Palm Beacher Jeffrey Epstein in Palm Beach County Circuit Court in 2008 to plead guilty to criminal charges stemming from claims he had teenage girls give him sexual massages. (Uma Sanghvi/The Palm Beach Post)

Updated: 3:43 p.m. Friday, May 12, 2017 |  Posted: 2:45 p.m. Friday, May 12, 2017





PALM BEACH —
President Donald Trump is a shadowy, but ever-present, figure in the never-ending saga of billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Mar-a-Lago, the commander-in-chief’s private-club-turned-southern-White-House in Palm Beach, was the backdrop for Epstein’s introduction to one of his dozens of teenage victims, according to court records.

In a short-lived lawsuit that Trump decried as “categorically false,” a California woman last year sued Trump and Epstein in federal court in New York City, claiming the two business tycoons raped her when she was 13 years old.

And Trump is on a star-studded witness list for an upcoming trial in Palm Beach County Circuit Court that attorney Jack Scarola promises will be the first public airing of Epstein’s lurid lifestyle.

But, Scarola acknowledges, it is unlikely the president will be part of what Scarola promises will be a salacious trial. Scarola claims Epstein sued attorney Brad Edwards in an effort to intimidate and punish the lawyer for representing some of Epstein’s victims. While Epstein dropped his lawsuit against Edwards, who has also represented clients in a lawsuit against Trump, the malicious prosecution suit against Epstein will likely go to trial in the fall, Scarola said.

When Scarola put Trump on the witness list in August, he said he never imagined the business scion and former television star would soon occupy the Oval Office. The legal battle he would have to launch to get a sitting president to testify simply isn’t worth it, Scarola said.

Moreover, while there is a lot of smoke around Trump’s relationship with Epstein, there appears to be little fire, so far, Scarola said.

“Based on all available public records, Trump’s involvement is peripheral,” he said.

While Trump has recently distanced himself from Epstein, a 64-year-old financier, it wasn’t always that way.

“I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” Trump said of Epstein during a 2002 interview with New York magazine. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”

Attorney Spencer Kuvin, one of dozens of lawyers who successfully sued Epstein on behalf of roughly 30 women who claimed he lured them to his Palm Beach mansion for sexually-charged massages when they were as young as 14, said he always found the comment curious.

“How would he know that?” he said of Trump’s acknowledgement of Epstein’s penchant for young women. The interview came nearly six years before Epstein’s secret sex life exploded into public view when the money manager pleaded guilty to Florida charges of procuring and soliciting a minor for prostitution. “Why would he make a joke like that?” the West Palm Beach attorney asked.

Further, Kuvin and others say they can’t believe it is purely coincidental that former South Florida U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta, who signed off on a non-prosecution agreement that kept Epstein from spending years behind bars, was tapped by Trump to be U.S. Labor Secretary.

During his confirmation hearings in March, Acosta said it was “awful” that convicted sex offender Epstein was allowed to leave the Palm Beach County Jail to work during his 13-month jail sentence. But he insisted that without the involvement of his office, Epstein would have received far less punishment and his victims wouldn’t have recovered any money from him. As a result of the conviction, Epstein also is on Florida’s registered sex offender list.

Scarola, who has represented several of Epstein’s victims in civil lawsuits, scoffed at Acosta’s claims. The evidence that Epstein sexually abused young girls was “overwhelming,” he said.

The answer to the many questions that still swirl around Epstein and his high-placed friends are the subject of roughly a half-dozen lawsuits that are still pending in both Palm Beach County and New York. Some of the nation’s top attorneys have represented Epstein and some of his victims.

But like many of the past lawsuits spawned by Epstein’s behavior, most of the remaining ones are expected to be settled. And even public court records don’t tell the full story — because many documents have been sealed or are heavily redacted.

For example, a defamation lawsuit against one of Epstein’s close friends was scheduled to go to trial in U.S. District Court in New York this coming Monday. But both sides agreed to a delay last week, often a signal that a settlement could be in the works.

The suit was filed by Virginia Roberts Giuffre against British-born socialite and longtime Epstein friend Ghislaine Maxwell. In a 2009 lawsuit that Epstein settled for an undisclosed amount, Giuffre claimed she was 15 when Maxwell recruited her from her $9-an-hour job in the locker room at Mar-a-Lago, where her father had a job as a maintenance worker. Giuffre claims in court records that Maxwell introduced her to Epstein and that Epstein turned her into his international sex slave.

Maxwell wasn’t sued as part of the lawsuit Giuffre filed against Epstein. But, in court papers filed by Giuffre, Maxwell was accused of grooming Giuffre to be Epstein’s sexual toy.

Maxwell ignored the allegations until Giuffre raised them again in December 2014 and Maxwell began publicly disputing Giuffe’s claims. Famed attorney David Boies then filed a defamation lawsuit on Giuffre’s behalf, claiming Maxwell “undertook a concerted and malicious campaign to discredit Giuffre.” In media interviews, Maxwell called Giuffre’s claims “obvious lies,” Boies wrote.

The trial promised to provide scurrilous details about Giuffre’s widely publicized contention in court records that Epstein not only used her but loaned her to his rich and powerful friends, including such notables as Prince Andrew and former President Bill Clinton. Similar claims against nationally-known attorney Alan Dershowitz, who represents Epstein, were withdrawn when the Harvard law professor and Giuffre’s attorneys reached a confidential settlement in dueling defamation lawsuits they filed against each other over the allegations.

Flight logs from Epstein’s private jet show Clinton was a frequent flyer, taking Secret Service agents along with him on trips with Epstein around the globe. Clinton has publicly ignored Giuffre’s allegations but an independent investigation launched by Dershowitz raised questions about their veracity.

One of Epstein’s longtime servants testified that Prince Andrew was a regular guest at Epstein’s house and received massages during the visits. But house manager Juan Alessi acknowledged in a sworn deposition that older women and men offered Swedish massages to Epstein’s guest. It is unclear who gave the British prince the massages or what was included. The prince has vehemently denied Giuffre’s allegations.

Alessi also testified that Trump visited Epstein’s home when both were in Palm Beach. “He would come, have dinner. He never sat at the table,” said Alessi, who described himself as Epstein’s majordomo. “He eat with me in the kitchen.”

But, Alessi said, unlike other visitors, Trump didn’t avail himself of massages. “No,” he said. “Because he’s got his own spa.”

While Giuffre’s defamation lawsuit appears headed for what will likely be a confidential settlement, Scarola said his case against Epstein is going to trial even though Trump won’t be called as a witness.

“We can prove our case without Donald Trump’s testimony,” he said of malicious prosecution lawsuit he filed against Epstein for suing Edwards, the attorney who has represented Giuffre and several of Epstein’s other victims.

Edwards has also been leading a separate charge to prove Acosta’s office violated the federal Crime Victims’ Rights Act when it signed off on the non-prosecution agreement without notifying the women. That suit, which has stalled in federal court after many of the documents were sealed, could eventually reveal why Epstein got what many call a “sweetheart deal,” Scarola said.

Edwards also represented 65 members of Trump National Golf Club Jupiter, who won $5.8 million in February when a federal judge ruled that Trump improperly kept their deposits when he took over the club on Donald Ross Road in Jupiter in 2012. Trump is appealing the decision.

2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *901

(2) Serving Objections. An objecting party must provide a copy of its objections to the opposing party and to the probation
officer.

(3) Action on Objections. After receiving objections, the probation officer may meet with the parties and the victim to discuss
the objections. The probation officer may then investigate further and revise the presentence report as appropriate.

(h) Notice of Possible Departure from Sentencing Guidelines. Before the court may depart from the applicable sentencing
range on a ground not identified for departure either in the presentence report or in a party's prehearing submission or in a
victim impact statement, the court must give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a departure. The notice
must specify any ground on which the court is contemplating a departure. The attorney for the government or for the victim
shall advise defense counsel and the court of any ground identified by the victim that might reasonably serve as a basis for
departure.

(i) Sentencing.
[7902]

(1) In General. At sentencing, the court:

(A) must verify that the defendant and the defendant's attorney have read and discussed the presentence report and any
addendum to the report;

(B) must give to the defendant and an attorney for the government a written summary of - or summarize in camera - any
information excluded from the presentence report under Rule 32(d)(3) on which the court will rely in sentencing, and give them
a reasonable opportunity to comment on that information;

(C) must allow the parties' attorneys and any victims to comment on the probation officer's determinations and other matters
relating to an appropriate sentence; and

(D) may, for good cause, allow a party or any victim to make a new objection at any time before sentence is imposed.

(2) Introducing Evidence; Producing a Statement. The court may permit the parties or the victim to introduce evidence on the
objections. If a witness testifies at sentencing, Rule 26.2(a)-(d) and (f) applies. If a party fails to comply with a Rule 26.2 order
to produce a witness's statement, the court must not consider that witness's testimony.

(3) Court Determinations. At sentencing, the court:
(A) may accept any undisputed portion of the presentence report as a finding of fact;

(B) must - for any disputed portion of the presentence report or other controverted matter - rule on the dispute or determine that
a ruling is unnecessary either because the matter will not affect sentencing, or because the court will not consider the matter in
sentencing; and

(C) must append a copy of the court's determinations under this rule to any copy of the presentence report made available to the
Bureau of Prisons.

The Rationale:

For the reasons explained in the preceding section, the victim's right to be reasonably heard at a sentencing hearing
encompasses the right to be heard on Sentencing Guidelines issues. Congress [*903] intended that the victim become a
participant in the process with rights independent of the Government or the defendant. 773 Those independent rights include

273 150 Cong. Rec. S4268 (daily ed. Apr. 22, 2004) (statement of Sen. Kyl).

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018460.txt,"[theory] Liberal, Sex-Positive Sex Education: What's Missing

I originally wrote this in 2009, then reposted it in 2010 as part of a group drive by sex-
positive bloggers to solicit donations to Scarleteen.com. Scarleteen is an amazing sex
education site run by the equally amazing sex educator Heather Corinna, and it can
always use donations! You should totally go investigate that site -- after you're done
reading my work, of course.

When I first published this piece, the sex-positive film director Tony Comstock
commented on Twitter, I think that post of yours might be one of the most important
things written about sex-positivity in the last 10 years. I was really honored by that,
because he does excellent work.

My parents occasionally read my blog, and I also got some interesting feedback from my
mother. She wrote to me:  Speaking from where I sat when you were growing up: I wish
I could have taught you what you eventually learned on your own. But I felt there was
this unchallengeable wave moving and I didn't have a place to stand to counter it. I kept
thinking I was leaving you to learn the hard way exactly what I learned the hard way,
and was still learning, and was despairing of ever learning.

I wrote back: For what it's worth, I remember you trying to stem the tide with small
comments, and I think that those comments later helped me center myself in a place
where I could reach my own conclusions rather than blindly sleeping around. I hope it
made her feel better, because it's true. I'm not a parent, although someday I would like to
be... but I think one of the hardest things about parenting must be knowing that your kids
will learn terrible things from the surrounding world, and the best you can do is try to be
there while they process those lessons.

KOK ok

Liberal, Sex-Positive Sex Education: What's Missing

I am fortunate. I was born in the eighties and I received a great sex-positive upbringing.
The public school I attended taught students how to use condoms; middle school health
education included a section on sexually transmitted diseases. My parents didn't throw
their sexuality in my face -- but they were almost always matter-of-fact, understanding
and accepting when they talked about sex. (I'll never forget how, at age 12 or so, Mom
sat me down and gave me a long speech about how it would be totally okay if I were
gay.) I was raised Unitarian Universalist, and the Unitarian Sunday School teen program
included a wonderful sex education curriculum called About Your Sexuality. (I
understand that the sex-ed curriculum has been changed and updated, and is now called
Our Whole Lives. I haven't delved deeply into the Our Whole Lives program -- maybe it
addresses some of the issues I'm about to describe.)

So I think I'm in a good position to describe the problematic signals we face in liberal
sexual education. Yes, I've experienced the overall sex-negative messages that drench
America, and they're terrible -- but so much is already being said about those. I also
received lots of sex-positive messages that are incomplete, or problematic, or don't quite
go the distance in helping us navigate sexuality -- and I think the sex-positive movement
must focus on fixing them.

In many ways this remark is as dumb as her early remarks. Why do I
think this?

Because it makes it clear that she hasn’t a clue, and doesn’t really
care, about causation.

And, this is exactly the problem with Sarah Palin’s remarks to
Katie Couric as well:

Couric: .. . people have questioned your readiness since that
interview. And I’m curious to hear your reaction.

Palin: Well, not only am I ready but willing and able to serve as
vice president with Senator McCain if Americans so bless us
and privilege us with the opportunity of serving them, ready
with my executive experience as a city mayor and manager,
as a governor, as a commissioner, a regulator of oil and gas,
not only with my résumé proving that readiness, but I think
the important thing here is that John McCain and I, we share
a vision for America that includes energy independence.

Why do I think that the problem here is about a misunderstanding of
how to determine causation? Miss South Carolina has determined the
following things to be true:

If students can’t do something, they should be taught to do it.

If students can’t do something, it is because they weren’t taught
to do it.

If students can’t do something that it seems anyone should be
able to do, then it should be taught in school.

Reading maps is more important than whatever would have to
be eliminated from school so that reading maps could take its
place.

These decisions should be made on the basis of statistical
evidence of student’s abilities.

But is any of this reasonable? Not only could one argue with each of
these propositions, but it is fair to say that Miss South Carolina herself
doesn’t know that she holds these positions, that she hasn’t thought
about them, and that she might disagree with what she said if some-
one pointed this out to her.

In other words, she cannot reason well precisely because her be-
liefs indicate that she does not think about causation, and one can

First draft:

It is hard to know how to respond to a list of false and/or distorted allegations, along with misleading statements on your part. Needless
to say, | treat people | interact with with respect, and | work hard to support and mentor students, colleagues, and members of the
general public. | do not sexually harass people. If the purpose of your reporting is to somehow argue that that Universities and other
institutions are lax in dealing with well known individuals like myself, then in fact the situation is quite the opposite. My high public
profile opens me up to more scrutiny at these institutions, not less, and it also opens me up to a host of outside complaints and
allegations that other faculty do not receive, each of which the University has to respond to. The fact that | have remained a professor
in all Universities with which | have been associated, in good standing, and also an officer or an invited speaker at organizations like
CFI, which have strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the fact that they trust my behavior. | was asked to be an honorary
director of CFI, and invited to their last 3 meetings to speak, specifically because, as they have written me after the fact, the attendees
universally appreciated my talks, my courtesy, and graciousness in spending time with the attendees. If the purpose of your report is to
impugn my integrity or suggest | have a history of harassment, that too is false. As noted in one of your 'miscellaneous facts’, as a
scientist | try and remain skeptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather than allegations and innuendo. | also try and judge the facts
in context. The fact that Universities and other organizations employ me or have me on their boards, or invite me to meetings is
because they value my contributions and my actions.

Your specific allegations are false or distorted. Item 1 refers to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in 2006 where we mutually
decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be appropriate, and had respectful encounters afterwards. |
cannot comment on item 3, which involves an anonymous 3rd party claim, because | know nothing about it, and it was not taken
seriously enough to result in any university action. Item 4 is confusing. Are you saying that because | decided | didn’t want to go out to
a bar with a group of attendees that | was harassing them? The second part is false. | don’t do that. Re incident 5: The ‘female
companion’ in this case is my wife, who can attest to the fact that the claim is false, which is what | wrote in response to the blog in
question, causing it to be taken down.

It is worthwhile responding to Item 2 and 6 in more detail,

Re item 2: the student in question was interested in science communication, and on dozens of occasions came to me or wrote to me
with questions. When she asked about advice for after graduation | DID tell her she was different than the other students in her

year. The rest of them were interested in going on to graduate school, but she was interested in science communication so | told her
that she might want to take a different path. Since she was the only woman in her year, as | recall, | did ask her on one of these
occasions if that made it difficult for her in any way. | asked, because as a faculty member | was interested, and also because as
someone she had asked for career advice from | wanted to know if that made a difference to her. Re asking her for dinner.. | have
gone back over emails from that period. | have numerous requests from her to go for coffee to talk, which | usually had to turn down
because | was busy, including several occasions where she asked me to have coffee with her off campus to talk, and | politely
declined. | did let her accompany me off campus one time to watch me do a BBC interview because she specifically requested it. | did
and do have coffee and meals with students on campus, and | see nothing wrong with this. | was shocked when | later learned of her
complaint, not least because there was no inappropriate interaction and also because well after the date on which she is said to have
been offended, she continued to email me with joking questions or comments, and at a AAAS conference in 2008, for which she had
asked, and for which | had written her a letter of recommendation to attend, my wife and | gave her a lift well out out of our way to drop
her off at her hotel, and | note in an email response to her email about the conference, agin in 2008, | expressed that | would pass her
regards along to my wife and vice versa. When the University informed me of the complaint | was shocked and concerned. When |
spoke to the human resources person, including relating my concerns and providing the emails in question, | was told that no formal
complaint of sexual harassment was deemed to be warranted in this case, and that the young woman in question had agreed to

that. By that time | learned of the complaint | had already announced my intentions to leave Case to accept an offer at ASU—a very
difficult decision for me because of my long-standing attachment to the University, and the excellent relations | had with my colleagues
there, both among the faculty and among the administration. Because | was already in Arizona at the time | was asked not to have any
further interaction with the student | agreed to that request because it was basically moot. | was also told that because it was being
handled informally, that (a) it should remain confidential, which |, at least abided by, and (b) if no further complaints were lodged in that

Businesses and individuals should be aware that conduct that violates the

FCPA‘s anti-bribery or accounting provisions may also violate other statutes or

regulations. Moreover, payments to foreign government officials and intermedi-

aries may violate these laws even if all of the elements of an FCPA violation

are not present.

Travel Act

The Travel Act, 18 US.C. § 1952, prohibits travel

Unlawful activity” includes violations of not only

bribery between private commercial enterprises may, in
some circumstances, be covered by the Travel Act. Said dif-
ferently, if a company pays kickbacks to an employee of a
private company who is not a foreign official, such private-
to-private bribery could possibly be charged under the
Travel Act.

DOJ has previously charged both individual and
corporate defendants in FCPA cases with violations of
the Travel Act.’ For instance, an individual investor was

convicted of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and the Travel

Act in 2009 where the relevant “unlawful activity” under
the Travel Act was an FCPA violation involving a bribery
scheme in Azerbaijan.”” Also in 2009, a California com-
pany that engaged in both bribery of foreign officials in vio-
lation of the FCPA and commercial bribery in violation of
California state law pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate
the FCPA and the Travel Act, among other charges.”

Sinai’s Bedouin run amok in post-
Mubarak Egypt

Mohamed Fadel Fahmy

AUGUST 24, 2011 -- The landscape of Egypt's lawless North Sinai
governorate is punctuated by the bullet-riddled, torched police station
of Sheikh Zuweid, a densely populated town roughly nine miles from
the Gaza border. It is just one of the security buildings that has fallen
victim to the long-running clashes between the military and the
Bedouin tribes of the region, clashes that have only escalated since
Egypt's revolution. Hosni Mubarak's regime branded the Bedouin, a
largely nomadic and clan-based people, as outlaws who threatened
Egyptian sovereignty. As his rule collapsed in February, and
afterward, the Bedouins sought retribution against the security
services that long oppressed them, attempting to carve out a degree of
autonomy in the region. The unrest has turned into an economic
headache for Egypt's new military rulers: The pipeline that supplies
AQ percent of Israel's natural gas has been bombed five times since
the revolution, halting the country's natural gas exports. But more
importantly, Sinai has become a breeding ground for Islamist
extremism and violence that -- barring a dramatic improvement in
relations between the Bedouins and the central government in Cairo --
threatens Egypt and the region at large. Sinai's lawlessness recently
sparked an international incident: On Aug. 18, gunmen carried out a
string of attacks in southern Israel that left eight Israelis dead. The
Israeli government, which claimed that the attackers were militants
from the Gaza Strip who had crossed into Israel through the porous
Sinai border, retaliated by launching attacks in both Gaza and Egypt.

alternative way is via the probation officer. If there is any doubt about whether the right to be heard covers communications
to the probation officer, the right to be treated with fairness comfortably covers such a requirement.

The proposed rule requires that the probation office affirmatively seek out the victim. It is unlikely that a probation officer
could properly prepare a thorough presentence report without obtaining the victim's views. Indeed, the rules already require the
officer to include victim information in the report. 773 Because there is no way [*891] to know in advance whether the victim
will have relevant information for the report, the probation officer should be required to investigate that possibility. Of course,
nothing in the proposed rule change would require the probation officer to include irrelevant or argumentative information in
the report.

Rule 32(d)(2)(B) - Presentence Report To Contain Victim Information
The Proposal:

Rule 32(d)(2)(B) should be amended to refer directly to victims in describing the content of the presentence report and to
conform to the style used for information about defendants as follows:

(2) Additional Information. The presentence report must also contain the following information:

(A) the defendant's history and characteristics, including:

(i) any prior criminal record;

(ii) the defendant's financial condition; and

(iii) any circumstances affecting the defendant's behavior that may be helpful in imposing sentence or in correctional treatment;

(B) verified information, stated in a nonargumentative style, that assesses the financial, social, psychological, and medical
impact on any individual against whom the offense has been committed any victim of the crime ...

The Rationale:

As discussed at the outset of this article, 734 Rule 32(d)(2)(B) typifies the victim's absence from the current federal rules by
failing to use the word victim in describing what information belongs in a presentence report. In addition, the rule should be
amended to conform to the style used in describing the presentence report's information about the defendant. The rule dealing
with the [*892] defendant's background 7° contains no requirement that information be verified or stated in a non-
argumentative style. As a matter of even-handedness, no such requirement should be listed for victim information. Of course,
well-trained federal probation officers will no doubt attempt to verify all information in the presentence report and phrase all of
the report in a non-argumentative style. The peculiarity in the current rule is that, among the numerous subjects covered by the
rules, the verification and non-argumentative style requirements apply to victim information alone.

Rule 32(e) - Prosecutor To Disclose Presentence Report to Victim
The Proposal:
The prosecutor should be required to disclose relevant parts of the presentence report to victims as follows:

(ec) Disclosing the Report and Recommendation.

233 See supra notes 10-13 and accompanying text (discussing Rule 32(d)(2)(B)).

234 See supra notes 10-13 and accompanying text.

to only consider it with a partner they know very well; to establish pressure-free
channels of communication; and to ensure crystal-clear understanding of how, exactly,
the relationship can be ended if anyone involved truly wants it to end.

Journal-Keeping

Some BDSMers play with really, really strong power dynamics. A good example of this
is couples who choose a 24/7 dynamic: one partner is dominant and the other is
submissive... all the time. I attended a workshop once with Sir Top and slave bonnie, two
wise BDSM educators, where I learned that slave bonnie was only ever allowed to
disobey orders of two kinds:

* Suicidal orders,
* Orders that would cause financial ruin.
The rest of the time, bonnie obeyed Top -- all the rest of the time.

Obviously, relationships like this are totally cool with me as long as they are -- say it with
me, everyone -- 100% consensual! Such relationships can also encourage the use of
interesting communication tactics, because many of the usual tactics don't feel right to the
participants. For example, these relationships often take place between people who feel
such a strong power dynamic that it would be almost impossible for the submissive to
feel comfortable safewording -- safewording can feel disconcertingly like a form of
resistance.

One way of dealing with this problem is for both partners to keep journals that are open
to the other partner. (With some couples, only the submissive keeps an open journal.)
They talk about their romantic feelings, they process their sexual encounters, they
articulate anxieties, etc. Sometimes a partner will give the other one journal prompts to
answer. The idea is that it's easier to express these things when there's a designated space
for it outside the relationship; the journals mean that partners (especially submissives)
can talk about what they need without fearing that they're undermining the power
dynamic.

I find the concept of simultaneous journals intriguing for a number of reasons. One is that
I've used similar tactics myself; I kept a private journal for many years, and once in a
long while I'd give entries to my partners when I needed to explain something
complicated about my feelings. I only did this a few times, ever, but it was really
effective when I did.

Later, I took to writing love letters that I noticed were very similar to both my journal
entries, and to the simultaneous relationship journals suggested for Master/slave couples.
I realized that I was writing letters because, at the time, I felt more comfortable writing
about my desires than talking about them. I've gotten a million times better at talking
about my sexuality honestly and shamelessly since then; but back then, there were
definitely things I wrote to my partners that I couldn't have said aloud. I also wrote
because -- just like Master/slave couples -- I wanted to communicate my feelings outside

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015356.txt,"Whether necrophilia is a victimless crime may still be open to
debate. Nevertheless, claiming that the act was consensual will not be
considered as a legal defense. It should be noted that the necrophilia
community ranges from those who are monogamous and stick with one
partner for a lifetime, to those who are promiscuous and hop from casket
to casket.

According to his own journal entry, Ralph Waldo Emerson, one of
the most revered figures in American literary history, was so devastated by
the death of his young wife, Ellen, that, shortly after her burial, he went out
to the cemetery one night and dug up her corpse, though he didn’ t
mention exactly what he did with it.

One of the most popular episodes of the police TV show, Homicide,
Life On the Streets, was about the investigation of an old lonely widower, a
mortician, who used to party with the corpses, setting them around a table
as if they were alive. They investigated him because he shot a neighbor
who knew about this practice, and then sat in the garden and waited for
the cops. But again, the mortician’ s relationship with those corpses may
have been purely platonic.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002

In 2002, in response to a series of accounting scandals
involving US. companies, Congress enacted the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act (Sarbanes-Oxley or SOX), which strength-
ened the accounting requirements for issuers. All issuers
must comply with Sarbanes-Oxley’s requirements, several

of which have FCPA implications.

SOX Section 302 (15 U.S.C. § 7241)—Responsibility
of Corporate Officers for the Accuracy and Validity of
Corporate Financial Reports

Section 302 of Sarbanes-Oxley requires that a com-
pany’s “principal officers” (typically the Chief Executive
Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO)) take
responsibility for and certify the integrity of their compa-
ny’s financial reports on a quarterly basis. Under Exchange
Act Rule 13a-14, which is commonly called the “SOX cer-
tification” rule, each periodic report filed by an issuer must
include a certification signed by the issuet’s principal execu-
tive officer and principal financial officer that, among other
things, states that: (i) based on the officer’s knowledge, the
report contains no material misstatements or omissions;
(ii) based on the officer’s knowledge, the relevant financial
statements are accurate in all material respects; (iii) inter-
nal controls are properly designed; and (iv) the certifying
officers have disclosed to the issuer’s audit committee and

auditors all significant internal control deficiencies.

SOX Section 404 (15 U.S.C. § 7262)—Reporting
on the State of a Company's Internal Controls over
Financial Reporting

Sarbanes-Oxley also strengthened a company’s
required disclosures concerning the state of its internal con-
trol over financial reporting. Under Section 404, issuers are
required to present in their annual reports management’s
conclusion regarding the effectiveness of the company’s
internal controls over financial reporting. This statement
must also assess the effectiveness of such internal controls

and procedures. In addition, the company’s independent

The FCPA:

Accounting Provisions

auditor must attest to and report on its assessment of the
effectiveness of the company’s internal controls over finan-
cial reporting.

As directed by Section 404, SEC has adopted
rules requiring issuers and their independent auditors to
report to the public on the effectiveness of the compa-
ny’s internal controls over financial reporting.*“! These
internal controls include those related to illegal acts and
fraud—including acts of bribery—that could result in a
material misstatement of the company’s financial state-
ments.” In 2007, SEC issued guidance on controls over

financial reporting.**

SOX Section 802 (18 U.S.C. §§ 1519 and 1520)—
Criminal Penalties for Altering Documents

Section 802 of Sarbanes-Oxley prohibits altering,
destroying, mutilating, concealing, or falsifying records,
documents, or tangible objects with the intent to obstruct,
impede, or influence a potential or actual federal investiga-
tion. This section also prohibits any accountant from know-
ingly and willfully violating the requirement that all audit

or review papers be maintained for a period of five years.

Who Is Covered by the Accounting
Provisions?

Civil Liability for Issuers, Subsidiaries, and Affiliates

The FCPA’s accounting provisions apply to every
issuer that has a class of securities registered pursuant to
Section 12 of the Exchange Act or that is required to file
annual or other periodic reports pursuant to Section 15(d)
of the Exchange Act. These provisions apply to any issuer
whose securities trade on a national securities exchange in
the United States, including foreign issuers with exchange-

traded American Depository Receipts.” They also apply

Broward County government. They already believe there is. They are only trying to uncover evidence to
confirm their beliefs.

Walton's blanket defense of the Commission has made the Feds conclude he is a fool or co-conspirator.

The FBI just needs the evidence and not much of it. To quote the late Supreme Court Justice William .
Brennan: any prosecutor worth his salt could indict a ham sandwich.

This means all evidence, regardless of its ambiguous nature, will be interpreted to support their
assumption of wrongdoing.

_. They will be using software to go through millions of E-mail messages to look for key words. As Buddy,
has. quoted me: The 'E' in E-mail stands for evidence. .

So imagine the following scenario.

Six months from now they uncover an E-mail from the County Manager to Walton stating that
Commissioner X wants to know if the bid of company Y for new busses was correctly filled out. He
replies that it was.

Months later he has tay forgotten about the innocuous E-mail. Based on the merits, he happens to
rank Y's bid number one. = :

You can bet as sure as J: Edgar Hoover wore pink poodle skirts, the FBI will conclude this was code
from Commissioner X to Walton to vote for Y.

Armed with the E-mail you can be damn sure that the G-Men will be back threatening him with

All of this might have been avoided if he had fallen my three basic rules.

“She came into my office, sat down in the chair next to my desk and
tearfully admitted I had been right,” he wrote.

The book opens with an account of Mr. Cheney’s experiences during
the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when he essentially
commanded the government’s response from a bunker beneath the
White House while Mr. Bush — who was away from Washington
and hampered by communications breakdowns — played a peripheral
role. But Mr. Cheney wrote that he did not want to make any formal
statement to the nation that day.

“My past government experience,” he wrote, “had prepared me to
manage the crisis during those first few hours on 9/11, but I knew
that if I went out and spoke to the press, it would undermine the
president, and that would be bad for him and for the country.

“We were at war. Our commander in chief needed to be seen as in
charge, strong, and resolute — as George W. Bush was.”

Mr. Cheney appears to relish much of the criticism heaped on him by
liberals, but reveals that he had offered to resign several times as
President Bush prepared for his re-election in 2004 because he was
afraid of becoming a burden on the Republican ticket. After a few
days, however, Mr. Cheney said that Mr. Bush said he wanted him to
Stay.

But in the Bush administration’s second term, Mr. Cheney’s
influence waned. When Mr. Bush decided to replace Donald H.
Rumsfeld as secretary of defense after the 2006 midterm elections,
Mr. Cheney said he was not given a chance to object.

Mr. Cheney praised Barack Obama’s support, as a senator from
Illinois, for passing a bank bailout bill at the height of the financial
crisis, shortly before the 2008 election. But he criticizes Mr. Obama’s
decision to withdraw the 33,000 additional troops he sent to
Afghanistan in 2009 by September 2012, and writes that he has been

Key takeaways

° We are upbeat on Japan's outlook and think consensus is underestimating the strength of
medium-term GDP and inflation.

° While the consensus looks for just 0.8% growth next year, we expect growth of 1.4% in
CY17 and 1.2% in CY 18.

° With inflation moving in the right direction, we expect BoJ to keep its rates targets

Consensus underestimating GDP and inflation

We are upbeat on Japan's outlook and think consensus is underestimating the strength of medium-term GDP
and inflation. We expect growth of 1.4% in CY2017 and 1.2% in CY2018, well above consensus of just 0.8%
growth next year. For the first time in four years both monetary and fiscal policy are supporting growth. The
combination of modestly higher commodity prices, a weaker yen, and a tightening output gap should drive
Japan-style core inflation to 1.0% in CY2017, and 1.4% in CY2018. We expect the BoJ to keep its rate targets
unchanged for the foreseeable future as inflation moves in the right direction.

Fiscal and monetary policy realigning

For years Japan has oscillated between loose and tight fiscal policy. Japanese policymakers now seem to be
on the same page and we see little risk of another policy error. If anything, we see upside risks from greater
fiscal stimulus via a third supplementary budget or a relatively aggressive FY17 ordinary budget. Meanwhile,

girls with a finger or object; or full-intercourse.

yet been fully felt and is often undervalued. Iraq still draws undue
scepticism but production there is showing serious promise. The
country could add up to 300,000 barrels this year, with more
contracts, more exploration and more drilling already in the works.
Barring an unlikely and total implosion of the government, it is hard
to see production slowing down this decade. The same is true for
“tight oil” coming from unconventional sources. We are seeing this
begin to play out in North American fields such as the Bakken in
North Dakota. As technology and investment are dispersed over the
coming year, oil supply should positively surprise. Third, Saudi
supply increases are not dependant on Opec. The country’s oil
minister Ali Naimi left the cartel’s Vienna meeting earlier this month
with complaints that the organisation had just endured one of its most
contentious and least productive gatherings in many years. But that is
only because the major oil players were not prepared to pretend that
there was agreement on output quotas. With Iran chairing the
meeting, an annoyed Venezuela in attendance and an embattled Libya
looking on, it was much harder to get the group to put aside their
differences and smile for the cameras. The Saudis have the most
influence on price-moving output decisions and they increased
production just as they had planned before the meeting proved so
difficult. Economically stressed oil producers such as Iran and
Venezuela always want higher oil prices. But the Saudis and other
Gulf Co-operation Council producers maintain a longer-term
moderating outlook and they are the ones with the spare capacity to
make the difference. Add that to your favourite economist’s
projection on the softness of the global economy, and we may soon
be asking whether or not this latest IEA move was worth it.

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029850.txt,"To compare the United States’ performance and leadership to Mexico’s, Japan’s and China’s is particularly ill-timed.
Trump might be stuck in a 1980s time warp on Japan. When his “The Art of the Deal” was published in 1987, Americans
were envious of Japan’s brilliant leaders, who were said to be outsmarting the United States at every turn. Since then,
Japan has become the poster child for economic stagnation and political paralysis. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been
unwilling or unable to get his promised reforms enacted, and the country’s economy continues to shrink.

Mexico is watching its growth collapse. While its president, Enrique Pefia Nieto, is a courageous and intelligent leader
who has made some very bold decisions, he has also made some significant missteps. Most important, the country was
ill-prepared for plunging oil prices that have battered government revenues and growth.

China has had three decades of supercharged growth and competent government policy. But in the past few years,
Beijing went on a borrowing binge, running up its total debt to levels that are unprecedented, according to Sharma. And
in the past two months it has made mistakes in managing both its equity markets and currency — mistakes that have
cost $400 billion, the Financial Times reports.

Of course, the United States has problems that are worrying, such as wage stagnation and low labor-force participation.
But the important comparison is not to some ideal fantasy of what America might be but to other countries in the real
world. And the facts show, Mr. Trump, we’re killing them .

Potential Risk at Expiry & Options Limited Duration Risk

Unlike owning or shorting a stock, employing any listed options strategy is by definition
governed by a finite duration. The most severe risks associated with general options
trading are total loss of capital invested and delivery/assignment risk, all of which can
occur in a short period.

Investor suitability

The use of standardized options and other related derivatives instruments are
considered unsuitable for many investors. Investors considering such strategies are
encouraged to become familiar with the Characteristics and Risks of Standardized
Options (an OCC authored white paper on options risks). U.S. investors should consult

The subject of the email should have been warning enough for Jes Staley, the embattled 
chief executive of Barclays. At quarter to nine on Wednesday evening, after a bruising 
shareholders' meeting, Mr Staley received a message purporting to be from his chairman, 
John McFarlane. The heading read: The fool doth think he is wise. 
In fact, the message was from a prankster, using the Gmail account 
iohn.mcfarlane.barclays@gmail. com. The imposter described Michael Mason-Mahon, an 
individual shareholder who called for Mr Staley to resign at Wednesday's annual 
meeting, as brusque as he is ill informed and went on to reassure the Barclays chief 
executive that together they had successfully seen off any attempt to force Mr Staley out. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030359 
Surely the fickleminded nature of the angry few will help tie up any loose ends, the 
short email concluded. You owe me a large Scotch. 
Mr Staley, who has been heavily criticised for his attempt to unmask a whistleblower, 
soon replied to the prankster in effusive terms. Presumably thinking he was talking to his 
chairman, who has been dubbed Mack the Knife for his habit of ousting chief 
executives, Mr Staley said, You are a unique man, Mr McFarlane. 
You came to my defense today with a courage not seen in many people. How do I thank 
you? Mr Staley wrote. The 60-year-old Barclays boss continued in the same style: You 
have a sense of what is right, and you have a sense of theatre. You mix humor with grit. 
Thank you John. Never underestimate my recognition of your support. And my respect 
for your guile. 
He had time for yet more praise before he signed off. And some day I want to see an ad lib 
guitar run. You have all the fearlessness of Clapton, said Mr Staley, referencing the 
legendary guitarist Eric Clapton and his chairman's fondness for playing his guitar in 
public meetings. 
The brief conversation ended with a final email around iipm. The imposter sent a poem, 
which began Worry not of tomorrow's end and ended Revel in their bloodied eyes. 
The first letter of each line spelled out the word `Whistleblower'. 
Thanks for sharing the foxhole, Mr Staley replied. 
The prankster, who contacted the Financial Times via Twitter, told us the email was part 
of his battle with Barclays over a customer issue. I thought I'd see how Jes was relaxing 
after his AGM, he said. 
Barclays declined to comment.

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016139.txt,"Government arrears to contractors could be significant

We estimate the range of unpaid capex for 2015 to be SAR23bn-SAR100bn (US$6bn-
USS$27bn or 1-4.3% of 2015 GDP). At the very minimum, unpaid capex could be around
SAR23bn. This is the amount of additional loans taken out by construction contractors
over 2015 compared to 2014. Total construction loans were SAR106bn in 2015 versus
SAR83bn in 2014. Contractors likely did not go to obtain alternative bank funding for
the same amount as the delayed payments from the government, suggesting delayed
payments should be larger than SAR23bn, in our view.

By the same token, the 2015 budget outturns imply capex was down by 45% to
SAR205bn versus 2014 levels of SAR370bn. This is of course unlikely as construction
grew by 5% in real terms in 2015. Correcting the 2015 budget by the likely
underreporting (an additional SAR100bn in spending, assuming it was all capex-related),
then capex spending was likely down by SAR65bn (17%) in 2015. This would be in line
with the c15%yoy drop in construction awards as reported by MEED.

In comparison, government overdues in the healthcare sector are much smaller. Based
on the disclosures of two listed healthcare groups, we estimate the growth of
government receivables owed to them alone is SARO.4bn. We estimate the total sector
government overdues to private healthcare operators could be 2-3 times this level.

1OUs to serve multiple purposes

1OUs could support simultaneously the multiple needs of the government, domestic
banks and contractors, in our view. The government will be able to conserve fiscal
reserves and restructure the maturity of its outstanding dues. Domestic banks would
substitute corporate credit risk with sovereign risk and improve asset quality, while
contractors could improve their liquidity and working capital position by cashing in early
on the IOUs. We believe most of the contractors impacted could be domestic ones, and
we presume these IOCs would be issued in domestic currency. Furthermore, to the
extent these |OUs are structured as tradable instruments, this could better distribute
risk in the financial sector to those agents more capable or willing to hold it.

Domestic liquidity could be eased, but Fx outflows may not subside

The impact of |OUs on domestic liquidity will likely depend on the issuance mechanism,
of which we have little visibility for now, though this could likely ease domestic liquidity.
We would however expect subsequent Fx reserves losses due to an increase in demand
for Fx consequent to the liquidity injections (a 50% leakage would for instance lead to
USS13.5bn loss in Fx reserves at the high-end of the estimated arrears range).

One possibility for the mechanism would be for banks to extend more secured credit to
contractors using the lOUs as collateral. In this case, domestic liquidity is likely to
remain tight as the banking sector balance sheet would stay stretched. Another, perhaps
more likely, option would be for banks to accept IOUs as deposits. Contractors would
then be able to transfer |OUs to their trade creditors and withdraw cash regularly, with
the total amount being likely a portion of the face value of the |OUs. Banks would hold
new government instruments on the asset side of their balance sheet. This mechanism
could also be structured as a simple sale of the IOUs to domestic banks (with a haircut),
which domestic banks would accommodate through equivalent changes on the asset
side of their balance sheet, without the creation of additional liabilities.

In the latter option, to avoid straining the banking sector liquidity, the deposits
withdrawal or in effect the increased money in circulation would likely require monetary
accommodation from SAMA, in our view. We believe this could take the form of liquidity
injection, possibly through repo operations for the |OUs. Although unconventional, this

isms. With more complete data,

Biotron’s climate chambers can
be varied from —40 degrees Fahr-

anything from the Arctic winter to
a tropical rainforest. On the reof of
the building are six “biomes”——air-
locked, preenhouselike structures
that have been custom designed
to precisely control environmental
factors such as ternperature, UV
radiation, light intensity, wind, pre-
cipitation, and CO;, Each biome is
large enough to house trees more
than 30 feet tall and to allow for
the re-creation of complex biologi-
cal communities that can extend
from the highest tree canopies to
underground soil layers.

If the possibilities seem end-
less, they nearly are. The plan is
for the world’s leading scientists to
rotate in and out of the lab space,
and the biomes will be regularly
reconfigured. One such setup will

use cross sections of Arctic perma-
frost, transported from northern
Canada, so researchers can study
how it reacts to rising tempera-
tures: As the permafrost thaws,
how much methane gas will be
released? How will bacteria and
overwintering insects be affected
by changing freeze-thaw cycles?
Scientists will design and study
more temperate ecosystems,
as well, to learn how changes
in temperature and CQ» affect
the growth of photosynthetic
organisms, including crops and
boreal forest,

Biotron researchers will also be
able to study the benefits and risks
of biotechnology in agriculture,
forestry, and medicine by examin-
ing the basic biology of genetically
modified organisms: What is the
rate of gene transfer from trans-
genic plants to wild ones? Can
plants be engineered to manufac
ture medicinal compounds that
will benefit humans?

The Biotron will be equipped
with a sophisticated imaging and
analysis system—a virtual control
room—that will expand its reach
globally, allowing researchers
anywhere to manage and moni-
tar experiments remotely over
the Intemet in real time. A scien-
tist in India studying the impact
ot climate change on rice could
instruct the Biotron to raise the

tion in a biome set up to simulate
a South Asian rice paddy. Then he

erators or astronomers the latest

Court papers filed Monday say the U.S. Attorney’s Office violated
the Crime Victims’ Rights Act by signing a nonprosecution
agreement with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein without notifying his
victims.

Attorneys Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell, representing Jane Doe
#1 and Jane Doe #2, want a court hearing, where they will ask that
the agreement be invalidated because, they say, the victims’ rights
were violated. If that happens, it could open up the 58-year-old
Palm Beach billionaire to a slew of federal charges involving sex
crimes with minors that were set aside by the agreement.

The motion, filed Monday in federal court in West Palm Beach,
accuses the U.S. Attorney’s Office of deliberately misleading the
victims by telling them the investigation was ongoing, while
concealing they had already signed a deal with Epstein.

According to the motion, the U.S. Attorney’s Office sent “false
notification” letters in January 2008 and May 2008 to the victims
saying “(t)his case is currently under investigation” after the
government had signed the agreement with Epstein in September
2007.

“The only reason that the (U.S. Attorney's Office) concealed the
existence of the non-prosecution agreement from the victims was
not to comply with some legal restriction, but rather to avoid a
firestorm of public controversy that would have erupted if the
sweetheart plea deal with a politically connected billionaire had been
revealed,” the motion says.

If Epstein were found guilty on federal charges, statutory penalties
ranged from 10 years to life.

Instead, the sealed pact was part and parcel of Epstein’s
acceptance of a state plea deal, where he received an 18-month
sentence for soliciting a minor for prostitution and soliciting
prostitution. He served 13 months segregated in a vacant wing of
the county stockade and was let out on work release six days a
week for up to 16 hours a day.

Edwards and other attorneys fought in court for a year before
successfully getting the agreement unsealed in September 2009.
More than 30 minor girls were identified as Epstein’s victims in the
pact.

« Panelists highlighted that while recent innovations in faster payment transfers have
been focused on P2P applications, the B2B opportunity is 7-10x larger. That said,
panelists thought, based on experience in the UK, the cost of faster payments
would likely have to be borne by the existing payment infrastructure as consumers
have not been willing to pay for faster transfers. Additionally, panelists pointed out
that in countries where faster payments have been implemented, it has mostly been
a mandate by regulations suggesting the government has an important role to play.

¢ Panelists highlighted Security and Compliance as being essential for a new Fin Tech
company to be admitted as part of the industry ecosystem. Incumbent payment
companies will only partner with a new FinTech company that can meet the safety
and regulatory standards that the incumbent is required to meet.

none Advisors: Shedding Light on the Potential Opportunity
Guest speakers in this panel included Eli Broverman (Co-Founder and President of
Betterment), Randy Sternke (Vice President, Business Development at Alkanza), and
Vaughn Bowman (Director, Managed Solutions Channel Management at BofAML).
Each firm discussed the unique aspects of their individual business models and
where they see the robo industry headed in the future.

¢  Broverman brought up several key points on how the independent robo advisor
model came about and why it will continue to grow in the future. He believes that
the main drivers include a lack of quality advice for investors with few assets,
investors’ beliefs that financial institutions are not aligned with their interests or
transparent, and the fact that people want financial services to work as well as the
other technology in their lives. Broverman believes that the biggest opportunity
going forward is in the mass affluent segment and the 401K space.

«  Alkanza is focused on providing robo capabilities to financial advisory firms through
partnerships, rather than directly to consumers, with a focus on the platform as well
as portfolio construction.

« We surveyed the audience to gauge their views on the potential size of the robo
advisor market and the most common answer was that assets will surpass $1T,
followed by assets will hit S500B and then level out.

The central demand of these
learning practices is to use one’s own
mental experience as evidence and
content for the responsive presence of
this God, who is believed to be other
than oneself, and to use pretend play to
integrate those mental events into a
representation that is persuasively
external to the self. The emotional
practices provide both direct evidence of
God’s love and, more generally,
evidence that participation in church is
satisfying and worthwhile. In effect the
process asks the congregants to carve
God out of their own experience and to
experience those phenomena as other;
and it uses the emotional practices taught
by the church and the social world of the
congregation to help them hold that God
separate and apart and lovingly
responsive.

This is hard work to do, and not
everyone was able to do it, or to do it
easily. Here two congregants describe
their difficulty in experiencing God
directly despite their efforts.

Jake: “I remember desperately wanting
to draw closer to God, and [to have] one
of these inspired Holy Spirit moments ...
I wanted those [experiences] and I
sought them out, but I never found
myself encountering them”

Irene: “I don’t understand the gift of
prophecy completely. I’ll probably
never will and I don’t have it and I don’t
want it because it would scare me.”

Here is another congregant who has been
able to do so:

Nora: “It was pretty early on in my
relationship with him. I was just all full
of myself one morning. I just had
wonderful devotions and worships and
just felt so close. I went out, and it was
the most god-awful day. It was icy rain
and gray and cold and it was sleeting.
I’m just full of the joy of the Lord, and I
say, “God, I praise you that it isn’t
snowing, and that nothing’s
accumulating, and that the streets aren’t
icy’—and then I went around the corner,
and I hit a patch of ice, and just about
went down. It was so funny to me. I just
burst out laughing out loud. It was just
so funny that he would put me in my
place in such a slapstick personal kind of
way. But then he just graced me the rest
of the morning. The bus showed up right
away, which it never does. I was
reading, and I missed my stop to get off,
and I heard God say, “Get off the bus.” I
looked up and hollered, and the bus
actually stopped, half a block on, to let
me get off. I just felt that intimacy all
morning. Like when you go from
holding a new boyfriend’s hand to
kissing him goodnight ....”

in a 1945 science-fiction story by the British author, Arthur C. Clarke.”

It took the team only six months to design and build the satellite,
which was launched in December 1958 by an Atlas rocket that weighed
9,000 pounds. “The satellite payload became famous for the tape-
recorded message from President Dwight Eisenhower, who insisted that
this project remain top secret,” George tells me. “He said the launch
would be aborted if any word leaked out, because he didn’ t want a
chance of failure to tarnish our image. As it turned out, one of the two
tape recorders did fail, but his Christmas message to the world was the
very first transmitted message from space.”

Eisenhower stated: “This is the president of the United States
speaking. Through the marvels of scientific advance, my voice is coming to
you via a Satellite circling in outer space. My message is a simple one.
Through this unique means, | convey to you and all mankind America’ s

deal of time examining the data by hand as an additional check on its reliability. The other corpora may
not be as reliable.

4) Quality of Metadata. Again, the English language corpus was checked very carefully and
systematically on multiple occasions, as described above and in the following sections. The metadata for
the other corpora may not be equally reliable for all periods. In particular, the Hebrew corpus during the
19th century is composed largely of reprinted works, whose original publication dates farpredate the
metadata date for the publication of the particular edition in question. This must be borne in mind for
researchers intent on working with that corpus.

In addition to these four general issues, we note that earlier portions of the Hebrew corpus contain a large
quantity of Aramaic text written in Hebrew script. As these texts often oscillate back and forth between
Hebrew and Aramaic, they are particularly hard to accurately classify.

All the above issues will likely improve in the years to come. In the meanwhile, users must use extra
caution in interpreting the results of culturomic analyses, especially those based on the various non-
English corpora. Nevertheless, as illustrated in the main text, these corpora already contain a great
treasury of useful material, and we have therefore made them available to the scientific community
without delay. We have no doubt that they will enable many more fascinating discoveries.

III.0.2 On the number of books published

In the text, we report that our corpus contains about 4% of all books ever published. Obtaining this
estimate relies on knowing how many books are in the corpus (5,195,769) and estimating the total
number of books ever published. The latter quantity is extremely difficult to estimate, because the record
of published books is fragmentary and incomplete, and because the definition of book is _ itself
ambiguous.

One way of estimating the number of books ever published is to calculate the number of editions in the
comprehensive catalog of books which was described in Section | of the supplemental materials. This
produces an estimate of 129 million book editions. However, this estimate must be regarded with great
caution: it is conservative, and the choice of parameters for the clustering algorithm can lead to significant
variation in the results. More details are provided in Ref $1.

Another independent estimate we obtained in the study How Much Information? (2003) conducted at
Berkeley (Ref S6). That study also produced a very rough estimate of the number of books ever
published and concluded that it was between 74 million and 175 million.

The results of both estimates are in general agreement. If the actual number is closer to the low end of
the Berkeley range, then our 5 million book corpus encompasses a little more than 5% of all books ever
published; if it is at the high end, then our corpus would constitute a little less than 3%. We report an
approximate value (about 4%) in the text; it is clear that, in the coming years, more precise estimates of
the denominator will become available.

III.1. Generation of timeline plots

III.1A. Single Query

The timeline plots shown in the paper are created by taking the number of appearances of an n-gram ina
given year in the specified corpus and dividing by the total number of words in the corpus in that year.
This yields a raw frequency value. Results are smoothed using a three year window; i.e., the frequency of

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018312.txt,"Long before Paul Baran dreamed up the networks that were required to solve the
“deaf, dumb and blind bomber pilot” challenge, he lived through the sort of moment
that left an indelible psychological mark - one that remains visible in the revolution
he made, as Luther’s lightning-bolt of faith is in the unadorned churches and simple
liturgy of Lutheranism. Baran was born in Grodno, Poland in 1928. His father had an
uneasy sense about what was coming to Europe and he moved the family to America
when Paul was six. Pesach Baran became Paul Bran in America, a model student, a
prize-winning mathematician and eventually at Hughes and Rand he established
himself as one of the great American engineers of his generation. And like so many
refugees of that era, the sharp, irreversible exodus left him with a question. How,
exactly, to stay connected - to family, to tradition, to history? As the murderous mist
of Nazism swept over Europe, the problem took on a searching urgency: How to
maintain a connection, any connection, in the face of utter catastrophe? As he neared
retirement decades later, Baran recalled his life’s work with this resonant line: “I
was concerned,” he said, “with survivability.” The problem that animated his life as
much as it did his networks.

Two years after arriving at RAND, Baran began to discern the outlines to a solution
to the dangerous problem of American military communications. In a series of
lectures for Air Force officers starting in the summer of 1961, Baran began working
his way towards an answer, speech by speech and equation by equation. He didn’t
fully know where he was heading when he began the talks, he said, but he had an
instinct that some other design must be out there, some completely fresh way to
handle the “survivability problem” and by the end of his lecture tour, he had found
it.

Baran’s new design for a durable network had begun with an idea that didn’t work.
The Pentagon, he’d thought, might broadcast thousands of coded messages over AM
radio frequencies all at once as an attack approached. “We interrupt this program to
say: It’s Christmas in July!” Missile silo commanders and bomber commanders
would cluster by their transistor radios, collecting a “launch” code with the ease of
listning to a late-night baseball game. That target-shaped, “Just Aim Here” web of
phone lines would be replaced by something far more distributed, harder to wipe
out with a single Semyorka-7 missile shot. But this approach had problems too. It
relied fatally on broadcast towers and on insecure AM radio waves. But the idea of
such a widespread, insidiously untargettable network got Baran thinking. Sending
out the messages and letting them find their own way had a lot of appeal, if it could
be done. There would be no central hubs. Information would sail over linked lines in
the way radio signals moved in the air. Military communications, in Baran’s system,
would bounce from point to point on this tapestry, at each stop being re-directed
towards their intended destination. The resulting network, if you drew it out, would
look like a fishnet: Lots of links connected to a few knotted nodes. And because the
bundles of data, Baran called them packets, could be moved by the network itself,
you could cut or nuke or sabotage the net in a few places and still use it. The packets
would would find another path. Even a badly ripped up and irradiated network
could, in theory, carry a “launch” - or a recall - message safely from the White House
to a bomber pilot.

ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY

4) Al, CYBERSECURITY, AND Al ATTACK SURFACES

Al Attacks on Computing Systems, Devices, Infrastructure

(Contributions by Kathleen Fisher, John Launchbury, Ashish Kapoor, Sean, Shahar, Jeff Coleman and others)

Al will be used in new ways to enhance cyberwarfare. Targets could be either purely computational,
aimed at the bringing down of computing systems, the stealing of stored information, of gaining access
to monitoring activity and information streams. However, we are more likely to see potentially even
more costly attacks involving a combination of cyber and physical systems, e.g., uranium enrichment
plants, automated flight systems, weapon systems, automated driving systems, healthcare equipment,
oil refineries, or the large swaths of the power grid of the US or other countries.

Cyberwarfare is a domain in which the use of Al is inevitable. Attacks and/or responses are likely to
happen at computing rather than human speeds. As soon as one side has autonomous cyber warriors
systems (ACWs), other actors will have to adapt similar offensive or new defensive technologies. Given
this context, imagine building an ACW designed to seek, disrupt, and destroy within high-value
adversary networks and systems. The ACW has to be able to observe network behavior to build
situational awareness, find places to hide, create exploits to pivot to new places, build a map and use it
to navigate complex networks, find high-value information, and identify targets to disable or from
which to extract information.

Because high-value adversary networks are likely to be relatively isolated, the ACW will have very
limited opportunities for external command and control communication, so it will need to make many
decisions in isolation. It will read information it finds, build a model of adversarial intent, and then
invent ways to disrupt that intent.

Establishing the initial access to the high-value network is likely challenging, so the ACW will spawn and
spread to ensure that it can reconstruct itself if an active part is observed and destroyed. The ACW may
also create disguised caches of specific capabilities so that it can construct new mission-oriented
functionality from pieces. It will morph its active form so that defenses will have a hard time finding it.
It will inject itself into trusted binaries so that its behavior is difficult to distinguish from legitimate
applications.

The mission of the ACW will likely be defined in flexible terms because the human handlers will have
only limited information when it is deployed. The ACW will be designed to seek opportunities to
communicate with its human handlers, but it will also be designed to act autonomously if it observes
triggering behavior in the adversary’s systems. It may try to distinguish training states from active
warfare states on adversary systems. The creators of the ACW will have had to trade off the likely
effectiveness of the ACW versus the cost of premature action. Awareness of the adversary’s systems
will necessarily be limited in accuracy because it only gets a worm’s eye view of the network from the
portions of the system it has been able to compromise. Once the ACW triggers an active mission, it will

Now that P/E multiples have risen off the bottom, what’s the outlook for P/E multiples and earnings from here?

Apple (3% of the S&P index, 15% of S&P’s YTD returns). As shown below, earnings revisions have been negative for 2012,

companies posting 2013 margin expansion since 1970, and by a very wide margin. In our view, it will be difficult for multiples
to rise further unless earnings outperform expectations, particularly if Europe’s structural problems take center stage again.

begins with the party
congress in October and goes
now to the government
sessions in March. And
normally there is a
predictability and what
happens at the National
People’s Congress is not very
significant.

RLK: This year is different:
China talks about a “New
Era” — and this is not just
words, it is really the case. If
we look at the vision that Xi
Jinping gave at the party
congress, what we see here
at the National People’s
Congress we see as the
implementation of that vision
across a very broad front.

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030960.txt,"The location of the meeting is itself suspicious. Prosecutors and other law enforcement
officials normally demand that those seeking a deal come to them.

The fact that Acosta didn’t is another sign — if one were needed — that this was a
capitulation. It also casts further doubt on the claim that Acosta was capitulating for the
purpose of sparing the folks who worked with him in the prosecutor’s office.

The key point, though, is that Ken Starr and Jay Lefkowitz were power players in
Washington — men who might help Acosta down the road.

Readers will be quite familiar with Starr’s background. Lefkowitz was director of cabinet
affairs and deputy executive secretary to the domestic policy council under President
George H.W. Bush. Under President George W. Bush, Lefkowitz served as general counsel
in the Office of Management and Budget and later as deputy director of domestic policy at
the White House.

Accommodating such influential figures must have seemed like a good career move.
Having Starr and Lefkowitz on his side might help Acosta get a judgeship, a cabinet
appointment, or a high-paying job back at Kirkland and Ellis.

I’m speculating, of course. But my speculation finds support in Acosta’s practice of
accommodating the powerful.

Much of that accommodation is of Democrats. Indeed, at the time Acosta was working in
Miami as a U.S. Attorney, he had alienated some Republicans by such accommodation
while at the Department of Justice. Some say he was on the verge of being fired when
Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez parachuted him to Miami. The Epstein settlement was a
way for Acosta to shore up his standing with some influential Republicans.

Will Acosta be able to survive the current scandal? I don’t have a clear sense about this yet.
But President Trump, who isn’t bashful about sacking cabinet members, may come to
believe (if he doesn’t now) that it’s disadvantageous to have a cabinet member who sold out
teenage victims of sexual abuse, especially when the sell-out benefited an ultra-wealthy
serial offender.

* Some on the left are trying to make something or the fact that Starr, who had investigated
Bill Clinton in connection with sexual misconduct, later defended Epstein, a pervert. This is
silly.

In both instances, Starr was doing his job as a lawyer. Perverts are entitled to a defense and
there is nothing hypocritical about investigating Bill Clinton’s misconduct when that was
Starr’s job and later joining the team that was defending Jeffrey Epstein.

Acosta, by contrast, was on the team seeking justice for Epstein and for his victims. He
gave up this quest for reasons that can’t be defended.

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030960
"
IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011931.txt,"Unfortunately, he made the offer to an undercover cop, and was subsequently charged with
“obstruction of official proceedings” for withholding information that could have advanced the
criminal investigation of Epstein—which by that point had been settled in a plea deal. Rodriguez
was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison (Epstein was allowed to serve 13 months in the
Palm Beach county jail), and now awaits an additional sentence on Aug. 24 in federal court in
Miami for transporting firearms, another deal he says he made to pay the bills after he lost his
job.

In a deposition given for the civil suits, Rodriguez testified that he was instructed to always have
$2,000 in cash on hand, so that he could pay both the girls who gave massages and recruiters
such as Haley Robson who brought them to the house. He also testified that Epstein made large
contributions to the Palm Beach Police Department, and in return was given PBPD baseball hats
to put on the dashboard of his various cars to avoid being stopped or ticketed by local police.
Retired Police Chief Michael Reiter, in his own deposition, acknowledged that, in addition to
earlier donations to the police department (which are fairly common in well-heeled Palm Beach),
Epstein had recently given the department $100,000 for some sophisticated equipment. The
police were still researching the purchase when Epstein came under suspicion, and Reiter
ordered the money returned. (Guy Frostin, one of Epstein’s local attorneys, told police that
Epstein also gave $100,000 to the Florida Ballet for massages, because he was ‘very passionate”
about massages being “therapeutically and spiritually” beneficial. Yet victims told police they
had no massage training.)

Perhaps most disturbing, in terms of possible sex trafficking, was Epstein’s relationship with
Jean Luc Brunel, owner of the MC2 modeling agency. According to a complaint filed in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of Florida, an alleged victim said that Epstein, Maxwell,
Brunel, Rodriguez, and Marcinkova “deliberately engaged in a pattern of racketeering that
involved luring minor children through MC2, mostly girls under the age of 17, to engage in
sexual play for money.” (Which would amount to trafficking.)

Brunel is a 50-plus French playboy who was formerly part owner of Karin, a Paris-based
modeling agency. He lives in New York and South Beach, Florida, and owns 85 percent of MC2.,
which has offices in New York, Miami, and Tel Aviv. (The remaining 15 percent is owned by
his partner, Jeff Fuller.) Brunel has been observed as a house guest at Epstein’s Palm Beach
home and may well have had contact with him also in New York, where Epstein owns a lavish
home, and in Paris, where Epstein keeps an apartment on elegant Ave. Foch.

CBS reporter Craig Pyes, who investigated Brunel for a 60 Minutes broadcast many years ago, is
quoted in Michael Gross” book about the modeling industry, Model: The Ugh: Business o
Beautiful Women. Pyes told the author that Brunel “ranks among the sleaziest people in the

fashion industry. We’re talking about a conveyor belt, not a casting couch. Hundreds of girls
were not only harassed but molested.” Now The Daily Beast has learned that Epstein had made a
$1 million wire transfer to Brunel’s offshore bank account in September 2004, just as he was
setting up MC2. Whether this was a gift or a loan or a backdoor investment in the new venture is
unknown. A French citizen who managed to avoid giving evidence in the Epstein investigation,
Brunel declined to comment on any of this, as does Fuller. Asked in April of Brunel's activities,

Important Disclosures

FUNDAMENTAL EQUITY OPINION KEY: Opinions include a Volatility Risk Rating, an Investment Rating and an Income Rating. VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential
price fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst’s assessment of a stock’s: (i) absolute total return potential and (ii)
attractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). There are three investment ratings: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total
return of at least 10% and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than
Buy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0-12
month total return expectation for a stock and the firm’s guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be
referenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst’s view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).

Investment rating Total return expectation (within 12-month period of date of initial rating) Ratings dispersion guidelines for coverage cluster*
Buy = 10% < 10%
Neutral 20% = 30%
Underperform NIA = 20%

*Ratings dispersions may vary from time to time where BofA Merrill Lynch Research believes it better reflects the investment prospects of stocks in a Coverage Cluster.

INCOME RATINGS, indicators of potential cash dividends, are: 7 - same/higher (dividend considered to be secure), 8 - same/lower (dividend not considered to be secure) and 9 - pays
no cash dividend. Coverage Cluster is comprised of stocks covered by a single analyst or two or more analysts sharing a common industry, sector, region or other classification(s). A stock’s
coverage cluster is included in the most recent BofA Merrill Lynch report referencing the stock.

categories Clinton and acquaintances of Clinton fall into. The flight logs showed Clinton
traveling on Epstein’s plane on numerous occasions between 2002 and 2005. See Flight logs
attached hereto as Exhibit “MM.” Clinton traveled on many of those flights with Ghislaine
Maxwell, Sarah Kellen, and Adriana Mucinska, - all employees and/or co-conspirators of
Epstein’s that were closely connected to Epstein’s child exploitation and sexual abuse. The
documents clearly show that Clinton frequently flew with Epstein aboard his plane, then
suddenly stopped - raising the suspicion that the friendship abruptly ended, perhaps because of
events related to Epstein’s sexual abuse of children. Epstein’s personal phone directory from his
computer contains e-mail addresses for Clinton along with 21 phone numbers for him, including
those for his assistant (Doug Band), his schedulers, and what appear to be Clinton’s personal
numbers. This information certainly leads one to believe that Clinton might well be a source of
relevant information and efforts to obtain discovery from him were reasonably calculated to lead
to admissible evidence. See Exhibits “B”, “F” “AA”, “DD”, and “MM” and Edwards Affidavit,
Exhibit “N” at Q15.

: 71. Bradley J. Edwards, Esq., provided notice that he intended to take the deposition
of Donald Trump. Edwards possessed a legitimate basis for doing so: (a) The message pads
eaifisnated from Epstein’s home indicated that Trump called Epstein’s West Palm Beach
mansion on several occasions during the time period most relevant to my Edwards’s clients’
complaints; (b) Trump was quoted in a Vanity Fair article about Epstein as saying I've known
Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy, He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes

beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it --

“Antisocial psychopaths don’t have brakes at all.”

Dr. Salter has never met Epstein, but she’s followed his case
closely and finds him a familiar type. She’s especially struck by
the singular nature of the relationship between powerful, wealthy
men and vulnerable, underage women.

“(The men] are more impressive to a fourteen-year-old [girl]
than to, say, an adult young woman who is self-supporting and
feels more sure of herself,” she explains.

“They are attracted to what they call freshness— barely bud-
ding sexuality and lack of sexual experience. The difference
between them and their victims feeds their ego.

“Great wealth and access are generally factors that make men
feel they are entitled to whomever and whatever they want. Some
have narcissistic personalities with inflated self-images. And of
course, great wealth and status make such men think they can
get away with it. Too often, they’re right.”

On the other hand, Dr. Salter believes that certain condi-
tions, such as the ones exhibited by Jeffrey Epstein, might be an

inborn character trait.

Personality can be influenced, sometimes quite heavily, by

genetics.

“Virtually no one believes anymore that humans are born a ©

totally blank slate,” she explains.

“We arrive with temperamental and personality variations ~
that, of course, the environment can often, but not always, influ- ~

ence. We arrive with baggage.”
Is Epstein a born psychopath, then?

have a conscience. Pyschopaths are often narcissistic, but

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 032913

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025534.txt,"by THOMAS D. WILLIAMS, PH.D.11 Mar 201 sg

As Steve Bannon continues his tour of Europe, energizing the anti-
establishment populist base, the mainstream media cannot help but
admit their admiration for his abilities, despite their dislike of his aims.

In this week’s issue, the left-wing German weekly Sern articulates the greatest fear of the European
establishment: that Bannon “could give the fragmented right in Europe a common ideology and rhetoric.”
Many thought that the reign of the “Dark Lord” had ended, writes Gernot Kramper, when Steve Bannon left
first the White House and then his role as executive chairman of Breitbart News. It turns out, however, that
Bannon’s adversaries had underestimated him, because he is “‘as dangerous as ever,” he confesses.

Kramper cannot conceal his respect for Bannon’s ability to move a crowd. He was greeted by “frenetic
applause” in his recent address before France’s National Front party, Kramper writes, demonstrating his
“impressive potential,” which the writer describes as “dangerous.”

In the mind of his audience, Bannon is something of a miracle-worker, Stamper notes, having “done the
impossible” by bringing Donald Trump into the White House.

The reason Bannon is dangerous, Kramper continues, is because he “lays out the political program of a
worldwide right: He has already conquered the USA; now Europe and then the whole world will follow.”

generally considered to be representative of U.S. stock market activity. The NASDAQ
Composite Index measures all NASDAQ domestic and non-U.S. based common stocks listed
on the NASDAQ Stock Market. The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index includes securities of
NASDAQ-listed companies classified according to the Industry Classification Benchmark as
either Biotechnology or Pharmaceuticals which also meet other eligibility criteria. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average is an index that shows how 30 large, publicly owned companies
based in the U.S. have traded during a standard trading session in the stock market.

Data provided by Cambridge Associates at no charge. Cambridge U.S. VC healthcare data as
of Q1’13. Where results on the Sprout Funds refer to net basis, it is the result of a
methodology that adjusts the gross results for the healthcare technology investments for
recycling, management fees, and carried interest so they can be compared to industry sources
(e.g., Cambridge Associates) on a directly comparable basis. The methodology and
assumptions used to adjust from gross to net basis is described in Appendix 2.

The gross annual compound internal rate of return (“IRR”) and gross multiple of invested
capital as of March 31, 2014 are before giving effect to taxes, management fees, the general
partner’s carried interest and other expenses. The net IRR and net multiple of invested capital
as of March 31, 2014 are after giving effect to management fees, the general partner’s carried
interest and other expenses. All IRRs presented are annualized and calculated on the basis of
quarterly inflows and outflows of cash and unrealized values, assuming such inflows and
outflows occurred as of quarter end and all remaining investments were sold at the current
holding value through as of March 31, 2014. There can be no assurance that unrealized
investments will be realized at the valuations shown.

The results for the Sprout Funds represent results from the healthcare technology portion of
the Sprout Funds, which represents between 8% and 65% of the cost basis of the investments
of the funds taken as a whole. Healthcare technology means, collectively, the
biopharmaceutical, medical device, and diagnostics and infrastructure sectors. See
Appendix 2 for the Methodology Used to Calculate Net Return Numbers for Sprout
Healthcare Technology Portfolios.

Net Distributed to Paid-in Capital (“DPI”): Calculated based on (1) called capital of a fund
(based on individual called capital percentages and fund sizes across multiple funds) and
(2) distributed capital of a fund (based on aggregating individual funds distributed capital
amounts, as calculated using DPI and called individual fund called amounts). For the
purposes of this ratio for NLV-I and NLV-IL, the “deemed contribution” of the general partner
is included in the total amount of capital contributions made by the fund’s partners.

(Distributed + Public) to Paid-in Capital: Calculated based on (1) called capital of a fund
(based on individual called capital percentages and fund sizes across multiple funds) and
(2) distributed capital of a fund (based on aggregating individual funds distributed capital
amounts, as calculated using DPI and called individual fund called amounts) plus the
unrealized value of publicly traded securities based on the closing market price of the
security. For the purposes of this ratio for NLV-I and NLV-II, the “deemed contribution” of
the general partner is included in the total amount of capital contributions made by the fund’s
partners.

"
IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022578.txt,"What Are the Different Types of
Resolutions with SEC?

Civil Injunctive Actions and Remedies

In a civil injunctive action, SEC seeks a court order
compelling the defendant to obey the Jaw in the future.
Violating such an order can result in civil or criminal con-
tempt proceedings. Civil contempt sanctions, brought by
SEC, are remedial rather than punitive in nature and serve
one of two purposes: to compensate the party injured as a
result of the violation of the injunction or force compliance
with the terms of the injunction.

Where a defendant has profited from a violation of
law, SEC can obtain the equitable relief of disgorgement
of ill-gotten gains and pre-judgment interest and can also
obtain civil money penalties pursuant to Sections 21(d)(3)
and 32(c) of the Exchange Act. SEC may also seek ancillary
relief (such as an accounting from a defendant). Pursuant
to Section 21(d)(5), SEC also may seek, and any federal
court may grant, any other equitable relief that may be
appropriate or necessary for the benefit of investors, such
as enhanced remedial measures or the retention of an inde-

pendent compliance consultant or monitor.

Civil Administrative Actions and Remedies

SEC has the ability to institute various types of admin-
istrative proceedings against a person or an entity that it
believes has violated the law. This type of enforcement action
is brought by SEC’s Enforcement Division and is litigated
before an SEC administrative law judge (ALJ). The AL]’s
decision is subject to appeal directly to the Securities and
Exchange Commission itself, and the Commission’s decision
is in turn subject to review by a US. Court of Appeals.

Administrative proceedings provide for a variety of
relief. For regulated persons and entities, such as broker-
dealers and investment advisers and persons associated with
them, sanctions include censure, limitation on activities,
suspension of up to twelve months, and bar from associa-
tion or revocation of registration. For professionals such as

attorneys and accountants, SEC can order in Rule 102(e)

Resolutions

proceedings that the professional be censured, suspended,
or barred from practicing before SEC. SEC staff can seek
an order from an administrative law judge requiring the
respondent to cease and desist from any current or future
violations of the securities laws. In addition, SEC can obtain
disgorgement, pre-judgment interest, and civil money pen-
alties in administrative proceedings under Section 21B
of the Exchange Act, and also can obtain other equitable
relief, such as enhanced remedial measures or the retention

of an independent compliance consultant or monitor.

Deferred Prosecution Agreements

A deferred prosecution agreement is a written agree-
ment between SEC and a potential cooperating individual
or company in which SEC agrees to forego an enforcement
action against the individual or company if the individual
or company agrees to, among other things: (1) cooper-
ate truthfully and fully in SEC’s investigation and related
enforcement actions; (2) enter into a long-term tolling
agreement; (3) comply with express prohibitions and/
or undertakings during a period of deferred prosecution;
and (4) under certain circumstances, agree either to admit
or not to contest underlying facts that SEC could assert
to establish a violation of the federal securities laws. If the
agreement is violated during the period of deferred prosecu-
tion, SEC staff may recommend an enforcement action to
the Commission against the individual or company for the
original misconduct as well as any additional misconduct.
Furthermore, if the Commission authorizes the enforce-
ment action, SEC staff may use any factual admissions
made by the cooperating individual or company in support
of a motion for summary judgment, while maintaining the
ability to bring an enforcement action for any additional

misconduct at a later date.

Rickles to George Carlin, Chris Rock, Jon Stewart, Sarah Silverman and Cartman of
South Park. But the raunchiest participants are often those best known for their roles in
family-friendly sitcoms on network TV: Drew Carey, Jason Alexander, Paul Reiser. I
asked Mr. Saget, who starred as a lovable widower father in the long-running hit Full
House, where his own impulse to tell X-rated standup comes from. Among his reasons:
There's something about all of us that wants to push the limits of the world we're in,
where you can't say anything. There's a time and a place for stuff that is freeing for
people.

I'm not a particular enthusiast for dirty jokes, but that freedom is exactly what I, and I
suspect others, felt when a comic with a funny voice in a bad suit broke all the rules of
propriety at that Friars Roast. But it was just three days earlier at the White House that
Ari Fleischer, asked to respond to a politically incorrect remark about 9/11 by another
comedian, Bill Maher, warned all Americans to watch what they say. That last week in
September 2001, I've come to realize, is as much a marker in our cultural history as two
weeks earlier is a marker in the history of our relations with the world. Even as we're
constantly told we're in a war for freedom abroad, freedom in our culture at home has
been under attack ever since.

To: Michael Wolff < 
The Special Counsel's office, nearly leak-proof since its inception more than a year ago and seemingly 
immune to the President's constant taunts, might appear to be operating in some parallel universe unmoved by 
the every-day political turmoil. But in the course of conversations I've had recently, as a I research a new book 
on President Trump and the forces arrayed against him, what has become clear is that Robert Mueller and his 
office are preparing for a life or death confrontation with the President and the mother of all constitutional 
crises. 
My discussions have been with both White House advisors and people close to the investigation. No source 
involved in this story would speak on the record. 
The sources firmly believe that Special Counsel has ready an aggressive legal theory for the indictment of 
the president for obstruction of Justice. In the last few weeks, as the President has indulged his pardon 
authority, the Mueller team has also developed a legal strategy to oppose the ikely pardon of former National 
Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, who had previously struck a plea bargain which could include his testimony 
against the President. 
Robert Mueller, according to one person familiar with the Special Counsel's thinking, could hardly contain 
his disgust when Rudy Giuliani, the President's new lawyer—hired to makes a television case for the President 
and to push back against the Mueller team—in May airily dismissed the notion that a president can be indicted. 
Adding insult to injury, Giuliani—who a White House source said had likely learned of aspects of the pending 
indictment—said Mueller agreed with that assessment. White House sources believe Giuliani was daring the 
Special Counsel to tip his hand. Mueller, in character, contained his outrage and continued to hold his cards 
close as his team finished preparing the obstruction case and refined the legal theories under which it would 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030402 
claim the right to haul the president into court. 
The Mueller team, according to sources both near the investigation and the White House, has prepared a 
case, but it requires the approval of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who—with the recusal of 
Attorney General Jeff Sessions from the Russia-related investigation—oversees the Mueller team. He would 
need to set aside He could do this based on a finding that the former opinion was inaccurate re the president 
being above the law. ttherby creating an inability to indict a sitting president. Indeed, Rosenstein, as recently 
as April, publicly declared that the President was not a target. This may have been a form of fig leaf to soothe a 
President who regularly demands aides assure him he is not being pursued: the President does not become a 
formal target until Rosenstein agrees to designate him as one. 
Any proposed indictment would confront Rosenstein with matters with which he has been intimately 
involved. The case, according to my conversations , is fundamentally Trump versus the FBI, Justice 
Department, and Mueller investigation itself. In many ways, it boils down to the word of former FBI Director 
James Comey against the word of Donald Trump. Rosenstein, at the President's behest, drafted a memo 
justifying the Comey firing for how the former FBI Director handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation. 
But that justification, in an embarrassment for Rosenstein, was shortly brushed aside by the President when he 
admitted that he fired Comey to disrupt the Russian investigation. What's more, the indictment is said to charge 
that the firing of Andrew McCabe, the former Deputy Director of the FBI, who reported directly to Rosenstein 
after the Comey dismissal, was an instance of illegal retaliation tampering or consipracy by the President 
against a potential witness. 
According to a source with knowledge of the strategy, it will be all the more controversial because if finds 
the entire narrative of the case for obstruction in plain sight. Almost nothing about the case involves new 
information. This indictment could have been drafted without anyone being interviewed, said this source. 
Rather it takes well covered public events and moves them to a set of circumstantial conclusions. There is no 
smoking gun beyond the often flagrant, custom-breaking, events of the President's 16 months in office. Indeed, 
much of the evidence is based on the President's public statements and tweets about those events. 
This is, according to White House sources who have gotten wind of this approach, good news: the case then, 
is just an issue of what motives you ascribe to the President's behavior—behavior that is, the President's 
supporters believe it is easy to show, impulsive and not thought out. Hence no intent. For the Mueller team, it 
is precisely that careless behavior and flagrant disregard for the rules that they aim to put on trial. 
There is no certainty that the Special Counsel's office will ultimately pursue its plan to indict the President. 
But, according to a source the worry is that the plan is more advanced than previosly believed. . The 
investigation continues and new evidence or other factors might push both prosecutors and the grand jury in 
another direction. Just passing its first anniversary, the Mueller investigation has conducted itself with 
remarkable secrecy. Descriptions of a proposed indictment provide one of the few insights into its strategy and 
its sense of the political peril in front of it. 
It may be noteworthy that there appears now not to be plan for an indictment related to collusion, although, 
legal experts say, that could come later. 
The White House view is that without the underlying collusion charge, Mueller will be presenting a weak 
and politically-motivated case. The Mueller view seems to be that the obstruction charges go to the heart of 
exposing how Trump has abused his power and turned the White House into a corrupt fiefdom. 
The President's scheme to obstruct the FBI's investigation into connections between the Trump campaign 
and Russian efforts to undermine the U.S. election, according to Mueller began on the 7th day of the Trump 
administration. Three days prior to this, on January 24, National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, lied to the 
FBI about his contacts with the Russian Ambassador, Sergey Kislyak. These were contacts, directed by an 
unnamed person. 
That unnamed person, in the view of several lawyers who discussed the case with me, is very likely Trump 
himself, and might imply that Trump encouraged Flynn to lie to the FBI, promising to protect him—using his 
influence or pardon powers. 
On January 27th, seven days after Donald Trump's inauguration, the President had the one-on-one dinner 
with FBI

Overview

The.Las Vegas Experience

Developed as an entertainment destination, Las
Vegas is driven by a consumer services economy
where “the experience” is its primary commodity.
Las Vegas is one of the most visited tourist
destinations in the United States and it possesses a
unique international appeal that draws a remarkable
3.4 million visitors each month. Identified as the
global capital of entertainment and gaming, it is
the iconic three-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard
known as “the Strip” that draws visitors to Las
Vegas. With 115,000 hotel rooms located on the
Strip, the concentration of tourists is more than
any other metropolitan statistical area in the world.
The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Association
reported 41.1 million visitors in 2014 and project the
total number of visitors to reach a new market high
of 42 million in 2015.

ATTORNEY FOR EPSTEIN VICTIMS: 'T HAVE NEVER SEEN A STRANGER CASE' Palm Beach Daily News
September 20, 2009 Sunday

‘Out of the ordinary'
West Palm Beach criminal defense attorney Gregg Lerman said several aspects of the Epstein case are unusual.

I don't understand why it would be a federal case in this circumstance, and why was there anything in writing at all
and why did they seal the agreement? Lerman said. Why did it go to the grand jury instead of through the state filing
lewd assault charges? That's unusual. And it's very unusual that they structure a plea to get county time rather than
prison time. That's definitely out of the ordinary. Nobody goes to county jail as a state criminal punishment.

In May of 2011, SEC entered into its first deferred
prosecution agreement against a company for violating the
FCPA.*® In that case, a global manufacturer of steel pipe
products violated the FCPA by bribing Uzbekistan govern-
ment officials during a bidding process to supply pipelines
for transporting oil and natural gas. The company made
almost $5 million in profits when it was subsequently
awarded several contracts by the Uzbekistan government.
The company discovered the misconduct during a world-
wide review of its operations and brought it to the govern-
ment’s attention. In addition to self-reporting, the company
conducted a thorough internal investigation; provided
complete, real-time cooperation with SEC and DOJ staff;
and undertook extensive remediation, including enhanced
anti-corruption procedures and training. Under the terms
of the DPA, the company paid $5.4 million in disgorge-
ment and prejudgment interest. The company also paid a
$3.5 million monetary penalty to resolve a criminal investi-
gation by DOJ through an NPA.**°

For further information about deferred prosecution

agreements, see SEC’s Enforcement Manual”

Non-Prosecution Agreements

A non-prosecution agreement is a written agreement
between SEC and a potential cooperating individual or com-
pany, entered into in limited and appropriate circumstances,
that provides that SEC will not pursue an enforcement
action against the individual or company if the individual or
company agrees to, among other things: (1) cooperate truth-
fully and fully in SEC’s investigation and related enforce-
ment actions; and (2) comply, under certain circumstances,
with express undertakings. If the agreement is violated, SEC
staff retains its ability to recommend an enforcement action
to the Commission against the individual or company.

For further information about non-prosecution

agreements, see SEC’s Enforcement Manual>*

Termination Letters and Declinations
As discussed above, SEC’s decision to bring or
decline to bring an enforcement action under the FCPA is

made pursuant to the guiding principles set forth in SEC’s

Enforcement Manual. The same factors that apply to SEC
staffs determination of whether to recommend an enforce-
ment action against an individual or entity apply to the
decision to close an investigation without recommending
enforcement action.*”

Generally, SEC staff considers, among other things:

e the seriousness of the conduct and potential viola-
tions;

e the resources available to SEC staff to pursue the
investigation;

e the sufficiency and strength of the evidence;

e the extent of potential investor harm ifan action is
not commenced; and

e the age of the conduct underlying the potential
violations.

SEC has declined to take enforcement action against
both individuals and companies based on the facts and cir-
cumstances present in those matters, where, for example,
the conduct was not egregious, the company fully coop-
erated, and the company identified and remediated the
misconduct quickly. SEC Enforcement Division policy is
to notify individuals and entities at the earliest opportu-
nity when the staff has determined not to recommend an
enforcement action against them to the Commission. This
notification takes the form of a termination letter.

In order to protect the privacy rights and other inter-
ests of the uncharged and other potentially interested par-
ties, SEC does not provide non-public information on mat-

ters it has declined to prosecute.

What Are Some Examples of Past
Declinations by DOJ and SEC?

Neither DOJ nor SEC typically publicizes declina-
tions but, to provide some insight into the process, the fol-
lowing are recent, anonymized examples of matters DOJ

and SEC have declined to pursue:

Example 1: Public Company Declination
DOJ and SEC declined to take enforcement action
against a public U.S. company. Factors taken into consider-

ation included:

two friends increased over the house sale, Epstein found himself under investigation by
local Palm Beach police. Epstein’s legal problems vastly escalated but the new Trump
property , with only minor improvements, was bought 3 years later in 08 , the time
Trump was facing his huge debt. for $96 million by Dmitry Rybolovlev. a Russain oligarch.
That is, Trump had either miraculously earned $55 million, without putting up a dime, or
Rybolovlev, or someone such as Rybolovlev, paid Trump Properties, LLC—actual owner
unknown—$96 million, thereby providing a clean payment of $55 million to
someone. This at the very same time that trump was into Deutsch bank for over 600
million dollars but with a 40 millino personal guarnatee .Rybolovlev might have, in effect,
paid himself for the house, thereby cleansing the money. Epstein, on his part, would be
senetenced to 30 months, 12 of those months in jail on a prostitution charge.
After the election, when Bannon was introduced to Epstein, Bannon told him, “You were
the one person I was truly afraid of coming forward during the campaign.”

“not surprising ” said Epstein.

ENDNOTES

Except as otherwise expressly noted, all performance information contained herein, including
rates of return, is as of March 31, 2014 and is unaudited. The performance information is based
on the cumulative invested capital, cumulative cash dividends and realized and unrealized
sales proceeds in portfolio companies. Where designated as “gross”, the performance
information is presented on a gross basis with regard to expenses and does not reflect
deductions for any management fees, the general partner’s carried interest or other expenses.
Where designated as “net”, the performance information is presented on a net basis after giving
effect to management fees, the general partner’s carried interest and other expenses. Please
refer to Section III: “Summary of Historical Investment Performance” and the endnotes below
for a more detailed description of the performance of the NLV-I, NLV-II and the Sprout Funds.
An investment in the Fund does not represent an interest in any indicated investment or any
investment portfolio of any related or other investment fund, including any investment or fund
managed by the Fund Managers. Disclosure of past performance herein is for informational
purposes only and is not indicative of future results.

4 The financial data contained herein relating to the valuations and investment performance of
NLV-I, NLV-IL the Sprout Funds and their investments (including the IC. portfolio thereof)
are estimates prepared by NLV as of March 31, 2014, and have not been audited. The vintage
year of each fund represents the first year that an investment in a portfolio company was
either committed to or funded. While NLV’s valuations of unrealized investments are based
on assumptions that NLV believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the actual realized
returns on unrealized investments will depend on, among other factors, future operating
results, the value of the assets and market conditions at the time of disposition, any related
transaction costs and the timing and manner of the sale, all of which may differ from the
assumptions on which the valuations used in the prior performance data contained herein are
based. Accordingly, the actual realized returns on these unrealized investments may differ
materially and adversely from the (assumed) returns indicated herein. Past performance is
not indicative of future results. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve results
comparable to those shown herein, will be able to avoid losses or will be able to achieve its
investment objectives. Except as specifically noted, all performance information contained
herein is on a “gross” basis before giving effect to management fees, the general partner’s
carried interest, taxes and other expenses, the application of which would reduce such prior
performance and indicated rates of return. Except as otherwise indicated, performance
information is for NLV-I, NLV-II and the Fund Managers’ investments in the Sprout Funds.
While the Fund Managers initiated, led, co-led, managed or were otherwise instrumental in
the identification, negotiation, execution and/or management of these investments (as further
described herein), other individuals, including individuals from Sprout Group with respect to
the Sprout Funds, were involved in and assisted with these investments.

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025535.txt,"“You are part of a worldwide movement that is bigger than France, bigger than Italy, bigger than Hungary,
bigger than all that,” Bannon told French populists.

Bannon showed that he “dominates the mood against the ‘elites,’ the ‘establishment’ and the ‘perverse
system’ of greedy corporations and banks, and of course also against the press, which is led around ‘like a dog
on the Leash,’” Stamper writes.

And now he Mr. Bannon setting himself up as an instigator, if not an outright shepherd, of a movement that
crosses borders, languages and parties.

“Bannon is a master of apocalyptic rhetoric,” Stamper continues, effortlessly weaving together nationalist
interests with an international populist movement.

The American strategist showed his “true caliber” by expounding modern methods of political freedom
through blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies, Stamper said, leaving many of his hearers behind.
Bannon has demonstrated that if the right wants to rule the future, “it must dominate modern themes and
rhetorically position them,” he added.

Aspiring to be far more than an uncle who tells stories to his nephews of how he won the fight for the White
House, Stamper writes, “Bannon wants to become the super godfather of the international right.”

Although Bannon often looks a bit disheveled, “he should not be underestimated,” the writer warns. Past
business partners attribute impressive “strategic foresight” to the eccentric tactician, saying he was often
“three or four steps ahead” of his opponents in business. Because of his phenomenal memory, his nickname is
“the encyclopedia,” Stamper notes with a certain reverence, and in his speeches he will spontaneously cite

“Bannon brings with him exclusive knowledge of power from the very heart of power,” Stamper writes,
which he will bring to bear on Europe’s fragmented populist populism.

According to Stamper, Bannon has established his “European headquarters” in Italy, from where he intends to
galvanize European populists.

The Italian political situation is completely to his liking, Stamper declares, with a political landscape
“dominated by populists, right-wing ideologues and the political puppeteer Berlusconi.”

83. Despite three no contact orders entered against Epstein (see Exhibit C, supra),
Haman learned that Epstein continued to harass his victims. For example, Jane Doe had a trial
set-for her civil case against him on July 19, 2010. As that trial date approached, defendant
Epstein intimidated her in violation of the judicial no-contact orders. On July 1, 2010, he had a
“private investigator” tail Jane Doe — following her every move, stopping when she stopped,
driving when she drove, refusing to pass when she pulled over. When Jane Doe ultimately drove
to her home, the “private investigator” then parked in his car approximately 25 feet from Jane
Doe house and flashed his high beam lights intermittently into the home. Even more
threateningly, at about 10:30 p.m., when Jane Doe fled her home in the company of a retired
police officer employed by Jane Doe’s counsel, the “private investigator” attempted to follow
Jane Doe despite a request not to do so. The retired officer successfully took evasive action and
placed Jane Doe in a secure, undisclosed location that night. Other harassing actions against
Jane Doe also followed. See Motion for Contempt filed by Edwards in Jane Doe v. Epstein
detailing the event, including Fisten Affidavit attached to Motion, Composite Exhibit “RR.”

e High quality dividend yields (sourced from existing European
and UK equities)
High quality companies with geographically diversified business
models that pay sustainable dividends offer an attractive income
stream in a low yield world. Historically, dividends have made a
substantial contribution to total returns, and we expect this to remain
the case in the current environment.

e Western winners from emerging market growth (sourced from
existing equity holdings)
Emerging economies continue to grow faster than developed
economies. With little need to deleverage and repair balance sheets,
Asian economies are also well positioned to continue to outpace their
Western peers in the years ahead. We have identified companies from
a variety of sectors in Europe, the US and Japan which have significant
exposure to the rapidly growing emerging regions. We believe a
diversified portfolio of these companies will reward investors seeking
to profit from the robust demand growth in emerging economies.

e Natural gas growth gainers (sourced from existing equity
holdings)
Natural gas is a relatively clean source of energy, and we think it will
benefit from continued substitution for other energy sources over the
long term. We have examined the dynamics of the global market and
the various components of the gas value chain, and identified the
areas we see as the most significant beneficiaries currently. These
include producers in Europe and Asia, suppliers of infrastructure,
services and related machinery, and Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs)
in the US, that offer both attractive yields and growth.

e EM corporates: a growing asset class (sourced from global
government bonds - CIO UW)
Given our relatively constructive current view on risk, we regard EM
corporate debt as more attractive than EM sovereign debt due to its
higher overall yield. Over a 6-month horizon, we expect EM corporate
bonds to outperform US Treasuries and deliver total returns of close to
4%.

2 UBS

Government bond alternatives (sourced from government bonds -
clo UW)

Developed world government bonds offer a comparatively small cushion
against future interest rate hikes and many face increasing credit risk. We
expect selected bonds of supranational or national agencies, sub-national
governments, multinational corporates, and covered bonds to outperform
government bonds. We recommend switching out of government bonds
into these alternatives.

US high yield corporate bonds (sourced from government bonds -
clo UW)

Positive economic growth, robust corporate earnings and healthy balance
sheets provide support to US high yield corporate bonds. Current yield
spreads of 540 basis points still price in a more dire economic outcome
than we expect. Historically, US high yield bonds have delivered similar
returns as US equities with lower volatility. We continue to believe that
US high yield corporate bonds represent a more favorable risk/return
potential than equities and expect mid single digit returns over the next 6
months. Senior loans are exposed to similar positive fundamentals, and
offer an attractive, floating rate alternative to US high yield.

The place to be in Hedge Funds

Growth in most developed markets remains muted. In this environment,
less directional hedge fund strategies, such as relative value and event
driven, should offer above average returns.

EM currencies: An underappreciated asset class (sourced from
government bonds - CIO UW)

The currencies of emerging countries, collectively as an asset class and
measured using total returns (i.e. including interest received), have the
potential to contribute positively to the longer-term returns of a well-
diversified portfolio. We believe that this is especially relevant now that
the developed world is settling into an extended period of very low
interest rates.

6) DEEP SOCIETAL INFLUENCES

Al, Agency, and Disempowerment

(Contributions from Gireeja Ranade, Andrew Maynard, David McAllester, Stuart Russell and others)

We will be benefitting from Al system that are competent at doing important tasks. People and
organizations seek Al systems that bring new abilities to the table. We desire autonomous cars that
drive without collisions, we medical assistants that can diagnose patients accurately and we would like
to have household assistants that can infer our intentions and execute them flawlessly —and even
proactively. The military wants Al systems that can help with strategy and tactics, and systems that
outmaneuver human led troops, and anticipate and respond to threats either on timescales that
humans cannot achieve, or over landscapes humans cannot cover.

Today, there is still skepticism about performance of Al systems in a variety of domains. However, we
expect that Al systems will become more central decision support, pattern recognition, autonomous
decision making, and other types of problem solving. As such, we will become increasingly reliant on Al
systems. This raises concerns in several areas, including personal decision support, healthcare,
transportation, governance and the handling and operation of weapon systems.

We shall consider example of healthcare from Gireeja Ranade. The scenario and trajectory applies to
other areas as we consider the increasing role and power of Al in our lives and in society:

As healthcare providers are increasingly stretched in providing consultations with patients, diagnosing
conditions, and developing treatment and/or intervention plans, tech companies identify a market
opportunity for Al-based digital assistants that are designed to augment healthcare providers by
collecting data from consultations, cross-referencing it with existing medical records, and providing
feedback to aid appropriate diagnosis and decisions on how to proceed with treatment. Given the
economic and health-base potential of the technology, it receives widespread support from the federal
government (predominantly through grants and initiatives supporting it’s development), together with
healthcare providers and healthcare insurance companies.

Initial implementations are based on modular systems that share some commonalities with digital
assistants like Siri and Echo/Alexa. Under the general name “Al-consult”, they consist of a physical unit
in a consulting room that constantly monitors conversations, and sends encoded information to cloud-
based servers. Here, information is coded, interpreted, and parsed out to further agents that cross-
reference interpreted data with identified patient and healthcare provider records. Multiple and
diverse databases are interrogated at this point. The result is data packets that include key information
on the patient, including medical history, life style, and current status, and on the healthcare provider,
including past history of diagnoses, recommendations, successes and failures. These are forwarded to
a dedicated Al engine that analyzes the packets, and returns notes, advice and recommendations to
the physical unit in the consultation room.

| really don’ t like to boast, but in my lifetime, on half a dozen

something | always wanted to do. What a thrill it must have been for Dr.
Harold Cerumen, who decided that cleaning out earwax should be known
as “cerumen disimpaction.” And veterinarian Alice Neuticle who coined
the word “neuticles” —cosmetic testicles for a dog that’ s been

So I’ m not asking for credit. Or cash. Since money had been called
“dough” and then morphed into “bread,” | figured that “toast”
would be the next logical step in that particular linguistic evolution, but my
campaign itself became toast, in the sense that “toast” now means

history.

Also, | was intrigued by the process of having a body part named
after oneself. How proud Casper Bartholin’ s parents must have been to
have a son who christened the source of female lubrication that takes the
friction out of intercourse as “Bartholin’ s glands.” But my idea of
calling those two vertical lines between your nose and your mouth

“Krassner’ s crease” just never became popular.

work to degrade or destroy specific functionality (e.g., rewriting network routine tables, replacing
plans, changing target information).

Once the technology for ACWs exists for military targets, it seems likely there will be cross over into
civilian use. Such technology could be deployed against law enforcement targets to disrupt criminal
investigations, against banks to steal financial assets, or against companies to steal intellectual
property. As they spread into these more general targets, the effects of ACWs might become less
predictable. If an ACW incorrectly assesses the situation, it might end up taking down a flight control
center or a stock exchange, for example.

SOURCES

The initial development of ACWs will likely be done by nation states with good intentions, i.e., securing
the national interests. (Although what is in one country’s national interest may well not be in the
national interest of other countries). The shared existence of such technology might serve as a
deterrent against their use by anyone in much the same way that nuclear weapons have served as a
deterrent, although ACWs would likely have to be used to devastating effect first to establish their
efficacy and threat. However, once the technology exists, it would be very difficult to keep it out of the
hands of people with malicious intent (criminals, terrorists, and rogue nation states). It is also the case
that the technology has the potential to cause significant collateral damage even if its use was
originally well intentioned because it can be difficult to distinguish civilian from military targets in
cyberspace.

PERSISTENCE

Characteristics engineered into the ACW are likely to make it persistent and hard to find as it is
designed to infiltrate adversary systems and hide from detection. Once released and active in the open
Internet, it may be economically impossible to destroy and remove.

OBSERVABILITY

Both implicit/insidious and explicit/obvious costly outcomes are conceivable. An ACW could make
subtle changes to systems that cause adverse outcomes while hiding its tracks, making it extremely
difficult to determine why something has gone wrong or even that something has gone wrong. Attacks
that impact the physical world would be harder to mask, but it might still be possible to hide the role of
the ACW in the attack.

TIME FRAME

It seems likely we would start to see ACWs in less than 15 years. Initial steps along these lines are
already taking place; see DARPA’s Cyber Grand Challenge, which took place in August 2016 in Las
Vegas. The Cyber Reasoning Systems (CRS) that competed in that event are still primitive, the first of
their kind. The team that won the competition came in last in the human-league capture-the-flag
tournament that happened immediately after. The situation is likely analogous to what we have seen

HEADLINE: JUDGE TO RULE ON SEALED PLEA-DEAL PAPERS TODAY
BYLINE: MICHELE DARGAN, MICHELE DARGAN, Daily News Staff Writer

BODY:

A circuit judge will decide today whether the public will be privy to the federal government's non-prosecution deal
with Jeffrey Epstein, which was sealed when the convicted sex offender pleaded guilty in June 2008 to two felony
counts.

Epstein, of Palm Beach, will be released from the Palm Beach County Stockade July 22, after serving less than 13
months of his 18- month sentence for procuring a minor for prostitution and solicitation of prostitution.

Teri Barbera, spokeswoman for the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office, confirmed his release date Tuesday.

Epstein's projected release date had been Sept. 24, but gain time -- which includes his participation in a
work-release program -- moves the date up to July 22, Barbera said.

Epstein, 56, has been in the work-release program since Oct. 10, in which he is allowed out of the stockade six days
a week, from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., to go to his West Palm Beach office, the Florida Science Foundation, monitored by an
ankle bracelet and accompanied by a deputy.

As part of Epstein’s state plea agreement, the U.S. Attorney's Office agreed not to prosecute Epstein on federal
charges as long as he fulfills all requirements of his sentence and probation. The federal non-prosecution agreement has
been under seal in state court.

Epstein's attorney Jack Goldberger filed court papers asking that the documents stay sealed for the following rea-
sons: to prevent a serious imminent threat to the fair, impartial and orderly administration of justice; to protect a com-
pelling government interest; to avoid substantial injury to innocent third parties and to avoid substantial injury to a party
by disclosure of matters protected by a common law and privacy right, not generally inherent in these specific type of
proceedings, sought to be closed.

Fort Lauderdale-based attorney Brad Edwards represents three Epstein victims and has asked Circuit Judge Jeffrey
Colbath to unseal the federal agreement to the public. An attorney for The Palm Beach Post also has asked that the rec-
ords be unsealed.

Edwards and his clients have seen the agreement after a federal judge ruled that they are allowed to see it. But that
ruling bars Edwards and anyone else who sees the document from disclosing the terms to anyone else.

Edwards said he wants to use that document in the deposition of various material witnesses relative to his cases.

Jeffrey and Ghislaine: Notes on New York's Oddest Alliance < 
http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2O11/O3/notes- on-new-
yorks-oddest-cou ple-jeffrey-epstein-and-ghislaine- maxwell.html > 
by Vicky Ward <http://www.vanityfaircom/contributors/vicky-  ward> 
March 8,2011,2:30 PM 
I've got a story idea for you. The rebuilding of Indonesia. Or New Orleans. Or both. Go there. I've just been. You 
will never think the same way about anything again. 
So spoke not Bill or Melinda Gates, but Ghislaine Maxwell, the 48-year-old woman being written up everywhere at 
the moment as the alleged procurer of young women for billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. 
Epstein, 57, is the financier who spent a year in jail on charges of soliciting prostitutes—and now there is talk of 
another investigation because various women, now in their twenties and thirties, have come forward with 
allegations that he molested them when they were under-age. The allegations first surfaced in British newspapers, 
which have zeroed in on Epstein's friendship with Prince Andrew, who has recently tried to publicly disassociate 
himself from his old pal. 
I wrote a piece for Vanity Fair in 2003 called The Talented Mr. Epstein. It was largely a business piece that focused 
on his mysterious exit from Bear Stearns in 1981, his close relationships with Jimmy Cayne, Les Wexner, the 
chairman of Limited Brands, and above all, the man who claimed to be his mentor, Steven Jude Hoffenberg, who is 
currently serving a 20-year-jail sentence for bilking investors in Towers Financial out of $450 million. 
The piece alluded to Epstein's great friendship with Maxwell, and how she introduced him to young women with 
whom he had sexual relationships. But, in the end, the story didn't really go there, focusing instead on the issue that 
remains a mystery—how Jeffrey made his money, and how Ghislaine made hers. 
This is not to say I didn't hear stories about the girls. I did. But, not knowing quite who to believe, I concentrated on 
the intriguing financial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the same ones, different ones. 
And their stories are bone-chilling. Journalists from England have phoned—and, in one case, flown—to ask me 
about Epstein and Maxwell. Who is he? And the British, especially, want to know: Who is she? At this point, I am so 
bored of repeating myself to others—it was, after all, my 2003 Vanity Fairstory that really brought him into the 
limelight—that I have decided to write about this myself. 
Bizarrely, perhaps, I have gotten to know Jeffrey and Ghislaine far better after my piece than before it. I kept 
running into both of them, separately, at parties. Jeffrey is not a social animal so he usually has a couple of young 
women with him who stand two feet behind him, as if serving a monarch. Do they speak? I remember asking him 
once, nodding at his lookalike blondes. He laughed. Not like you,Vicky, was his riposte. 
I remembered that when we'd once discussed math—in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed I hadn't 
studied math since I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a package at 
home via messenger. It was a book: Math for idiots. 
So he is not without humor, even though he doesn't drink or smoke, and hates restaurants. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030417 
Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects, newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He was 
certainly preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few moments 
in his company and you know this to be true. 
When I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that 
Andy—as Jeffrey calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his strange 
title is. Because if one thing's for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what he's talking 
about far more than Andy does. Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other financiers hang out 
with him. 
And Ghislaine? 
Full disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It's almost impossible not to. 
She is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I've spent hours 
talking to her about the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is curious. 
She has spent weeks at the bottom of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent me a DVD of 
the fish there. Her rolodex would blow away almost anyone else's I can think of—probably even Rupert Murdochs'. 
She is very well-read and can talk about most things for hours. She is passionate about Bill Clinton with whom she is 
close friends. 
Yet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-Platero, 
(known fondly to her close friends as the Tennis Goddess) Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When it comes 
down to things she really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her vulnerability. 
And that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey. 
He saved her, I remember a close friend of mine telling me. When her father died, she was a wreck; inconsolable. 
And then Jeffrey took her in. She's never forgotten that—and never will. 
In many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect replacement 
for her father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his sexual pecadillos, but 
then Ghislaine's father was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving a massive black hole he'd 
fraudulently created. To Ghislaine, Jeffrey's habits may not have seemed that strange. 
In fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful people 
in the end either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl issues, and 
moved countries to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You don't tend to get to 
the top by being the world's most balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett didn't quite manage a 
normal life—whatever that is. He had a second wife for many years whose existence he has been open about. 
So what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven't spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her 
loyalty to friends like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she'll be out and about as always. Look at 
Waksal and Stewart. No one sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up for all sorts 
of blemishes.

hy do powerful men do the things that Jeffrey Epstein
and Prince Andrew have been accused of doing?

Dr. Anna Salter studies child sex offenders profes-
4 sionally. Educated at Harvard, with a graduate degree in clinical
; psychology, she spoke, with the benefit of hindsight, about Jeffrey
_ Epstein and others like him from her office in Madison, Wisconsin.
“Consider a car,” says Dr. Salter. “There’s a motor, and there
are brakes. We all have sexual impulses we don’t think it would
be a good idea to act on. Most of us have good control over our
behavior. We have good brakes.

| “Sexual offenses and inappropriate sexual behavior are some-
times the result of a bad motor—for example, an attraction to
Prepubescent children or eleven-to-fourteen-year-old pubescent
shildren as opposed to postpubescent individuals. But they are
aly ays the result of bad brakes.

The biggest risk to our view is that actual US fiscal easing turns out to be minimal. But
we believe the USD/JPY’s move will be quicker than whatever reality emerges in coming
months. China’s unexpected RMB devaluation or any explicit rhetoric to guide USD
weakness by the new US administration could eventually trigger significant JPY strength.
The other risk is a rapid increase in US long-term yields triggers risk-off trade,
supporting Japanese yen. However, we believe a potential correction in US equity is
unlikely to reverse the medium-term direction of USD/JPY (though it could cause a
short-term pullback as our technical analysis suggests) because higher yields and
USD/JPY are backed by fundamentals for now —prospect for fiscal easing. Finally, politics
is a significant concern. The President-elect has previously criticized the Japan-US
security alliance. A shift away from the Japan-US security alliance could lead to higher
geopolitical risk for Japan. It could also lead to more defense spending and expansion of
Japanese military capability and could lift prospect for fiscal expansion. A combination
of higher geopolitical risk and defense spending is probably less bearish USD/JPY than
Japanese equities.

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011930.txt,"It’s true that some underage girls may have lied about their age, and some came to the house
voluntarily several times—although, according to Florida statutes, none of that has any bearing
on the criminality of the contact, particularly if the girl was 16 or younger. But what is
particularly disturbing about this case—judging by arrangements at the Palm Beach house—is
that Epstein, a billionaire hedge-fund manager, organized his life around this sexual compulsion
in an open and methodical way that suggests he felt he was beyond the law.

* Conchita Sarnoff: Epstein Faces Sex Traffic Probe

* Billionaire Pedophile Goes Free

According to police who executed a search warrant, the house was decorated with large, framed
photos of nude young girls, and similar images were found stashed in an armoire and on the
computers seized at the house (although police found only bare cables where other computers
had been). Some bathrooms were stocked with soap in the shape of sex organs, and various sex
toys, such as a “twin torpedo” vibrator and creams and lubricants available at erotic specialty
shops, were stowed near the massage tables set up in several rooms upstairs.

Epstein also enlisted his staff in the predatory activity, and four—Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross,
Lesley Groff, and Marcinkova—figured in the FBI investigation. The Non Prosecution
Agreement stipulated that they would not be charged. According to police reports and swom
statements in the civil suits, all four women, among their other duties, worked to ensure that an
appointment book for twice- or thrice-daily “massages” was stocked with fresh recruits.
Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late Czechoslovakian-born press baron Robert Maxwell, who
was for many years Epstein’s live-in partner, also recruited young girls.

Since his 13-month sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor, Epstein has settled more
than a dozen lawsuits brought by underage girls. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last
week, days before a scheduled trial; each received well over $1 million—an amount that will
hardly dent Epstein's $2 billion net worth.

The victims told police they waited in the kitchen to be called upstairs for a massage, and the
house chef often gave them a bite to eat. House manager Alfredo Rodriguez said in his sworn
statement that a maid named Lupita, who was a devout Catholic, wept when she complained to
him about cleaning up after the massage sessions, picking up soiled towels and putting away the
sex toys. And she was upset that a photo of Epstein with the pope hung next to one of him with a
young girl.

Ironically, Rodriguez, who ran the house on El Brillo Way in 2004 and 2005, ended up being
sentenced to more jail time than his boss as a result of the complex investigation into Epstein’s
activities. He was fired, he says, for inadvertently drawing police attention to one of the girls
when she arrived at the house unannounced to collect money. He saw an unfamiliar “beater” in
the driveway one evening and called 911. When he left Epstein’s employ, Rodriguez took away
some notes and emails about massage appointments as “protection” against his own prosecution,
and failed to produce them during the Palm Beach Police Department’s initial investigation.

Unable to get work as a house manager elsewhere in South Florida, he says, Rodriguez later tried
to sell this “golden nugget”—his term—for $50,000, to be used in the victims’ civil suits.

As Steve Bannon continues his tour of Europe, energizing the anti-
establishment populist base, the mainstream media cannot help but
admit their admiration for his abilities, despite their dislike of his aims.

In this week’s issue, the left-wing German weekly Svern articulates the greatest fear of the European
establishment: that Bannon “could give the fragmented right in Europe a common ideology and rhetoric.”
Many thought that the reign of the “Dark Lord” had ended, writes Gernot Kramper, when Steve Bannon left
first the White House and then his role as executive chairman of Breitbart News. It turns out, however, that
Bannon’s adversaries had underestimated him, because he is “‘as dangerous as ever,” he confesses.

Kramper cannot conceal his respect for Bannon’s ability to move a crowd. He was greeted by “frenetic
applause” in his recent address before France’s National Front party, Kramper writes, demonstrating his
“impressive potential,” which the writer describes as “dangerous.”

In the mind of his audience, Bannon is something of a miracle-worker, Stamper notes, having “done the
impossible” by bringing Donald Trump into the White House.

The reason Bannon is dangerous, Kramper continues, is because he “lays out the political program of a
worldwide right: He has already conquered the USA; now Europe and then the whole world will follow.”

Bannon the European: He’s opening the populist fort in Brussels

The former Trump strategist arrives in Europe with The Movement. Objective: an alliance
between right-wing leaders, from Salvini to Orban in view of the 2019 elections

NEW YORK. The invasion of Europe has begun. Steve Bannon, 65, the American far-right guru
who was Donald Trump’s right-hand man in the White House — but let go last summer following
the racist violence in Charlottesville — is preparing to march on Brussels. Launching, he told the
Daily Beast himself, a new non-profit foundation called The Movement, (Il Movimento), right in the
heart of Europe and its institutions. Through which he hopes to coordinate the populist right in view
of the European elections which will be held in spring 2019.

Objective: to compete with George Soros, the American billionaire of Hungarian origin, benefactor
of the Democratic party, who since 1984 with his Open Society has spent at least $32 billion in
support of NGOs dealing with human rights. And for this he became the bogeyman of the populist
right, accused of plots of all kinds: including that of wanting to replace Italians with immigrants in
order to have labour at low cost. A mantra repeated in the past on Twitter also by the current
Minister of the Interior Matteo Salvini.

The ambition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site Breitbart — which in
the European campaign preceded him since the platform had already opened bureaux in London and
Rome — is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great “populist international” of which he
has long since been dreaming.

The Movement, in fact, intends to function as an extreme right-wing think tank: a source of strategic
advice to channel the not-so-politically structured discontent of the most extreme European
movements. Analysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and channeling
funding.

The aim is to create a populist alliance, a sort of “super group” that if victorious can conquer up to a
third of the European Parliament in the elections next May.

Indeed — putting the common policy of the Old Continent in the hands of Bannon and his own. The
American strategist is very attached to the Freedom Caucus — the extreme right of the US Congress
— and in 2014 he was at the top of the Cambridge Analytica company, which in 2016 used data
stolen from Facebook to try to influence the presidential election from which Donald Trump
emerged victor. It is not a mystery that for a long time he courts nationalists of the right from East to

Global oil supplies are healthier than they

scem_
Ian Bremmer

June 24, 2011 -- Many of the world’s oil consuming nations, led by
the US, shocked oil markets this week as the International Energy
Agency agreed to release 60m barrels of oil from strategic reserves
over the coming month. The move was intended to offset price
pressures brought about by Libya’s supply cut and comes in response
to Opec’s recent inability to formally endorse new supply increases.
The IEA action is also an example of growing concern over higher oil
prices in Washington, where the White House is managing political
fallout from high gasoline prices as next year’s presidential elections
loom just over the horizon. Yet, a year from now, we’re likely to
look back on this moment and find that fears for supply have
diminished. There are three reasons. First, the most substantial
fallout from the Arab world’s recent upheaval is behind us. Syria’s
Bashar al-Assad continues to fight for survival and Yemen continues
to flirt with failed-state status, but the Gulf’s major oil-producing
states are quite stable. So are other major producers. Even in Iran,
with its leaders infighting, the green revolution has moved off the
streets for now. While there are plenty of long-term structural
challenges for many major economies — just ask China — for the
moment there are no more Libyas left to explode. IEA action and the
ongoing Saudi supply increases will neutralise what remains of the
oil price’s political risk premium. Second, big additional supply is
coming, and it’s not all priced in. Offshore Brazil and Canadian oil
sands are no longer new stories, but their collective impact has not

never having been cleared from the massive and totally negative media coverage involving
Epstein and his illegal activities. Plaintiffs have been, and continue to be, irreparably harmed by
these false internet-based links to Epstein. (Exhibits R & S attached).

33. Second, Plaintiff Brunel was also told by Epstein to leave the Palm Beach area in
anticipation of a deposition of Plaintiff Brunel in a criminal case against Epstein. On the direct
advice of Epstein, Plaintiff Brunel went to Europe and Asia for a period of time. This was done
for the sole purpose of delaying Plaintiff Brunel’s deposition.

34. Asa direct result of Plaintiff Brunel’s travels, his deposition was delayed twice. When it
was finally scheduled for November 2009, Plaintiff Brunel was in fact available (Exhibit L
attached). However, a medical emergency in the family of his attorney further delayed this
deposition (Exhibit M attached). It was never rescheduled and he was never deposed.

35. This was a blatant example of obstruction of justice in the criminal case. Epstein was
solely responsible for telling Plaintiff Brunel to leave the area. Plaintiff Brunel lost a huge
opportunity to clear his name, and that of his agency, Plaintiff MC2.

36. Third, as a result of all of the facts stated above, Plaintiff Brunel was under tremendous
psychological pressure throughout this period of time.

37. This psychological pressure resulted in Plaintiff Brunel avoiding business contacts as set
forth above. This pressure also directly caused Plaintiff Brunel to avoid certain social contacts
during this period of time.

38. Plaintiff Brune] became extremely withdrawn and anxious at this time.

press was reporting extensively on the lurid details of Epstein’s illegal activities with the under-

aged girls.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014400.txt,"1) Upturn in inventory cycle: Defensives—Cyclicals

We expect cyclicals to outperform defensives, premised on our end-2017 $/¥ estimate of ¥120, and this is
supported by our above-consensus economic growth outlook. Our Japan economist sees a shift to fiscal
easing, firms countering the tight labor market by increasing capex, and estimates industrial production to grow
3.5% and 3.6% in 2017 and 2018, respectively. With the inventory cycle exiting a contraction phase and
entering a recovery phase, conditions are likely to remain conducive to cyclicals outperforming defensives
(Chart 1, Exhibit 3).

2) Higher inflation, rates: Deflation stocks— Inflation stocks

Up to 1H16, the Japan equity market saw continued preference for deflationary stocks as domestic inflation
remained subdued and the JGB curve underwent excessive bull flattening. Defensives outperformed cyclicals
(Chart 1), growth outperformed value (Chart 2), and stocks that benefit from a low-yield environment (REITs)
outperformed the converse (banks, insurance; Chart 3). However, we expect conditions to reverse into 2017.
We see US Treasury yields rising and Japanese core CPI inflation recovering to +1.4% yoy by 2018 and core-
core to +1.1% yoy. Stronger inflation and higher foreign yields should steepen the JGB yield curve above10yr,
while below 10yr should escape from downward pressure as BoJ rate cut expectations recede. Against this
backdrop, we expect to see a rotation from deflation to inflation stocks, which in addition to cyclicals means
banks and insurance should outperform REITs within the financial sector (Chart 3). This is also in line with the
global rotation expected by Michael Hartnett (The Flow Show: The Inflation Era Begins 10 November 2016).

3) Nikkei winner of steeper UST and strong macro

In a scenario of strong external demand and US rate hikes (particularly with curve steepening), Japan equities
tend to be the winner on a local currency basis, led by cyclicals, banks and insurance stocks (Exhibit 4).
Resurgence in the Japan macro trade of short yen / buy equities is also a possibility.

Our Buy-rated stocks in bank, insurance and cyclical sectors are listed in Table 1.

Mr. Cheney’s long struggle with heart disease is a recurring theme in
the book. He discloses that he wrote a letter of resignation, dated
March 28, 2001, and told an aide to give it to Mr. Bush if he ever had
a heart attack or stroke that left him incapacitated.

And in the epilogue, Mr. Cheney writes that after undergoing heart
surgery in 2010, he was unconscious for weeks. During that period,
he wrote, he had a prolonged, vivid dream that he was living in an
Italian villa, pacing the stone paths to get coffee and newspapers.

to companies whose stock trades in the over-the-counter
market in the United States and which file periodic reports
with the Commission, such as annual and quarterly reports.
Unlike the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions, the accounting
provisions do not apply to private companies.“

Although the FCPA’s accounting requirements are
directed at “issuers,” an issuer’s books and records include
those of its consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates. An issu-
er’s responsibility thus extends to ensuring that subsidiaries
or affiliates under its control, including foreign subsidiar-
ies and joint venture partners, comply with the accounting
ptovisions. For instance, DOJ and SEC brought enforce-
ment actions against a California company for violating the
FCPA’s accounting provisions when two Chinese joint ven-
tures in which it was a partner paid more than $400,000 in
bribes over a four-year period to obtain business in China.”
Sales personnel in China made the illicit payments by obtain-
ing cash advances from accounting personnel, who recorded
the payments on the books as “business fees” or “travel and
entertainment” expenses. Although the payments were made
exclusively in China by Chinese employees of the joint ven-
ture, the California company failed to have adequate internal
controls and failed to act on red flags indicating that its affili-
ates were engaged in bribery. The California company paid
$1.15 million in civil disgorgement and a criminal monetary
penalty of $1.7 million.

Companies may not be able to exercise the same level
of control over a minority-owned subsidiary or affiliate as
they do over a majority or wholly owned entity. Therefore,
if a parent company owns less than 50% of a subsidiary or
affiliate, the parent is only required to use its best efforts
to cause the minority-owned subsidiary or affiliate to
devise and maintain a system of internal accounting con-
trols consistent with the issuer’s own obligations under
the FCPA. In evaluating an issuer’s good faith efforts,
all the circumstances—including “the relative degree of
the issuer’s ownership of the domestic or foreign firm and
the laws and practices governing the business operations
of the country in which such firm is located”—are taken

into account.2””

Civil Liability for Individuals and Other Entities

Companies (including subsidiaries of issuers) and
individuals may also face civil liability for aiding and abet-
ting or causing an issuer’s violation of the accounting pro-
visions.”** For example, in April 2010, SEC charged four
individuals—a Country Manager, a Senior Vice President
of Sales, a Regional Financial Director, and an International
Controller of a U.S. issuer—for their roles in schemes to
bribe Kyrgyz and Thai government officials to purchase
tobacco from their employer. The complaint alleged that,
among other things, the individuals aided and abetted the
issuer company’s violations of the books and records and
internal controls provisions by “knowingly provid[ing]
substantial assistance to” the parent company.?! All four
executives settled the charges against them, consenting to
the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them
from violating the accounting and anti-bribery provisions,
with two executives paying civil penalties.°? As in other
areas of federal securities law, corporate officers also can be
held liable as control persons.?*

Similarly, in October 2011, SEC brought an admin-
istrative action against a U.S. water valve manufacturer and
a former employee of the company’s Chinese subsidiary
for violations of the FCPA’ accounting provisions. The
Chinese subsidiary had made improper payments to employ-
ees of certain design institutes to create design specifications
that favored the company’s valve products. The payments
were disguised as sales commissions in the subsidiary’s books
and records, thereby causing the US. issuer’s books and
records to be inaccurate. The general manager of the subsid-
iary, who approved the payments and knew or should have
known that they were improperly recorded, was ordered to
cease-and-desist from committing or causing violations of
the accounting provisions, among other charges.”

Additionally, individuals and entities can be held
directly civilly liable for falsifying an issuer's books and
records or for circumventing internal controls. Exchange
Act Rule 13b2-1 provides: “No person shall, directly or
indirectly, falsify or cause to be falsified, any book, record
or account subject to [the books and records provision] of

the Securities Exchange Act.”?* And Section 13(b)(5) of

Defining Intelligence

All our knowledge begins with the senses, proceeds then to
the understanding, and ends with reason. There is nothing
higher than reason.

—Immanuel Kant

What is school for? A common answer is, to make people more knowl-
edgeable. Another is, to socialize them and prepare them for living
with others. Another is, to make them ready for work. (This last one
seems almost laughable because it is clearly untrue in the modern
world, but people do seem to still believe it.) Another is, to prepare
them for more school. (People take this one very seriously.) My answer
is: School should make people more intelligent.

Really? Can we make people more intelligent? There are those
who would argue, and I am quite sure they are right, that intelligence
is genetic: It can’t be altered by school, one way or the other.

Nevertheless, I think that school should make students more
intelligent.

How can I believe both things?

It all depends on how you define intelligence. Let’s think about in-
telligence the way ordinary people define it when they say that some-
one seems dumb or that someone seems to be very smart. There is a
lot to be learned by considering seriously the folk view of intelligence
as opposed to the classical school/testing view.

In the 2007 Miss Teen USA contest, Miss South Carolina responded
to this question:

“Recent polls have shown that a fifth of Americans can’t locate
the United States on a world map. Why do you think this is?”

having to borrow from banks); eased first time homebuyer restrictions; and injected capital into its biggest banks. What the
China debate is really about is whether these measures will reinvigorate growth or not. Since much of the recent
slowdown was self-imposed due to inflation concerns, it seems reasonable to us to expect the Chinese economy to respond
positively to stimulus should it be reapplied. We are not big buyers of Chinese onshore equities for reasons we have
explained before, but we do rely on 7%-8% Chinese GDP growth to fuel economic activity in Asia that underpins many
of our investments there. As things stand now, we see no reason why this growth target will not be achieved.

"
IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018475.txt,"the anxiety-inducing frameworks of the serious discussion, the bedroom, etc.

So when I developed my sexual communication workshop, I encouraged love letters. I
gave two suggested points of departure for a love letter:

1) Describe what happened during a sexual encounter you had together, with particular
emphasis on what your partner did that you really liked -- and what you liked about it. (I
love it when you fuck me is a great thing to say, but you give much more information to
your partner if you say I love it when you fuck me from behind,” or even better, I love
it when you fuck me from behind and it feels amazing when your balls hit my clit. [This
blog does not necessarily reflect the desires or encounters of Miss Clarisse Thorn. ])

2) Describe a fantasy you have. Bonus points if you explicitly put your partner in it. (I
like to imagine you sinking your teeth into me until I scream. This blog does not
necessarily... oh, who am I kidding.)

Postscript: In the comments on this piece, a reader noted that they might feel anxious and
pressured if a partner described them doing something specific. I hadn't thought of this,
but I totally believe that it could be a problem. Certainly, I've sometimes had experiences
writing to a partner where I described him doing something and he thought it was
ridiculously hot... but I've also done it and had partners dislike it. I guess my final advice
is that -- as with all communication -- you'll want to consider the audience, and be ready
to apologize.

I wrote this post in 2011, years after the events in my coming-out story, and a long time
after I'd done all the above research into communication tactics. By 2011, I'd picked up
lots of sexual and BDSM experience with a variety of partners. I had just written a post
about my most destructive past relationship; the post got a lot of readers and was
eventually cross-posted to Jezebel. I wanted to do something positive with all the

2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *888

In its current form, Rule 32(c)(1)(B) suggests that the probation officer is required to include restitution information only in a
case covered by the MVRA because only then is restitution (in the language of the current rule) required. 22° No sound
reason exists [*889] for such a limitation, particularly after the enactment of the CVRA. The CVRA guarantees that victims
have the right to full and timely restitution as provided in law. *2? Even when the court is proceeding under the discretionary
VWPA, without appropriate information in the presentence report, the court cannot determine whether to exercise its discretion
to award restitution. Therefore, the rule should be changed to require that the presentence report contain restitution information,
from which the court can determine whether to make a restitution award.

(New) Rule 32(c)(3) - Probation Officer To Seek Out Victim Information
The Proposal:

The probation officer preparing a presentence report should be directed to determine whether a victim wishes to provide
information for the report as follows:

(3) Victim Information. The probation officer must determine whether any victim wishes to provide information for the
presentence report.

The Rationale:

Under the CVRA, the victim has the right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court involving ...
sentencing ... .. 72° This right clearly encompasses the victim's right to allocate, or make an oral statement at sentencing, as
discussed below in connection with Rule 32(i). 73! However, the right to be reasonably heard also appears to include the
opportunity to provide information to the probation office during preparation of the presentence report.

As Senator Kyl explained, the victim's right to be heard at sentencing should be broadly construed:
[*890]

[The CVRA] provides victims the right to reasonably be heard at any public proceeding involving ... sentencing. This provision
is intended to allow crime victims to directly address the court in person. It is not necessary for the victim to obtain the
permission of either party to do so ... . When a victim invokes this right during ... sentencing proceedings, it is mtended that ...
he or she be allowed to provide all three types of victim impact: the character of the victim, the impact of the crime on the
victim, the victims’ family and the community, and sentencing recommendations ... .

It is not the intent of the term reasonably in the phrase to be reasonably heard to provide any excuse for denying a victim
the right to appear in person and directly address the court. Indeed, the very purpose of this section is to allow the victim to
appear personally and directly address the court. This section would fail in its intent if courts determined that written, rather
than oral communication, could generally satisfy this right. On the other hand, the term reasonably is meant to allow for
alternative methods of communicating a victim's views to the court when the victim is unable to attend the proceedings. Such
circumstances might arise, for example, if the victim is incarcerated on unrelated matters at the time of the proceedings or if a
victim cannot afford to travel to a courthouse. In such cases, communication by the victim to the court is permitted by other
reasonable means. 777

In light of this legislative history, victims undoubtedly have a right to make an in-court statement at sentencing as part of their
right to be heard. But they also have the right to communicate in other ways with the court. At sentencing, an obvious

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018313.txt,"“The early simulations,” Baran recalled, “showed that after the hypothetical network
was 50% instantly destroyed, the surviving pieces of the network reconstituted
themselves within a half a second.” That was a way of saying that his messages were
finding new routes on the network even after huge parts of the system had been
taken off line. And they were doing it nearly instantly. Better still, as he began to
model these fishnet, “distributed” networks, Baran discovered that they were not
only capable of surviving attack, they were also incredibly efficient. “If built and
maintained at a cost of $60 million (1964 Dollars),” he calculated, his design would,
“handle the long distance telecommunications within the Department of Defense
that was costing the taxpayer about $2 billion a year.”

Baran travelled the country for most of 1961 and 1962, classified presentation and
slide-rules in hand, trying to persuade skeptical generals, engineers and other
scientists. It was, he found, a nearly impossible task. He recalled a visit to the
towering AT&T switching headquarters on Thomas Street in Lower Manhattan. It
was,an implacable temple of the high-priests of hub-and-spoke network design.
That one building handled more telephone and telex traffic than nearly any other
single point on earth. Surely the place was very high on the USSR first-strike list for
exactly that reason. So Baran expected a friendly reception. After all, he’d be telling a
bunch of men with a uranium death sentence that he’d found a way to get them off
the Soviet target list. His new “mesh” network would mean that bombing AT&T
would be largely pointless. It wouldn’t blind US commanders. If only they’d redesign
their network, the AT&T engineers might save their own lives. They thought he was
insane.

“I tried to explain packet switching to a senior telephone company executive. In mid-

stunned. He looked at his colleagues in the room while his eyeballs rolled up,
sending a signal of his utter disbelief. He paused for a while, and then said, ‘Son,
here’s how a telephone works...” Of course Paul Baran knew how a telephone
worked. You jacked one point to a switch to another point. That was the problem.
This was why AT&Ts design would be absolutely useless in the face of the
catastrophe he’d been told to prevent. Baran was, nerve and blood and bone, as an
analyst, and even as a refugee perhaps, alive with the imperative of survivability, of
how connection might mean the difference between war and peace. Those morons
in the AT&T building? What the hell could they be worrying about?

But it wasn’t just that $2 billion annual check from the US Defense Department those
wizened phone wizards were seeing vanish in Baran’s fishnet, it was a whole way of
thinking. The AT&T scientists wanted to control the addresses, the routes, the
timing of messages from the center. This sort of authoritarian design appeared more
efficient to them; perhaps it was even more psychologically comfortable since it
matched their own experience of being commanded and controlled. Kar] Wittfogel,

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017020.txt,"The computations required to generate these corpora were performed at Google using the MapReduce
framework for distributed computing (Ref $5). Many computers were used as these computations would
take many years on a single ordinary computer.

Note that the ability to study the frequency of words or phrases in English over time was our primary focus
in this study. As such, we went to significant lengths to ensure the quality of the general English corpora
and their date metadata (i.e., Eng-all, Eng-1M, and Eng-Modern-1M). As a result, the accuracy of place-
of-publication data in English is not as reliable as the accuracy of date metadata. In addition, the foreign
language corpora are affected by issues that were improved and largely eliminated in the English data.
For instance, their date metadata is not as accurate. In the case of Hebrew, the metadata for language is
an oversimplification: a significant fraction of the earliest texts annotated as Hebrew are in fact hybrids
formed from Hebrew and Aramaic, the latter written in Hebrew script.

The size of these base corpora is described in Tables S3-S6.

III. Culturomic Analyses

In this section we describe the computational techniques we use to analyze the historical n-grams
corpora.

IlI.0. General Remarks

III.0.1 On Corpora.

There is significant variation in the quality of the various corpora during various time periods and their
suitability for culturomic research. All the corpora are adequate for the uses to which they are put in the
paper. In particular, the primary object of study in this paper is the English language from 1800-2000; this
corpus during this period is therefore the most carefully curated of the datasets. However, to encourage
further research, we are releasing all available datasets - far more data than was used in the paper. We
therefore take a moment to describe the factors a culturomic researcher ought to consider before relying
on results of new queries not highlighted in the paper.

1) Volume of data sampled. Where the number of books used to count n-gram frequencies is too small,
the signal to noise ratio declines to the point where reliable trends cannot be discerned. For instance, if
an n-gram's actual frequency is 1 part in n, the number of words required to create a single reliable
timepoint must be some multiple of n. In the English language, for instance, we restrict our study to years
past 1800, where at least 40 million words are found each year. Thus an n-gram whose frequency is 1
part per million can be reliably quantified with single-year resolution. In Chinese, there are fewer than 10
million words per year prior to the year 1956. Thus the Chinese corpus in 1956 is not in general as
suitable for reliable quantification as the English corpus in 1800. (In some cases, reducing the resolution
by binning in larger windows can be used to sample lower frequency n-grams in a corpus that is too smal
for single-year resolution.) In sum: for any corpus and any n-gram in any year, one must consider whether
the size of the corpus is sufficient to enable reliable quantitation of that n-gram in that year.

2) Composition of the corpus. The full dataset contains about 4% of all books ever published, which
limits the extent to which it may be biased relative to the ensemble of all surviving books. Still, marked
shifts in composition from one year to another are a potential source of error. For instance, book sampling
patterns differ for the period before the creation of Google Books (2004) as compared to the period
afterward. Thus, it is difficult to compare results from after 2000 with results from before 2000. As a result,
significant changes in culturomic trends past the year 2000 may reflect corous composition issues. This
was an important reason for our choice of the period between 1800 and 2000 as the target period.

militarism,” but the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency created false
employment and political biographies to circumvent Truman’ s command.

Those scientists were then granted security clearance and infiltrated
into hospitals, universities, and the aerospace industry, further developing
their techniques in propaganda, mind control, and behavior modification.
Among them was Wernher von Braun, who had been a member of the
Nazi Party and an SS officer who could be linked to the deaths of
thousands of concentration camp prisoners. (Fun fact: He married his
cousin.) He came to America in 1945 and became a citizen in 1955. He was

"
IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021363.txt,"Some people experience God speaking
directly to them in an easy relationship.
Others do not.

As aresult of my involvement
with the Templeton group, I decided to
carry out some quantitative and
experimental work to see whether we
could figure out the differences between
those who found it easy to do this work,
and those for whom it was difficult. That
work suggests that there is a
psychological capacity that makes the
process of knowing this kind of God
easier, though its absence does not
prevent religious experience, and its
presence does not predict it. It is the
capacity for absorption, which is at the
heart of imagination. Absorption is the
capacity to focus one’s attention on a
non-instrumental (and often internal)
object while disattending to everyday
exterior surrounds. Absorption is related
to hypnosis and dissociation, but not
identical to either. All of us go into light
absorption states when we settle into a
book and let the story carry us away.
There are no known physiological
markers of an absorption state, but as the
absorption grows deeper, the person
becomes more difficult to distract, and
his sense of time and agency begins to
shift. He lives within his imagination
more, whether that be simple
mindfulness or elaborate fantasy, and he
feels that the experience happens to him,
that he is a bystander to his own
awareness, more himself than ever
before, or perhaps absent, but in any
case different. And as the absorption
grows deeper, people often experience
more imagery and more sensory
phenomena, sometimes with
hallucinatory vividness. Scholars do not
discuss training in absorption, although
researchers of hypnosis and dissociation

are clear that some kind of practice
effects can be seen. °

Conclusion

Prayer is basically training in
absorption, at least the kind of prayer in
which the person praying focuses
inwardly and disattends to the everyday
world in order to engage with God. It
would be hard to over-estimate the
importance placed on prayer and prayer
experience in a church like this and
indeed, in Christian America today.
Many of the best-selling Christian books
are books on prayer technique, and they
sell in the millions. Such books often
begin by presenting the concrete sensory
experience of God described in the
Hebrew Bible as the everyday
relationship for which the ordinary
believer should strive. In these manuals,
the act of praying is understood as a skill
that has to be deliberately learned. I
discovered that these evangelical
congregants assumed that prayer was a
skill which had to be taught, that it was
hard, that not everyone was good at it,
and that those who were naturally good
and well trained would experience
changes associated with a more richly
developed inner world. Their mental
images would seem sharper; they would
be more likely to report unusual sensory
experiences. They would be more able,
in short, to experience God. The more
quantitative work—done in
collaboration with Howard Nusbaum
and Ron Thisted--suggests that those
who have a proclivity for absorption and
who trained that proclivity through
prayer are indeed more able to
accomplish the demanding learning that
this concept of God sets out.* They are
more able to identify God’s presence in
their mind. They are more likely to
experience God as an invisible

The Art Market: a house party 2010-Oct-11

By Georgina Adam www.google.co.uk

“Frieze week” kicks off this week in London, drawing the cream of the art world to Britain’s capital.
It is centred of course on the fair that started it all (Frieze opens to the public in Regent’s Park on
Thursday), but a host of satellite events are also on offer. One of the more intriguing is taking place
just down the road from the fair, at 2 Cornwall Terrace, part of an enormously expensive real estate
project being developed and sold.

In what appears to be a sophisticated way of selling both art and the property, the 18th-century
mansion is being used as a temporary venue for an exhibition entitled The House of the Nobleman,
October 15-20. The format is hybrid, both commercial and non-commercial, with 68 works on show,
half of them loans from collectors — one is David Roberts, the rest are secret — the other half consisting
of works of art for sale.

The House of the Nobleman is curated by the artist Wolfe von Lenkiewicz, who has teamed up with a
young Russian curator, Victoria Golembiovskaya. It is backed by Mirax, a Russian real estate company
that has a “significant but minority” stake in the Cromwell Terrace complex. Mirax belongs to a
Russian billionaire, Sergei Polonsky, but Mirax has been troubled since the financial recession and has
a reported $120m in debt; the firm did not respond to a request for comment. The eight houses in the
Cromwell Terrace complex are priced between £29m and £60m.

Various dealers, from the UK and elsewhere, are contributing works of art to the show; they range
from two paintings by Poussin to Picasso’s “Buste d’Homme a la Pipe” (1969), priced at £3m. Banksy,
Richter, Klein, Rodin, Cézanne and Warhol are the unlikely bedfellows in the show, which includes two
works by Von Lenkiewicz himself (at £60,000 and £50,000) and about 22 consigned by Charles Saatchi.
While entry is free, visitors must register for admission (www.cornwallterrace.co.uk); they will be
taken around in groups of 50, according to the curators.

That might sound like a lot of money, but it's all relative. Pritzker, whose family founded the Hyatt hotel chain,
is worth about $1.5 billion. So it's easy to see how a few million — or 80 — could go missing.

Maybe she left it in the other purse?

corrected the error as soon as they realized it.

Per Bloomberg: Documents released last week show Pritzker received $32.2 million for a decade's worth of

than that.

Doe 1 and 2, who were 14 and 13, respectively, at the time of the
incidents, received monetary settlements in civil cases. They are
among more than two-dozen underage girls who filed lawsuits or
settled claims against Epstein, alleging they were lured to his Palm
Beach mansion to give him sexually charged massages and/or sex
in exchange for money.

The motion filed Monday says the agreement is illegal because the
government did not protect the “Congressionally mandated rights of
victims before it entered this agreement.”

Alicia Valle, special counsel for the U.S. Attorney’s Office Southern
District of Florida, said in an e-mail that the U.S. Attorney's Office
will respond in court filings.

“However, as we stated more than two years ago in July 2008 in our
response to the plaintiffs’ then-emergency petition for enforcement
of the Crime Victim Rights Act, the CVRA was not violated because
no federal charges were ever filed in the Southern District of
Florida,” Valle said. “Because the matter remains pending in court, it
would be inappropriate at this time to provide additional comment on
the merits of the current motion.”

The attorneys reference e-mails and letters from the federal office to
Epstein’s lawyers acknowledging the government's legal obligation
to inform victims about the pact. The e-mails are redacted in the
motion because they are under seal. The attorneys filed a separate
motion Monday to unseal the correspondence.

“The reasonable inference from the evidence is that the U.S.
Attorney's Office wanted to keep the agreement a secret to avoid
intense criticism that would surely ensued had the victims and the
public learned that a billionaire sex offender with political
connections had arranged to avoid federal prosecution for numerous
felony sex offenses against minor girls,” the motion says. “As part of
this pattern of deception, the U.S. Attorney’s Office discussed victim
notification with the defendant sex offender and, after he raised
objections, stopped making notifications.”

Epstein sought “a higher level of review” within the Department of
Justice, the motion says. “A reasonable inference from the evidence
is that Epstein used his significant political and social connections to

lobby the Justice Department to avoid significant federal
prosecution,” the motion states.

Banks and contractors will require supportive policies to realize NTP benefits

The banking sector is targeted to benefit from the NTP initiatives through greater

disintermediation (SMEs, real estate financing, non-oil export financing) and greater

household savings. However, domestic liquidity is likely to remain structurally tight, in

our view. The NTP targeted increase in non-oil fiscal revenue is likely to tighten

domestic liquidity, all else being equal, as it would have the effect of extracting

resources from the non-hydrocarbon private sector (as opposed to government

domestic spending that injects liquidity).

Linked to liquidity trends and banking sector asset quality, the issue of government
arrears to contractors is likely to take centre stage, in our view. Resolving this is likely to
be required if the capex projects under the NTP are to be executed on a timely fashion,
in our view. We think the government’s proposal to issue | Owe You' notes (IOUs) could
be a step in this direction.

Government looks to issue |OUs

According to the press, the Saudi government has paid contractors some cash on its
arrears, and is considering to issue | Owe You' notes (IOUs) to them. Contractors would
receive these notes to cover their outstanding dues, which they could hold until maturity
or sell on to banks. The government has been highlighting it wanted to settle the
contractor sector dues, and recently a high-profile domestic contractor has made mass
redundancies. In the previous downturn in the 1980s, arrears to domestic contractors
were also likely to have been accumulated. We highlighted that the fiscal deficit was
likely under-reported last year. Also, construction was one of the fastest growing sector
last year both in terms of domestic activity and of domestic credit.

The Future of Financials M&A and Regulation

We hosted a panel to discuss the state and outlook of M&A and regulation. Given the
results of the US election and the potential for easing of regulations, the panel
discussed a timely topic on the mind of investors. Our panelists included Rodgin Cohen,
Senior Chairman of Sullivan & Cromwell; Richard Kim, partner at Wachtell, Lipton,
Rosen & Katz, and Ed Hill, Senior Vice President, Government Affairs, Bank of
America Corporation.

= Regulation is about tone: Our panelists agreed that the scope and strength of
regulation comes from the tone and attitude of regulators rather than from
legislation. They noted that an attempt to repeal legislation such as Dodd-Frank
would be misplaced as most direction derives from the tops of regulatory bodies.
They also felt Senator Hensarling’s Financial Choice Act would not be a better
alternative to Dodd-Frank given the 10% leverage ratio is not a Federal Reserve
definition of leverage. Utilizing a Fed definition would likely lead to leverage north
of 10%. The inclusion of CAMEL ratings with the leverage ratio would also allow
regulatory sway over institutions.

Executive Summary

For Haiti to become an economically independent nation from donors and foreign aid there needs
to be support for private industry to establish itself and flourish. At one point in its history, Haiti
was a market leader in the textile industry supplying quality products. Currently there is an
opportunity to provide sustainable employment for Haitians with the right training to develop an
industry to serve as a catalyst to catapult the country out of the stigmatism of a third world country.
‘There is a need for work to be done, such as construction of homes, infrastructure, etc.

Haiti is one of the lowest-income countries in the Western hemisphere. The country has problems
with AIDS, crime, drug trafficking, etc. (CIA, 2010). On January 12th, 2010, an earthquake
destroyed the capital of the country and worsened the overall situation of Haiti. The total loss was
estimated around $11.5 billion; however, the country still needs more time to rebuild (U.S.
Department of State, 2010). The majority of the donor countries worry about Haiti becoming a
burden throughout the years without any positive results (Novacek et. al, 2008). The country has
both positive and negative sides.

This business plan includes secondary data. Secondary data was selected from academic,
government, news resources or based on extensive research by those with experience in dealing
with Haiti. Considering retrieved data, the plan focused on the following aspects:

e Past and current situations in Haiti;

e <A ctitical needs assessment of Southeastern area of Haiti;

e Our plan for investment in Haiti

After the detailed investigation of the authoritative sources and critically evaluating information,
CEFOTAJ has concluded the following:

e Haiti has a potential for investment in the area of apparel/clothing.

e Establishment of our trade/learning school will facilitate and foster future investments
within the country via job and economic growth in the southeastern area.

e Despite its economic situation, the country attracts foreign investments and investors.
e Foreign investments and aid allow restoring the country quicker.

e Foreign investments positively affect the country.

SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 27

Producer Donna Gigliotti is my date to the awards. We are
both so nervous we arrive at the Kodak Theater at 3 p.m. and
nobody is there. We are driven around for an hour. When we
arrive back at the world’s most famous red carpet, I guide
Donna through security check-in to the extreme right to
make sure we get on camera. I teach her the red carpet
hustle, which is five steps forward, three steps back, one inch
behind a couture-clad nominee. We greet Kevin Huvane as
Sandra Bullock is talking to ABC-TV and a billion people see
me wearing a black Marchesa gown. Five steps forward, three
steps back, we next meet Gwyneth Paltrow, and I hook up the
back of her dress while another billion people see me correct
the fashion malfunction. Five steps forward, three steps back,
were now posing behind Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban.
Our Blackberrys begin buzzing; the world has seen us.

James Franco and Anne Hathaway are hip hosts. This is the
year of no surprises. But it isn’t until Hilary Swank yells out
Hooper’s name for Best Director that Harvey’s gang finally
realizes they are getting the Oscar for Best Picture after all.
Harvey is sitting in Spielberg’s seat as Spielberg announces
the win from the stage. Producers Iain Canning, Emile
Sherman and Gareth Unwin leap up and kiss each other. Six
months of grueling work have finally paid off. King George
VI and Harvey Weinstein now share the journey of a single
man who triumphs over adversity.

At the Governor’s ball, held above the Kodak Theater,
the winners triumphantly sachet around the room holding
their heavy eight-pound gold statues.

An hour later there is a migration to the Vanity Fair party
hosted by Graydon Carter at Jeff Klein’s Sunset Tower
Hotel. The invitation features a gold hologram that trans-
mits a radio frequency of a photo and details about the

guest to VF staff as they arrive. The next day “Page Six” will

report that the backup private security firm is run by a

former Israeli operative, when in fact they are Irish

Catholics from Staten Island.

There’s a hierarchy of arrival times. At 5 p.m. the inner
circle of Graydon’s 141 best friends attend a seated dinner.
They include Barry Diller and Diane von Furstenberg,

Francis Ford Coppola, Jon Hamm and Jennifer Westfeldt,

Betsey Bloomingdale, Tory Burch and Lyor Cohen,
Carolina and Reinaldo Herrera, Wren Scott and Sir

plane; he’s leaving in 10 minutes. Too bad James Franco
didn’t know because he is presently sitting on a commercial
flight back to school, skipping his own after-party. The rest of
the guests’ social standings are determined by half-hour
increments. VPs Beth Kseniak, Matt Ullian and Jane Sarkin

At 11:30 p.m. there is another celebrity migration up the

weak. The Seventh Sense is defined first by an intuitive feeling for just how power is
being re-geared now. If you look at a kid with a phone and think “Strong”, you have
the Seventh Sense. If you look at an angry, barely educated terrorist wannabe and
think, “Junior Varsity”, you don't. And as a result you may be about to have a very
unpleasant surprise.

Try this: Ball up your right hand and hold it in front of you; now take your left hand
and open the fingers and hold it a few inches away with your fingers pointing back
towards the right. You can think of your left hand as the vibrating, living network of
connection — reaching towards the concentrated power that your right hand
represents. This is the heart of understanding our age. Networks live in that tension
between distribution and concentration. To connect any object - my dad, a
newspaper, a radio-controlled plastic drone - to this skein is to change, irrevocably,
its essence. The reason the legitimacy of old leaders is failing, the reason our
strategy is incoherent, the reason our age really is revolutionary, is that they are all
sitting in the midst of these pulling, powerful forces. We should steel ourselves for
the shredding imminence of this violence . But also - and you know this already, |
think - we must prepare ourselves for the possibility of immense construction.
Network power does not only pull apart. It also creates.

This paradox confused me, to be honest, for a long time. Power is, manifestly,
concentrated with astonishing efficiency now. And it is more widely dispersed than
ever too. We can stare at this difference, this strange polar tension and baffle
ourselves as we try to figure out just how and why it moves. The best way of
understanding this, I finally concluded, requires a cognitive leap, perhaps, over our
usual Western way of understanding the world as either “a” or “b”, as either
“distributed” or “concentrated”, and into a view of how opposites might ceaselessly

balance into a whole. Not “a” or “b” but “a” and “b” at the same time.

Let me tell you what I mean: In 1132 the Song Dynasty that had ruled China for
nearly 200 years collapsed in the face of an invasion by wild Manchurian soldiers
from the northern plains. The Song leadership - along with its best minds and
cultural figures - fled south from Beijing for a thousand miles, until they were safely
on the opposite bank of the Yangtze River. They settled in a lakeside city we know
today as Hangzhou. In those days Hangzhou was known as Lin’An, which might best
be translated as “Gazing at Peace.” The little town must have seemed to the Song
leaders a perfect respite from the horror and war they had left behind. The city lay
then, as it still does, along side XiHu or West Lake, a tranquil and horizon-filling
stretch of water framed by rolling hills and tea plantations. The famous poet and
statesman Su Dongpo later compared gazing at the lake to looking at a beautiful
woman - that same fused sense of calm, peace and astonishment you might feel
while considering the object of your own love. Stilled water is regarded in Chinese
culture - you may recall from Lake Tai Hu where Master Nan set his campus —as a
reservoir of yin energy. Song leaders had fled the angry yang energy of invasion for
the yin peace of the south. Yin energy is associated with calm, femininity, fertility.
Yang expresses action, violence, creation. Yang is the thunderstorm; Yin is the peace

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023129.txt,"“As additional details about Epstein’s crimes have emerged, it is clear to me that we
should have pushed for much harsher terms,” Sloman wrote. “That said, some have
mistakenly suggested that our office kowtowed to Epstein’s high-priced defense
lawyers or, worse, that his lawyers corrupted or intimidated us into submission. ...
Nothing could be further from the truth.”

Sloman did not directly address the chief complaint brought by Epstein’s victims,
who are now in their late 20s and early 30s. Those who spoke to the Herald said
they felt betrayed by federal prosecutors, who sealed the non-prosecution agreement
from public view so that they wouldn’t find out about it before he was sentenced. It
would be almost a year before they were successful in having it unsealed. By then, it
was too late to try to derail it.

They allege, in a federal lawsuit filed against the government, that prosecutors
deliberately kept the deal secret — in violation of federal law — to prevent them
from appearing at Epstein’s sentencing to possibly undo the deal. Nor did Sloman
address why prosecutors also gave immunity to a number of Epstein’s co-
conspirators, who have never been identified.

“They cut a deal which they have to know was a failure,” said Marci Hamilton, a law
professor at the University of Pennsylvania and executive director of Child USA,
which advocates for children’s civil liberties. “ They kept it secret and they didn’t
charge the co-conspirators. The horror of this is if you don’t hold all the ‘Johns’
accountable, then it doesn’t stop. This case involved multiple girls, multiple men,
multiple recruiters, multiple times and he recruited girls to get other girls. That’s a
trafficking organization.”

Acosta has not commented since 2011, when he defended his decisions in a publicly
issued letter that can be found in the federal court file. In it, he described what he
called a “yearlong assault” on prosecutors by Epstein’s “army of legal superstars,”
including Roy Black, Kenneth Starr and Alan Dershowitz, among others. In four
long paragraphs, Acosta detailed how defense attorneys relentlessly worked to
manipulate the negotiation process, often frustrating prosecutors.

“They would obtain concessions as part of a negotiation and agree to proceed, only
to change their minds, and appeal the office’s decision to Washington,” Acosta
wrote, adding that their tactics included delving into the private family lives of
individual prosecutors in an effort to discredit them and get them removed from the
case.

Wrote Sloman: “The Herald’s ‘Perversion of Justice’ series presented a heartrending
portrait of Epstein’s victims and made a strong case that he should have gone to jail
much longer, but never explained or substantiated its accusation that we schemed
with Epstein’s lawyers.”

Shelley is survived by her creation: Frankenstein took on a life of his own within our collective imagination
(Figure $15). Such legacies, and all the many other ways in which people achieve cultural immortality,
fall beyond the scope of this initial examination.

III.8. History of Technology

A list of inventions from 1800-1960 was taken from Wikipedia (Ref $10).

The year listed is used in our analysis. Where multiple listings of a particular invention appear, the year
retained in the list is the one reported in the main Wikipedia article for the invention. (e.g. Microwave
Oven is listed in 1945 and 1946; the main article lists 1945 as the year of invention, and this is the year
we use in our analyses).

Each entry's main Wikipedia page was checked for alternate terms for the invention. Where alternate
names were listed in the main article (e.g. thiamine or thiamin or vitamin B,), all the terms were
compared for their presence in the database. Where there was no single dominant term (e.g.MSG or
monosodium glutamate) the invention was eliminated from the list. If a name other than the originally
listed one appears to be dominant, the dominant name was used in the analysis (e.g.
electroencephalograph and EEG - EEG is used).

Inventions were grouped into 40-year intervals (1800-1840, 1840-1880, 1880-1920, and 1920-1960), and
the median percentages of peak frequency was calculated for each bin for each year following invention:
these were plotted in Fig 4B, together with examples of individual inventions in inset.

Our study of the history of technology suffers from a possible sampling bias: it is possible that some older
inventions, which peaked shortly after their invention, are by now forgotten and not listed in the Wikipedia
article at all. This sampling bias would be more extreme for the earlier cohorts, and would therefore tend
to exaggerate the lag between invention date and cultural impact in the older invention cohorts. We have
verified that our inventions are past their peaks, in all three cohorts (Fig $16). Future analyses would
benefit from the use of historical invention lists to control for this effect.

Another possible bias is that observing inventions later after they were invented leaves more room for the
fame of these inventions to rise. To ensure that the effect we observe is not biased in this way, we
reproduce the analysis done in the paper using constant time intervals: a hundred years from time of
invention. Because we have a narrower timespan, we consider only technologies invented in the 49
century; and we group them in only two cohorts. The effect is consistent with that observed in the main
text (Fig S16).

III.9. Censorship

III.9A. Comparing the influence of censorship and propaganda on
various groups

To create panel E of Fig 6, we analyzed a series of cohorts; for each cohort, we display the mean of the
normalized probability mass functions of the cohort, as described in section 1B. We multiplied the result
by 100 in order to represent the probability mass functions more intuitively, as a percentage of lifetime

frieze art fair: a glass guide
Our online art team pick out what — and who — to watch out for at this year’s fair
Posted: 12 October 2010

. Pe.

Despite the difficult last two years, Frieze is playing host to some big numbers this time around. Christie's will hold
its annual October Post-War and Contemporary Art evening auction, with the top lot - | Am Become Death,
Shatterer of Worlds, a butterfly canvas by Damien Hirst — going for an estimated £2.5m-£3.5m. Other notable
sales to watch out for are Andreas Gursky's photomontage of the New York Stock Exchange, last seen hanging in
the boardroom at Lehman Brothers (estimate: £100,000 — £150,000), and Sotheby’s sales from Jerry Hall's
extraordinary collection, which includes work by Frank Auerbach, Lucian Freud and Andy Warhol.

The fair’s fringe is looking more diverse than ever this year. For quiet classicism, The House of the Noble Man, a
stone's throw away in Cornwall Terrace, is a definite highlight. Curated by Victoria Golembiovskaya and the artist
Wolfe von Lenkiewicz, it will include four rare Picassos and Cezanne’s Don Quixote. Meanwhile, purveyors
looking for modern artist-led work should head to Screening. An independent art exhibition on 203-205
Brompton Road — a purpose-built exhibition space within a Knightsbridge office block — rising stars will be
showing alongside heavyweight Toby Ziegler and much-talked about video artist Ryan Trecartin. The temporal
format of video art will be considered in this sprawling building as an extension of work on canvas — with the help
of some of London’s brightest new young painters.

There are a few satellite fairs for the collectors craving boutique shopping after getting an eyeful at the main
event. The Pavilion of Art and Design will be returning to Berkeley Square, Mayfair, for the fourth year running,
featuring 50 distinguished international dealers of modern art, design, decorative arts, photography, jewellery
and tribal art. SUNDAY, a free three-day event in Marylebone's Ambika P3, is shaping up to be an intriguing
replacement to Zoo,, according to the Independent. Sponsored by the Zabludowicz Collection, it features 20 up-
and-coming galleries from all over the world. Whitechapel Gallery is also making some noise on the periphery,
displaying works from the D.Daskalopoulos collection in Greece — one of the foremost collections of
contemporary art in Europe.

add physiological benefits. A 1979
population-based study showed that
adults lacking social ties were 1.9 to 3.1
times more likely to die during a 9-year
follow-up than those who had more
social contacts, all else being equal (2).
Since then, at least five population-based
prospective studies (3) and numerous
smaller studies have found positive
associations between social integration
and either survival or improved health
outcomes. The mechanisms by which
social integration enhances survival are
several and include improved health
behaviors, increased access to resources
and material goods, and strengthened
immunity against infection (4).

Whereas sociality is a normal
state, loneliness is an unusual state, akin
to hunger, thirst, or pain (5). As with
those states, loneliness is unpleasant and
serves to remind us that we should
change the status quo. Therefore,
loneliness can be an adaptive motivator
for increased social surveillance and
interaction. Unfortunately, not all
individuals succeed at achieving the
level of social connectedness they desire
and suffer instead from chronic feelings
of loneliness. Cacioppo and others have
shown that lonely individuals interpret
events and social interactions more
negatively than non-lonely individuals.
As aresult, they unconsciously develop
defense mechanisms, including social
barriers, which shield them from insults
and rejection. While this approach may
achieve its goals of self-protection, it
also reduces opportunities for positive
social interactions and perpetuates
feelings of social isolation (5). John
Bunyan, a 17” century Christian writer
and preacher, described the barriers
associated with loneliness when he
wrote of a vision in which he

131

Page

“saw the people set on the sunny
side of some high mountain,
there refreshing themselves with
the pleasant beams of the sun,
while I was shivering and
shrinking in the cold, afflicted
with frost, snow, and dark
clouds. Methought, also, betwixt
me and them, I saw a wall that

did compass about this mountain

(6).”

For chronically lonely people,
the wall between themselves and others
is partly of their own making and
reflects continuous surveillance for
negative signals from others (5). The
challenge is to help lonely individuals
break down the barriers between
themselves and others and ultimately
return to the normal state of sociality. In
his vision, Bunyan achieved this, but
only through great effort:

“About this wall I thought
myself, to go again and again,
still prying as I went, to see if I
could find some way or passage,
by which I might enter therein,
but none could I find for some
time. At the last, I saw, as it
were, a narrow gap, like a little
doorway in the wall, through
which I attempted to pass; but the
passage being very strait and
narrow, I made many efforts to
get in, but all in vain, even until I
was well-nigh quite beat out, by
striving to get in; at last, with
great striving, methought I at first
did get in my head, and after that,
by a sidling striving, my
shoulders, and my whole body;
then I was exceeding glad, and
went and sat down in the midst
of them, and so was comforted
with the light and heat of their
sun (6).”

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027025.txt,"For the first time, scientists have created human embryos that are genetic copies of living people
and used them to make stem cells — a feat that paves the way for treating a range of diseases
with personalized body tissues but also ignites fears of human cloning.

If replicated in other labs, the methods detailed Wednesday in the journal Cell would allow
researchers to fashion human embryonic stem cells that are custom-made for patients with
Alzheimer's disease, diabetes and other health problems.

Theoretically capable of reproducing themselves indefinitely, these stem cells could be used to
grow replacements for a wide variety of diseased cells — those of the blood, skin, heart, brain,
muscles, nerves and more — that would not risk rejection by the patient's immune system.

The report also raises the specter that, with a high-quality donor egg, a bit of skin, some careful
tending in a lab and the womb of a willing surrogate, humans have cracked the biological secret to
reproducing themselves.

That is an objective American scientists have squarely renounced as unethical and scientifically
irresponsible. At the same time, most acknowledge that such reproductive cloning will one day
prove too tempting to resist.

In the hope that other researchers will validate and extend their results, the scientists at Oregon
Health & Science University provided an exceptionally detailed account of their techniques. For
anyone with a well-equipped fertility lab, the comprehensive guide could also be a useful
handbook for cloning a baby.

OHSU cell biologist Shoukhrat Mitalipov led a team of 23 scientists who methodically culled the
lessons learned from stem cell research on amphibians, mice and rhesus monkeys — as well as
from the abundant failures of others in the field. They devised a welter of new techniques to use
the DNA ofa fully formed skin cell in its most primitive embryonic form.

The approach they used — called somatic cell nuclear transfer — effectively strips an egg of its
chromosomes and packs it instead with DNA from a donor.

Nurtured by a stew of nourishing chemicals and zapped with two jolts of electrical current, many
of the eggs began to divide and grew for five to six days. At that point, the embryos had 64 to
200 cells, including a dense inner cell mass from which stem cells were extracted.

In past efforts to coax such an assemblage of components to life, researchers have burned through
dozens of donor eggs without getting any embryos even to the 16-cell stage at which stem cells
become a remote possibility.

This time, the researchers said their methods were so efficient that they could create at least one
embryonic stem cell line from each batch of eggs donated by 10 female volunteers. In one case, a
single donor produced eight eggs of such exceptional quality that researchers were able to derive
four embryonic stem cell lines.

That same night, five Egyptian soldiers were killed and several
injured during an attack on the Egyptian side of the border. Lt. Col.
Amr Imam, a media spokesman for the Egyptian military, said that
the officers were killed by an Israeli Apache helicopter that fired two
rockets. It may have been a mistake, he said. Also on Aug. 18, a
man wearing an explosives belt blew himself up at an Egyptian
checkpoint 11 miles from the Sinai town of Taba, killing an officer
and injuring two others. The body of the dead officer and the
unidentified head of the bomber were brought over to the hospital,
said Abel Wahab, a doctor in the emergency department of the
hospital in el-Arish, North Sinai's capital. The Israeli operation
outraged the Egyptian public and prompted thousands to protest
outside the Israeli Embassy in Cairo. Amid rumors that Egypt might
recall its ambassador from Tel Aviv, the Egyptian government also
brushed off a rare Israeli statement of regret as not in keeping with
the magnitude of the incident and the state of Egyptian anger.

In Sinai, that anger is more palpable -- but it's more often directed at
the Egyptian state. Ibrahim al-Menaei, a leader of the Swarkeh tribe,
considered the most powerful tribe in the north, told me that
Mubarak's formally dissolved state security apparatus was to blame
for the lack of law and order in the region. He accused the security
forces of framing his people for crimes that they did not commit and
labeling them as drug and weapons dealers. I will not let a single
police officer into this region until they give in to our demands,
Menaei explained as he sat in the sanctuary of his safe house a few
kilometers south of the Israeli border, surrounded by his five sons
and armed disciples. He called on the new Egyptian government to
repeal laws that prevent the Bedouins from owning land, abolish all
absentia sentences against Bedouins that were issued during
Mubarak's rule, and prosecute police officers responsible for killing
Bedouins. There are in fact two Sinais: the impoverished north and

violations,”®° three former Haitian officials involved in the

same scheme were convicted of money laundering,”

Mail and Wire Fraud

The mail and wire fraud statutes may also apply. In
2006, for example, a wholly owned foreign subsidiary of
a US. issuer pleaded guilty to both FCPA and wire fraud
counts where the scheme included overbilling the sub-
sidiary’s customers—both government and private—and
using part of the overcharged money to pay kickbacks to the
customers’ employees. The wire fraud charges alleged that
the subsidiary had funds wired from its parent’s Oregon
bank account to off-the-books bank accounts in South
Korea that were controlled by the subsidiary. The funds,
amounting to almost $2 million, were then paid to manag-
ers of state-owned and private steel production companies
in China and South Korea as illegal commission payments
and kickbacks that were disguised as refunds, commissions,

and other seemingly legitimate expenses.”

Certification and Reporting Violations

Certain other licensing, certification, and reporting
requirements imposed by the U.S. government can also be
implicated in the foreign bribery context. For example, as
a condition of its facilitation of direct loans and loan guar-
antees to a foreign purchaser of US. goods and services,
the Export-Import Bank of the United States requires the
US. supplier to make certifications concerning commis-
sions, fees, or other payments paid in connection with the
financial assistance and that it has not and will not violate
the FCPA. A false certification may give rise to criminal
liability for false statements.

Similarly, manufacturers, exporters, and brokers of
certain defense articles and services are subject to regis-
tration, licensing, and reporting requirements under the
Arms Export Control Act (AECA), 22 U.S.C. § 2751, et
seq., and its implementing regulations, the International
Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 C.ER. § 120, e¢
seq. For example, under AECA and ITAR, all manufactur-
ers and exporters of defense articles and services must reg-

ister with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. The

sale of defense articles and services valued at $500,000 or
more triggers disclosure requirements concerning fees and
commissions, including bribes, in an aggregate amount of
$100,000 or more.” Violations of AECA and ITAR can

result in civil and criminal penalties.”*

Tax Violations

Individuals and companies who violate the FCPA may
also violate U.S. tax law, which explicitly prohibits tax deduc-
tions for bribes, such as false sales “commissions” deductions
intended to conceal corrupt payments.”*’ Internal Revenue
Service-Criminal Investigation has been involved in a num-
ber of FCPA investigations involving tax violations, as well as

other financial crimes like money laundering.

that written agreement with you.

Re item 6: You report on ASU’s response to item #6 , without including the fact that the University specifically stated there were never
any allegations of sexual misconduct or harassment by me at the University, and the outside complaints were in fact related specifically
to your item #6. Further you neglect to mention that this complaint was by an anonymous third party, not the individual who was
allegedly harassed, who never lodged a complain, and that no specific evidence was provided of the alleged transgression. | was
surprised and dismayed that both ASU and ANU launched investigations on the basis of this but was told by both Universities that
because of my high profile even such unsubstantiated third party complaints at private events unrelated to the University would be
investigated. The complaint was investigated throughly by both ASU and ANU and both came to the conclusion that it was not credible
and no university policies had been violated. . In addition ANU’s investigation, which took a full month found significant inconsistencies
in the allegation, suggesting distortion and fabrication, | will quote from the ANU report. The initial complaint, which in fact resulted in a
temporary suspension by ANU outlined the claim you made in the words you quoted in your note to me, along with the statement made
in the complaint that

It is the University’s understanding that a complaint was lodged directly to the conference organisers at the time of the incident.”

After the investigation, the final report absolved me of any wrongdoing, and indicated information inconsistent with the original claim
and apparent later claims as follows:

The allegations were made by an observer to the incident.

- The complaint did not identify, nor disclose the identity of the conference attendee who was allegedly touched in

an unwelcome manner.

- The conference attendee who took the ‘selfie’ photo did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference organisers
at the time of the incident (November 2016).

- The conference attendee who witnessed the incident, did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference organisers
at the time of the incident (November 2016).

The photo submitted as part of the complaint does not provide evidence of any physical contact.

- The complainant alleged that a photo exists, showing your hand on the breast of the conference attendee who took
the ‘selfie’ photo. This photo was not made available to the Australian National University, although it was requested
in the course of the investigation.”

(And for the record | often put my hand up in front of a camera if there is a flash, as | specifically request selfies not to include flashes,
so that | don’t end up with a series bright spots in front of my eyes for the next half hour)

What makes this particular type of allegation so repugnant is that | get asked for literally thousands of selfies, and when people come
up to me they are vulnerable, often shaking, and sometimes overly aggressive. | am particularly proud of the way | attempt to make all
people feel at ease, and respected, rather than humiliated. Thus, this false claim strikes at the heart of what | am about, which is to
acknowledge fans in a way that makes them feel appreciated. As | understand you had a reporter watching me sign books and take
selfies at the CFl conference in Las Vegas this year, that behavior is what they will have witnessed. Moreover, | am proud of the
interactions | have had at both Case and ASU, with students, colleagues and staff. | have had numerous female graduate students,
postdocs, employees, and colleagues, and as ASU attested to you, none of these have ever complained of harassment. Quite the
contrary in fact, as | have worked hard to support them, mentor them, and treat them with respect. | treat others as responsible adults,
and | expect to be treated equally.

Dr. Krauss:

As you know, I’m a reporter for BuzzFeed News who has been investigating sexual misconduct allegations
against you. As we've already discussed by email, I’d very much like to interview you about these allegations in
detail.

In particular, you stated in an email sent on Nov 13 that two universities had investigated an incident (# 6
below). You claimed that “both Universities independently concluded that the report was unsubstantiated and
fabricated with malicious intent.” We are not aware that either university concluded fabrication or malicious
intent, so if you have evidence to support this assertion, we would like to see and discuss it.

guess that she doesn’t think about causation because no one ever tried
to get her to do so. So she may very well be smart but she sounds
stupid because she seems to be unaware of her own causal reasoning
and is not very good at it. Being good at understanding causation
and figuring what could possibly cause what and why is a hallmark of
intelligence.

Intelligence can be enhanced by practicing the cognitive processes
that are the basis of intelligent behavior and intelligent reasoning.
One of these hallmark processes is certainly causation.

We could make Miss South Carolina smarter by teaching her how
to determine what causes what and asking her to figure things out and
explain them to others using a causation model that she could defend.
Of course, it would have been better if this process started when she
was a small child.

Now, with that in mind, let’s look at the Palin remark. Palin was
asked about her readiness for the office of vice president, which isn’t
much of an office really. What was really being asked was her readi-
ness for the presidency, which was not unreasonable to worry about
considering John McCain’s age. She responded in a way that made
clear that she has no understanding of causation either.

In the statements above, she asserted (implicitly) the following
beliefs about causation:

Any mayor or city manager is ready to be president.

Any governor is ready to be president.

Any commissioner is ready to be president.

Any regulator of gas and oil is ready to be president.

If you have a vision of energy independence, you are ready to be
president.

Now, of course, one of these beliefs is, in fact, shared by the country
since we have chosen governors to be president. But the other beliefs
are simply wrong. No one thinks that having a vision of energy in-
dependence prepares you to be president or that being an oil and gas
regulator prepares you to be president.

So, what does Palin misunderstand here? She doesn’t get the idea
of preparedness as causation. Having a degree in accounting prepares
you to be an accountant, most would agree. We believe, as a society, in
certain rites of passage preparing you for the next step. Palin apparently
has never thought about this or why anyone would hold such beliefs.

Okay, call me old-fashioned, but | still like pubic hair. Internet porn
sites now present several choices--completely shaved, vertical landing

an arrow pointing to the clit--yet, for a full bush, one would have to search
the Web for “hairy” sites that are considered as “specialty,” “kinky”

Retired porn stars have commented on this phenomenon. Gina

"
IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018461.txt,"I'm so grateful for my relatively liberal, relatively sex-positive upbringing. I think it did
me a world of good. But here are my five biggest problems with the way I learned
about sexuality:

1. L wish that I hadn't gotten this message: Sex is easy, light-hearted -- and if it's not,
you're doing it wrong.

Do I believe sex can be easy? Sure. Do I think it can be light-hearted? Absolutely! But do
I think it's always those things? No, and I don't think it ought to” be.

I think we need to teach that sex can be incredibly difficult. It can be hard to
communicate with your partner. It can be hard to learn and come to terms with your own
sexual desires. It can be hard to understand or accept all your partner's sexual desires.
And just because it's hard, doesn't mean that you're with the wrong partner -- or that
you're missing some vital piece of information that everyone else has -- or that you're
doing it wrong.

And as for light-hearted, well -- sure, sex can be happy rainbows joy joy!, but it can
also be serious... or dark. And there's nothing wrong with that!

I recently talked to a friend, who also identifies as a BDSMer, about our stories of
coming into BDSM. Both of us had sadomasochistic fantasies from a very early age
(mine, for instance, started in grade school -- seriously, I actually did tie up my Barbie
dolls). I told my friend about how I'd always had these intense, dark, violent feelings --
but when I made it to middle school, I remember a change. I had a series of vivid BDSM-
ish dreams, and I freaked out. I closed it all away, I stopped thinking about it, I repressed
it all as savagely as I could.

Before that, I had also started thinking about sex. I imagined sex at great length; I read
about sex. I had long since filched my parents’ copy of The Joy of Sex and examined it,
cover to cover -- not to mention many other fine sexuality works, like Nancy Friday's
compilation of female sexual fantasies My Secret Garden. I was totally fascinated by sex.
I talked about it so much that one of my friends specifically searched out a vibrator as a
birthday present for me. I actually pressured my first major boyfriend into some sexual
acts before he was ready, which I suppose is an interesting reversal of stereotype (but to
be clear, it's not okay that I did that). As I started having sex, I found that I liked it okay,
but knew a lot was missing -- and couldn't figure out what.

It took me years and years to connect sex to BDSM -- to figure out that the biggest thing I
was missing was BDSM. Why? Because BDSM was horrible and wrong, and I'd shut it
away; BDSM (I thought) couldn't possibly have anything to do with the bright, shiny,
happy horizon of sex! Coming into BDSM was a crisis for me partly because -- although
I knew other people practiced it, and had never thought much about that -- my own need
for those dark feelings totally shocked me. This wasn't me. This wasn't healthy sex. Sex
was light-hearted, happy rainbows joy joy!... wasn't it?

In contrast, my friend -- who had an extremely sexually repressed upbringing -- never
had any trouble integrating BDSM into his sex life. Sex, for him, was already wrong and
bad... so as he got in touch with his sexuality and began having sex, BDSM was involved
from the start. After all, there was no reason for it not to be.

related parts of the presentence report; without such access they are unable to effectively make their sentencing
recommendation.

In view of that legal landscape, there are three ways in which the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure might deal with
disclosure of the presentence reports to victims:

(1) Complete Disclosure. The rules could direct full disclosure of the presentence report to the victim. While no statute bars this
approach, legitimate policy objections might be raised. Some reports may contain sensitive private information about the
defendant such as results of psychiatric examinations, prior history of drug use, or childhood sexual abuse. Some reports may
also reveal confidential law enforcement information that should not be widely circulated. Victims may not always need access

rt, 269

to these parts of the report. While a number of states give victims unfettered right to access the presentence repo a more

limited approach seems appropriate in the federal system.

[*900] (2) Selective Disclosure. The rules could direct that the probation office redact any presentence report to remove
confidential information and then provide the redacted report to the victim. This approach, too, is problematic; it would require
considerable work by busy probation officers to prepare an additional document - a redacted report - presumably only after
consulting with the attorneys on both sides of the case about what might be viewed as confidential.

(3) Disclosure through Prosecutors. The simplest solution to the competing concerns is to disclose the report to victims through
an intermediary: the prosecutor. The prosecutor would serve as the filter for confidential information and assist the victim by
highlighting critical parts of the report. Opponents might object that this approach would burden prosecutors, who are no less

270

busy than probation officers. But the CVRA already gives victims the right to confer with prosecutors, and presumably

they will confer regarding the important topic of sentencing. Moreover, many U.S. Attorney's Offices already have Victim-
Witness Coordinators who communicate with victims regarding impact statements. The CVRA also authorizes increased

funding of $ 22 million for the Victim-Witness Assistance Programs in U.S. Attorney's Offices, presumably enabling those

offices to expand their victim services. 77!

It might be burdensome to require that prosecutors disclose presentence reports to victims in all cases, even when they are not
interested in such disclosure. Accordingly, disclosure of the report should be required only upon request of a victim.

For all those reasons, the Commission should amend the rules to give requesting victims access to presentence reports through
the prosecutor. In addition, some of the aspects of preparing and disclosing presentence reports are covered in Chapter 6.A of
the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual. *’? The Manual falls within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Sentencing
Commission. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules should [*901] coordinate with the Commission to
ensure that any changes in the Criminal Rules are consistent with the provisions of the Manual.

Rule 32(f), (h), (i) - Victim Opportunity To Object to Presentence Report

The Proposal:

Rule 32(f), (h), and (i) should be amended to allow the victim to object to the presentence report as follows:
(f) Objecting to the Report.

(1) Time To Object. Within 14 days after receiving the presentence report, the parties must state in writing any objections,
including objections to material information, sentencing guideline ranges, and policy statements contained in or omitted from
the report. The attorney for the government or for the victim shall raise for the victim any reasonable objection by the victim to
the presentence report.

Article 7.

The National Interest

The Good Autocrat

Robert D. Kaplan

June 21, 2011 -- IN HIS extended essay, On Liberty, published in
1859, the English philosopher John Stuart Mill famously declares,
“That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised
over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to
prevent harm to others.” Mill’s irreducible refutation of tyranny leads
him to—I have always felt—one of the most moving passages in
literature, in which he extols the moral virtues of Marcus Aurelius,
only to register the Roman’s supreme flaw. Mill writes:

If ever any one, possessed of power, had grounds for thinking himself
the best and most enlightened among his contemporaries, it was the
Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Absolute monarch of the whole civilized
world, he preserved through life not only the most unblemished
justice, but what was less to be expected from his Stoical breeding,
the tenderest heart. The few failings which are attributed to him, were
all on the side of indulgence: while his writings, the highest ethical
product of the ancient mind, differ scarcely perceptibly, if they differ
at all, from the most characteristic teachings of Christ. And yet, as
Mill laments, this “unfettered intellect,” this exemplar of humanism
by second-century-AD standards, persecuted Christians. As
deplorable a state as society was in at the time (wars, internal revolts,
cruelty in all its manifestations), Marcus Aurelius assumed that what
held it together and kept it from getting worse was the acceptance of
the existing divinities, which the adherents of Christianity threatened
to dissolve. He simply could not foresee a world knit together by new
and better ties. “No Christian,” Mill writes, “more firmly believes

Policy tailwinds are only one pillar of our call for Japan’s outperformance in 2017. We
also believe the stars are aligning for an organic improvement in domestic demand,
which would support the current recovery: the economy is firing on all cylinders for the
first time since 2013, and growth should accelerate to 1.4% in CY2017, followed by
1.2% expansion in CY2018 (Chart 12).

We see three catalysts: a consumer comeback, stronger capex, and a shift in income
away from high-saving corporations in favour of higher-spending households and
stockholders.

1. Consumer comeback

Households have been the noticeable laggard in the current recovery and the main
reason why Japan’s economy has barely grown since the 2014 consumption tax hike.
This is not for a lack of income growth: real employee compensation (wages +
employment) has staged an impressive recovery of late, rising 1.2% in CY15, and an
estimated 1.9% in CY16 (Chart 13).

One explanation is that private consumption is simply being underestimated in demand-
side GDP statistics: researchers at the Bank of Japan recently produced experimental
supply-side estimates of GDP that were significantly higher than existing expenditure-
side statistics. We find the Bo) research interesting and agree that Japanese
consumption statistics are beset by data quality issues. But this alone cannot account
for the consumption slump. We think two factors are equally to blame for depressed
household spending: 1) a squeeze on disposable income from higher taxes and social
security contributions; and 2) a surge in the saving rate (Chart 14).

Calling Japan right in 2017 is largely about correctly forecasting whether these two
trends will reverse. We see several reasons for optimism. First, we expect real employee
compensation to accelerate further, driven by a continued pick-up in per capita wages.
The call on the saving rate is admittedly trickier. But having surpassed the 2006 highs,
we think it is unlikely to surge further, given that consumer confidence is improving and
income growth is firming. FY17 tax reforms are also likely to support household
sentiment at the margin: for example, discussions are underway about enlarging tax cuts
for second-earners who work part-time. Overall, we expect private consumption to rise
1.0% in CY17, adding O.6ppt to growth.

Should the saving rate stabilize, as we expect, consumption should again start rising in
tandem with compensation. Investors should not have to wait long to get some visibility
around these trends. We expect the saving rate to peak in Q4 CY16 and consumption to
rise strongly from this quarter.

substantial actual value.

Without repeating each and every invocation of the Fifth Amendment that Epstein has
mnie and the reasonable inferences to be drawn from those invocations of privilege, the big
picture is unmistakably clear: No reasonable finder of fact could rule in Epstein’s favor on his
claims against Edwards. Accordingly, Edwards is entitled to summary judgment based on the
Fifth Amendment inferences that the jury would draw. |

| The inferences against Epstein are not limited to those arising from his privilege
assertions. Epstein’s guilt is also reasonably inferred from his harassment of, intimidation of,
efforts to exercise control over, and limitation of access to witnesses who might testify against

Epsiein’s efforts to intimidate his victims support the inference that Epstein knew that
theiy were going to provide compelling testimony against him. The evidence that Epstein
tampered with witnesses (later designated as his accomplices and co-conspirators) will be
admissible to demonstrate his consciousness of guilt. “(It is precisely because of the egregious
nature of such conduct that the law expressly permits the jury to make adverse inferences from a
party's efforts to intimidate witnesses... .” Jost v. Ahmad, 730 So.2d 708, 711 (Fla. 2 Dist.
Ct. App. 1998) Gnternal quotation omitted). To be clear, Epstein’s attempt to tamper with
witnesses is “not simply admissible as impeachment evidence of the tampering party's
eredibility. The opposing party is entitled to introduce facts regarding efforts to intimidate a
vies as substantive evidence.” Id. at 711 (emphasis in original) (internal citation omitted).
This substantive evidence of Epstein’s witness intimidation provides yet another reason why no
reasonable jury could find in favor of his claims against Edwards.

represented by Republican presidents such as Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon and
Bush Sr and became radicals. The derailment, he argues, began under Ronald Reagan
and reached its zenith under George W. Bush.

With the goodwill gone the US is not able to produce a medium-term credible fiscal
trajectory or get agreement on rebuilding its infrastructure. This paralysis is significant
not just for the US but for the world.

Keating links the collapse of this prosperity compact to the financial crisis. Too many
Americans were unable to sustain themselves from wages and salaries.

How did they get by? They used the easy credit of the banking system, thereby feeding
the frenzy that ended in bad loans and meltdown.

Keating's book has an abiding message for Australia: in the transformed world we will
find ourselves increasingly on our own having to master our own destiny.

The job is to rediscover the productivity and savings agenda of the 1990s. Why did
Australia survive the 2008 financial crisis? Because of the flexibility of the economy,
Keating says. Flexibility which came from the reform of Australia's financial, product and
labour markets that began 25 years ago. This has given us one of the most flexible
economies in the world - arguably the most flexible. But further structural changes are
ahead of us.

He lists them. It is a mix of the new and old Keating agenda: a shift in resources to the
extractive industries; a lift in capital inflow driving a high current account deficit putting a
premium on savings; recognition that competitiveness will lie in the creativity of our
people as much as it does in our oil and gas; a renewed emphasis on the value of hi-
tech and education; and above all, a cultural change that integrates Australia more into
East Asia. Cultural transformation is the key for us, Keating says. He rates it as more
important than economic reform.

“There is less interest now in being part of East Asia than there was in the 1990s, he
laments.

Keating wants this idea revived. And he ties it to the republic arguing that to succeed in
Asia we must become a republic, a proposition Howard always dismissed.

On China, Keating is an optimist yet alive to the daunting economic challenge China now
confronts. What is happening in China knows no precedence in world economic history,
he says. Never before have 1.25 billion people dragged themselves from poverty at such
a pace. China is now half the GDP of the US and incomes have risen by a factor of 10.
He argues, however, that the origin of the 2008 financial crisis lies in the global
imbalances - China has built huge foreign exchange reserves by exporting too much and
America, in turn, is saving too little.

Roberts is apparently known for making crude and outlandish remarks on Twitter, most of
which have been aimed at politicians.

year.

“Important stuff,” Roberts added.

Describing Illinois Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris, the independent candidate tweeted:
“Hot, tough & smart!”

Commenting on a video featuring President Trump, he said: “It looks like he’s morphing

In response to the social media backlash he’s been receiving, Roberts refused to apologize
and instead cited the Constitution.

“It’s that whole 1st amendment thing,” he tweeted on Tuesday, along with an official
explanation from Twitter as to why his tweet about Melania hasn’t been taken down.

the assault, and added Marco to Bibi’s team on the other side of the aircraft.

It was then that Yoni arrived back from Negev. He insisted on being added
to one of the assault teams. In one respect, that made sense. He had more
battlefield experience than almost everyone in the unit. But there was an
unwritten sayeret rule never to place two brothers together in the line of fire.
“It’s too late,” I told him, with an arm on his shoulder. “Bibi has already been
training his team.” He went off to find Bibi. I thought there was little chance of
Bibi standing down, but didn’t feel I could stop Yoni from trying. Five minutes
later, they came to talk to me. Bibi said: “Yoni wants to replace me. We want
you to decide.” I assumed both of them knew what Id say. “Today, it’s Bibi,” I
replied. “But Yoni, this is not our last operation. I will make sure you are there

they filed into the hangar, I quickly explained the operational plan. I showed
them how we would push in the wing doors in, and then ushered them inside the

When I gave the agreed two-finger whistle, they stormed the plane. “OK,
gentlemen,” Dado told the team leaders when it was over. “We’ve seen what we
needed.” Before returning to the control tower, however, he took me aside.

We still had to outfit ourselves in mechanics’ overalls, and swap the
sayeret’s paratroop-style red boots for black ones. I directed all the men to
conceal the Berettas on a waist-belt inside their overalls. We got acquainted
with our mechanics’ toolboxes. Finally we organized our maintenance
motorcade: four electronic buggies in front, towing four ladders, two short ones
for the wings and taller ones for the front and rear doors. Waiting for the order
to move, I said a final few words. Seeing the determination and nervous
anticipation on the faces of the men around me, I began by reiterating that the
first five seconds would be critical. “We all know that nothing ever happens
exactly according to plan. Each and every one of us has to focus on speed,
momentum and precision. No one can wait for anyone else to act. From the
moment I give the signal, or if we come under fire, each team has to act as if

suffered from sexual abuse.

100. Asaresult of Dershowitz’s and Epstein’s campaign to spread false, discrediting,
and defamatory statements about Roberts, Roberts suffered substantial damages in an amount to
be proven at trial.

101. Dershowitz’s false statements have caused, and continue to cause, Roberts
economic damage, psychological pain and suffering, mental anguish and emotional distress, and
other direct and consequential damages and losses.

102. Dershowitz’s and Epstein’s campaign to spread his false statements nationally and
internationally was unusual and particularly egregious conduct. Dershowitz and Epstein sexually
abused and trafficked Roberts, conspired to avoid having these crimes properly prosecuted and
discovered, and wantonly and maliciously set out to falsely accuse, defame, and discredit
Roberts to deny and conceal the scope and scale of their crimes. In so doing, Dershowitz’s
efforts constituted a public wrong by deterring, damaging, and setting back Roberts’ efforts to
help victims of sex trafficking. Accordingly, this is a case in which exemplary and punitive
damages are appropriate.

103. Punitive and exemplary damages are necessary in this case to deter Dershowitz,
Epstein and others from wantonly and maliciously using a campaign of lies to discredit Roberts
and other victims of sex trafficking.

Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q

Underlying MAU and DAU trends are still the key metrics for the stock, in our view. We
assume MAUs grow 16% y/y to 1.91bn and DAUs 16% to 1.26bn, keeping DAU/MAU at
a steady 66%. It’s possible (but hard to predict) that management offers an update on
Instagram users (600mn MAU, 400mn DAU in 4Q}, and more specifically, Instagram
Stories (150mn DAU in January). On the messaging front, there could be a Messenger
user update (1bn as of 7/16), while a WhatsApp update is less likely (1.2bn as of 4Q16).
We expect ad impressions to grow 46% y/y (49% in 4Q) and ad prices to increase 2%
y/y (3% in 4Q).

Biggest 1Q issues/risks:

¢ Expense trajectory or lack of an expense guidance change could disappoint:
While we continue to anticipate favorable revisions to management’s 2017 expense
forecast in 2H, near-term adjustments may be less likely given the velocity of new
product launches and potential video content investments.

* 1Q ad revenue deceleration possible: We note that 4Q was particularly strong
and it’s possible 1Q normalization could result in revenue growth deceleration.

¢ Lack of commentary on monetization strategy: While Messenger/WhatsApp
monetization is likely still a 2018 story, lack of constructive commentary on timing
could disappoint.

- User deceleration always a risk: MAU and DAU growth has surprised to the upside
at mid-to-high teens y/y growth, and any meaningful slowdown could raise
competitive concerns.

Top 1Q data point: Instagram reaches 1mn advertisers

Mid-quarter data points were somewhat limited in 1Q, though management did give an
update on the Instagram monetization efforts. In a March 2017 update, management
indicated that Instagram grew to 1mn advertisers, double the number since 9/16, with
business profile pages up to 8mn from 5mn in 4Q. Facebook’s comparable metrics are
4mn advertisers (as of 9/16) and 65mn business pages (4Q16).

For early advertiser checks, general feedback suggested positive trends, but more
‘steady as it goes’ than absolute blow out. The stronger 4Q was highlighted as a tough

otherwise be improbable. I made it the Darwinian axiom: maintenance is exhausted

in satisfying our taste for survival.

Ben-Porath’s life cycle was adjusted to express these features. Factor risk theory
argued that human capital is the riskier and higher-return factor because capital of
any kind takes on the risk characteristics of its owners and human capital is owned

disproportionately by the risk-tolerant young.

The Y rule contradicts the Y = 1 + C equation, while the pay rule contradicts the
dogma that output equals pay plus work. National accounts are founded on both.
That means | can expect tough resistance. | have tried to prepare for it by adding a

little more to each argument with each chapter.

Throughout this chapter, and throughout this book, I have bent over backwards to
distinguish logical certitudes from falsifiable hypothesis. Economics needs both. But
it needs to know which is which. The pay and Y rules, for example, are each
certitude in part. The certain part is the heretical one. The present value and
maximand rules follow from definitions, and compel expected recovery of human
depreciation in pay. | then relied on the convergence axioms to infer actual recovery
as a norm, not a invariable outcome, and on the new axiom of the biological
imperative, as well as evidence from age-wage profiles, to infer that maintenance

consumption is exhausted rather than recovered in pay as well.

Japan Investment Strategy

Nikkei to 20,000: Inventory cycle upturn — cyclicals;
inflation — banks, insurance

Investment Strategy

18 November 2016

Key takeaways

° Solid macro and weaker JPY positive for Japan equities, which also tend to outperform when
US rate rises (esp. steepening)

° The inventory cycle continues to recover on fiscal easing and capex, implying cyclical stocks
will outperform

° Inflation and higher yields positive for banks, insurance. Risk is diplomacy, protectionism, and
US economic cycle

FULL REPORT

Bullish equities 2017; rotation into cyclicals, banks, insurance

We are bullish Japan equities for 2017 and we estimate the Nikkei 225 index will recover to 20,000 by end-
2017 (see $/¥'s eventual surge: Buy Nikkei 06 September 2016). Our new Chief Japan Economist Izumi
Devalier forecasts above-consensus Japan GDP growth and inflation in 2017, which is also supportive of our
bullish equities scenario (see Ready for ignition 18 November 2016). We expect rotation into cyclicals, banks
and insurance as explained below.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012930.txt,"14 1 Introduction

In essence this is a list of claims such that, if the reader accepts these claims, they should
probably accept that the CogPrime approach to AGI is a viable one. On the other hand if the
reader rejects one or more of these claims, they may find one or more aspects of CogPrime
unacceptable for some reason.

Without further ado, now, the claims:

1. General intelligence (at the human level and ultimately beyond) can be achieved via creating
a computational system that seeks to achieve its goals, via using perception and memory
to predict which actions will achieve its goals in the contexts in which it finds itself.

2. To achieve general intelligence in the context of human-intelligence-friendly environments
and goals using feasible computational resources, it’s important that an AGI system can
handle different kinds of memory (declarative, procedural, episodic, sensory, intentional,
attentional) in customized but interoperable ways.

3. Cognitive synergy: It’s important that the cognitive processes associated with different kinds
of memory can appeal to each other for assistance in overcoming bottlenecks in a manner
that enables each cognitive process to act in a manner that is sensitive to the particularities
of each others’ internal representations, and that doesn’t impose unreasonable delays on
the overall cognitive dynamics.

4, As a general principle, neither purely localized nor purely global memory is sufficient for
general intelligence under feasible computational resources; “glocal” memory will be re-
quired.

5. To achieve human-like general intelligence, it’s important for an intelligent agent to have
sensory data and motoric affordances that roughly emulate those available to humans.
We don’t know exactly how close this emulation needs to be, which means that our AGI
systems and platforms need to support fairly flexible experimentation with virtual-world
and/or robotic infrastructures.

6. To work toward adult human-level, roughly human-like general intelligence, one fairly easily
comprehensible path is to use environments and goals reminiscent of human childhood, and
seek to advance one’s AGI system along a path roughly comparable to that followed by
human children.

7. It is most effective to teach an AGI system aimed at roughly human-like general intelli-
gence via a mix of spontaneous learning and explicit instruction, and to instruct it via a
combination of imitation, reinforcement and correction, and a combination of linguistic and
nonlinguistic instruction.

8. One effective approach to teaching an AGI system human language is to supply it with
some in-built linguistic facility, in the form of rule-based and statistical-linguistics-based
NLP systems, and then allow it to improve and revise this facility based on experience.

9. An AGI system with adequate mechanisms for handling the key types of knowledge men-
tioned above, and the capability to explicitly recognize large-scale patterns in itself, should,
upon sustained interaction with an appropriate environment in pursuit of ap-
propriate goals, emerge a variety of complex structures in its internal knowledge network,
including, but not limited to:

e a hierarchical network, representing both a spatiotemporal hierarchy and an approxi-
mate “default inheritance” hierarchy, cross-linked

e a heterarchical network of associativity, roughly aligned with the hierarchical network

e aself network which is an approximate micro image of the whole network

Trump Hands China an Easy
Win in the Trade War
The presidentʼs tough rhetoric plays into Chinese economic
nationalism.
By Kevin Rudd
Mr. Rudd, a former prime minister of Australia, is the president of the Asia Society Policy
Institute.
May 29, 2019
When President Trump tweeted on May 5 that the China trade deal was off, the historical echoes
in Beijing were loud and clear. Almost exactly 100 years earlier, China’s “May Fourth Movement”
of 1919 was a direct response to the actions of President Woodrow Wilson at the end of World War
I. Wilson had promised China, an American ally, that German colonies in Shandong would be
returned to Chinese sovereignty, but instead handed them to Japan. China exploded with anti-
American, nationalist sentiment. One of the eventual consequences was the establishment of the
Chinese Communist Party, which for the last 70 years has ruled the country.
Thus, Mr. Trump has handed Xi Jinping a remarkably effective nationalist card to play at a time
when he has been under pressure at home because of a slowing economy. The Chinese media is
now full of accounts of the country’s economic resilience and appeals to patriotism, even invoking
the spirit of the Korean War, when, according to the official narrative, China was able to stare
down the vastly superior American military.
And just in case people didn’t get the point, Mr. Xi recently visited Jiangxi, the starting point of
the Long March in 1934, in which the Communist Party endured many hardships but ultimately
emerged victorious.
I can almost hear members of the Trump administration groaning. Why on earth would they need
to take into consideration events in China’s ancient past?
The answer depends on what Mr. Trump’s primary objective is. If it’s to sound tough to American
voters, he may well have a winning formula. But if it’s to bring about a substantive change in
China’s negotiating posture toward a bilateral trade agreement, one that might usher in changes
in China’s trade policy, addressing questions of forced technology transfers, intellectual property
theft, industrial subsidies, currency manipulation and a phalanx of other non-tariff barriers, I’m
not so sure.
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/opinion/trump-china-trade-war.html 1/3
5/29/2019 Opinion | Trump Hands China an Easy Win in the Trade War - The New York Times
Days after the president’s tweets, China listed three “red lines,” positions the United States had
taken in the trade talks that were unacceptable: First, that it would keep tariffs in place for a
period after the proposed trade agreement was signed. Second, that it could impose punitive
tariffs if it judged China to be in violation of the agreement, and that China would be forbidden
from retaliating with its own tariffs. Third, the ever-inflating expectations of the terms under
which Beijing would buy American goods under a proposed bilateral purchasing agreement.
These “red lines” were new. Before that, China’s negotiating team had a fully flexible remit from
the leadership. But not anymore. Now that these three lines are in the public domain, there is no
way Chinese leaders can yield on them. The leaks of large parts of the negotiating text to the
American news media has added a new level of toxicity, making it virtually impossible to return
to the existing text as a basis of negotiations. Together with recent moves against the Chinese
telecom company Huawei presumably intended to pressure Beijing further, the possibility of
negotiating a revised agreement that is more accommodating to American interests is now very
slim.
Instead, what I have seen in Beijing over the last few weeks is a country moving in exactly the
opposite direction.

More on the trade war.
Opinion | Michelle Cottle
Donald Trumpʼs Great Patriotic Wars May 26, 2019
Economic analysts, meanwhile, have been calculating the impact of a full-blown trade war,
estimating a loss of about 1.2 percentage points to Chinese G.D.P. growth. This figure is now
portrayed in the Chinese media as entirely manageable given China’s capacity to use fiscal and
monetary policy stimulus to support domestic demand and keep growth above 6 percent.
Even if a trade deal with the United States is still possible, some in the Chinese leadership are
now starting to ask, why bother? They argue that in technology, investment, foreign policy,
national security and human rights, the Trump administration has made it clear that it has
embarked on a more adversarial position toward China. So why should Beijing expend any more
political capital on a trade deal? Perhaps it’s better, in China’s view, to cut its losses now and get
ready for the next Cold War.
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/opinion/trump-china-trade-war.html 2/3
5/29/2019 Opinion | Trump Hands China an Easy Win in the Trade War - The New York Times
If that’s what the Trump administration wants, its strategy has been a great success. If not, and
the president really wants a trade deal, with reasonable decreases in the bilateral trade deficit,
and some substantive changes in Chinese economic behavior, the American negotiating strategy
requires some serious recalibration.
Of course, China’s public position is that negotiations can continue. Even within the framework of
the new “red lines,” there may still be room for a deal. China might agree to purchase more
American goods, with America yielding on the retention of tariffs, and the unilateral right to
impose tariffs later. However, the degree of difficulty in getting to an agreement has now
increased substantially.
The bottom line is that nationalism is not just a factor in Trump’s America. It’s now a big factor in
Xi Jinping’s China as well, reinforced through the prism of Chinese history. In most of its dealings
with America over the last 100 years, China has seen itself as weak. Today, in Beijing’s view,
China is weak no longer.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012924.txt,"8 1 Introduction

1.6.6 Use heuristic computer science methods

The computer science field contains a number of abstract formalisms, algorithms and structures
that have relevance beyond specific narrow AI applications, yet aren’t necessarily understood
as thoroughly as would be required to integrate them into the rigorous mathematical theory of
intelligence. Based on these formalisms, algorithms and structures, a number of single formal-
ism/algorithm focused AGI approaches have been outlined, some of which will be reviewed in
Chapter 4. For example Pei Wang’s NARS (Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System”) approach is
based on a specific logic which he argues to be the logic of general intelligence — so, while his
system contains many other aspects than this logic, he considers this logic to be the crux of the
system and the source of its potential power as an AGI system.

The basic intuition on the part of these single formalism/algorithm focused researchers
seems to be that there is one key formalism or algorithm underlying intelligence, and if you
achieve this key aspect in your AGI program, you're going to get something that fundamentally
thinks like a person, even if it has some differences due to its different implementation and
embodiment. On the other hand, it’s also possible that this idea is philosophically incorrect:
that there is no one key formalism, algorithm, structure or idea underlying general intelligence.
The CogPrime approach is based on the intuition that to achieve human-level, roughly human-
like general intelligence based on feasible computational resources, one needs an appropriate
heterogeneous combination of algorithms and structures, each coping with different types of
knowledge and different aspects of the problem of achieving goals in complex environments.

1.6.7 Integrative Cognitive Architecture

Finally, to create advanced AGI one can try to build some sort of integrative cognitive architec-
ture: a software system with multiple components that each carry out some cognitive function,
and that connect together in a specific way to try to yield overall intelligence.

Cognitive science gives us some guidance about the overall architecture, and computer science
and neuroscience give us a lot of ideas about what to put in the different components. But still
this approach is very complex and there is a lot of need for creative invention.

This is the approach we consider most “serious” at present (at least until neuroscience ad-
vances further). And, as will be discussed in depth in these pages, this is the approach we’ve
chosen: CogPrime is an integrative AGI architecture.

1.6.8 Can Digital Computers Really Be Intelligent?

All the AGI approaches we’ve just mentioned assume that it’s possible to make AGI on digital
computers. While we suspect this is correct, we must note that it isn’t proven.

It might be that — as Penrose [Pen96], Hameroff [Mam87] and others have argued — we need
quantum computers or quantum gravity computers to make AGI. However, there is no evidence
of this at this stage. Of course the brain like all matter is described by quantum mechanics,
but this doesn’t imply that the brain is a “macroscopic quantum system” in a strong sense
(like, say, a Bose-Einstein condensate). And even if the brain does use quantum phenomena in

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012924
"
IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021388.txt,"communities enfolded the care of the
sick into a communal life of liturgy and
prayer. This is not to say that the
substantively irreligious lack proper
motivation to practice medicine. It is to
say that an animating vision for
medicine as a good and worthy activity
seems to require moral concepts that
science alone does not provide.

How should medical science be
deployed?

Medicine is not only animated by
something like a religious vision; it also
requires a thick moral framework for its
ongoing direction. To know how best to
care for patients, we need to know
something about what human flourishing
entails and how medicine can contribute
to it. Medical science is less helpful here
than one might hope.

Science facilitates the sort of
religious humanism that Browning
encourages, because it helps us better
understand the empirical world and
therefore helps all moral communities
refine their efforts to bring about human
flourishing. Science elucidates a range of
technical possibilities and provides
information about what we can
reasonably expect as the consequence of
choosing one course over another. Yet,
even the successes of medical science
highlight its limits. As medical science
generates technologies that can be put to
ever-wider uses, it exposes
disagreements about which of those uses
are worthwhile. Although medicine
proceeds in scientific ways in the care of
patients, it does so in pursuit of goals
that science cannot set. These goals
come from moral traditions and cultures,
religious or otherwise.

In the same way that the
influence of a dominant culture on
medical practice is often invisible or

taken for granted precisely because of its
dominance, so the influence of religious
ideas on medical practice is often
invisible in those areas where
commitments are shared in common
among different religions and other
moral traditions. For example, we
generally take it for granted that
mending injuries, treating infections, and
removing diseased organs are good
things to do. That is because the moral
commitments that undergird these
practices are shared by virtually all
moral communities, religious or
otherwise. Moral commitments that are
shared by all may not seem ‘moral’ at
all. Yet even the idea of sickness implies
a norm of and concern for health that are
not fully derivable from empirical
science.

The influence of religion on
medical practice becomes more visible
where the commitments of particular
traditions diverge from one another or
where they diverge from the values of
the dominant culture. For example,
religious measures have been found
consistently to strongly predict
physicians’ attitudes regarding ethically
controversial practices such as abortion,
physician-assisted suicide, withdrawal of
life-sustaining therapies, contraception,
physician interaction with patients about
spiritual concerns and, as we have found,
physicians’ ideas about the relationship
between religion and health.’

Yet overtly controversial issues
merely highlight the tips of proverbial
icebergs. Disputes about practices such
as abortion or physician-assisted suicide
concern whether the practices are
intrinsically unethical. Much more
commonly physicians agree about the
range of legitimate clinical strategies,
but they disagree about which is to be
recommended in a given moment. For

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025284.txt,"Base metals

Preference: neutral

Current (24 Oct) (last month): Copper USD 7,815/mt (8,271); Nickel USD 16,336/mt (18,351);
Aluminum USD 1,912/mt (2,079)

UBS View 6-month target: Copper: USD 8,800/mt; Nickel: USD 19,000/mt; Aluminum: USD 2,100/mt
e After the swift uptick in prices, base metals have been under renewed pressure. The initial price strength
—a simple catch up with Chinese prices triggered by a shift in demand expectations — is losing strength.
¢ In order to continue the price rally, a firm increase in final metal demand is needed. Since global
economic growth is far from seeing such a demand uptick in industrial activity during 4Q12, we think that
prices are likely to trade only sideways in the coming months before trending higher in 1Q13.
e Loose monetary policy is a good precondition for activity to pick up, but not a guarantee after so many
rounds of monetary stimulus. We therefore look east to China. Although industrial activity growth in China
is likely to bottom out, the upcoming leadership change in the country (November 2012 to March 2013),
will likely delay a bigger investment program into 1Q13. The latest stimulus program will probably prevent
Chinese IP from decelerating even further, but will not lift it meaningfully higher.
¢ Ona single commodity level, we favor copper and nickel. For nickel, short-term supply issues due to a
slower ramp up of new and existing projects have temporarily brought the market closer to balance than
initially expected. Furthermore, we should see higher Chinese stainless steel demand with stabilizing
housing activity and a demand pick up in stainless steel related products.
¢ With regards to copper, we expect import activity to remain strong, as seen in the import figures for
September. Overall, the copper market should remain undersupplied, which could widen if financial
demand is finding some store of value in the metal. We think this puts structurally low LME inventories at
risk and should push the metal price towards USD 8,800/mt or higher over six months.

4 Positive scenario

¢ China eases monetary policy aggressively, pushing credit growth to 20% y/y. In the US the Fed is able to
lift GDP growth via QE3 and the ECB puts an effective backstop to declining industrial activity.

St Negative scenario

¢ To passive Chinese authorities keep GDP growth on a constant deceleration path. A severe escalation of
the Eurozone crisis (room for a break-up) triggers a setback in investment activity - including in Germany.

What we're watching Why it matters

China's growth deceleration should come to an end. But hard economic activity

Genmand indicators, especially for China, have yet to catch up with the increase in prices.
Hence, the current base metal market is already reflecting considerable growth
goodwill that is in need of a demand confirmation by China, the US or Europe.
Copper output continues to undershoot market expectations and should be

Supply watched closely, as investment activity in mines increased sharply. For zinc,
prospects for mine closures have been delayed and should keep the market
oversupplied.

Economic data/forward Chinese economic data — trade data, CPI, IP and loan growth by financial

curve institutions. Key date: 10-15 Oct

2 UBS

Recommendations

Tactical (6 months)

e We reiterate that the strong uptick in
base metal prices is skating on thin ice, in
our view. Real activity has yet to follow
and support prices over a longer time
period. 50% of the upside potential on a
6-month horizon is likely to be behind us,
making only copper and nickel attractive,
with +10% expected return.

Strategic (2 years)

e Although the strongest performance
should be visible in zinc and lead, with
existing mine capacity expected to peak
in 2014/15, the recent price strength
makes such an investment unattractive
now, based on timing. Given a
structurally solid supply side, investors
should avoid aluminum and nickel. A
firmer supply side should also limit the
upside in copper.

Consumer Products Market Sizing (Azer)

In our proprietary Cowen consumer survey (~2,500, 18+ respondents), we found that in
January 2019 close to 7% of respondents indicated that they use CBD as a supplement.
While this is only the first month’s reading of the data (which can fluctuate from month
to month), this initial response piqued our interest considerably, as it was much higher
than we would have suspected. Indeed, to put the 6.9% incidence rate in context, that
compares to JUUL use of 4.2%, and 19.6% of consumers that consider themselves a
current tobacco user, per our survey.

From a user perspective, category engagement not surprisingly skews younger, with use
among 18-24 and 25-34 year olds at over 9%, while it is below 4% for consumers 55+.

While the category remains nascent (with revenue estimates ranging from $600 mm to
S2 bn in 2018) it seems clear that the abundance of choice, which we discuss in more
detail herein, has been a key driver of that consumer engagement. In particular, we
were surprised to see that beverages already account for close to 20% of reported form
factor use, given that this segment is among the newer offerings in the market place.
Meanwhile, tinctures, which were arguably one of the original delivery systems, has a
dominant 44% share.

when the phone rang. We’d just fed Michael, who was almost two, full of
energy, and showed no sign of wanting to go to bed. “It’s Manno,” said the
voice on the line. Brigadier General Emanuel “Manno” Shaked was Dado’s
chief of operations. “A plane has been hijacked,” he said. “It’s heading for Lod.
It will land in about 30 minutes. They’ve got hostages. Get to the airport. Dado
and Dayan are on their way.”

I called Danny Yatom and told him to get whoever was at the sayeret base to
Lod as soon as possible. But most of the men were on training exercises,
including one team with Yoni deep in the Negev Desert. He immediately began
calling them back. When I got to the airport, I found Dayan and Dado huddling
in a room below the control tower, unfurnished except for a small table in the
comer. Talik was there with them. He was now head of all military operations
in the kirva. Rechavam Ze’evi as well, the head of the central command area,
which included Tel Aviv. So was Ahrahle Yariv, who had succeeded Meir Amit
as head of military intelligence, and nodded glumly as I joined them.

The plane had landed. A Sabena Boeing 707 bound from Brussels to Tel
Aviv, it had been hijacked after a stopover in Vienna. All we knew at this point
was that the hijackers were Palestinians and that there were about a hundred
passengers on board. Dado said that, while we figured out how to respond, we
had to make sure, at all costs, the plane didn’t take off again. It would
presumably go to an Arab country, where we’d be powerless to act. Though
only a handful of my men had arrived, I took the only officer who had, Shai
Agmon, and an El Al engineer to see whether we could disable the hijacked jet.
It was parked well off from the main terminal area. With the El Al man leading
the way, we approached from the rear, crouching low, hoping the hijackers
wouldn’t spot us. The engines were still running, but at least the deafening noise
kept anyone from hearing us as we ducked under the fuselage and the engineer
removed a stabilizing pin from the front wheel. It was an eerie feeling,
envisaging the captive crew and passengers, and the terrorists, a few feet above
our heads but knowing we were powerless to do anything more to help.

Manno had called me not because I’d won my argument to expand the role
of the sayeret. It was the luck of the draw. With the growing threat of terrorism,
the kirva had drawn up a list of installations which might be targeted. Next to

conflicting explanations over the past six months about who is responsible for ensuring that he is complying with the law.

On Nov. 14, the Herald asked the sheriff’s office for a full accounting of Epstein’s check-ins for 2018. The record the office supplied two days later showed
he registered in January and in July — as required. But PBSO also inexplicably had him registering on Nov. 14 — the very same day that the Herald asked
for the records from the sheriff’s office.

When asked about this sudden registration, Barbera replied: “The information we provided you was a snapshot from the FDLE website. Perhaps,
someone from FDLE can provide a reason for you.”

Said FDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger in an email: “The screenshot is not on the public registry. This is information inputted by the local agency when
the offender comes into the local sheriff’s office to register.”

Plessinger said Epstein is not covered by the state’s new three-day rule, which requires sex offenders to re-register when they come to stay in Florida for
three days or more. His town of Palm Beach home is already on file, as a temporary residence, she said.

So it’s not clear why he would have suddenly registered a third time on Nov. 14.

State Sen. Lauren Book, a child sex abuse survivor and vocal advocate for tough sex offender monitoring, called the case an appalling example of how
those in the justice system allow wealthy people to skirt the law and bend the rules.

“These prosecutors, and judges and sheriffs who are making these decisions and allowing things to fly — we have to hold these people accountable. They
are supposed to uphold the law — regardless of who a person is and how much money they have in the bank or who they had on their airplane.”

Piece by piece

Over the years, Courtney Wild, Virginia Roberts and more than a dozen other women who say they were victims of Epstein have been quietly challenging
the traditional legal norms that have failed to punish Epstein and other men in positions of power for sexual abuse.

Epstein has paid millions of dollars in civil compensation that, for the most part, has kept the details about his operation out of the public eye. As a result,
much — but not all — of the testimony and evidence collected as part of the vast litigation has been sealed or redacted from public court records.

evaluation verbally. Since children naturally copy their parents, it is
not that complicated to figure out where children acquire their initial
values. And, since values are not typically stated (my father never said
liquor at 5 p.m. is a good thing), it certainly isn’t through lectures that
we learn values. I learned to drink at 5 p.m. from my father. He wasn’t
trying to teach me that. I learned to gamble from my father. He wasn’t
trying to teach me that either. I learned to be argumentative from my
father. He wasn’t trying to teach that. I did not learn algebra from my
father. That, he was trying to teach me.

My son wanted to grow up and sip Pepsi. He told me this constant-
ly as he was growing up. It did not matter that I hadn’t drunk Pepsi for
10 years at the point when he was saying that. He was impressed that I
had done this when he was 3 and he was frustrated that I didn’t allow
him to drink it. Presto, another family value is learned.

Children learn the family values that their family actually has.
Teenage mothers who warn against getting pregnant at a young age
may say that in words, but their actions say that their kid is alive and
well and it all worked out.

So, it follows that we don’t have to consciously teach values be-
cause we teach them without saying a word. Values are held subcon-
sciously and learned subconsciously. We can only hope that we have
set a good example. That having been said, there will still be those
who ask how we can teach values. You can’t expect that “you can’t,”
will work as an answet.

I mentioned in Chapter 3 that there are lots of things that you
can’t teach. I mentioned honesty as an example. Honesty is, of course,
a value. Now let’s ask whether you can teach people to be more hon-
est than they are naturally inclined to be. The answer is that to do
this, you have to turn a subconscious process into a conscious one.
You would need to provide case after case and experience after experi-
ence to a student that all led to the conclusion that honesty simply
works out better in the long run. This is, of course, what abstinence
and say no to drugs campaigns endeavor to do. They want to argue
kids into believing that things they think are fun, are bad. But how
can we make that argument? The argument we can make is that these
things aren’t as much fun as you think, so try them and see for your-
self—but that kind of ruins the basic premise about not doing them
in the first place. So, in principle there is no way to argue kids into
not doing what looks like fun to them and what doesn’t seem to have

Opportunity Zones 
image001.jpg; image002.jpg; image003.jpg; image004.jpg 
Importance: High 
Hope all well, are you doing anything around these or clients? 
In a former warehouse on a dimly lit street in the South Bronx, developers sipping Puerto 
Rican moonshine listened as a local official urged them to capture a new U.S. tax break by 
rebuilding the decaying neighborhood. 
In Alabama, a young lawyer quit his job after seeing the same tax break's potential to help 
one of the nation's poorest states. He now spends his days driving his Hyundai from town 
to town, slideshow at the ready, hoping to connect investors with communities. 
And on a conference call with potential clients, a prominent hedge fund executive pitched 
investments in a boutique hotel in Oakland, which he described as San Francisco's 
Brooklyn. The project is eligible for the same tax break, designed to help the poor. 
Betting on Opportunity Zones 
Sales of development sites are surging in areas eligible for tax breaks 
Source: Real Capital Analytics 
Fervor about opportunity zones is heating up across the U.S. For a limited time, investors 
who develop real estate or fund businesses in these areas are able to defer capital gains on 
profits earned elsewhere and completely eliminate them on new investments in 8,700 low-
income census tracts. The goal is to reinvigorate these areas. But the question is whether 
the 2017 tax law will, as U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin predicts, pump $100 
billion into places that need it most, or if investors will play it safe by funding projects in a 
few zones already on the upswing. 
QuicktakeWill 'Opportunity Zones' Help the Rich, the Poor or Both?  
There's no lack of optimism among officials in shrinking Rust Belt towns, wind-swept 
Western landscapes and hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, who hope to jump-start local 
economies. The incentives are so flexible they could be used for everything from affordable 
housing to solar farms. 
Yet on the investor side, much of the attention is fixed on how to turn a profit in already 
thriving areas. They include neighborhoods surrounding Manhattan, Atlantic beach towns  
drawing vacation-home developers, bedroom communities near Silicon Valley and 
anomalies like Portland, Oregon, where the entire downtown was deemed eligible for the 
breaks. 
The phrase I keep thinking of is 'gold rush,'  said Michael Lortz, an accountant who 
works with developers in Portland. There's a lot of money from out of town that's coming 
here. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 016413 
Already, a policy debate is raging. Backers are urging people to reserve judgment and say 
the tax breaks have galvanized cities, businesses and investors to think creatively about 
boosting parts of the country most in need. Critics say the incentives were poorly 
calibrated and may amount to a boondoggle far in excess of the official $1.6 billion 
projected cost. 
Americans may have to wait months or years to learn which side is right. That's because 
the law doesn't require investors to disclose projects, making it difficult to tell which areas 
are benefiting the most. 
But there's plenty of evidence that a boom is brewing. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which 
already had an investment team focusing on struggling communities, has disclosed about 
$150 million in projects in recent months. Purchases of sites inside opportunity zones 
spiked as the tax law took effect, outpacing growth in other areas, according to Real 
Capital Analytics, which tracks property sales. Altogether, investors spent 62 percent more 
on properties eligible for tax breaks in the 12 months through September, compared with 
those in the same census tracts a year earlier, its data show. 
Here are snapshots of what's happening across America: 
Bronx Boost 
Port Morris Distillery, which makes a high-alcohol rum called pitorro, was the perfect spot 
for an opportunity zone pitch. It's on a block with a colorful mural, industrial buildings 
ready for loft conversions and views of the Manhattan skyline. Much of the surrounding 
South Bronx is now an opportunity zone. 
We have always been the most ignored, Marlene Cintron, the borough's head of 
economic development, told an audience of developers and lawyers in November. These 
opportunity zones are here for you to take advantage of them. 
The case for the Bronx, where incomes are among the lowest in New York, is that it's the 
last borough awaiting revitalization. The tax incentives are designed to unleash it. If 
developers can buy at current Bronx prices, before seeing a Brooklyn-like rise, the breaks 
would be massive.

Huge, huge upside that you're not going to get if you build a strip mall in Topeka, said 
Terri Adler, managing partner of law firm Duval & Stachenfeld LLP, who also spoke at the 
event. 
Yet the Bronx faces a formidable problem: It's competing with other zones across the city, 
including waterfronts in Brooklyn and Queens with stronger momentum. The tax break 
Bronx officials hope will rejuvenate their borough may instead lure more money to what 
looks like a safer bet across the river. 
In November, Amazon.com Inc. selected Long Island City for its next headquarters. 
Portions of that Queens neighborhood, including a former plastics factory the retailer 
plans to occupy, are inside opportunity zones, even though they're among the city's fastest-
growing areas. In 2017, more apartments were built there than in any other neighborhood 
in the city. 
Driving Alabama 
Alex Flachsbart, 30, has a lot of time to talk when he's in his SUV crisscrossing Alabama. A 
lawyer who specialized in economic development grants and tax breaks, he quit his job last 
year to start Opportunity Alabama, aiming to connect capital to worthy projects. For the 
past several months, he's been educating people about opportunity zones, speaking to 
local officials, businesses and investors. 
I have done the OZ PowerPoint God knows how many times, Flachsbart, who grew up in 
the Bay Area, said from behind the wheel one day in December. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 016415 
Alex Flachsbart gives a presentation on opportunity zones in Athens, Alabama. 
Photographer: Nicole Craine/Bloomberg 
When he read about opportunity zones in a 2017 draft of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, his 
mind reeled. Here was an uncapped subsidy far more flexible than anything he'd used 
before. It could draw investment for an array of projects. He imagined funding startups in 
Huntsville, where NASA's presence has lured a deep bench of talented engineers, and the 
renovation of an old civic complex in Mobile. 
Flachsbart's nonprofit—which has board members from the state's largest utility and its 
biggest bank, Regions Financial Corp.—is now in talks for 10 potential projects that need 
more than $loo million in equity investment, he said. None have been funded yet, but he's 
certain some will be. Meanwhile, he keeps driving. 
Baltimore Billionaire 
One of the arguments over opportunity zones is whether the U.S. is handing wealthy 
investors and companies big breaks on projects they would've done anyway. One example: 
Hedge fund executive and former White House spokesman Anthony Scaramucci plans to 
build a swank, boutique hotel in Oakland. The paperwork for the permit was filed 
months before the neighborhood was designated an opportunity zone. 
But that project pales in comparison to what's happening in Baltimore. More than a year 
before President Donald Trump signed the law, real estate developer Steven Siegel helped 
negotiate one of the largest public financing deals of its kind for a client, a company owned 
by billionaire Kevin Plank, founder of athletic-wear maker Under Armour Inc.  
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 016416 
Port Covington area of Baltimore.

In 2016, Baltimore's city council approved a $660 million financing package for a 235-acre 
mixed-use development, including new offices for Under Armour, along the city's 
waterfront. The area was already designated as an enterprise zone and a brownfield site, 
connoting additional lucrative tax breaks, and the project attracted a $233 million 
investment from Goldman Sachs's urban investment group. 
Then came the opportunity zone designation. 
The tax break is only supposed to apply to real estate purchased after the law took effect. 
But lawyers across the country quickly began working around that to get the benefits for 
projects planned before the law was passed. Many tax experts have recommended sales to 
new entities. So long as the seller owns no more than 20 percent of the buyer, the 
transaction counts as arm's-length and qualifies. 
Siegel said his firm, Weller Development, has found enough new investors to comply with 
the arm's-length requirement. The company has seen so much demand, he said, that he's 
looking to replicate the project elsewhere. 
We've been fielding a lot of inbound interest, Siegel said, declining to name cities that 
have approached him. That stimulated us to take this show on the road. 
Boulder Balks 
In mid-December, during a marathon city council meeting that stretched past midnight, 
Boulder became perhaps the first jurisdiction in the country to reject its own opportunity 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 016417 
zone. Officials in the Colorado town imposed an 18-month moratorium on almost all 
development in its only census tract earmarked for the incentives. 
The move highlights how local officials have the power to respond to criticisms of the 
law—in this case, that investors may rush to build projects the community doesn't want. 
Boulder has long been a favorite spot for growing companies because people want to live 
there, thanks to its college-town vibe and quick access to nature. 
People think we have too much development, said Bob Yates, a council member. We're 
not Detroit. 
An eyebrow salon is surrounded by empty stores at Diagonal Plaza in Boulder. 
Photographer: Rachel Woolf/Bloomberg 
Though Yates, a former telecom executive, opposed the moratorium and worries it will 
make things difficult for businesses in the zone, he understands why people in Boulder, a 
liberal enclave, were skeptical of an idea enacted by a Republican Congress. He just wishes 
his city would take a more measured approach. 
The zone includes an aging mall called Diagonal Plaza. The tax incentives could have 
spurred investors to redevelop it to include affordable housing, which is sorely needed, he 
said. 
Boulder's teachers can't live in Boulder, he said. It's not a healthy thing to have 
socioeconomic divide where lower-income people have to live outside of town to serve 
higher-income people in town.

Moreover, the discovery that Edwards pursued has to be considered against the backdrop
of Epstein’s obstructionist tactics. As the Court is aware, in both this case and all other cases
filed against him, Epstein has asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege rather than answer any
substantive questions. Epstein has also helped secure attorneys for his other household staff who
assisted in the process of recruiting the minor girls, who in turn also asserted their Fifth
Amendment rights rather than explain what happened behind closed doors in Epstein’s mansion
in West Palm Beach. See Statement of Undisputed Facts. It is against this backdrop that
Edwards followed up on one of the mily remaining lines of inquiry open to him: discovery aimed
at Epstein’s friends who might have been in a position to corroborate the fact that Epstein was
sexually abusing young girls.

| In the context of the sexual assault cases that Edwards had filed against Epstein, any act
of sexual abuse had undeniable relevance to the case — even acts of abuse Epstein committed
against minor girls other than L.M., E.W., or Jane Doe. Both federal and state evidence rules
make acts of child abuse against other girls admissible in the plaintiffs case in chief as proof of
“modus operandi” or “motive” or “common scheme or plan.” See Fed. R. Evid. 415 (evidence of

Interview: Xi's engaging, creative diplomatic
approach to benefit China-U.S. ties: U.S. expert

by Xinhua writer Luo Jun

BEIJING, Sept. 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping, with an engaging and creative diplomatic
approach, is likely to secure a big success in his visit to the United States later this month, said U.S.
expert Robert Kuhn.

In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Kuhn, author of The Man Who Changed China: The Life and
Legacy of Jiang Zemin and How China's Leaders Think, recalled Xi's previous trip to California as
president and to Iowa as vice president as one of the best images as for China.

BookExpoAmerica in New York on May 29, 2015)

He went to sporting events and I was at one of the luncheons. You really had a wonderful, enriched
feeling about China at that point, Kuhn said.

Now with the United States entering a political season of presidential election, issues of contention

with China and the lack of overall understanding of China's policy has been increasing, but Kuhn
believes that low expectations can become an advantage as people may get surprised on the positive

that he owned $7 million in securities, $1 million in cash, zero in residential property (although
he told sources that he had already bought the home in Palm Beach), and $11 million in other
assets, including his investment in Riddell. A co-investor in Riddell says: “The company had
been bought with a huge amount of debt, and it wasn’t public, so it was meaningless to attach a
figure like that to it ... the price it cost was about $1.2 million.” The co-investors bought out
Epstein’s share in Riddell in 1995 for approximately $3 million. At that time, when Epstein was
asked, as a routine matter, to sign a paper guaranteeing he had access to a few million dollars in
case of any subsequent disputes over the sale price, Wexner signed for him. Epstein has
explained that this was because the co-investors wanted an indemnity against being sued by
Wexner. One of the investors calls this “bullshit.”

Epstein’s appointment to the board of New York’s Rockefeller University in 2000 brought him
into greater social prominence. Boasting such social names as Nancy Kissinger, Brooke Astor,
and Robert Bass, the board also includes such pre-eminent scientists as Nobel laureate Joseph
Goldstein. “Epstein was thrilled to be elected,” says someone who knows him.

After one term Epstein resigned. According to New York magazine, this was because he didn’t
like to wear a suit to meetings. A spokesperson for the Rockefeller board says Epstein left
because he had insufficient time to commit; a board member recalls that he was “arrogant” and
“not a good fit.” The spokesperson admits that it is “infrequent” for board members not to be
renominated after only one term.

Still, the recent spate of publicity Epstein has inspired does not seem to have fazed him. In
November he was spotted in the front row of the Victoria’s Secret fashion show at New York’s
Lexington Avenue Armory; around the same time the usual coterie of friends and beautiful
women were whisked off to Little St. James (which he tells people has been renamed Little St.
Jeff) for a long weekend.

Thanks to Epstein’s introductions, says Martin Nowak, the biologist finds himself moving from
Princeton to Harvard, where he is assuming the joint position of professor of mathematics and
professor of biology. Epstein has pledged at least $25 million to Harvard to create the Epstein
Program for Mathematical Biology and Evolutionary Dynamics, and Epstein will have an office
at the university. The program will be dedicated to searching for nature’s algorithms, a pursuit
that is a specialty of Nowak’s. For Epstein this must be the summit of everything he has worked
toward: he has been seen proudly displaying Harvard president Larry Summers’s letter of
commitment as if he can’t quite believe it is real. He says he was reluctant to have his name
attached to the program, but Summers persuaded him. He rang his mentor Wexner about it, and
Wexner told him it was all right.

An insatiable, restless soul, always on the move, Epstein builds a tremendous amount of
downtime into his hectic work schedule. Yet there is something almost programmed about his
relaxation: it’s as if even pleasure has to be measured in terms of self-improvement. Nowak says
that, when he goes to stay with Epstein in the Caribbean, they’ll get up at six and, as the sun
rises, have three-hour conversations about theoretical physics. “Then he’ll go off and do some
work, re-appear, and we’ll talk some more.”

There Is Potential for ‘Unintended’ Consequences

e The new law changes some system incentives, which may lead to new behavior
patterns, many of which are complex and hard to predict.
— The market may adapt to new MLR (Medical Loss Ratio) rules that incentivize
and reward a very specific (but ultimately arbitrary) cost structure.
— The cost/benefit analysis for employers and consumers may change, and
some may opt to re-evaluate their current employer-sponsored coverage
offerings.

e Health plans that are no longer economically viable may exit markets, potentially
adding to the uninsured problem prior to 2014.

Historical Anecdote — “An Accurate Economic Forecast Might Have

Sunk Medicare & Medicaid [in 1965]”

* In 1965, the official estimate of Medicare’s costs was $500 million per year,
roughly $3 billion in 2005 dollars.*

* The actual cost of Medicare has turned out to be 10x that estimate.

- Medicare’s actual net loss (tax receipts + trust fund interest — expenditures)
has exceeded $3 billion (adjusted for inflation) every year since 1976 and
was $146 billion in 2008 alone. In other words, had the original estimate been
accurate, the cumulative 43-year cost since Medicare was created would
have been $129 billion, adjusted for inflation.

- Infact, the actual cumulative spending has been $1.4 trillion** (adjusted for
inflation)...in effect, 10x over budget.

* While calculations have been flawed from the beginning for some of USA Inc.’s
entitlement programs, little has been done to correct the problems.

An accurate economic forecast might have sunk Medicare.

The core of this rotation is four athletic injuries. In each case the stu-
dents examine the patients, describe their observations in detail, and
perform a formal differential diagnosis. The students must use judg-
ment and modeling to predict the effect of providing a competitive
athlete with an artificial bone implant.

This rotation has three primary activities. In all three, evaluation plays
a role as they discuss genetically modified animals, crops, and muscles.
Describing, planning, and influence all are involved as the students
prepare a congressman for hearings. All four of the social processes
come into play in formal debates.

What should be clear here is that what the health sciences curricu-
lum seems to be about and what it is actually about are very different
things. It seems to be about teaching health sciences content, when
what it is really about is having students practice various cognitive
processes that occur again and again throughout life. This was the goal
of the design, pure and simple: to help students practice thinking. It
really doesn’t matter what arena they are thinking in. We get them
interested in thinking by having them think about something that
interests them and is connected to a world they may wish to explore
later on in life. They may indeed learn something about that world as
well, but the point is the cognitive process-based education, not the
subject-based education.

CALL TO ACTION

--

Gruterites,

What prompted my first memo was a concern that we have a psychopath or sociopath or malignant narcissist or narcissist or Mach (Machiavellian) in the White House, whether or not those categories grade into a continuum. What might be the remedy? To start, someone should get the word out.

It isn’t about partisanship. The far left, with its ancient forbears such as Marius or Peisistratos, has shown equal menace or worse. It’s about fitness for office. The President is the world’s number one fiduciary. A fiduciary puts the trust first. Persons without empathy or remorse are not prudent choices.

By book, I mean a collection of papers along the lines of “Moral Markets.” A mass-market book would be even better if one of us is up for it and up to it.
If I am right in fitting the president somewhere in the groups I listed, the nation faces a different and deeper crisis than many had thought. That clarifies the question and its urgency. We may or may not reach consensus on the answer. Each of us will decide separately, as always, on what is relevant and where logic leads. The overall theme might be something like “personality disorders in leadership.” There would be attention, but not exclusive attention, to which shoe if any fits the President.

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028554.txt,"12 JAM v. INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORP.

Opinion of the Court

eign immunity. Jbid.

We do not agree. The delegation provision is most
naturally read to allow the President to modify, on a
case-by-case basis, the immunity rules that would other-
wise apply to a particular international organization. The
statute authorizes the President to take action with re-
spect to a single organization—“any such organization”—
in light of the functions performed by “such organization.”
28 U.S.C. §288. The text suggests retail rather than
wholesale action, and that is in fact how authority under
§288 has been exercised in the past. See, e.g., Exec. Order
No. 12425, 3 CFR 198 (1984) (designating INTERPOL as
an international organization under the IOIA but with-
holding certain privileges and immunities); Exec. Order
No. 11718, 8 CFR 177 (1974) (same for INTELSAT). In
any event, the fact that the President has power to modify
otherwise applicable immunity rules is perfectly compati-
ble with the notion that those rules might themselves
change over time in light of developments in the law gov-
erning foreign sovereign immunity.

The D. C. Circuit in Atkinson also gave no consideration
to the opinion of the State Department, whose views in
this area ordinarily receive “special attention.” Bolivarian
Republic of Venezuela v. Helmerich & Payne Int'l. Drilling
Co., 581 U.S. __, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 9). Shortly after
the FSIA was enacted, the State Department took the
position that the immunity rules of the IOIA and the FSIA
were now “link[ed].” Letter from Detlev F. Vagts, Office of
the Legal Adviser, to Robert M. Carswell, Jr., Senior Legal
Advisor, OAS, p.2 (Mar. 24, 1977). The Department
reaffirmed that view during subsequent administrations,
and it has reaffirmed it again here.2 That longstanding

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011703.txt,"By mid-December 1990, war was virtually certain. Misha and I had been to
Washington in September and agreed with the Americans that, unless we were
attacked by Saddam, we would stay out of it. To do otherwise was clearly not
just against the US-led coalition’s interests. Given the importance of our
alliance with Washington, it was against our inrerests as well. Yet with
hostilities obviously getting closer, Misha phoned Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney a few days later to remind him of the guid pro quo: we would be kept
fully in the loop about the details and timing of the initial American air strikes.
At around five o’clock on the afternoon on January 16, 1991, Misha got a call
from Cheney. He said “h-hour” would be at seven that evening Washington
time. Three a.m. in Israel.

Though we hoped to stay out, I’d now spent months coordinating and
overseeing preparations to ensure we could attack Saddam’s Scuds if necessary.
By far most of the missiles were mounted on mobile launching vehicles, and
Saddam was almost certainly going to be firing them from the vastness of Iraq’s
western desert. That meant an Israeli air strike alone wouldn’t work. We
decided on a joint air and ground operation, built around a newly created air-
mobile division and other special units. A force of 500 to 600 soldiers would
take control of key areas and road junctions in western Iraq and start hunting
and destroying, or at least impeding, the Scud launchers.

We also engaged in secret diplomacy in the hopes of reducing one of the
obvious risks in such an attack: a conflict with Jordan, which we’d have to
overfly to reach Iraq. The Mossad had a unit called 7evel, a kind of shadow
foreign ministry for states with which we had no formal relations but with
which, in both side’s interests, we had a channel of backdoor communications.
It was headed by Ephraim Halevy, a London-born Israeli who had come to
Palestine in 1948 as a teenager. He had built up a personal relationship with
King Hussein, and now arranged for us to meet him at a country residence
which the king had in Britain.

A few weeks before the war, I boarded a private jet to London along with
Halevy and Prime Minister Shamir. Shamir had never met the king before and
nor, of course, had I. But we didn’t talk about the forthcoming meeting on the
five-hour flight. Instead, Shamir opened up in a way I’d never seen: about his
childhood as part of a relatively well-off family in Poland; his love of literature,
and of the Bible. In a way, it reminded me of how my father had spoken to me
when I was growing up — minus the “well-off family” part.

constraints. Too little support for family over equally deserving others is seenasa

fault, and too much as another.

The reason is obvious. Jack’s ambitions for kin will eventually conflict with Zack’s,
just as with ambitions for food and nest sites and mating opportunities. Not
everyone's firstborn can be king of the hill. Social creatures evolve agonistic rules to
settle such conflicts peacefully. Losers in mating tournaments, or in contests where
males display and females choose, usually survive to compete again next year. The
contest is in the group interest because the traits of strength and skill proved in the
winner will be those passed on. Our genes tell us to compete as best we can for the
sake of a fair test, and to stop when the verdict seems clear. And soon enough it does.
The quarterback tries his best for three downs to move the yardsticks, but trots to
the sidelines on fourth down for the sake of another chance later. If genes can
encode this farsighted strategy for those other kinds of competition, why not for

nepotistic competition too?

For decades, biologists wondered why genes need so much selecting in species long
established. Shouldn’t earlier contests have selected the fittest genes once and for all,
with no need for further ones but to screen out recent and harmful mutations?
Shouldn’t the best traits have become clear millennia ago? Why need males contest
in tournaments or beauty contests every breeding season, with mostly the same
contestants, when best genes ought to have proved themselves soon after the
species began? Then there would be no genetic diversity except for recent
mutations not yet screened out. Population genetists such as Fisher, J. B.S. Haldane
and Sewall Wright had written mathematical models showing that even the slightest
selection pressures should drive a gene to fixity, and its rivals to extinction, within a
few generations if selection favored it consistently. Their argument was Malthus’
insight: breeding success is geometric. Yet there is rich allelic diversity wherever we

look. There are some gene sites in some species where the most common allele

Snowden, as a CIA communications officer, was authorized to use the computer system. The
problem was that Snowden had deliberately misused it by adding code to it. This code could have
compromised the security of the CIA’s “live system.” So while what the CIA public affairs officer
said was correct, it clouded the issue.

For his part, Snowden blamed his career-ending “derog” on an “e-mail spat” with a superior.
From Moscow, he wrote James Risen of the New York Times that his superior officer ordered him
not “to rock the boat.” Further, he complained that the technical team at the CIA station in
Geneva had “brushed him off’ even though he had a legitimate complaint. When he complained
about a flaw in the computer system, he said that his superior took vengeance on him. He said he
added the code to the system prove he was right. He attributed the “derog” in his file to the
incompetence, blindness and errors of his superiors. According to Snowden, he was a victim.
This would not be the last time he faulted superiors for their incompetency. He would later say
that the NSA experts who examined the documents that he had stolen as “totally incapable.”

In any case, in February 2009, Snowden not only had a career-damaging “derog” in his file but
he faced an internal investigation of his suspicious computer activities. According to Tyler
Drumheller, the former CIA chief for Europe, such an internal investigation was not undertaken
lightly or because of an “email spat.” He said that such an investigation was “a big deal”
involving the CIA Office of Security in Washington and possibly the FBI. It would also result in
the temporary suspension of his secrecy clearance. This left Snowden with little choice. If he
wanted avoid the investigation, he had to resign from the CIA, which he did. That was the end of
the security investigation. He was clearly bitter about the CIA, posting on Ars Technica on
January 10, 2009, “Obama just appointed a fucking POLITICIAN to run the CIA!” (He was
referring to Leon Panetta, President Clinton’s former chief of staff.) Snowden attributed the
origins of his antipathy to US intelligence to his 2007-2009 experiences in the CIA. Snowden
later told Vanity Fair that the 2009 incident in the CIA convinced him that working “through the
system would lead only to reprisals.” Much of what I saw in Geneva really disillusioned me
about how my government functions and what its impact is in the world, he told the Guardian in
June 2013. I realized that I was part of something that was doing far more harm than good.
Snowden, if not yet a ticking time bomb, was certainly a disgruntled intelligence worker before he
ever got to the NSA

US Policy on Arab Revolutions

TJP summary:  Plenty of different opinions on what was done right and wrong.  No consensus.  



Indyk: syria will spill into Bahrain and KSA (Saudi). We should have moved earlier.  KSA is a BFD.  

Feaver (ex Bush):  BO's obsession w anti Bush (especially wrt Iraq) has unnecessarily limited Administrations ability to engage in Iraq which -as we see now w Syria - is just dumb. 

Dannzinger (ex Obama Admin):  obama has done a remarkable job and the only way he could have done better is if I had held a senior post in the Administration. 

Kahl (ex Obama Admin) : Feaver is living in a fantsy world. BO couldn't make a SOFA deal w NAM. He tried, but we had no leverage and Iraqis wanted to break sense of  occupation. So President went to zero based engagement  and now wants to build engagement w Iraq from zero base. 

Flornoy:  Feaver, you make me feel like I lived in a different reality.  Did a good job of articulating lead from behind strat in Libya.  When you consider our national interests in the context of our domestic condition, we did the best we could. 

Zelikow: what are the top priorities of admin.  Defeat AQ and avoid a pre mature  war w Iran; avoid Iraqi civil war - Iraq is moving troops now to west; manage the hot situations in ME. 

Froman: lead fom behind is not admin policy.  Leverage our resources and those of our allies. 

Hadley: now in era of big bets. We need to define our objectives and spot moments when we should lead and take a big bet. 

Maghan O: advancing our interests w a  Lead from behind or a light handed approach will only work if a numner of assumptions are accurate (eg Muslim Bro will moderate; monarchy -KSA- will self reform). These are big assumptions and therefore using a light hand may fail. Agrees w Hadly that there are times we should take a big bet and Iraq would have been an example of that. 

Indyk: we need to engage more in Syria. It is a regional lynch pin and lead from behind won't work. 

Feaver:  Dannzinger is uncharacteristically wrong. A different approach 4 yrs ago would have left us in better positions in Iran Iraq and Syria. 











Iraq 

TJP summary:  Obama has been unable to find a way to keep a US voice in Iraq.  Iraq is a big deal and US has just disappeared.  Admin says that NAM (Iraq PM) has kept us out; Bush people say that Obama has walked away.  





Maghan O’:  We should have kept resid force in Iraq.  Most important function would have been keeping a healthy tension between the central govt and new institutions.  For 10 years Iraq has had a centralized power base.  With removal of US, you took away support for new institutions.  Iraqis view removal of forces as a sign we don’t care.  




Jim Steinberg:  Could get that done.  President was committed to keeping some troops in Iraq and used his leverage to try and get that done.  President supported NAM in hopes of getting a new SOFA. Tried  everything.  We could not deploy forces without deal on immunity.  We need to now focus on how can we now engage.  This is going to be hard to do without support (financial, security etc.)





MO:  President ignored lessons of 2008 SOFA negotiations.  There, we got creative on immunity.  





JS: NAM said he could do SOFA but couldn’t take it to Parliament.  We insisted on going to Parliament beacause attys said without that we wouldn’t have a binding deal. 





MO:  Will Iraq hold together?  More challenges now that I have seen since 2003, but still more likely than not.  NAM is consolidating power in last 9 mos which sends a msg to Kurds that they don’t like.  If NAM kills democracy, then Kurds leave the union.  The US should help Turkey and Baghdad resovlve their issues.  Portraying Turkey as a model and Iraq as a bad guy is counter productive.  Turkey is trying to undermine Shia role in Iraq.





JS:  External forces will affect Iraq.  We need to keep incentives for all parties to keep country together.  





MO:  Iraq is most vulnerable to Iran when it is weak and divided and we haven’t done enough to help Iraq.  Iraqi’s are worried that an Assad exit will push Iran to double down on Iraq.  





JS:  limit Iran’s influence on Iraq by isolating Iran in region.  Reducing Iran’s incluence in region is key. But Iraq also has to get its act together and be more cohesive.  President has made a big bet on Erdogan and Turkey.  





Scowcroft:  What are Turkey’s objectives in Iraq?





Steinberg:  Kurd separation is their focus.  Building a relationship with Iraqi Kurds is a route for Turkey.  They don’t like NAM and Shia – sunni split plays a role in Turkey’s attitude towards Iraq.  





MO:  Turkey sees Iraq and Iraqi Kurds as a source of energy. Turkey doesn’t necessarily like the idea of an indep. Kurdish state.   Also comments that there are limits to Iran’s influence in Iraq.  Sadr is becoming an Iraqi nationalist.  He wants to get rid of NAM.  Fluid political dynamics in Iraq.  Iran cannot determine outcomes in Iraq.  





Zalikow:  US posture in Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan.  We can put non-uniformed people in Iraqi Kurdistan.  Kurdish conflict with NAM is about oil.  These are big bets.  NAM is saying you oil companies can go to Kurdistan or Basra but not both.  Immediate neighbors of Kurds are Sunnis who also dislike NAM.  What would US position be if Iraqi forces fought with Kurds?





Madeleine:  Turkey needs to be a key relationship.  Need to assure that Turkey is a solid partner in our efforts in region.  





Feinstein:  You guys underestimate activities and missions being executed by Qud  Forces and Republican Guards.  Proxies are going to become major players.  





Dov:  If Syria goes Sunni, that’s bad for NAM. 





Podesta:  What role of AQI in Syria?





Kahl:  Risk to Iraq is growth of NAMs power, but we couldn’t affect politics in Iraq w 150k toorps what makes anyone think we could do it with 10 k troops.  Also, we couldn’t get SOFA  cause all attys were saying we needed Parliament to approve SOFA and NAM said he couldn’t take it to Parliament.  





JS:  Resid forces might have been helpful under some circumstances.  Now, we need to make clear that we do not support an Indep. Kurdistand.  How do we do that and still support Kurds?  





MO:  If Kurds have military confrontation with NAM, our response will depend on circumstances.  





Pawlenty:  What lessons have we learned and what lessons has NAM learned?





MO:  NAM knows that when he leaves office, he could be prosecuted and put in jail.  This will inform his actions.  Syria and Iraq: would be in our interests if Syria issue was not seen as Sunni v Shia.  We would like an opposition that is more broad based.  Barzani could help by trying to get Syrian Kurds integrated into Syrian opposition.   Baghdad-Ankara relationship is very bad.  They want to get rid of NAM so pushing Iraqi Kurds to make trouble for NAM.  This could be a gross miscalculation.  Davutaglu is personally driving a better deal for Sunnis in Iraq.

Post 3 


MENA: trade, aid and economics 


TJP summary:   Arab Spring or Islamic Awakening has changed the game in knowable and unknowable ways.  Knowable is that the region – in addition to its political crisis -  is facing the potential of a very serious financial crisis.  Financial stabilization is first order of business.  Egypt and KSA are the mother of all problems in the region.  (besides Iran, Pakistan and Syria).  If Egypt or KSA get out of control it is a global game changer.  





Kito de Boer McKinsie UAE


Arab Spring has had significant and negative financial consequences for region. 

  1.  Not biz as usual.  Outcomes are very uncomfortable.  Think in terms of paths that could be models:  Pakistan or Indonesia or Turkey.

  2.  Libya could be lighthouse of progress in region; 

  3.  Insights and strategy counts.  Discount opinions of elite. Get to the street to understand.  Hire locals.  Be local.  

  4.  Act while the going is good. Cost of operating KSA has gone from $12/barrel to $85/barrel.  KSA is not financially sustainable with these expenditures. 

  5.  Governance is not fit for purpose in many countries.  KSA is unable to solve problems particularly where it requires cross – ministerial action.  Too many civil servants. 

Critical issues for region: 

  1.  Employment

  2.  Education for employment

  3.  Economic model needs to be fixed

  4.  Housing.  Huge social issue because inadequate housing means the 20-30 year olds stay at home and that is bad social policy.  



Mike Froman (Dpty NSA)

Glass half empty.  Serious financial difficulty ahead.  Populace policies adopted to quell people.  This includes expenditures and that become embedded as entitlements.   (I refrained from asking him if that sounded like another country we know).   MENA’s export market is Europe which means they will experience softness.   All of this has the makings of a serious financial crisis in the region.  We are seeing the beginning of a multi-decade set of issues.  No beacon for success.  A series of fundamental issues are not resolved, including:  Modernism, role of private sector, role of foreigners.  Demographics create pressure on solutions because they need to address distribution of wealth.  Administration’s early contacts w Muslim Bro (Muslim Brotherhood) are encouraging. They come from mercantile class.  Need to work with them.  What to do?

Admin has a 4 pillar policy towards Egypt.  

  1.  Stabilization.  We must, must, must avoid financial crisis.  Give financial support (IMF, access to credit markets etc.)

  2.  Job creation.  Expand mandate of EBRD.

  3.  Broaden participation in governance.  Anti corruption laws and asset recovery programs. 

  4.  Integration.  Trade and investment.  Trade liberal ization.  Good regulatory practices (like Dodd Frank?)

Problem in Egypt is that there is no one to talk to.  



Bob Zoellick (just retired as President of World Bank)

Economics needs to be viewed as a dynamic in its own right, not just a function of political and social issues.  Money is not enough.  Structural and governance reforms are just as critical.  Connect structural reforms to communities.  Create context for public investment.  Framework s for investing.  Jordan is on the edge.  They are starting some reforms.  Policy counts, not just money.  Country and people must own the effort.  While we see Egypt and KSA (Saudi) as the big problems, if they aren’t interested in reform, we should spend our energy and resources in smaller countries who are ready and hope they provide role models when dynamics of Egypt and KSA are more ripe.  



Syria: Should the US intervene?   

TJP summary.  There was a remarkable consensus that the US should intervene in Syria.  Many on both sides of the aisle supported the Hadley formulation (see below).  Questions of how to intervene varied somewhat, but few said we should not actively intervene in the Syrian situation.   Under discussed were two critical issues.  First, WMD.  Syria has huge stores of chemical and bio weapons and they are very widely distributed.  Having these fall into hands of terrorists could ruin our day.  Do we have the knowledge, strategy and will to secure these?   Second, post Assad Syria is going to be a mess.  It will require a serious peace keeping force.  Who is going to provide that force?   Post script:  inspite of the broad consensus that the US must act, the private conversation was that we would not act.  It is unclear to me why this is the case, but several people (Dems and Repubs who had spoken in favor of action) said they didn’t think it was in the cards.  



Richard Falkenrath:  The US has the power to depose a very bad guy – Assad.  Should we do that?    Proposition:  Don’t do it because:   

  1.  We have a strategy and its working.  BS. It is a failed strategy.

  2.  Is there a reasonable prospect of success if we decide to depose – yes.

  3.  The costs are acceptable – yes

  4.  Do no harm.  That would be at risk if we decide to depose

  5.  Legaility.  Can be handled

  6.  Timing.  Election season is problematic.

Richard’s conclusion is we should have a policy to depose Assad.  



Ann Marie Slaughter (ex Obama) .  Depose but with military light.  Intel and tailored arms to opposition who hold territory in return for pledge of no revenge killings.  Multi pronged incrementalism.  US is still missing one element.  We have no overt public relations program. Why aren’t we working a full fledged PR campaign w our allies?  We should be standing with Syrian people in a more public way. 



General Hoss Cartwright .  We need to inventory the tools we have and then define our actions.  Stop supplies to Assad; provide command and control assets (radios) to rebels; provide intelligence; develop knowledge and planning for securing WMD.   We need to answer the above questions as part of defining our policy.  Intel and arms are happening.  We also need armed observers to know what’s going on; need safe harbors that have a protective flank in order to provide good logistics and supply.  Syria is far more difficult in this regard than was Libya.  We need strategy and structures to prevent mass atrocities.  Will we put boots on the ground.  



Steve Hadley (ex Bush):  Need to assure ourselves and the Syrians that we are aligning with the Syrian people.  Forget the UN.  This will send a critical message to China and Russia that they don’t have a veto on US policy.  Gain legitimacy by aligning with Turkey and others.  Send a strong and clear message to business and military community in Syria that we are going to see this through and they should ditch Assad now.  



Bill Perry:  I support near term intervention, but not boots on the ground.  Support enforcing no fly – no drive zones.   Bring Turkey into operations.  US must participate with its unique capabilities (e.g. AWACs) and let others participate with less unique assets (supplying arms etc.).   There is no prospect of UN cooperation.  But a coalition of the willing (UK, Arab League) will give us the legitimancy we need.  Very good prospect of military success.  Reasonable prospect of success on humanitariean side.  We should act, but in a fashion that has most of the action on the backs of the rebles.  



Madeleine  A:  Must intervene.  How do we structure intervention.  Didn’t use UN in Kosovo and shouldn’t use it now.  



Jim Steinberg (ex Obama).  Must be certainty in everyone’s mind as to outcome (ie.that Assad is out).  Take nothing off the table. 



Dennis Ross (ex Obama):  Costs and consequences of intervention have been discussed, but most of these consequences and costs will come to fruition whether we go in or don’t go in, therefore we should go in and impact the outcome.  Reach out to KSA and Alawites.  Don’t dither over analysis. 



Zalikow.  Arms assistance can be had elsewhere.  More interesting is to supply things that we are uniquely able to supply (intel) and use that as leverage for post war Syria.  Nuclear Iran is our primary objective.  Look at all strategies in Syria through that prism.  



Perry:  Going into Syria will not weaken Iran’s resolve to get nukes, but it will send the message that the Admin is willing to act militarily.  Not going into Syria will send the opposite message and that is very dangerous.  



Indyk.  Don’t ditch UN.  Need them for post war.  Need them for Turkey.  Put pressure on Russia and then be prepared to go ahead without UN, but not yet. 



Madeleine.  Not going to UN for intervention does not preclude going to the UN later.  



Feavor (ex Bush).  Iran is THE issue.  Whatever we do in Syria cannot feel like a quagmire.  What we do in Syria will affect the recently announced ‘rebalancing to Asia’.  We cannot secure WMD without boots on the ground.  



Meghan O. 

  1.  Iran’s reaction to fall of Assad.  Look to 2007 actions agains Iran.  Didn’t have Iranian ‘pay back’ rather, Iran slowed down its nuke activity

  2.  Post Assad, need a peace keeping force.  That will be critical.  Post assad Syria will be very, very unstable.  Turks will look to stabilize their kurd situation.  Iran will adjust strategies towards Syria etc. 

  

  Ignatius We need to speak to Syrian people to let them know we are active.  Population movements towards sanctuaries (Alawite sanctuaries, Sunni Sanctuaries etc.) will trigger atrocities.  

  

  Kahl.  The fall of Assad may cause Iran to increase  their nuke efforts.  Do not lose focus on Iran.  

  

  Green.  Inaction will have serious negative consequences. It will be a measure of our will to act by friends and enemies.  

  

  Israel: the big loser   

  TJP summary.   Syria Iran is a game changer for Israel which requires them to completely rethink their threats, opportunities, strategies and interests.  They can hunker down until more clarity or they act (big or small).  There is a feeling that Israel has some acts they can take that would improve their positioning.  Iran is the most immediate and big issue.  Cannot have an Iran with nukes.  Will lead to proliferation and significantly increased probability of nuclear event.  Israel cannot  sit by.  

  

  Dennis Ross, Jane Harmon and Walter Isaacson.   



  DR: Syria is most secure border that Israel has.  Syria is unraveling is very significant.  WMD could go to terrorists.  Everyone should share concerns about Syria’s WMD.    Hezbollah loses supplier, but unraveling of Syria has huge consequences for Jordan.  Bibi is sensitive to Jordan issues.  We need to have a very serious conversation with Bibi.  (does Obama have the credibility reserve to have that conversation). 

  

  Jane H:  Israelis misplayed this.  They encouraged us not to play in Syria.  They failed to anticipate Arab Spring and its consequences.  Iran needs to be our focus.  US narrative on ME is lost.  So is Israel’s.  

  

  Walter:  What effect on Israel : Palestine issues.  Israel: Turkey issues.  Will Israel think big?  Can Israel coalesce parties around a solution to Iran issue.  Can they do this by agreeing to a Palestinian solution. 

  DR:  Now would be a moment for Israel to take a brave initiative with Turkey.  Having an Islamic country as an ally may give cover to other Islamic countries.  Israel and Turkey have common interests in Syria.  This outcome is possible, Bibi needs assurances on Turkey’s response to an Israeli apology. 

  

  Jane.  Maybe rise of Islamists in Egypt has some good aspects.  If Muslim Bro keeps treaty (w Israel) then you have an Islamic country owning a treaty with Israel.

  

  DR.  Muslim Bro is very busy with domestic issues.  But let’s remember who they are.  Morsi sent letter to Shimon Perez.  Perez said thank you and asked Morsi if Israeli’s could take letter public.  Morsi said yes, it was written with that in mind.  Perez made it public, Egyptian Muslim Bro got angry so Morsi denied he had ever sent a letter.  Tunisia’s Muslim Bro are drafting a constitution that makes it criminal to support a peace with Israel.  

  

  Indyk.  Israeli public believes that they have no Arab partner w whom they can negotiate a peace.  Syria reinforces notion that Israel should not take risk when regimes are fragile.  

  

  DR.  Sinai is flashpoint w Egypt.  Admin has had a very meaning? Palestinian issue is not key.  Wasn’t art of Islamic awakening, but it is not insignificant.  Demographics compel 2 state solution.  Too much distrust between Israel and Palestinians.  Steps that each could take to move towards each other (e.g. Israel offers money to any settler who leaves West bank.   

  

  Iran

  TJP summary.   Discussions suggest that it is more likely than not that there will be a military attack on Iran in next 18 months.  That is going to be very ugly.  Interestingly, polls suggest population and IR academics would not support such an attack.  Both Pawlenty – representing Romney, and Podesta – representing Obama, presented a logic that – if followed, would lead to war with Iran.  Logic sitting in Aspen is fine, pulling the trigger is another matter.  

  

  Graham Allison.  Two terrible choices, we should look for a third way. 

  Steve Hadley.  Iraq was not a war of choice, it was a war of last resort when all other options failed.   Aug, 2013 we will be out of options on Iran.  We do need to think hard about our options and the sequencing of those options.  Think in terms of a f

  family of options and the methods of moving through them.  

  1.  Stop the clock, buy time.  Iran has rejected this. 

  2.  Put more on the table.  More for more.  

  3.  Secure the big agreement that ends dispute.  Could the US agree to allowing Iran to have a limited amount of LEU – say 3-5% enriched unranium.  

  4.  If all of the above fails  - what to do?  US should try to establish a status quo w redlines where, if Iran tries to break out, we have time to attack.   We would also want to understand Iran’s redlines.  

  5.  Long term sanctions, pressure and isolation to try for regime change.

  6.  Limited military strike.

  7.  Big strike



Bill Perry:  a military strike by US or Israel will have serious, unknowable and unintended consequences.  Therefore attack is very unattractive.   Iran is close to a virtual nuke.  They will be there by June, 2013.  If Iran gets the bomb this will make a mockery of US and UN.  Lead to copy cats developing nukes – especially KSA.  It would be the end of nuclear non-proliferation and significantly increase chance of nuclear event.  This is very, very unattractive.  We should explore third way between now and end of the year.  Diplomatic path would have to be coercive diplomacy.  Sanctions are hurting, but we only have 6 months and that is not enough time.  Must convince Chinese and Russians of consequences of a military strike.  We should allow some (5%) enrichment with inspections.  This gives Iran a way out.  

If none of the above works, US should strike.  We could launch a devastating strike (Israel does not have that ability).  (nighttime, B-2, deep penetration bombs).  First strike should be limited to nuke facilities.  US strike will be more effective militarily and narrow the political consequences.  



Energy and GCC

TJP Summary:  Write up



Meghan O:  ME may not be able to supply quantity of energy that people are assuming.  2020-2030 most predictions assume increasing oil supplies from ME.  Moving world supply coming from ME from 30 to 38%.  Most increase scheduled to come from KSA and Iraq.  Are these reasonable assumptions.  Oil is there, but politics is problematic.  1.  Internal stability is in question.  Following a revolution it is very slow to rebuild production; 2.  Reinvestment rates will decline.  KSA was planning to move from 12.5mm bbl to 15 mm bbl with a $10 bn investment.  That has been cancelled in deference to social needs.  As there is a push for democracy, the autocrat needs to increase social spending.  As population (and joblessness) increae, autocrat needs to increase social spending.  Aversion to FDI.  We are likely to see supply from ME decline.  Iraq and Iran could take up some of the slack.  

However, we have an American Energy Revolution in play.  From 2006  to 2012 we have gone from importing LNG to finding 100 years supply of gas.  Shale is also producing oil.  Bakkan field has gone from 187k bbl/day to 750k bbl/day in 5 years.  By 2020-2030 they exepect Bakkan to produce 1.3 mm bbl/day (same as Libya).  Add Gulf of Mex and by 2020 US will be producing 6.7mm bbl/day.  Harvard is estimating 11mm bbl/day.  Similar situation in Brazil and Mexico.  

Economic benefits will be great.  Political benefits will be there, but we will still have vital interests in ME.  1.  Gas won’t substitute for oil; 2.  We have other interests in ME (geography, heart of Islamic fundamentalism etc.); 3.	Oil is a global commodity.  Disruptions in ME oils supply will affect US; 3.  KSA still has spare capacity (Iraq is trying to develop same); 4.  Who has strategic influence over ME oil will matter; 5. Oil and global GDP are connected.   In some ways, our energy policy may become more difficult.  One big question is whether China will continue their policy of non-intervention in internal affairs of other countries (e.g. KSA goes Islamic).   KSA’s response to Arab Spring was to double the pay of everyone in the military.  



Gfoeller.   KSA social welfare was $20/bbl per year, now $85/bbl, projected at $300/bbl in 2030.  This means they will have to go to taxes and that will trigger social reaction.  Arabs have already translated “no taxation without representation”.  Major political shifts are occurring and major financial stresses are predictable.  Free health care and education are untouchable.  Arab Spring will come to KSA.  AQ was easy to fight because you could identify bad guys and kill them.  Could fight their ideology.  Arab Spring has no leaders, no ideology.  They want everything: money, power and vote.  When will KSA get nukes?  Realignment of national security team (Bander plus 2 other major changes suggest a major focus and potential big deals in the offing.  Is this about Iran or Russia and china or Arab Spring or something else.  



Mehgan :  Power of being energy indep has consequences.  Being a major consumer has leverage.  KSA taking oil off market will still be meaningful.  Will China retain its policy of non-interference in internal afairs when faced with Islamist take over of KSA?







US Policy Going Forward

TJP Summary: see write up



Bob Blackwill: 

Pivot to Asia does not relieve us of serious interests we have in ME.  We announce a pivot to Asia when: 

Iran – moving to nukes

Egypt – Mubarak is in a cage and new govt could be seriously anti-US

Syria – disintegrating

Iraq – could fragment

KSA – ripe for revolution

ME peace process is dead

Israel – at more serious risk than in living memory

Afpak – a mess 



Obama has made no big mistakes in a revolutionary environment, but no victories either.  No big bets other than surge in Afghan – which we lost; and killing Osama which we won.  Obama’s approach is to take no risk, increment into a situation and hedge the position.  No big bets.  Maybe that’s right for these times but look at Truman with Marshall Plan;  in ’73 ME war Nixon used it to push Soviets out of ME which gave us 30 years of dominance in ME.  Bush (I) pushed to integrate Germany and Poland into NATO – huge bet and we won.  Big bets come from the top down.  Not interagency BS.  Before Malta summit, Reagan WH had given him 18 initiatives to raise with Gorbachev.  2 days before summit, Reagan decided to pass them by cabinet.  Held cabinet meeting and every time an idea was surfaced, the relevant cabinet member tried to kill it until it had been vetted by his bureaucracy.  After three went this way, Reagan ended the meeting.  Presidents make big bets, administrations don’t.  Here are some ideas: 

  1.  Iran – next president will be forced to make a big bet.

  2.  Egypt – Importnace is clear.  Our response has been pitiful.  Small and irrelevant.  Obama is letting his team over analize and organizational dynamics are pushing safe and no risk options.  Only a president can overcome organizational dynamics.  Not all big bets are worth taking. 

  3.  Syria – Pattern has been to hesitate and equivocate.  Some of our allies are joking that we will implement a no fly zone … 10 feet at a time.   We should break the Syria  - Iran link with the full force of the US.  Slow and cautious will be damaging to our interests in Syria and Iran. 

  4.  KSA we should consider guarantying their integrity. 

  5.  Iraq – NAM bring it towards a break up.  Bet on Alawi 

  6.  ME peace process – we need a big bet.  

Incrementalism won’t work.  Activities threaten our vital interests.  No big bets can succeed if the US has a policy of leading from behind.  

Strobe Talbott

Big bets should be hedged and designed to change when circumstances change on the ground.  Obama doctrine is not concise and that’s deliberate and smart in a very dynamic regions.  Obama is an anti-doctrine doctrine. 



Scowcroft

We need a central strategy.  Currently we are all tactics and no strategy.  Pivot to Asia, responses to EU financial crisis etc are all tactics.  The Westphalian structure is under attack.  Industrialization led to Westphalian state.  Globalization is creating forces against the state.  We need a strategy to reconcile these huge forces.  Global warming is a global threat that may dwarf all of the above.  We need a strategy

Stock view: controversy sounding the mortgage business

While we still expect Zillow’s core business to have a solid quarter on product
improvements, the self-serve platform, and its recent Seller Boost product, the
controversy surrounding Zillow’s mortgage business (which potentially has implications
for Zillow’s core business and the retail estate industry} has been a key recent driver of
the stock. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB} has indicated that it views
Zillow's mortgage referral system as potentially violating parts of the Real Estate
Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA}. RESPA (Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act) is
an act designed to product potential homeowners by outlawing kickback and referral
fees from real estate services, particularly in relation to mortgage brokers who often
receive referrals from real estate agents. Since Zillow’s mortgage referrals involve a
pre-application and a referral directly to a mortgage agent that than a larger entity like a
bank, this could be violating the act. Mortgage brokers often fund some of the real
estate agents online advertising expenses and a crackdown on mortgage agents could
potentially hurt real estate agents ability to spend dollars on Zillow.

For now it is too early to say how this will develop as there are conflicting views for and
against this view with the CFPB not releasing an official stance, but we expect this to be
a near term overhang on the stock until a clear view of the CFPB’s view and intentions
unfold. While a contentious issue, mortgage revenue is still only 8% of total revenue
and even a cut back would have a minimal impact to overall revenue growth. As for the
impact on real estate agent spend on Zillow, we believe at with only roughly 5%
penetration into real estate agents online spend Zillow has plenty of room to grow the
core business and the high ROI of the ad unit will ensure agents buy placements on
Zillow regardless of mortgage broker involvement and continue to like the stock.

Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q: Mortgage requests and revenue per loan

With the controversy surrounding the mortgage business, we think investors will be
extra focused on the mortgage unit and focus on the mortgage revenue per loan request
and consumer load requests. Zillow will be releasing new metrics this quarter to replace
ARPA and premier agent count, but has yet to indicate what those metrics will be. Key
topics for the call will likely include: 1) mortgage business outlook; 2) premier agent
advertising spend; 3) rentals business; and 4) progress on FY17 goals.

Biggest 1Q issues/risks:
¢ — If the CFPB decides Zillow violates RESPA, Zillow could face fines and have to
retool its mortgage platform.

« New metrics for FY17 could give less visibility into the business as a whole.

¢ Slower than expected penetration of self-service platform leading to increased
S&M costs.

¢ Potential for a weak 2Q guide if mortgage issues overhang the business as a whole.

Top 1Q traffic data points: comScore suggests usage up in 1Q

comScore desktop data suggests that unique visitors were down 5% quarter to date
Jan. and Feb.) while usage was up 2% QTD. However, on mobile, comScore data
suggests usage is up 14% y/y on a bigger unique visitor base to 62mn unique users and
usage was up 7%. We note comScore has made several methodology changes which
has impacted the consistency of recent months data.

Estimates vs. Consensus: We are above the Street

Over rev/EBITDA estimates of $239mn/$40mn is above the Street at $236mn/$39mn.
We estimate that ARPA will be up 29% y/y to $629 and premier agent subscribers will
be flat y/y at 91.9K. Overall, we estimate 28% y/y growth, but note that the mortgage
issues could potentially impact revenue. For rentals and other we estimate $32mn in
revenue, up 75% y/y.

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014920.txt,"Snap (Neutral, $25 PO)

Stock view: Long-term potential, but near-term could be lumpy

Snap will report its first earnings as a public company and expectations have a wide
range. The 2H16 DAU slowdown has raised concerns in terms of both competitive risk
and execution, so user trends could be the most important metric in the quarter. At this
point, it’s difficult to gauge relative impact of Facebook / Instagram competition,
Android technical issues, product cycle lumpiness, and seasonality to the recent
slowdown. Nonetheless, our sense is that DAU expectations are around 164-166mn, and
we'd expect variability (higher or lower) to have a meaningful impact on stock
sentiment.

In terms of the P&L, we expect a slight q/q decline in revenue per normal seasonality
and are modeling down 1% q/q (consistent with comments in the prospectus filing}.
While we can appreciate the momentum of the API roll-out with several new
partnerships announced in January, our checks suggest most programs are early stage
with limited volume to date. Considering the rest of the P&L, we expect a fairly messy
quarter between deal costs, the CEO stock award, and a catch-up RSU stock comp
expense. As we do not anticipate non-GAAP profitability until 2H19, we expect
traditional P&L metrics will be less of a focus in the coming quarters.

We recently initiated coverage with a Neutral and $25 price target (please see User
overhang unlikely to be resolved in a Snap — Initiate at Neutral with $25 PQ). Social
media sector history suggests a wide range of possible outcomes for Snap and, as such,
near-term lumpiness in metrics could result in high volatility for the stock. We also note
that lock-up overhang could drag on near-term performance into the first lock-up
expiration on 7/29.

Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q: DAUs, ARPU, and competition

We believe the key metric for the quarter will be the DAU number, which we model at
166mn (up 8mn q/q, 36% y/y). We believe DAU headwinds may peak 1H17 as the
company is facing an onslaught of competitive products (see More Stories in the Snap
competitive saga), technical challenges with Android (from Memories), and seasonality
entering the summer. We model ARPU at $1.01 (down 5% q/q), with North America
ARPU at $2.03 (down 7% q/q). We won't be surprised to see upside in ARPU driven by
ad load growth and higher user engagement, though competitive pricing could
potentially offset.

Biggest 1Q issues/risks:

¢ DAU deceleration on share loss: Anything short of 164mn will likely be met with
skepticism as investors extrapolate recent trends in considering competitive
resilience vs Instagram, Facebook, and others. Management will likely address the
Android technical issues impact on DAUs.

+ Aggressive pricing could drive short term growth but have mixed perception:
Twitter noted elevated competition and potentially aggressive pricing surfacing in
mid-January, which aligns well with Snap’s API update.

¢ Lack of visibility into pipeline: While we don’t necessarily expect new product
announcements, lack of color/visibility on the product pipeline could disappoint.

¢ Results could leave investors looking for more disclosure: We are not sure what
disclosure Snap will provide on results, and important trending info (like average
minutes per user) could be lacking.

Top 1Q data points: comScore suggests some gains for Instagram
While comScore data is not consistent with reported minutes, it is useful for relative
comparisons. The data puts Snapchat minutes per user well above Twitter, but still

antidote to the local strain of parasite or pathogen. This idea could complement the
Hamilton-Zuc parasite model nicely. It would give a safe home to which both gene

and parasite could retreat until their times come again.

Period of Production Theory

Back to economics. Chapter 4 mentioned John Rae as a contributor to what later
developed into Mill’s free growth theory. Rae’s book, published in 1834, also begins
what was called period of production theory. The idea was that production took
time, and that profit compensated the investor’s patience over the production
period. Senior, who had sent Rae’s book to Mill, adopted this idea in his own better-
known Outline in 1836. Rae’s book itself found few readers, despite its warm
endorsement by Mill in his own magnus opus of 1848. Jevons adopted the idea from
Senior in 1871, and Boehm Bawerk from Senior and Jevons in his book of 1889.
Boehm Bawerk soon learned of Rae’s work, and dedicated later editions to him.
Period of production theory thrives today in the Austrian School, which had been
founded by Boehm Bawerk’s teacher Carl Menger in 1871. (Menger was the guy who
squabbled with Schmoller in Chapter 2.)

It has found little favor elsewhere. The period seemed impractical to define or
measure, and so gave little predictive value. Joseph Schumpeter, a student of Boehm
Bawerk who disagreed with him on this point, argued in 1911 that the period of
production is zero; capital is present continuously. Frank Knight, who had
anticipated Schultz in realizing that some consumption is investment in human

capital, argued as Schumpeter had.

But the theory is true by definition. Any rate is the inverse or reciprocal of a period.
The inverse of 4% per year is 25 years. Return is the ratio of net output to capital

producing it, meaning the rate of production, and its reciprocal is the period of

after his CIA security clearance ran out, he applied to renew it. A new clearance required a new
background check and filling out (again) the government’s 127-page standard form 86.

Since 1996, background investigations for the NSA, like much of the computer work at the
NSA, had been outsourced to a private company. It had proceeded from the effort of the Clinton
Administration to cut the size of the government by privatizing tasks that could be more
efficiently done by for profit companies. US Investigations Services, or USIS as it is now called,
which won the contract for background checks, was initially owned by the hedge fund Carlyle
Group who later sold it to another hedge fund, Providence Equity Partners. For the hedge funds,
profits were the measure of success. To increase its profits from the contract with the NSA,
USIS had to move more quickly in concluding background checks since it did not get paid more
extensive investigation. In 2006, the government learned USIS’s background checks were often
prematurely ended. In Snowden’s case, as USIS did not have access to Snowden’s CIA
personnel files, it did not learn about the pending security investigation of him. Nor did it learn
from the Internet that he was a disgruntled employee. So Snowden’s new clearance was approved
in the summer of 2011, allowing him to continue working for Dell on secret intelligence projects.

Meanwhile, in August 2011, Mills began her own blog entitled “L’s Journey.” In it, she
described herself as “a world-traveling pole-dancing super hero.” By now, she was an
accomplished photographer, specializing in taking self-portraits. Many of her posted pictures
were provocative poses of herself in her underwear and various states of undress. She wrote:
“T’ve always wanted to be splashed on the cover of magazines, with my best air-brushed look.”
Her wish would be gratified two years later in way she did not anticipate.

For his part, Snowden seemed happy to encourage her fantasy about being a super hero. He
even gave her a Star-Trek-inspired head visor. Despite all the concerns he voiced about privacy,
he did not seem to mind her provocative posts. On the contrary, he took photographs of her,
telling her, at one point, that her photographs were not “sexy” enough.

Snowden meanwhile got offered by Dell a new position at an NSA Kunia regional base in
Hawaii. Dell, which was in the process of expanding its government consulting business, wanted
him to be a system administrator on the NSA’s back-up system. The NSA needed this system
before it could upgrade new security protocols that would audit suspicious activity in real time.
In Hawaii, as in Japan, system administrators still worked as singletons. As Snowden had seen
when working in Japan this solo work in an unaudited workplace provided an opportunity for a
system administrator like himself to steal documents. So he may have also realized that as a solo
system administrator in Hawaii, he would have this opportunity.

In any case, on March 15, 2012, he accepted the offer. Dell agreed to pay all his relocation
expenses and provide him with a housing allowance.

He found a 3-bedroom house in Hawaii on-line, and arranged to move there on April 2, 2012.

1.2 AGI versus Narrow AI

An outsider to the AI field might think this sort of book commonplace in the research literature,
but insiders know that’s far from the truth. The field of Artificial Intelligence (AT) was founded
in the mid 1950s with the aim of constructing “thinking machines” - that is, computer systems
with human-like general intelligence, including humanoid robots that not only look but act
and think with intelligence equal to and ultimately greater than human beings. But in the
intervening years, the field has drifted far from its ambitious roots, and this book represents
part of a movement aimed at restoring the initial goals of the AI field, but in a manner powered
by new tools and new ideas far beyond those available half a century ago.

After the first generation of AI researchers found the task of creating human-level AGI very
difficult given the technology of their time, the AI field shifted focus toward what Ray Kurzweil
has called narrow AI — the understanding of particular specialized aspects of intelligence; and
the creation of AI systems displaying intelligence regarding specific tasks in relatively narrow
domains. In recent years, however, the situation has been changing. More and more researchers
have recognized the necessity — and feasibility — of returning to the original goals of the field.

In the decades since the 1950s, cognitive science and neuroscience have taught us a lot about
what a cognitive architecture needs to look like to support roughly human-like general intelli-
gence. Computer hardware has advanced to the point where we can build distributed systems
containing large amounts of RAM and large numbers of processors, carrying out complex tasks
in real time. The AI field has spawned a host of ingenious algorithms and data structures, which
have been successfully deployed for a huge variety of purposes.

Due to all this progress, increasingly, there has been a call for a transition from the current
focus on highly specialized “narrow AI” problem solving systems, back to confronting the more
difficult issues of “human level intelligence” and more broadly “artificial general intelligence
(AGI).” Recent years have seen a growing number of special sessions, workshops and confer-
ences devoted specifically to AGI, including the annual BICA (Biologically Inspired Cognitive
Architectures) AAAT Symposium, and the international AGI conference series (one in 2006,
and annual since 2008). And, even more exciting, as reviewed in Chapter 4, there are a number
of contemporary projects focused directly and explicitly on AGI (sometimes under the name
AGI, sometimes using related terms such as Human Level Intelligence).

In spite of all this progress, however, we feel that no one has yet clearly articulated a detailed,
systematic design for an AGI, with potential to yield general intelligence at the human level
and ultimately beyond. In this spirit, our main goal in this lengthy two-part book is to outline
a novel design for a thinking machine — an AGI design which we believe has the capability to
produce software systems with intelligence at the human adult level and ultimately beyond.
Many of the technical details of this design have been previously presented online in a wikibook
[Goel0b]; and the basic ideas of the design have been presented briefly in a series of conference
papers [GPSL03, GPPG06, Goe09c]. But the overall design has not been presented in a coherent
and systematic way before this book. In order to frame this design properly, we also present
a considerable number of broader theoretical and conceptual ideas here, some more and some
less technical in nature.

terms of the 1997 transfer of sovereignty from Great Britain, China
is responsible for Hong Kong’s defense and foreign policy, includ-
ing intelligence services. He then proceeded to Russia, which has no
extradition treaty with the United States. Russia granted him asy-
lum, making it unlikely that U.S. authorities would ever have the
opportunity to question him.

Snowden’s escape left in its wake an incredibly important unsolved
mystery: How hada young analyst in training at the NSA succeeded
in penetrating all the layers of NSA security to pull off the largest
theft of secret documents in the history of American intelligence?
Did he act alone? What happened to the documents? Was his arrival
in Russia part of the plan?

Because I had written several books on the vulnerability of intelli-
gence services, this was a mystery—a “howdunit,” if you like—that
immediately intrigued me. Even if Snowden had acted for the most
salutary of reasons, the unauthorized transfer of state secrets from
the United States to an adversary country is, by almost any defini-
tion, a form of espionage.

® I decided to begin my investigation of this case in Hong Kong, ©
because it was the place to which Snowden first fled after leav-
ing Hawaii. Snowden had planned the trip for at least four weeks,
according to the mandatory travel plan he had filed at the NSA.
When I spoke to my sources in the intelligence community, they
could not explain Snowden’s choice. It would not necessarily protect
him from the reach of U.S. law, because Hong Kong had an active
extradition treaty with the United States. Just a few months earlier,
Hong Kong had made headlines by honoring America’s request to
extradite Trent Martin, a fugitive wanted for insider trading.

Nor was Hong Kong particularly convenient to Hawaii. There
were no nonstop flights there from Honolulu in May 2013. Snowden
flew eight hours to Narita International Airport in Japan, where he
waited almost three hours. He then flew five hours to Hong Kong.
Snowden could have flown to countries that do not have extradition
treaties with America in far less time.

Adding to this mystery, at the time he departed Honolulu,
Snowden had not yet arranged for any journalists to meet him in
Hong Kong, and as far as U.S. intelligence could determine, he had

whether we actually would, or should, target Saddam. I asked Misha, and then
Yitzhak, only whether such an operation might seriously be considered by the
government. If not, I said, we’d drop it. Both replied that we should go ahead

with the planning and preparation. The November 1992 exercise was intended
as a final test of its viability — before deciding whether actually to do it.

A few weeks earlier, Rabin and I had talked through the arguments for and
against. The arguments against it were obvious. Yes, in the past we had
abducted, or even killed, leaders of groups involved in terror attacks. But we’d
never contemplated targeting a head of state. Crossing that line risked being
seen not just as attacking a dictator with a record of ruthlessness and murder at
home, and aggression towards Israel, but long-accepted norms of international
relations. The arguments in favour began with the fact that Saddam was a
meglomaniacally ambitious dictator. He had also fired missiles on our towns
and cities. He retained the capability to arm them with chemical warheads,
possibly biological agents, and conceivably a nuclear warhead in the future.
Both Rabin and I agreed there were two key tests of whether an attack would be
justified: was it was the only realistic way of confronting the threat from Iraq,
and would killing him end, or at least exponentially reduce, that threat.

Though there was no final decision at our meeting, Rabin was clearly
inclined to go ahead. An Israeli TV program two decades later unearthed a
summary of the discussion, written by his military aide. “The Prime Minister
approves the target... This is an operation we should go for when the probability
of success is very high,” it said. “Thus, we have to build the operational
capability in the best possible way, and continue preparations.” In another part
of the record, Rabin is quoted as having defined the elimination of Saddam as a
“meaningful objective” with implications for “the very security of Israel.” He
added: “I do not see anyone similar to him in the Arab world.”

I, too, was on balance persuaded we should do it. In the years since, I’ve
sometime reflected on what happened with Saddam still in place: the 2003
invasion of Iraq, led by the younger President Bush, the tens of thousands of
lives lost, the trillions of dollars spent on a war without any clear end, and the
near-disintegration of Iraq. But with the complexities of Iraq then and now,
there can be no simple answer to how the situation would have changed if we’d
killed Saddam. Our view, based on detailed intelligence analyses, was that the
likely result would have been a fairly rapid takeover by a few top security and
Baath Party figures and that, while the new Iraqi leadership might try to retaliate

In addition, the judge before whom the accusation was made struck the accusation from the
record and sanctioned her lawyers for filing it. One of her own lawyers then acknowledged that

9 66

his client was “wrong” “simply wrong,” and her other lawyers formally withdrew the accusation,

admitting it was a “mistake.”

Not only did Virginia Roberts lie about me, she lied about Al and Tipper Gore and President Bill
Clinton claiming that she met the three of them on Jeffrey Epstein’s island — a claim refuted by
secret service records that established that none of the three were on that island during that
period of time.

There is evidence that directly proves I was framed. These include emails between Roberts and a
journalist, a book manuscript by Roberts and a legal brief that are smoking guns showing that I
was “deliberately framed for financial reasons.” These exculpatory documents have been sealed
by Roberts’ lawyers and I am seeking to make them public.

Roberts’ closest friend told me that Roberts told her she “felt pressure to go after [Dershowitz]”
in order to obtain money from Leslie Wexner and that Roberts had never previously included
me among the people with whom she claimed to have had sex. I have a tape recording of this
conversation.

Not surprisingly, Roberts made her false claims against me only in court documents that
immunize her from being sued for defamation. When she was interviewed by the Miami Herald,
she refused to repeat her false allegations outside of court. The Crimson did not ask her directly
to repeat her false allegations to them. As a matter of journalistic ethics, The Crimson should
not have published an accusation without interviewing the accuser on the record. I now
challenge Roberts to repeat her false accusations to The Crimson or other media, so that I can
sue her for defamation and let a jury decide — after seeing all the evidence including the emails
and book manuscript — who is telling the truth and who is lying.

I want an investigation or trial to finally prove that Roberts made up the entire story, so that it
can finally be put to rest.

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017791
"
TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022952.txt,"﻿	It’s an absurdly vast house, among the largest in Manhattan, but the dining room is windowless, creating a hermetic or stop-time sense, broken only by the household help ferrying in time-of-day-appropriate foods and beverages. 
     In sweatshirt, draw-string pants, palm beach slippers, and half glasses, Jeffrey Epstein sits at the head of the table. He spends most of his day in the dining room, remote from the world, in front of a lap top and beside a row of reading glasses (there are a lot of them in case, apparently, he misplaces a pair, but being quite meticulous he never does) advising, or instructing, a startling collection of the rich and powerful, slotted in on an hourly basis. 
     The apartness of Epstein’s dining room might seem to offer some buffer in this leveled, angry age for a super rich man who attends to even more fabulously rich men. On the other hand, with the paparazzi often posted near by, the outside world seem dangerously close too. (Once I arrived for a visit and found several police cars blocking the street and thought the worst—they’d come for Jeffrey. But it was a security detail for a controversial head of state, also visiting him.)
     His subject for the morning is “hyper wealth.” His subject is always wealth—how capital should react to the given global political, economic, and cultural moment. The otherwise baronial dining room is disturbed by an ever-present white board, on which he scribbles calculations and notes, conducting perhaps the world’s most rarified economics class, often to many of the world’s most rarefied economists. 
     Epstein’s apartness or parallel life in part reflects much of the other-worldly characteristics of the wealth revolution that began in the late 1970s and that continued through the Wall Street boom of the 80s, the tech boom of the 90s—surviving, to often bitter attack, the banking crisis—and that has now seen the emergence of the international billionaire and oligarch class. 
     Epstein’s way to riches was to become a student of such wealth as it has grown to an unanticipated and disruptive scale. His stock in trade is not precisely the making of money, but the issues that arise when money, at a heretofore unimaginable rate, makes itself, altering many basic economic, social and personal calculations. 
     He recounts a dinner he had two nights before. It is, like much of what he does, a conspiracist’s fantasy. The six men at this dinner, all technology entrepreneurs, represented, together, several hundred billion dollars. 
     “In the past, only governments had this kind of money,” says Epstein making something of a pedagogical point, “money of a reality altering scale. In fact, it used to be that the rich, reaching a certain point of philanthropy, merely hoped to help make the world a better place, now they want to change the world. Rockefeller and Carnegie were, as examples of social-engineering philanthropy, unique. They alone had such resources and will. Now you have legions of people who have to give away vastly larger fortunes than Rockefeller or Carnegie had at their disposal, or might even have imagined. 
     “Except that it’s actually hard to give away this kind of dough, without causing more problems than you’re solving.” 
     Epstein’s long-time business thesis is that the rich know very little about their money. They may know about their own businesses, but the great sums that are the result are an ultimate after thought and demand an entirely different sort of intellectual discipline. The Forbes 400, says Epstein, not immune to an amount of wonder, increased their wealth by $500 billion last year, meaning, in effect, that every American billionaire makes more than another billion every year. And, points out the 62-year-old Epstein, they will almost all be dead in 30 years, most well before that, meaning $2 trillion, compounding everyday, will have to be given away. “So, to understand the future, what you have to begin to do is follow the money, not in Watergate-like terms backwards, as in who has gotten it, but forwards to where it will go and who will get it.”
     Epstein can find himself echoing aspects of Thomas Piketty on the inequities of the accumulation of wealth (“the divide is between people with assets, which appreciate, and people without assets, who fail to advance—that is, of course, the miracle of compounded interest”), except for the fact that Epstein, knowing the rich, understands a curious point that Piketty doesn’t: “Nobody, nobody, wants to give it to their children. Everybody now has the modern appreciation that one of the curses of great wealth is that it makes your kids weird and fucked up.”
     Epstein’s position in this private allotment of a decent fraction of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product is not as philanthropist but as a higher sort of banker or guru or brain—a rich whisperer—making him, in addition to rich himself, arguably, among the most influential people you’ve never heard of. 
     Though, likely, you have heard of him, but not for his prowess with high abstraction, but for a scandal of such luridness that he is, for a great many, the poster child of the lawlessness of privilege and wealth, and for a much smaller circle, the poster child for what can happen when you become the target of a resentful world. He is that Epstein, according to the Daily Mail—among his most dogged press antagonists—“one of America’s most notorious sex offenders.”
     
     Epstein might be among the most reviled men of the time, and yet the mighty and powerful, apparently evaluating the nature of disgrace on their own terms, beat a path to his door. It’s a fantastic conclave of influence in his dining room: financiers, billionaires, heads of state, economic ministers.
     He surely represents the kind of insiderism that is mostly just a figment in outsider’s fantasies. Except for the fact that, straining credulity, Epstein is real. His is an ultimate sort of fantasy of power, wealth, and secrecy. (Many, in fact, have accused him of making up his own fantasy.) Were the International Jewish conspiracy to actually exist, it might be here in his dining room (while not everybody in his circle is Jewish, it’s a recognizable sort of hamish atmosphere, with an acknowledgement that a generally “think Yiddish” point of view prevails).
     It often crosses my mind, when I am invited here, that I must have made a Faustian bargain—so Faustian that I am not even aware of it. (In 2004, when the then owners of this magazine put it up for sale, I was involved with a group trying to buy it—an effort in which Epstein volunteered to invest $20 million. New York was subsequently sold to another wealthy investor.) Without ever being asked to keep what I have heard here off the record, I’ve willingly done so, least I not be invited back. And, too, to protect him. Who would understand Jeffrey? Who could explain him? 
     Certainly Epstein’s past encounters with the press (and in many ways with the entire outside world) have been about as disastrous as any could be, helping to open a Pandora’s box of lifestyle vulnerabilities that sorely, unluckily, and—in the eyes of many, in the eyes of most, rightly—offended time and place and sent him to prison. 
     And yet here he is, in his 50,000 square foot mansion, despite his sex offender status, dispensing advice to world leaders and business titans. 
     It is Bill Gates who for some time has been prodding Epstein to begin a process of public rehabilitation. Epstein has been advising Gates on a vast expansion and restructuring of the Gates foundation. Hence, as part of an effort to get “out in front” of the unfavorable notice that might be expected to greet Gates’ public association with Epstein, I, as a favored journalist, have been given a degree of carte blanche to write about Epstein’s life, with the hope, on Epstein’s part, that the high regard in which he is held by many highly regarded people might leaven his reputation. And with the hope on my part of learning more about how and if the rich are different than you and me (although we can fairly dispense with the if).

     Then, just before the New Year, Epstein forwarded me a heads-up email that Alan Dershowtiz, one of Epstein’s long time friends—they have a bickering brotherly relationship—and occasional legal advisors, had received from a reporter at Politico and forwarded to Epstein. The Politico reporter had been following Epstein-related court filings (there is a determined contingent of Epstein reporters) and found a new one added to an old law suit with some rather jaw-dropping, if not preposterous, recent allegations.
     This seemed to me to be merely a desperate, even comic-book, filing—just a lawyer trying to revive a dead case. 
     Eight years after the original filing, a Florida lawyer was now seeking to add new plaintiffs to the old case, accompanied by sensational allegations connecting a catch-all of bold-faced names associated with Epstein, including Dershowtiz and Britain’s Prince Andrew, to a “sex slave” ring.
     I responded to Epstein that I doubted this would be seen as credible by anyone.
     Epstein, who sometimes seems to have an out-of-body attitude to his own fate and bad press, said he thought it might be “quite a show.”
     Two days later, the Daily Mail, which has become the effective ground zero in the English language for anti-privilege, and moral opprobrium (the more salacious the better), and whose editor Paul Dacre has a long time feud with Prince Andrew, put the story on its front page. (Epstein also has a long relationship with the family of disgraced press baron, Robert Maxwell, another reliable target of the British press.) Flimsy and far-fetched court filings in the U.S. by settlement-hungry plaintiffs might be discounted by skeptical U.S. reporters, but, the U.K. media, constrained by onerous rules about legal proceedings in the U.K., promptly went into tabloid frenzy (even the normally sniffy Guardian, in full anti- royal and anti- billionaire fever, joined the tabloid show) and effectively exported the story back to the U.S., where Epstein’s connection to Bill Clinton, and, hence as a shadow over Hillary, became the news. 
     “I told you,” said Epstein.
     
     There is Epstein in his inner world, trying, quite ostrich like, not to look out. Little beyond his strict realm seems palatable or even in a sense familiar to him. He’s a foreigner out here. Not too long ago, I met him for lunch in the West Village, the first time in more than ten years, he pointed out, he’d been to lunch in a restaurant (a not particularly pleasant experience for him and we were out in 30 minutes). 
     Then there is the outside world pressed to the glass, appalled and titillated by the monster inside the big house—a kind of Boo Radley of the Upper East Side. I have taken friends by the Epstein mansion, and the reaction to its other-worldly size in Manhattan is almost always the same: an incredulous guffaw. Press accounts, seldom supplying new information, ever recycle and repeat the mysterious (and monstrous) billionaire mythology, with brief glimpses of him stepping out of the house (the same photos endlessly republished), and the assumption of depravity inside.
     In fact, the life in the house, without wife or children or conventional domestic demeanor, in some way conforms to the most scripted fantasies: a life somewhere between Daddy Warbucks and Eyes Wide Shut.
     The domesticity of the house, and the background of Epstein’s problems, centers around a group of young women who act as his support staff and companions. Some have worked for him for many years, marrying, having children, and continuing as part of his business and household infrastructure. One woman, on an afternoon when I was there, recently married, had just returned from an around the world honeymoon that Epstein had arranged for her. Some are his romantic interests. His present girl friend is in dental school. One former girlfriend, Eva Andersson Dubin, a Swedish model and Miss Universe finalist, became a doctor and married hedge funder Glen Dubin and together they finance the Dubin Breast Center at Mount Sinai Hospital. Most at one time will travel with him to his floating residences—the ranch in New Mexico, the vast apartment in Paris, the Island in the Caribbean, the house in Palm Beach. 
     This is so outside of conventional living or staffing or romantic relationships that it is hard to describe in a straightforward way. It sometimes seems part of Epstein’s implicit challenge: not just look at me, but do you dare look at me? Or it seems he is just oblivious to what other’s are thinking. A sort of fatal tone deafness. 
     Epstein’s young women mingle freely with his powerful guests, not so much as hostess or, in tabloid language, harem-like (or as “sex slaves”), but often as attentive students (that, of course, might be regarded as having its own fetish-like attraction).
     Once, Epstein invited me to sit in on a day of presentations to him in his dining room by various “quants.” Quant theory involves making investments based solely on mathematical and statistical models. This method can often have uncanny predictive powers. But the problem is it doesn’t scale very well—the market, having discerned a pattern of successful investing, quickly copies and discounts the advantage. Epstein’s effort was to identify a dozen or so promising algorithms (each quant is effectively hawking his secret sauce algorithm) and invest up to $5 million with each. (Epstein’s advantage here, over traditional investment firms, is that he was proposing to do this without needing to own the algorithm itself, the manner in which many firms operate to the disadvantage of the quants.) I knew paltry little about this and so rather found myself identifying with the young women to whom Epstein was explaining the basic math and mechanics. (Epstein demands a certain amount of pedagogical attention in return for a wealth of information.)
     Hefnerian prurience becomes quite businesslike: poised young women in a mansion on the Upper East Side with various office responsibilities—really not that different from any of the art galleries in the surrounding neighborhood. 
     The Epstein house/office is, not unlike many nearby galleries, an ultimate club, a private reserve, a place of shared and valuable information—indeed, the kind of place, that, even for the most ardent conspiracists, might seem a little too movie-like. And while it’s hard to explain why, given the radio-active nature of Epstein’s disgrace, the rich and powerful still beat a path to his door, it’s also notable in the fixed hierarchy of who comes to whose turf, that everybody, when they went to see Epstein, comes to him.
     A week in late September, U.N. week as it happened, began, on Sunday, at Epstein’s house with a colloquial for billionaires—Gates, TK, TK, TK.  
     Epstein, preternaturally responsive to both the price of oil and to the politics of the middle of East, entertained that evening a delegation from Qatar, including Sheikh Hamad, the foreign minister. Hamad, indeed, lives across the street in a similarly furnished house—he and Epstein have the same decorator. Epstein, in his relaxed and amused demeanor, kept prodding: “Why are you financing the bad guys? What do you get out of that?” 
     The Qatarians, in some mild diplomatic discomfort, seemed most worried that their bid for the World Cup might be compromised by bribery allegations.
     At 9:00 next morning, Epstein is joined for breakfast in the dining room by Reid Weingarten, who’s represented among other fat cats in trouble, Worldcom’s Bernie Ebbers and Goldman Sach’s Lloyd Blankfein. Weingarten, horse, with a cold, and dejected, is just back from a failed defense of former Connecticut Governor John Rowland. (Epstein: “You actually believe he was getting fucked?” Weingarten: “From minute one. I’m not a virgin. But his was the worst I’ve ever seen. It was like an assassination.)
     After a short discussion of the Qartarian’s visit—Epstein is serving the chocolate, made from pistachios grown on the Shakes farm—and speculation about who actually controls ISIS, I am asked to leave the room. Twenty minutes later, after what ever business has been transacted or particular confidences, shared I am asked back in.
     “Why?” I asked Weingarten, when Epstein briefly steps out of the room, “do some many people keep coming back here, everything considered.”
     “Why we camp out here? I find that question as mysterious as you do,” says Weingarten.
     Shortly after Weingarten leaves, Epstein tells me that Eric Holder will resign by the end of the week—which he does.
     Epstein summons in the next person cooling his heels in the ante-room. It’s a young man named Brook Pierce, a former child actor, and dotcom high flyer—a principle in a gaming company called DEN, a notorious dotcom burnout, with its own sex scandal—who is now a leading investor in Bitcoin. He describe himself as the “the most active investor in the field.”
     And, indeed, is the first clear explanation I actually get about Bitcoin. It is so good that Epstein stops him and checks to see if his next appointment is here. And seconds later, Larry Summers, the former treasury secretary and President of Harvard, enters the dining room. Summers, off Diet Coke, digs deep into the Shakes chocolates, focuses in on the Bitcoin investor.
     “Okay,” he says, after listening for a bit, “I have opportunities here. But an additional feature of my decision problem roughly speaking is that the worst that could happen to you is that you could lose all the money you put into it. Whereas, I could go—I mean I don’t look that great now—but I could go from being seen as a figure of some probity and some intelligence to being a figure of much less intelligence and much less probity…”
     “Well,” says Pierce in what in some dramatic understatement, “you are going to have some low quality characters playing the space…”
That evening, there is a small cocktail party, which includes the former Prime Minister of Australian, Kevin Rudd, and Thorbjørn Jaglandthe head of the Noble Peace Prize Committee, who offers an affable, but general scathing, critique of U.S. diplomacy (and a brief defense of Obama’s Peace Prize award) and to whom Epstein offers a ride back to Europe on his jet. 
     The next morning, it’s Ehud Barack, the former Israeli Prime Minister and Israel, for breakfast. Barack is, over his omlet, able to defend both Obama and Putin. Then Kathy Ruemmler, who has just left her job as White House Counsel joins. She is already in the mix as a possible next attorney general, but, in fact, will withdraw from consideration in part to work with Epstein. 
     Larry Summers wife, Elisa New, drops by. She teaches Americna poetry at Harvard and is putting together a proposal for a series on poetry that WGBH in Boston may produce and Epstein is advising on where she might go for added support (he also makes mince meat of her budget). 
     MORE…TK
     
     Perhaps it’s just the ultimate feminist nightmare: Men (and a few opportunistic women) continue to come to Epstein’s because, no matter their public bows to modern manners, they simply don’t care that he offends every aspect of feminist sensibility; when it comes to power, feminism doesn’t count.
     Or, it’s a guilty pleasure. People who know Jeffrey exchange “Jeffrey” stories. “That’s Jeffrey,” says Mort Zuckerman, the real estate billionaire and publisher of the Daily News (ever vitriolic in its coverage of Epstein), with a twinkle in his eye and obvious enjoyment, to tales of Epstein escapades. It is an outréness that Epstein seems delighted to cultivate. In Epstein’s Paris apartment, 20,000 square feet on the Avenue Foch, a neighborhood otherwise occupied by foreign potentates, there is a stuffed baby elephant in his living room—that is, the elephant in the room. The single book on his bedside table is Lotlita (he is, beyond the joke, a great Nobokov fan).
     Or, in a more sophisticated view, it’s a two tier understanding of the world. There is a media version of the world, which most of us live in and largely accept, and are certainly influenced by. And then there are those people who live in the media itself and therefore know that it’s mostly bunk. If the media says it, as likely some version of the opposite is true. I might guess too that for many of his visitors there’s an order of identification: there but for the grace of God. Any hyper-prominent person might, at any time, run afoul of prosecutors, the political moment, the media, or the Internet hoi polloi. 
     Epstein is the Dreyfus of the rich.
     And then there is the glue of wealth. Once, at lunch in the Epstein dinning room with Bill Richardson, the former Governor of New Mexico, and past Presidential aspirant, when Epstein left the room for a few minutes, I asked the obvious question, the one everybody asks each other, “How did you meet Jeffrey?” Richardson seemed surprised: “Jeffrey,” he said, as though stating what should have been perfectly obvious, “is the biggest landowner in New Mexico.”
     And then there is Epstein’s yet more structural explanation as to why after prison and with continuing tabloid infamy he can maintain his valued place. It comes back, not unexpectedly, to the nature or the needs of money:
     “At a certain level of finance, almost everyone is allied with an institutional interest. You are part of government, or you want to be in government, or you are connected to a bank or other portfolio, or you have key relationships with certain corporations or industries. Because of my situation, I have none of that. I have no institutional bona fides which makes me in some sense one of the few independent sources of information and actual honest brokers. That’s the usefulness of disgrace.”
     And then there is too, that he is right. Since I began working on this piece in September, Epstein predictions about the price of oil, the Euro, and the Danish Krone have all born out.
     And something else, which perhaps also surely accounts for Epstein’s continuing relationships with the rich and powerful. 
     Most everyone who is now of a certain age and certain ambition and certain status grew up in, and found they were temperamentally suited to the new age of wealth that started in the late 1970s. A meritocracy on steroids, or, as Vanity Fair would baldly and ingratiatingly dub it, the new establishment, an increasingly parallel world, a self-invented one, at further and further remove from the ordinary one. In some sense, Epstein is just one version, picaresque, as well as louche, of this shared story. 
     
     Epstein was born in 1953 in Coney Island. His father worked for the city’s Parks Department. His mother was a housewife. He has a younger brother, Mark. Epstein was distinguished by little other than his math talents. The captain of the math team at Lafayette High school in Bensonhurst, goes on to Cooper Union where the tuition is free. He drops out after two years and begins taking classes at the NYU’s Courant Institute of Mathematics. Then, without a college degree, hence by slight of hand or deft misrepresentation, gets a job teaching math and physics at Dalton in 1974.
     It’s his first exposure to the wealthy. They have, he concludes, just as many problems as the people in Coney Island, just different ones, almost invariably involving divorce and money. “I found it interesting as a science experiment,” he recalled not long ago as we chatted about his life. “It did not really involve me. I could just stand back and watch.”
     Dalton fathers were attracted to him. Punch Sulzberger, the publisher of the New York Times, and father of one of Epstein’s students (Cynthia, the half sister of the Times’ current publisher), tried to recruit Epstein to come to the Times. Epstein recounts a story of riding with Sulzberger in his wood paneled station wagon to the his country estate and Sulzberger talking to the chauffer on a phone from the backseat to the front. 
     In 1976, another Dalton father, asking “wouldn’t you rather be rich than be a teacher?” introduced him to Bear Stern’s chief Ace Greenberg, a conversation Epstein recounts as this:
     Greenberg: “Everyone tells me you are super smart in math and your Jewish and you’re hungry…so why don’t you start working here tomorrow?”
     Epstein: “What?”
     Greenberg: “If your supposed to be so fucking smart why don’t you understand English?”
     Epstein: “Ok. Count me in.”
     Hence, Epstein, like many in the late 70s, arrived on Wall Street.
     As will happen to a generation of others, by the fortuitous luck of being on Wall Street at that point in time, Epstein is transformed by a new, much faster, form of upward mobility. With a facility for getting along with rich men, he transforms at an even faster rate than others being quickly transformed. 
     He moves into a new building at 66th Street and Second Avenue—the Maxwell Plum era when the 60s on Second was the glamour address—a building full of “actresses, models, and super stars.” 
     And yet, the Wolf of Wall Street model may be off here. If on one side of Wall Street there were the salesmen, on the other side there was a new level of acute abstraction and the people who could embrace it.
      “In the past,” says Epstein, “investing was all about reputations and relationships. You invested in a company on the basis of who was running it. Did they have integrity? Were they married? Good family men? It was a 50’s mentality. But in the mid 70s options started to be traded. In essence, the first formal derivatives. The movement of this instrument is not directly attached to the stock price. The world of investing began turning from relationships to math. In a sense I didn’t really make money as much as I did create it. This was intellectual activity of a fairly high order.”
     Still, in Wolf of Wall Street-ish fashion, he meets Helen Gurley Brown and she makes him Cosmopolitan Magazine’s Bachelor of the Month in 1980.
     “What,” I ask, “was your social life like?”
     “Well, I was a playboy.”
     “That’s all? Not looking to get married?”
     “No. Never. I never wanted to get married. I wanted sex. I liked women. I wanted freedom. I was attracted to the rich because of their freedom. But I wanted also to avoid their burdens. And I didn’t want to hide. I didn’t want to be a hypocrite. I wanted to be free.”
     His rise at Bear Sterns was a steep one. And he soon became the protégée of Jimmy Cayne (also hired by Ace Greenberg on whim—he met him in a bridge game—who would go on to run Bear and to lose his fortune in Bear’s 2006 collapse). Epstein’s leave taking or ouster from Bear is the result of politics, envy, overreaching, or a securities violation, or…unclear. But, no matter, he leaves in 1982 with billionaire clients, including Marvin Davis, a real estate developer who owns Twentieth Century Fox, and Herb Seigel, a major media investor in the 1980s. Epstein is dating Morgan Fairchild, a television star in the 1980s rich-family soap operas, Dallas and Falcon Crest. 
     Now begins the Concorde phase of his life—and the Concorde phase of the 1980s. If the 80s are happening pell mell in New York, they’re happening at double time and catch up speed in London. Epstein is 30 years old and living, in Lifestyle of the Rich and Famous fashion, at English shooting parties at country estates with Saturday night black tie dinners, where he’s meeting the great families of Europe. It’s Euro trash pageantry.
     “I don’t take it seriously,” Epstein recounts. “I’m not caught up in it. I’m not trying to make a billion dollars. There is no ultimate goal. Or its just to meet smart people, interesting people. But no long-range plans. Often no short-term plans either. I would head to Kennedy and, on the theory that most important events are serendipitous, I wouldn’t decided where I was going until I got there.”
	At the same time, he is developing a perception, or, at least a market differentiation: wealth was not a fixed issue. The super wealthy had different problems than the very wealthy. Dealing with a billion dollars was different from dealing with $100 million:
     “While if you had a billion dollars the last thing you should be worried about was money, in truth money was what you most worried about. How to make more of it, how to give away more of it, how to protect you children from it, how to hide it from your wife, how to avoid paying taxes on it. The traditional wealth services structure, an accountant, and investment advisor, a personal lawyer, and an idiot brother-in-law, became hopelessly outdated as amounts geometrically increased. 
	“You can’t spend a billion dollars, you can just relocate it to a different investment class. And you can’t give away a billion dollars without a vast staff, in effect going into the business of giving away money, yet another business you are unlikely to know anything about.”
	At just about this point in the narrative, the questions or the incredulity begins in social circles and eventually in the media. He begins to acquire the major symbols of riches but does this without position, public holdings, or obvious paper trails. In essence, the formulation is, how can a person have enough money to merit increasing attention, but no clear way of having gotten it. Epstein gets stuck in that tautology. He may be rich, but he is without institutional protection or bona fides. He is a questionable substrata of wealth. He’s a freelancer.
     In the Epstein telling, he’s representing a series of vastly wealthy people and families. 
     In a sense, he’s their instrument, doing their bidding, and for a period describes himself as recovering money, as something like a private detective. If early in his career he might seem like a sort of George Peppard (there’s a resemblance) in Breakfast at Tiffany’s, a charming hustler, later he’s George Peppard in Banacek, a smart and astute operator.
     He steps up his game and his relationship with the rich. He’s not just doing their bidding or their investing, he’s helping them to imagine the ambitions of their wealth. They’ve satisfied their business dreams. Now there are the separate challenges and possibilities of their actual wealth.
     In essence, the response to this, as he becomes more public, as a function of envy and media, is “bullshit.” True, there is no clear alternate narrative. No one is accusing him of anything, accept, sometimes, guilt by association. (In addition to Robert Maxwell, who will be accused of fraud, there’s Steven Hoffenberg, briefly a New York high flyer, who went to jail for a Ponzi, for whom Epstein acted as a consultant.) But the characterization persist: if it’s not clear, it must be murky. Sure, Goldman Sachs partners and tech fortunes, but what to make of a Coney Island, Zelig-like no-namer? 
	In 1994, just at the moment when Prince Charles is on television acknowledging his love for Camilla Parker Bowles, Jeffrey Epstein is sitting next to Princess Diana at a dinner at the Serpentine Galley in London (Diana is wearing her “revenge” dress that evening). Graydon Carter, into his second years as editor of Vanity Fair, is also at the dinner. Epstein’s rise and Carter’s rise are not, with a little critical interpretation, that different. Both are a function of the age of new money, and both are helped by strategic relationships with the exceptionally wealthy. To say that Epstein, sitting next to the Princess, sticks in Carter’s craw would be an understatement. Epstein becomes one of the “what do you know about him” figures in Carter’s gossip trail—a story waiting to happen. A variety of the gossip that begins to circulate about Epstein—for instance, that he secretly films his guests—is seeded by Carter, who once advised me not to go to Epstein’s house or accept a ride in his car least I risk being blackmail. (“For what?” I asked Carter. “For you have no idea,” said Carter.)
	Epstein is playing a cat and mouse game with his own growing wealth and influence. He is private and secretive, but grandly so. He joins the board of Rockefeller University. He’s suddenly on the Trilateral commission, that cabal of business people who fancy themselves, and who are fancied by conspiracy buffs, as running the world. He acquires, from his client Limited Founder Les Wexner, the larges private house in Manhattan. He buys an airplane. He buys another. He expands his holdings in New Mexico. He begins a Zanadu refurbishment of his Caribbean Island. He befriends Bill Clinton in his new after-office life.
	And that’s quite the fatal pairing. 
	The post-Monica Clinton, now having pardoned the on-the-lam financier Marc Rich, is suddenly being ferried around in the jet of…who exactly?
	The New York Post is the first to take formal media note of the Clinton-Epstein connection, hinting at a sex and money bromance. The instinctively private Epstein is not just increasingly exposed, but clearly curious about the nature of exposure. 
	I met Epstein around this time. Epstein has become a more and more active backer of advanced scientific research—ultimately he will donate $30 million to Harvard for a theoretical physics research center—and in 2002 he was taking a small group of scientists out to the TED conference in Monterey. The TED organizers invited various other TED participants, including me, to join the flight. A small group assembled at the private plan terminal, most of us unfamiliar with our benefactor, and as we headed in the direction of the discrete private plans we were gently pointed to our ride: Epstein’s 727. 
	It is some thoroughly updated drawing room set-up, all of us nervously ensconced in this luxury plane, waiting for our unknown host to arrive. Epstein, looking more like a Palm Beach bon vivant than it would have been possible to imagine anyone could, was accompanied by three young women. 
     It would be unlikely, outside of a men’s magazine fantasy of the luxe life, to located this in reality. Epstein’s attentions, taking time with each of his passengers, seemed impossible to account for. The quiet of the plane, engineered into acoustic perfection, seemed spooky. Epstein’s companions were witty, poised, helpful as well as powerfully alluring (as though stewardesses bygone times).
     At one point, sliding into the seat beside me, Geraldine Laybourne, then the head of the Nickelodeon network, whispered, with more awe than horror, “This could be the closest I’ve ever come to pure evil.” (One more thing about this trip: Google founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, came out to see the plane and, with a few other Googlers, literally ran whopping from one end of the plan to the other. Then they described for Epstein, in what I can not now remember as put on or entrepreneurial brainstorm, a brand extension in which they would market a line of Google bras with the Os as convenient cups.)
	Not long after this trip, Epstein’s assistant called to invite me for tea at his house in New York, where Epstein, with what seemed to me little understanding of the subject, began to ask me about media—the upside, downside, and nature of media coverage. This magazine was then soliciting him for a profile, as was Vanity Fair, who had assigned the British tabloid reporter, Vicki Ward, to the job.
	Both profiles pivot on the Clinton connection and detail the same quandary, how a man without clear institutional bona fides nevertheless achieves wealth and influence. Ward, who would more recently assert in the Daily Beast, that she was barred by Vanity Fair from writing about under-age sex evidence (a fact that could be read the other way: Vanity Fair, even looking to take down Epstein, did not find the evidence credible), went down a rabbit hole of possible questionable contacts who might or might not have been the source or sources for Epstein’s wealth, seemed to get no closer to an answer, beyond confirming her own sense of dubiousness.
	Epstein, sensing that he might be exposing himself, tried to stop the process (Ward, well known for an operatic view about her reporting exploits, says he threatened her), called Carter and said he was having second thoughts about being a public figure.
	 “Then you should live in a two bedroom apartment in Queens,” responded Carter.

	And then the troubles began. 
     Epstein, in man-who-can-have-everything fashion, has, for many years, ordered up a daily massage following his workout sessions.
	“Often these were massage massages,” says Epstein matter of factly, “but sometimes these were happy ending massages, especially in Palm Beach, where there are many massage parlors—‘Jack Shacks,’ they’re called—that do outcalls. There was no sex. An often there was no happy ending. Often I would be on the phone for the entire massage. There were however a lot of massages and a lot of girls, with one girl recommending others.”
	It is after Epstein’s round of publicity and widely touted association with Clinton, that the mother of one of the massage parlor girls who have gone to Epstein’s house (most of the girls return to Epstein’s house many times) calls the police. The place interview the girl, Saige Gonzales, who then supplies names of other girls. Some of whom are found to be younger than 18.
	In the end, the police track down 18 girls—nine who are under 18—who give depositions describing scenarios not terribly different from Epstein’s description above, except each is laid out in clinical, lurid, and near-identical detail—a cold and forceful Epstein demanding that unwitting juveniles (though they have come here for this very purpose) perform repulsive (or at least repulsively described) acts on him. (Although the nature of the allegations will dramatically grow, nobody at this point alleges that he did anything to them.) 
	Epstein, vastly raising the stakes, calls Dershowitz, who flies into Palm Beach to put the local authorities in their place—alienating Palm Beach officialdom—and, doubling down on the profile of the case, bringing in Roy Black the famous criminal attorney who defended William Kennedy Smith in his rape trial in Palm Beach.
	Here’s the narrative: the shadowy rich man, friend of the louche and disgraced President, at all times surrounded by a retinue of gorgeous retainers doing his bidding, is now found to have gathered a network of wrong-side-of-the-tracks Palm Beach girls to provide him with weird sexual services. (It somehow seems weirder that he doesn’t have sex with them.)
	Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter is reported to say: “This is bigger than Rush Limbaugh,” who, in a storm of publicity, has just been arrested in Palm Beach for possession of controlled drugs. 
	On one side are some of the nation’s most powerful defense attorneys (who, increasingly, seem more stumblebum than effective), on the other side, a round-up of hapless girls, with sensational tales of perversion and infamy (in the telling they are not so much sex workers, as Dickensian victims), relatively speaking giving the Palm Beach authorities the choice between utter capitulation to the powerful or standing on the side of the exploited and powerless.
	Still, with a critical eye, it also quite appears to be a straightforward tale of prostitution. And even though some of the girls are minors,, age is not a distinguishing factor in a prostitution charge in Florida, nor in most places (in New York, for instance, at this time soliciting sex with anyone over the age of is a class D misdemeanor calling for a 100 dollars fine).
	In fact, Saige Gonzales told the police that she lied about being 18 because otherwise she knew she would not have been admitted to the house.
	The local sex crimes prosecutor, Lana Belhalevic, interviews the girls and determines that the offense is solely related to prostitution.
     Dershowitz rejects a series of lower-level plea deals and Palm Beach District Attorney Barry Krischer takes the unusual step of empanelling a grand jury, which returns with a recommendation of a single count of soliciting a prostitute—a charge without jail time. (And Epstein can apply to have his record expunged after a year.) 
     At which point, Reiter, the police chief, at odds with the District Attorney’s office, recruits the involvement of the FBI. This is of course the Bush-era FBI and Epstein presents quite the Clinton-connected scandal. Still, solicitation, even of a minor, is not a federal crime. The FBI’s hits on the novel interpretation that if Internet solicitation can be considered interstate commerce, so can telephone solicitation, permitting them to begin a deep dive investigation into Epstein’s friends, many of whom receive subpoenas and who are threatened with prosecution as a party to Epstein’s actions.
     It’s all quite in the eye of the beholder: On the one end, Epstein is paying for sex acts (Epstein paid $200 for a massage with or without happy ending), on the other, he is abusing teenage girls. Epstein finds himself caught in an inescapable moral quandary: how can a girl not old enough to vote be a prostitute? And yet, many girls not old enough to vote are prostitutes. 
     Compounding Epstein’s predicament, the world outside of his carefully constructed and controlled environment is someplace that he seems not just ill-equipped to handle but in which he seems to be blindly grouping about (i.e. he’s totally tone deaf). I visited him once during this time and found him weighing the conflicting advice of some of the most vaunted and egomaniacal lawyers (along with Dershowitz and Black, celebrity criminal attorney, Gerald Lefcourt, and Clinton prosecutor, Ken Starr) of the day—anyone with new advice, Epstein seemed to hire—as well as a catchall of the leading crisis managers, who he seemed to retain at will, all wrangling for fees and primacy. If it was a Dickensian world, he was caught in its legal system. 
     Certainly, the upshot of his dealings with the Justice Department seem to involve a farce-like logic. The government threatens to prosecute him (with the possibility of a 10-year sentence) and various friends, associates, and lovers, or offers an ass-backwards sort of deal in which Epstein has to go to the Palm Beach authorities and convince them to charge him with an offense that will send him to jail and get him a sex offender status. Except that a solicitation charge won’t produce that result. Therefore he has to agree also to a procurement or pimping charge (even though he has paid money, not received it—the sine qua non of pimping). What’s more, he has to agree to pay the legal fees of any of the girls who want to sue him—and, not to defend himself in their suits—forcing him to settle with each of the girls for what are reportedly high 6-figure sums or more. 
     He’s sentence to jail in 2008 for 18 months and serves 13.
     This hardly ends the legal catch all. Epstein's butler, Alfredo Rodriguez, steals and tries to sell an alleged journal or calendar with Epstein’s activities—but he tries to sell it to an undercover agent. Rodriguez is sentenced to 18 months in jail on a charge of theft and of withholding evidence. Scott Rothstein, a lawyer whose firm represented additional girls in their suits against Epstein, also goes to jail for recruiting investors to pay for these suits on the fraudulent basis that settlements had already been reached.
     Then, Brad Edwards, Rothstein’s former partner, sues the government in 2008 for abridging their rights under the Victim Rights Act (under which victims have the right to be consulted). In 2014, tries to ad Virginia Roberts, one of the original complainants, who has previously settled with Epstein, to the long-running suit—and is now, with Edwards, further suing him for $50,000,000.
     Roberts who has been the most vocal of the accusers, with the Daily Mail being her prime outlet, emerges now, more than ten years after the fact, with what is billed as a memoir of her “sex slavery” with Epstein, written ten years after the fact. She names a number of people as being at Epstein’s Island home, including Clinton and Al Gore and his wife, who Epstein insists were never there—proof available through secret service records.
     It is hard to find a more hyperbolic intersection of media and lawyers then in Epstein’s case. 
     Edwards, over the six years of his law suit, tries to depose Clinton, Donald Trump, and Dershowitz—almost all of his targets coming directly from the original Vanity Fair and New York Magazine articles about Epstein.
     In addition to Prince Andrew as a British hot button, first connected to Epstein through Roberts’ interview with the Daily Mail in 2010, Clinton takes on a new role as Hillary spoiler through his connection, real or imagined, to Epstein and sex slaves.
     The world cleanly divides, with Epstein (and friends) behind secure walls—looking out at an angry and uncomprehending world—and the Mail and social media and upholders of new norms, seeing Epstein as a useful and terrible symbol and baying for his blood. 
     He is all bad things rolled into one: the financier whose wealth is a product of abstraction rather than work; a rich middle-age white man who not only parades his wealth and entitlement, but has a Peter Pan complex to boot; an unreconstructed sybarite and feminist nightmare; an insistent Playboy in a correct and prudish world; someone who somehow didn’t get the memo about vast changes in mores and culture.  
     When I suggested recently that one obvious way to blunt the animus is to get married, he said he would rather go back to jail.
     He is Calvin Harris’s song, It Was Acceptable in the 80s, come to life.
     And worse, although he has been jailed for 18 months and paid out what may be as much as $20 million, he seems somehow to have gotten away with it too—that worst sin of all.
     This is all, inevitably, a Gatsby-like story, except with none of the sentimentality or romantic longings accorded Gatsby—or at least that Nick Caraway and Fitzgerald accord him. Gatsby in New York Post and Daily Mail parlance would be a freaky financier too.
     And that partly is the issue, Jeffrey Epstein story isn’t one for black and white journalists. It’s a complicated story, real but necessarily fictional, a long-running cable series, perhaps, not an ordinary good-bad, right-wrong tale, but a premium one, compelling precisely because it is about all the ambitions and impulses that we are afraid of, not least of all because for many of us they exist within ourselves.

CONCLUSION

The FCPA was designed to prevent corrupt practices, protect investors,
and provide a fair playing field for those honest companies trying to win busi-
ness based on quality and price rather than bribes. Following Congress’ leader-
ship in enacting the FCPA 35 years ago, and through determined international
diplomatic and law enforcement efforts in the time since, laws like the FCPA
prohibiting foreign bribery have been enacted by most of the United States’
major trading partners.

This guide is designed to provide practical advice about, and useful in-
sights into, our enforcement considerations. For businesses desiring to com-
pete fairly in foreign markets, it is our goal to maximize those businesses’ ability
to comply with the FCPA in the most effective and efficient way suitable to their
business and the markets in which they operate. Through our ongoing efforts
with the U.S. and international business and legal communities and non-
governmental organizations, DOJ and SEC can continue effectively to protect

the integrity of our markets and reduce corruption around the world.

57. Again, both to conceal his relationship with Epstein and to discredit Roberts,
Dershowitz has repeatedly asserted that he was never in Epstein’s residence in the presence of
young women. As both Dershowitz and Epstein know, that assertion was also false. As Mr.
Rodriguez has confirmed, there were “also young ladies in the house at the time he [Dershowitz]
was there”. Mr. Rodriguez also confirmed that “Mr. Dershowitz was there” when “women came
to Mr. Epstein’s home to give a massage”. Mr. Rodriguez also confirmed that “Alan Dershowitz
was at the house” with “the local Palm Beach girls” who he was “told to call masseuses”,
although he did not himself know whether or not Dershowitz personally received a massage.

58. Maria Farmer was an employee of Epstein responsible for “manning the front
door at his New York mansion and keeping records of people who came to the home” (Exhibit
12, 92).

(a) Ms. Farmer “witnessed a number of school age girls coming to the house,
some of the young girls would be wearing their school uniforms”... who “then
would be escorted upstairs” (Exhibit 12, 3).

(b) Ms. Farmer was told these young girls “were interviewing for modeling
positions” even though “it did not seem credible to me that these young girls were
interviewing for modeling positions”. (Exhibit 12, { 3).

59. Ms. Farmer asserts that “Alan Dershowitz was an individual who came to visit
Epstein at his New York mansion a number of times when I was working for Epstein.
Dershowitz was very comfortable at the home and would come in and walk upstairs. On a
number of occasions I witnessed Dershowitz at the NY mansion going upstairs at the same time
there were young girls under the age of 18 who were present upstairs in the house” (Exhibit 12, J

4),

Ulla F Muller students attend a pep rally to roll out the school's Positive Be-
havior Support and Interventions initiative on Nov. 30 on St. Thomas.

Ulla F. Muller students
pledge good behavior

Ulla F Muller Elementary School
rolled out its Panther PRIDE Positive
Behavior Support and Interventions
(PBIS) initiative at a pep rally at the
school on Noy. 30. The fun, high-ener-
gy event laid the groundwork to teach
students the behaviors that make up a
positive school environment.

Administrators taught the students
the core values of the school through
PRIDE: P — positive behaviors, R —
respect, I — individual responsibility,
D — determination and E — excellence.
Students held signs depicting the val-
ues while Muller cheerleaders and the
Boys & Girls Club performed to rally
around the cause.

St. Thomas-St. John PBIS district
coach Darian Torrice-Hairston, who is
assigned to Ulla F. Muller Elementary,
praised the event. “As the PBIS dis-
trict coach for Ulla F Muller Elemen-
tary School, I have certainly caught
the Panther PRIDE! It was evident that
the administration, staff and students
exhibited their Positive Behavior, Re-
spect, Individual Responsibility, Deter-
mination and Excellence. PBIS and its
strategies are a priority at Muller and
they are working hard to implement the
program as it fits their school,” she said

Following the rally, teachers will
continue to instill the Panther PRIDE
principles in students on a daily ba-

OK UCH

sis as well as demonstrate what Pan-
ther PRIDE looks in each area of the
school. School staff will integrate the
Panther PRIDE language into daily
routines to encourage students to strive
for excellence.

The PBIS initiative is rooted in evi-
dence-based practices meant to increase
behavioral and academic outcomes by
improving school climate, preventing
problematic behavior, increasing learn-
ing time and promoting positive social
skills. Up to five members from each
school were selected to attend training
facilitated by PBIS coaches from the
state and district. School representatives
were tasked with producing positive be-
havior values unique to their institutions
and introduce them to teachers and stu-
dents. The goal of the PBIS initiative is
to focus on what the students do right,
rather than on what they do wrong to
help encourage the repetition of good
behavior.

As Muller Elementary continues
to support its students through PBIS,
additional phases of the initiative will
be introduced, such as a positive re-
ward system as well as ceremonies to
celebrate student and staff success.
With the help of the district coach,
Muller’s in-house PBIS task force
will guide the PBIS initiative to sup-
port the school.

Central High School students that participated in this year’s “Close Up Washington” trip to Washington, D.C., include

Ethaliah Henry, Jenna Malcomb, Nathan McGregor, Destiny Stout, Martisha Charles, Pellis Leonard, Franchel Ro-
driguez, Jayla Norman, Khaiel James and N’Quelle Golden. History teacher Ericka Hansen is the Close Up adviser.

Students get ‘close up’ with democracy

Students enrolled in the St. Croix
Central High School Close Up orga-
nization recently returned from the na-
tion’s capital where they attended the
Close Up Washington flagship pro-
gram. The group of 11 traveled Nov.
13-19 and joined with other Close Up
high school chapters from across the
country to learn about the American
democratic process.

Central High School history teacher

and Close Up advisor Ericka Hansen
took 10 students on the annual trip,
which gives high school students and
educators an inside look at their democ-
racy in action. Using the nation’s capital
as their living classroom, program par-
ticipants get a “close up” view of gov-
ernment processes and places that make
the district unique and functional.
Students visited the Washington
Monument, Martin Luther King Me-

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014511

morial, the Smithsonian, U.S. Capi-
tol, Arlington National Cemetery, the
White House and more. Students also
participated in political discussions
and met with members of Congress.
The program provided social activities
for the students in the evening.
Founded in 1971, the Close Up orga-
nization has provided more than 825,000
students with educational tours about
government and the political processes.

12 Feb 2013 -- Negotiations with Iran are
once more on the international agenda.
After an eight-month break, the five
permanent members of the UN Security
Council plus Germany -- the so-called
P5+1 -- are due to hold a meeting with Iran
on 25 February in Kazakhstan. What are
the prospects of success? In a nutshell, that
would seem to depend more on the climate
in Washington than in Tehran. Iran is
gesturing that it wants to negotiate, but
Washington has not yet signalled any
greater flexibility than in the past.

In a major speech in Tehran last Sunday,
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
addressed the United States: “Take your
guns out of the face of the Iranian nation
and I myself will negotiate with you,” he
declared. Meanwhile, the Iranian
ambassador to Paris told French officials
that, provided a work plan was agreed, Iran
was ready to allow inspectors of the
International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) to visit Parchin, a military facility
where Iran is suspected of having done
work on atomic weapons. Ahmadinejad
himself has said repeatedly that Iran was
ready to stop enriching uranium to 20% if
the international community agreed to
supply it instead to the Tehran research
reactor for the production of isotopes
needed to treat cancer patients.

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016306.txt,"Those are also the processes by which all new knowledge is created: They are how we
innovate, make progress, and create abstract understanding for its own sake. This is
human-level intelligence: thinking. It is also, or should be, the property we seek in
artificial general intelligence (AGI). Here I'll reserve the term “thinking” for processes
that can create understanding (explanatory knowledge). Popper’s argument implies that
all thinking entities—human or not, biological or artificial—must create such knowledge
in fundamentally the same way. Hence understanding any of those entities requires
traditionally human concepts such as culture, creativity, disobedience, and morality—
which justifies using the uniform term people to refer to all of them.

Misconceptions about human thinking and human origins are causing
corresponding misconceptions about AGI and how it might be created. For example, it is
generally assumed that the evolutionary pressure that produced modern humans was
provided by the benefits of having an ever greater ability to innovate. But if that were so,
there would have been rapid progress as soon as thinkers existed, just as we hope will
happen when we create artificial ones. If thinking had been commonly used for anything
other than imitating, it would also have been used for innovation, even if only by
accident, and innovation would have created opportunities for further innovation, and so
on exponentially. But instead, there were hundreds of thousands of years of near stasis.
Progress happened only on timescales much longer than people’s lifetimes, so in a typical
generation no one benefited from any progress. Therefore, the benefits of the ability to
innovate can have exerted little or no evolutionary pressure during the biological
evolution of the human brain. That evolution was driven by the benefits of preserving
cultural knowledge.

Benefits to the genes, that is. Culture, in that era, was a very mixed blessing to
individual people. Their cultural knowledge was indeed good enough to enable them to
outclass all other large organisms (they rapidly became the top predator, etc.), even
though it was still extremely crude and full of dangerous errors. But culture consists of
transmissible information—memes—and meme evolution, like gene evolution, tends to
favor high-fidelity transmission. And high-fidelity meme transmission necessarily entails
the suppression of attempted progress. So it would be a mistake to imagine an idyllic
society of hunter-gatherers, learning at the feet of their elders to recite the tribal lore by
heart, being content despite their lives of suffering and grueling labor and despite
expecting to die young and in agony of some nightmarish disease or parasite. Because,
even if they could conceive of nothing better than such a life, those torments were the
least of their troubles. For suppressing innovation in human minds (without killing them)
is a trick that can be achieved only by human action, and it is an ugly business.

This has to be seen in perspective. In the civilization of the West today, we are
shocked by the depravity of, for instance, parents who torture and murder their children
for not faithfully enacting cultural norms. And even more by societies and subcultures
where that is commonplace and considered honorable. And by dictatorships and
totalitarian states that persecute and murder entire harmless populations for behaving
differently. We are ashamed of our own recent past, in which it was honorable to beat
children bloody for mere disobedience. And before that, to own human beings as slaves.
And before that, to burn people to death for being infidels, to the applause and
amusement of the public. Steven Pinker’s book The Better Angels of our Nature contains
accounts of horrendous evils that were normal in historical civilizations. Yet even they

ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY Challenges of Artificial Intelligence:
Envisioning and Addressing Adverse Outcomes

5) Al, GOALS, AND INADVERTENT SIDE EFFECTS
Runaway Resource Monopoly (focus)
Self-improvement, Shift of Objectives

(Contributions from Shahar Avin, Sean O hEigeartaigh, Greg Cooper, and others)

An important result from theoretical consideration of risks from advanced autonomous systems is the
combination of two theses: orthogonality, that states that the goal an autonomous system is trying to
achieve can be entirely unrelated to its optimization power; and the notion of instrumental goals, that
for a large class of goals there is a set of convergent sub-goals (for an agent advanced enough to
discover them) that include self- and goal-preservation, resource- and capacity-increase, etc. (e.g., as
discussed in Bostrom, 2014). One suggestion for maintaining control over advanced systems that pose
risks from the combination of the above considerations is to limit the system's ability to access
increasing resources.

To make this situation concrete, consider an installation of a reinforcement-learning task scheduler for
a group of distributed data centres (e.g. Amazon Web Services). The goal of the algorithm is to
minimize time-to-execution of the tasks sent to the system by users. As part of its general scheduling
remit, it is also responsible for scheduling its own optimization sub-processes. The system has a clear
incentive to control an increasing set of compute resources, both for increasing its optimization power
and for achieving its main goal of reducing time-to-execution. Aware of these considerations, the
engineers of the system put in place various hard-coded limits on the amount of resources the system
can access, but these limits can be subverted through privilege escalation, masquerading as other
tasks, manipulation of users, physical control, etc.

POSSIBLE TRAJECTORY

e Ateam within a large tech corporation that has both ML development capacities and cloud
computing capacities is tasked with improving task scheduling on distributed compute resources.

e The team decides to deploy an out-of-the-box reinforcement learning package developed in-house
by the ML research teams.

e The inputs for the system are current loads on the different machines, the incoming tasks queue
(including priority for different tasks), and historical data on task runtimes. The output is an
assignment of tasks to machines. The loss function is the priority-weighted time-to-execute.

e The system performs well in a test environment (where the RL is running on a single cluster of
dedicated machines), and is rolled-out.

e A few months later, the system starts to run out of memory, and a tech-infrastructure engineer
decides to switch the system from a fixed-capacity setting to a load-balanced setting.

e Now an output of the system (assignment of the RL task to a machine) is coupled to the objective
of the machine (reducing runtime), and the resulting feedback loop drives the RL agent to spawn an
increasing amount of RL tasks with very high priority.

so... well, read on and learn more about what happened next.

I was honored to interview Berkowitz in early 2009. I really love it when I get the chance
to talk to boundary-breaking activists who were around before I was born, especially if
their domain is sexuality. I feel a combination of both exhilaration and despair during
these discussions -- exhilaration because I learn how far we've come, and despair
because I can see how we keep making the same mistakes again and again and again.

Interview with Richard Berkowitz, Star of Sex Positive and Icon of Safer Sex
Activism

Our second film at my awesome sex-positive film series was Sex Positive, a fascinating
documentary about the history of safer sex. I'll be honest: I was psyched about Sex
Positive from day one, long before I'd even seen it. It was the first film I chose for my
film list. In fact, the whole idea for the film series came out of a conversation I had with
Lisa (our lovely Hull-House Museum education coordinator) in which I said that I
wanted to see Sex Positive, and then added, There are so many sexuality movies I want
to see. You and I should have a regular movie night! She looked at me and said
thoughtfully, You know, I bet people besides us would come to that...

Sex Positive tells the story of Richard Berkowitz -- and how he was one of the first to
spread the word about safer sex in America. Berkowitz, a talented writer, started out as a
hot-blooded participant in the promiscuous gay bathhouse culture; later, he became an
S&M hustler (i.¢., a sex worker). When AIDS started decimating the gay community,
Berkowitz was instrumental in teaching his community (and the world) about safer sex.
As it became clear to some medical professionals that sexual promiscuity spread AIDS,
Berkowitz tried to tell the world about their findings. But there was a huge backlash
against him -- because in those days, the promiscuous bathhouse culture was seen by
many gay men as a huge part of identifying as gay and sex-positive... and anyone who
argued against it, or tried to modify it, was therefore cast by many people as sex-negative.

After we screened Sex Positive, I reviewed it on my blog, and Richard Berkowitz himself
read the review! He left a comment offering feedback, and I was so thrilled and honored
to hear from him that I emailed him right away. We talked a little bit, and met in person
last time I was in New York City -- and I practically begged him to let me interview him
by email. Here's the results: a discussion of Richard's history with S&M; what he thinks
about advocacy; his feelings about the gay community and its history; and where he finds
himself in his life right now.

Clarisse Thorn: In Sex Positive, you mention that you didn't initially think of
yourself as a BDSM type, but that you had partners who convinced you to do it. Do
you think you would have gotten into BDSM if you hadn't had partners pressuring
you to do it? Do you think you would have gotten into it if you hadn't been able to
make money at it?

Richard Berkowitz: I was filmed talking in three- to four-hour sessions over the course of
a year about difficult, often painful, personal history. At times I felt uncomfortable, I

approach does not necessarily need to be augmented with a prior complex of “ascent-safe” moral
imperatives at startup time. Developing an AGI with theory of mind and ethical reinforcement
learning capabilities as described (admittedly, no small task!) is all that is needed in this case
— the rest happens through training and experience as with any other moderate intelligence.

12.9.2 Superintelligent AI: Soft- Takeoff Scenarios

Soft takeoff scenarios are similar to capped-intelligence ones in that in both cases an AGI’s
progression from standard intelligence happens on a time scale which permits ongoing human
interaction during the ascent. However, in this case, as there is no predetermined limit on
intelligence, it is necessary to account for the possibility of a superintelligence emerging (though
of course this is not guaranteed). The soft takeoff model includes as subsets both controlled-
ascent models in which this rate of intelligence gain is achieved deliberately through software
constraints and/or meting-out of computational resources to the AGI, and uncontrolled-ascent
models in which there is coincidentally no hard takeoff despite no particular safeguards against
one. Both have similar properties with regard to ethical considerations:

1. Ethical considerations under this scenario include not only the usual interhuman ethical
concerns, but also the issue of how to convince a potential burgeoning superintelligence to:

a. Care about humanity in the first place, rather than ignore it

b. Benefit humanity, rather than destroy it

c. Elevate humanity to a higher level of intelligence, which even if an AGI decided to
proceed with requires finding the right balance amongst some enormous considerations:

i. Reconcile the aforementioned issues of ethical coherence and group volition, in a
manner which allows the most people to benefit (even if they don’t all do so in the
same way, based on their own preferences)

ii. Solve the problems of biological senescence, or focus on human uploading and the
preservation of the maintenance, support, and improvement infrastructure for inor-
ganic intelligence, or both

iii. Preserve individual identity and continuity of consciousness, or override it in favor
of continuity of knowledge and ease of harmonious integration, or both on a case-
by-case basis

2. The degree of danger is mitigated by the long timeline of ascent from mundane to super
intelligence, and time is not of the essence.

3. Learning that proceeds in a relatively human-like manner is entirely relevant to such human-
like intelligences, in their initial configurations. This means more interaction with and
imitative-reinforcement-corrective learning guided by humans, which has both positive and
negative possibilities.

12.9.3 Superintelligent AI: Hard-Takeoff Scenarios

“Hard takeoff” scenarios assume that upon reaching an unknown inflection point (the Singularity
point [Vin93, Kur06]) in the intellectual growth of an AGI, an extraordinarily rapid increase

The Wall Street Journal 
The Ayatollah Always Says No  
Editorial 
February 8, 2013 --The Farsi word for no is na h, which is easy enough 
to remember. Maybe even Joe Biden won't forget it the next time the U.S. 
tries to reach out diplomatically to Iran. 
We're speaking of the Administration's latest effort to come to terms with 
Tehran over its nuclear programs, which Mr. Biden made last weekend at 
the Munich Security Conference. The U.S. offer of direct bilateral talks, 
he said, stands, but it must be real and tangible. Iranian foreign minister 
Ali Akbar Salehi, who was also at the conference though he refused to 
meet with U.S. officials, called Mr. Biden's comments a step forward. 
Mr. Salehi's remark set the usual hearts aflutter that Iran is finally serious 
about a deal. But the optimism was brief On Thursday, Iran's Supreme 
Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei flatly rejected direct talks with the U.S. 
The U.S. is pointing a gun at Iran and wants us to talk to them, he said. 
Direct talks will not solve any problems. 
This isn't the first time Mr. Khamenei has played chaste Daphne to 
President Obama's infatuated Apollo. Just after becoming President in 
2009, Mr. Obama sent the Ayatollah two private letters and delivered a 
conciliatory speech for the Persian new year of Nowruz. Mr. Khamenei's 
answer: They chant the slogan of change but no change is seen in 
practice. He told a crowd chanting death to America that if a hand is 
stretched covered with a velvet glove but it is cast iron inside, that makes 
no sense. 
That was in March 2009. In October of that year the U.S. and its allies 
tentatively worked out a deal with Iranian negotiators to move some of 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028728 
their enriched uranium outside Iran. Western analysts were confident that 
Mr. Khamenei would give his blessing, given the international pressure he 
was said to be under following the fraudulent elections and the bloody 
crackdown that followed. 
The Ayatollah quashed that deal too: Whenever they [Americans] smile 
at the officials of the Islamic revolution, when we carefully look at the 
situation, we notice that they are hiding a dagger behind their back. 
It was the same in January 2011, when diplomacy also collapsed. Ditto in 
2012, when negotiations in February, May and June each ended in failure. 
Washington went into those talks thinking they were going to succeed on 
the theory that Tehran desperately wants relief from the supposedly 
crippling pressure of economic sanctions. 
Why does the Ayatollah keep saying no? The conventional wisdom is that 
previous U.S. offers weren't generous enough, or that the wrong President 
was in the White House, or that Iran wants only to deal directly with the 
U.S. and not in multilateral forums. Each of these theories has been tested 
and shown to be false. 
A more persuasive explanation—get ready for this shocker—is that Iran 
really wants a bomb. The regime believes, not unreasonably, that 
Moammar Gadhafi would still be in power had he not given up his nuclear 
program in 2003. Mr. Khamenei also fears a velvet revolution scenario, 
in which more normal ties with the West threaten the ideological 
foundations of the Islamic Republic. Confrontation with America is in this 
regime's DNA. 
Meantime, the pretense of negotiations has allowed Tehran to play for 
time to advance its programs. When Mr. Obama took office, Iran had 
enriched 1,000 kilos of reactor-grade uranium. In its last report from 
November, U.N. inspectors found that Iran has produced 7,611 kilos to 
reactor grade, along with 232 kilos of uranium enriched to 20%, which is 
close to bomb-grade. Last month, Iran declared that it would install 3,000 
advanced centrifuges at its Natanz facility, which can enrich uranium at 
two to three times its current rate. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028729 
As for the sanctions, they may hurt ordinary Iranians but this regime is 
famously indifferent to the suffering of its own people. The Ayatollah also 
doesn't seem to take the Administration's talk about all options being on 
the table seriously. Mr. Obama's nomination of Iran dove Chuck Hagel to 
be Secretary of Defense reinforces that impression, as do reports that the 
White House blocked Pentagon and CIA plans to arm the opposition that's 
fighting to overthrow Iran's client regime in Damascus. An America that 
won't help proxies in a proxy war isn't likely to take the fight directly to 
Iran's nuclear facilities. 
In rejecting Mr. Biden's offer, the Ayatollah said frankly, I'm not a 
diplomat; I'm a revolutionary. Another round of multilateral talks with 
Iran is set to resume this month, but maybe Joe Biden and his boss should 
start taking no for an answer. 
Article 2. 
Foreign Policy 
Let's face it: Obama's Iran policy is failing  
James Traub 
February 8, 2013 -- There is no better example of an Obama 
administration initiative that has succeeded on its own terms, and yet 
failed as policy, than Iran. By engaging the regime in Tehran, and being 
rebuffed, the White House has been able to enlist China, Russia, and the 
European Union in imposing tough sanctions on Iran. By steadily 
ratcheting up those sanctions, the administration has been able to 
gradually squeeze the Iranian economy. By insisting that containment is 
not an option, Obama has persuaded Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu that he need not launch an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities --
at least not any time soon. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028730 
Obama has done everything right, and yet his Iran policy is failing. There 
is no evidence that the sanctions will bring Iran to its knees and force the 
supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to accept the humiliation of 
abandoning his nuclear program. But neither is there any sign of new 
thinking in the White House. I don't see how what didn't work last year is 
going to work this year, says Vali Nasr, who served in the Obama State 
Department before becoming dean of the Johns Hopkins School of 
Advanced International Studies. He might not get much of an argument 
from White House officials, who, the New York Times recently noted, 
seem content with stalemate. 
The United States is not negotiating directly with Iran but rather doing so 
through the P5+1, which consists of the five permanent Security Council 
members and Germany. The P5+1's current position is that Iran must stop 
enriching nuclear fuel to 20 percent purity -- a point from which Iran 
could quickly move to weapons-grade material -- transfer its existing stock 
of such fuel to a third country, and shut down one of its two enrichment 
facilities, known as Fordow. In exchange, the parties will help Iran 
produce such fuel for medical purposes, which the regime claims is its 
actual goal. Iran has refused, saying it will not shut down Fordow. 
But the current state of play masks the larger issue, which is that the 
ayatollah and those around him believe the United States wants to make 
Iran cry uncle -- which happens to be true. The next round of P5+1 
negotiations, now scheduled for Feb. 25 in Kazakhstan, are almost 
certainly not going to go anywhere unless the United States signals that it 
is prepared to make what the Iranians view as meaningful and equivalent 
moves in exchange for Iranian concessions. Arms-control experts say that 
both British Prime Minister David Cameron and Catherine Ashton, head 
of foreign affairs for the European Union, favor offering Iran a reduction 
in sanctions; but there's a limit to what they can do without the United 
States. 
Of course, such flexibility would be pointless if Iran is simply hell-bent on 
gaining the capacity to produce a nuclear weapon. The signals, as always 
with Iran, are cryptic. Iranian authorities have told nuclear inspectors that 
they plan to install a new generation of centrifuges in order to accelerate 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028731 
enrichment. And yet Iran also chose to convert some of its stockpile of 
highly enriched uranium for medical use rather than approach the amount 
needed for a bomb, leading Israeli authorities to predict that Iran wouldn't 
be able to build a bomb before 2015 or 2016. Last week, Ali Akbar 
Velayati, Khamenei's foreign policy advisor, publicly criticized officials 
who have treated the negotiations dismissively. Presumably, he was 
thinking of President Mahmoud Ahmadinej ad, who has compared Iran's 
nuclear program to a train without brakes. 
Iran is now at the outset of what promises to be a raucous presidential 
election, and may be no more capable of serious negotiations between now 
and June than the United States was in 2012. But what is clear is that the 
sanctions have moderated Iranian behavior and rhetoric. At the same time, 
as the Times also noted, the economic pressure is not nearly great enough 
to compel concessions that the regime would view as a blow to national 
pride. In short, Iran might -- might -- be more willing to accept a face-
saving compromise than they were a year or two ago, but will need serious 
inducements to do so. 
What would that entail? Virtually all the proposals that have come from 
outside experts suggest that the P5+1 begin with modest confidence-
building measures, especially in the period before the election. A recent 
report by the Arms Control Association enumerates several of them. 
Western diplomats, for example, could take up Ali Akbar Salehi, Iran's 
foreign minister, on his proposal to limit the extent of enrichment -- i.e., 
well below 20 percent -- in exchange for fuel rods for the research reaction 
and a recognition of Iran's right to enrich, a notional concept the United 
States already supports under specified conditions. Or Iran could suspend 
20-percent enrichment in exchange for a suspension of new sanctions. But 
Iran is unlikely to accept even such small steps unless it felt that additional 
moves would win additional explicit concessions. 
Beyond that, the outlines of what in Middle East peacemaking is known as 
final status are clear enough: Iran agrees to verifiable inspections to 
ensure that it does not enrich uranium beyond 3.5 percent and does not 
pursue a nuclear weapons program, while the West accepts Iran's right to 
enrich and dismantles sanctions. Of course, the outlines of a Middle East 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028732 
peace deal are clear enough, too. But in both cases, neither side trusts the 
other, and each demands that the other go first. Instead, nobody goes 
anywhere. 
U.S. officials have very good reason to be wary of Iran's bona fides. In 
2009, they reached a deal with Iranian negotiators to send the stockpile of 
highly enriched uranium out of the country -- only to see the ayatollah 
repudiate it. As Ray Takeyh, an Iran expert with the Council on Foreign 
Relations puts it, Khamenei has created a politics where it's hard for him 
to compromise. But so has the United States. Anyone who watched 
Chuck Hagel's confirmation hearing knows that it is an article of faith in 
Congress -- and pretty much a bipartisan one -- that Iran is a faithless, 
illegitimate terrorist state that will be deterred from building a bomb only 
by the threat of massive attack. Had Hagel been foolish enough to suggest 
that the United States offer to reduce sanctions in exchange for Iranian 
concessions, the White House would have had to find a new candidate for 
defense secretary. 
It's the U.S. Congress that arguably holds the high cards, though the White 
House put them in its hands. The most potent sanctions are legislated, and 
have been written in such a way that they will be very hard to unwind. 
Obama can waive them for up to six months. But the ayatollah is not about 
to make irreversible decisions in exchange for six months of relief. 
The White House is thus stuck between Tehran and Capitol Hill. And it 
can't live long with the current stalemate. After all, Obama has said that 
containment is not an option. He is hoping that the combination of 
economic pain and fear of military action will bring Tehran to its senses. If 
it doesn't, the president has said that he is prepared to use force. Perhaps 
he feels that just as spurned engagement served as the predicate for tough 
sanctions, so would failed negotiations lay the predicate for a broadly 
supported strike against Iran's nuclear facilities. Iran left us no choice, he 
might say, as the bombers fly. 
That would constitute a diplomatic triumph ... if a strike against Iran's 
nuclear facilities is a good idea. If in fact it's a dreadful prospect -- worse, 
perhaps, even than containment -- then it would constitute a failure that 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028733 
would obliterate the record of adroit diplomacy of the last four years. 
Obama understands very well -- even if many members of Congress do 
not -- that even our worst adversaries have interests of their own, that 
those interests feel as legitimate to them as ours do to us, and that we at 
least have a chance of settling disputes with them if we can find the place 
where our interests overlap. The time has come for him to apply that 
wisdom to Iran.

Article 3. 
The National  
An uneasy courtship as Iran and Egypt test 
the waters  
Alan Philps 
Feb 8, 2013 -- There is a consensus among commentators that the visit of 
the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to Egypt - complete with 
red carpet and kiss on both cheeks from President Mohammed Morsi - 
does not amount to a breakthrough. The view of US think-tanks is that it 
does not amount to very much at all, and certainly not worth getting 
anxious about. Such a consensus is always dangerous, and it is worth 
looking more closely at what it is based on. 
Mr Ahmadinejad is the first Iranian leader to set foot in Cairo since the 
deposed Shah of Iran was given refuge in Cairo, where he died and 
received a state funeral. The two countries have not had diplomatic 
relations since 1979. 
The Iranian president's visit has deep historical significance, even if he 
came as a guest of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference summit. 
The picture of the two presidents embracing says to the world: Egypt is 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028734 
released from the US straitjacket and is free to resume its position as a 
regional power. 
There are plenty of reasons, however, to dismiss the visit as just show. Mr 
Ahmadinejad is a lame duck, banned by the constitution from running for 
a third term in the June elections. As Iran moves into a period of war 
economy under the pressure of sanctions designed to curb its nuclear 
programme, Mr Ahmadinejad is engaged in a furious struggle to ensure 
that his rival, the parliamentary speaker, Ali Larijani, does not succeed 
him. The corruption allegations levelled by Mr Ahmadinejad against the 
Larijani family are deeply damaging to the Iranian regime. 
Mr Morsi, meanwhile, has little to show Egyptians that he has improved 
their lot. Cairo is the scene of near-constant street battles and the economy 
is tanking. Egypt's currency reserves have just sunk to $13.6 billion (Dh50 
billion), below the critical level needed to cover three months of imports. 
The country is staring bankruptcy in the face, but cannot access 
emergency funds from the International Monetary Fund without 
implementing unpopular reforms that would further raise social tensions. 
Both leaders need to show that they have friends abroad. The reality is a 
little different. Egypt and Iran appear to be divided by the Syria conflict, 
which is symptomatic of the wider split between the Sunni Muslim 
powers, led by Saudi Arabia, and Iran's faltering axis of resistance that, 
with Syria in play and Hamas having defected, now looks increasingly like 
a Shia Muslim axis. 
If we look more closely, then the story of Egypt resuming its role as a 
regional power looks premature. At this stage, Egypt is trying to find some 
space to manoeuvre between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Given that Saudi 
Arabia has the money that Egypt needs, and Washington has a lock on the 
actions of the IMF, that space is limited. 
But what does Washington think? Not very much at the moment. With 
President Barack Obama's second term team still being assembled, it is not 
surprising that there is something of a vacuum in Middle East policy. But 
the issue is deeper than that. The Obama administration has declared it 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028735 
wants to focus on the Asia-Pacific region and, surprisingly, it means what 
it says. 
Only a year after troops withdrew from Iraq, that country is not talked 
about in Washington, like an embarrassing relative. In North Africa, the 
US military has taken a back seat while the work of toppling Colonel 
Muammar Qaddafi and driving back the jihadists in Mali has been left to 
Franco-British forces. Syrian policy is one of drift, where the 
administration finds all options unpalatable. In Egypt, Washington has set 
a red line for the Muslim Brotherhood leadership: it must adhere to the 
peace treaty with Israel. Everything else is negotiable. 
This week the Pentagon revealed that it would no longer be stationing two 
aircraft carriers in the Gulf region, as it has done for most of the past two 
years, due to cuts in the defence budget, and the possibility of even more 
stringent ones if Congress fails to agree on raising the US debt ceiling. 
The Iranian nuclear programme remains a priority in Washington, but the 
carrier decision indicates a less warlike stance. One cannot say that US 
power is ebbing, but there is a clear lack of political will in Washington 
for decisive action in the Middle East. For now, the logic is that regional 
powers will have to take more responsibility. Egypt, although impotent at 
the moment, will have to find its role. The US needs to talk to Iran if there 
is ever going to be a compromise on its nuclear programme. Maybe Egypt 
could help. 
Both Egypt and Iran have denied a report that General Qassem Suleimani, 
commander of the Quds force, a division of the Iranian Islamic 
Revolutionary Guard Corps, and the man responsible for Iran's military 
operations in Syria, visited Cairo in January. There was no reaction in 
Washington to this report. 
If there is going to be a resolution of the Syrian crisis without a decade of 
Lebanon-style war, then allies of the US will have to speak to someone of 
the calibre of Gen Suleimani, a far more important figure than Mr 
Ahmadinejad. Could this lead to a historic compromise between the 
Muslim Brotherhood and the ayatollahs to create a new Islamic front 
spreading revolution? 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028736 
That is out of the question. Egypt is too reliant on foreign finance, which 
Iran cannot offer at the moment, for it to swing into Tehran's orbit. And 
there is far too much domestic opposition. 
What is clear is that while the US is reluctant to take direct responsibility, 
other countries must find ways of resolving the regional contradictions 
that have become unmanageable in the era of American tutelage. That will 
lead to some unlikely meetings taking place. The Morsi-Ahmadinejad 
embrace may not be a breakthrough, but it does show one thing: what was 
unthinkable a few years ago may one day be the norm.

llamas Weighs Options For Recognizing Israel 
Adnan Abu Amer 
February 8 -- Recently, a lot has been said — and a lot of denials have 
been issued — about Hamas recognizing a two-state solution. It appears 
that Hamas is still vacillating between explicitly and implicitly 
recognizing Israel. Hamas realizes that recognizing Israel would open up 
the world's doors to the movement. At the same time, Hamas knows that 
such a move would be seen as a betrayal by the movement's supporters, 
both inside and outside Palestine. As Hamas well knows, its legitimacy 
derives from its vocal support for armed struggle within the complicated 
Palestinian reality. Hamas also knows that it will pay a heavy price if it is 
seen to be agreeing to international conditions. The cost will not only be 
political, but also ideological. Hamas has spent many years talking and 
writing about its notion of the state, its identity, borders, concept, 
constitution and the role of Islam within it. Generations of Hamas 
members were raised on those ideas. But those ideas have remained part 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028737 
of the imagination and heritage, and of the nostalgic dream of restoring the 
Islamic caliphate. 
The concept of the state 
Today's debate within Hamas over the concept of the state is more 
concrete than theoretical. The political conditions in the Palestinian 
territories do not allow for dreaming about unrealistic grand theories being 
promoted by some Islamist movements. Hamas is facing real-world 
problems that require real-world solutions. The Palestinian state being 
envisioned by Palestinian, Arab, and world politicians is based on the June 
1967 borders. But does that fit Hamas's political vision and intellectual 
orientation? Generations of Islamists have been raised on the concept of 
the Islamic state, which is synonymous with the Islamic caliphate. But 
Hamas's situation is a little different. Israel's occupation of all Palestinian 
territories is a political and concrete obstacle to the dream of an Islamic 
state and it forces the consideration of more realistic options. So we have 
started hearing, from Hamas, statements about establishing a Palestinian 
state on the June 1967 borders. There is no doubt that this development is 
an intellectual and political shift by Hamas. More than 20 years ago, 
Hamas founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin proposed a long truce with Israel. 
But today, such a proposal is more realistic and is attributed to Hamas's 
current leader Khaled Meshaal. Hamas in 2013 is different than Hamas in 
1993. Hamas is now an influential player and its statements and stances 
are taken into account by regional and international decision-making 
circles. 
Recognition and commitment 
The shuttle diplomacy by Western officials between Gaza, where Hamas's 
domestic leadership is located, and the Arab capitals of Doha, Cairo and 
Amman have only one objective: getting Hamas to agree to the conditions 
that would allow it to be embraced by the international community. In 
other words, they want Hamas to agree to the two-state solution. And that, 
explicitly or implicitly, essentially means that Hamas has recognized 
Israel's right to exist! Those who have been following Hamas's course 
since it was founded 25 years ago notice that every once in awhile there is 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028738 
international pressure to make Hamas agree to those conditions. But 
Hamas is afraid to fall into the same trap that others, like Fatah, have 
fallen into without getting anything in return except loss of popular 
support, as was demonstrated in the elections seven years ago. In light of 
the demands that the movement should recognize the two-state solution 
and make political commitments, some influential circles within the 
Hamas leadership think that the movement is being drawn into going 
beyond its rational political discourse and how it deals with the reality on 
the ground, and into recognizing Israel and exchanging messages with 
it. However, the siege has made the Palestinian territories miserable. So 
decision-makers in Hamas are forced to issue hints and signals that do not 
affect the movement's general principles. Those signals, however, may be 
misunderstood. And this is where the problem lies. No one thinks that 
Hamas supporters will make a big deal of those signals, but any concrete 
steps toward recognizing Israel will cost Hamas dearly, something which I 
don't think Hamas wants during this dangerous phase. At the external 
level, Hamas's enemies and opponents may think that the siege has finally 
paid off, albeit a little late, and that Hamas's current declarations are 
signals that, if the siege and the Palestinian suffering continue, the 
movement may explicitly recognize Israel, which would open the 
appetite of Hamas' opponents for more breakthroughs in its ideology 
and principles. 
Not an existential conflict, but a border dispute. 
Although Hamas is aware of all that, it should be noted that in a few 
months it is facing elections during which the movement's signals that it 
may accept a two-state solution will be used in a fierce anti-Hamas 
campaign. Even though the movement has provided a different 
administrative performance than before, the fundamental change in the 
movement's political program may be a decisive factor for the Palestinian 
voters. As Hamas is being smothered, with a few breaches here and there, 
the demands that it should recognize Israel are ongoing and without letup. 
In other words, Hamas must choose between recognizing Israel to stay in 
power, or losing what it has achieved democratically as punishment for 
having to refused to bow to the world's conditions. In reality, the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028739 
international community has not significantly changed its relationship with 
the Palestinians, including Hamas, over the past months and years. There 
has only been some cosmetic and tactical changes. Washington, the 
European Union and the UN have not only signaled to Hamas that it 
should join the broken and paralyzed peace process, they have also 
insisted that the Palestinians explicitly recognize Israel. But this time, 
those powers are armed with an Islamic religious cloak, which would 
make a recognition of Israel more meaningful, especially since Hamas 
considers its conflict with Israel to be an ideological existential conflict, 
not a border dispute. That pressure is accompanied with a financial and 
economic blockade, which is increasing the pressure on Hamas, especially 
since those carrying out the blockade are blocking anything that would 
alleviate Palestinian suffering. It is clear that they want to punish the 
Palestinians for electing Hamas and warn them against reelecting them; 
that is if the reconciliation succeeds and the elections happen on time. It 
should be noted that certain Israeli and Western research institutions have 
estimated the timeframe that Hamas will need to explicitly recognize 
Israel. They may accept from Hamas certain rhetorical signals for a while 
before the movement officially recognizes Israel. Since Hamas was 
founded in late 1987, it has been conducting an ideological and political 
campaign for its members and supporters against recognizing Israel. 
Hamas' constitution says that Israel is a cancer that must be eradicated, 
and that its demise is a Quranic inevitability. Those and other slogans 
have been a key component of Hamas's political discourse. It is therefore 
not easy for Hamas to change overnight due to political realism and 
suddenly tell its supporters: We shall recognize Israel, but it's under 
duress!

An Assassination in Tunisia  
Editorial 
February 8, 2013 -- Tunisia is where the Arab Spring began just over two 
years ago. Until now it has set an encouraging example of progress toward 
democracy and pluralism. Free elections brought to power a coalition 
government pledged to pragmatic cooperation between a moderate-led 
Islamist party, Ennanda, and smaller, secular coalition partners. 
Progress has not always been smooth. But just as Tunisians inspired 
people in neighboring countries like Egypt and Libya to rise up against 
their corrupt and repressive dictators, they also seemed, for many, to point 
the way toward a democratic future accommodating both religious beliefs 
and the rights of the secular under the rule of law. 
Those hopes have been severely shaken by the murder on Wednesday of 
Chokri Belaid. Mr. Belaid, a human- rights activist and one of Ennanda's 
most outspoken critics, had publicly challenged the party's failure to 
investigate or prosecute violent acts of intimidation carried out by 
shadowy gangs of religious extremists. Mr. Belaid's killers have not yet 
been identified. But suspicion now falls on those same extremist groups, 
which had issued public threats against Mr. Belaid and other prominent 
secular leaders — without any serious government response. 
Thousands gathered for Mr. Belaid's funeral on Friday amid a nationwide 
general strike called by his trade union supporters. Tensions are high. 
What is urgently needed is a credible, independent investigation of Mr. 
Belaid's murder, followed by prosecution of the killers. 
Given Ennanda's record of selectively ignoring Islamist violence, that 
investigation cannot be left to its appointees alone. A preferable 
alternative would be to reconstitute the broad-based, multiparty 
commissions that successfully oversaw Tunisia's free elections in October 
2011 and investigated the crimes of the fallen dictatorship. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028741 
Ennanda, which captured 41 percent of the vote in the elections, promised 
to cooperate with secular parties and show respect for pluralism. Instead, it 
is sending muddled messages. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Hamadi 
Jebali made a conciliatory gesture by proposing a temporary nonpolitical 
cabinet and new elections. Unfortunately, hard-line party members quickly 
repudiated him. 
Tunisia's revolution, which has overcome past crises, can overcome this 
one if Ennanda and all other Tunisian parties recommit themselves to 
nonviolence, mutual tolerance and upholding the rule of law.

The Washington Post 
Iraq's return to bloodshed 
Kimberly Kagan and Frederick W. Kagan 
February 8, 2013 -- Eighteen days of protests in Egypt in 2011 electrified 
the world. But more than twice that many days of protest in Iraq have 
gone almost unnoticed in the United States. Iraqi army troops killed five  
Sunni protesters in Fallujah on Jan. 25, after a month of anti-government 
protests in Anbar, Nineveh and Salahuddin provinces and elsewhere for 
which thousands turned out. Al-Qaeda in Iraq and Iranian-backed Shiite 
militias are re-mobilizing. Iraq teeters on the brink of renewed insurgency 
and, potentially, civil war. 
This crisis matters for America. U.S. vital interests that have been 
undermined over the past year include preventing Iraq from becoming a 
haven for al-Qaeda and destabilizing the region by becoming a security 
vacuum or a dictatorship that inflames sectarian civil war; containing 
Iranian influence in the region; and ensuring the free flow of oil to the 
global market. 
While tensions have risen over the past two years, the triggers for recent 
eruptions are clear. Prime Minister Noun al-Maliki, a Shiite, had the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028742 
bodyguards of Finance Minister Rafie al-Issawi, who is Sunni, arrested for 
alleged terrorist activities on Dec. 20 — almost exactly one year after he 
ordered the arrest of Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi's security 
detail. Hashimi fled to Turkey and is unlikely to return soon to Iraq, where 
he was sentenced to death after Maliki demanded his trial in absentia for 
murder and financing terrorism. 
The threat to Issawi, a moderate technocrat from Anbar, galvanized Iraqi 
Sunnis, who rightly saw Maliki's move as sectarian and an assault on 
government participation by Sunnis not under the prime minister's thumb. 
Three days after the arrests, demonstrations broke out in Ramadi, Fallujah 
and Samarra. Three days after that, a large protest closed the highway  
from Baghdad to Syria and Jordan. The popular resistance spread to Mosul 
on Dec. 27. 
These protests erupted during a constitutional crisis and as an expanding 
Arab-Kurd conflict has become increasingly militarized. Iraqi President 
Jalal Talabani was incapacitated by a stroke on Dec. 17 and has been out 
of the countryfor treatment. Iraq's constitution specifies a line of 
succession — but with one vice president in exile and the other a Shiite 
and obvious Maliki proxy, Iraq has been, in effect, operating without a 
president. Political processes that require presidential involvement have 
been paralyzed, including moving forward with long-standing efforts by 
Sunnis and Kurds to hold a parliamentary vote of no-confidence in Maliki. 
Talabani had been the critical link holding Baghdad and Kurdistan 
together since tensions rose following a 10-day standoff between Iraqi 
army units and Kurdish pesh merga troops in October, after Maliki sent 
the army toward the disputed city of Kirkuk. That move followed a series 
of skirmishes and mobilizations along the Green Line separating 
Kurdistan from Arab Iraq and a series of attacks in the area by al-Qaeda in 
Iraq. 
The recent protests underscore the collapse of the inclusive political 
accommodation reached in 2007, which had been reconfirmed by the 
formation of a grand Sunni-Shiite-Kurd coalition government after 
parliamentary elections in 2010. By November 2012, Maliki had evolved 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028743 
to openly discussing his intention to form a majoritarian government 
that would exclude the most important Sunni representatives. In mid-
December he participated in creating a Shiite grand alliance as the 
launching pad for that government. The principal Sunni political leaders, 
including Issawi, parliamentary speaker Osama al-Nujaifiand Anbari tribal 
leader Ahmed abu Rishaannounced their intention to form their own 
coalition. In short, Iraqi politics was re-fragmenting along sectarian and 
ethnic lines even before the protests began. 
Understood in this context, the Iraqi army's killing of protesters in 
Fallujah last month is a watershed event similar to the destruction of the 
Askariya shrine in Samarra in February 2006, though the crisis will not 
escalate as quickly. Sunni-Shiite tensions have hitherto played out in 
political forums. The key actors in today's crisis are not the Sunni political 
leaders but, rather, Anbari tribal leaders, including Ali Hatem Ali 
Suleiman, one of the most powerful leaders of Iraq's largest Sunni tribe. 
Suleiman and fellow leaders of the Dulaim tribe were essential to 
engineering the Anbar Awakening in 2007 and Sunni participation in the 
government, for which they rejected al-Qaeda in Iraq and renounced 
violence against the state. They responded to the killings of protesters last 
month by threatening open war against the state for the first time since 
2007. So far at least, they have restrained protesters and resisted violent 
confrontation. 
For his part, Maliki has sought to deescalate the conflict and to mollify 
protesters. Tehran has also been working — to persuade Iraq's Sadrists, 
whom Maliki has alienated in his consolidation of power, to abandon their 
support for their Sunni brethren. Their combined efforts appear to be 
working: The Sadrist Bloc, which had refused Maliki's request for 
suggestions to replace Issawi and other Sunni politicians, has put forth a 
substitute finance minister. 
These efforts, ostensibly toward political resolution, actually increase the 
likelihood of sectarian war by continuing the marginalization of Sunni 
political leaders without addressing Sunni tribes' core grievances — and 
by re-creating a Shiite front that had splintered. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028744 
Al-Qaeda in Iraq has already taken advantage of this situation through its 
front group, the Islamic State of Iraq, which deployed combat teams in 
Fallujah last month that targeted Iraqi army positions and killed several 
soldiers. The jihadists' black flags have appeared at Sunni protests and 
memorial ceremonies for the fallen. The group is back in the havens it 
held in 2006. If Maliki does not allow proper Sunni representation in 
government, al-Qaeda will gain greater popular tolerance and foreign 
support. 
Over the past year, the situation in Iraq has become explosive while 
sectarian sentiment and armed violence in neighboring nations have 
escalated dramatically. Americans have become accustomed to watching 
Iraq approach the precipice and draw back. But circumstances have 
changed with the withdrawal of all U.S. forces and Maliki's year-long 
efforts to intimidate his opponents through political, judicial and military 
maneuvers. If Maliki does not accept many of the protesters' reasonable 
demands and allow meaningful Sunni participation in government, 
prospects for stopping Iraq's descent into sectarian conflict are grim.

Islam and Islamism in the Modern World  
An interview with Daniel Pipes (By Tom Bethell) 
February 2013 -- Daniel Pipes, one of our leading experts on Islam, 
established the Middle East Forum and became its head in 1994. He was 
born in 1949 and grew up in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His father, 
Richard Pipes, was a professor of Russian history, now emeritus, at 
Harvard. Daniel studied Arabic and Islamic history and lived in Cairo for 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028745 
three years. His PhD dissertation became his first book, Slave Soldiers 
and Islam (1981). Then his interest in purely academic subjects expanded 
to include modern Islam. He left the university because, as he told an 
interviewer from Harvard Magazine, he has the simple politics of a truck 
driver, not the complex ones of an academic. His story of being 
harassed through the legal system by a Muslim who later committed 
suicide was recently told in The American Spectator (A Palestinian in 
Texas, TAS, November 2012). He has been personally threatened but 
prefers not to talk about specifics except to note that law enforcement has 
been involved. I interviewed Pipes shortly before Christmas, when the 
Egyptians were voting on their new constitution. I started out by saying 
that the number of Muslims in the U.S. has doubled since the 9/11 attacks. 
DP: My career divides in two: before and after 9/11. In the first part I was 
trying to show that Islam is relevant to political concerns. If you want to 
understand Muslims, I argued, you need to understand the role of Islam in 
their lives. Now that seems obvious. If anything, there's a tendency to 
over-emphasize Islam; to assume that Muslims are dominated by the 
Koran and are its automatons—which goes too far. You can't just read the 
Koran to understand Muslim life. You have to look at history, at 
personalities, at economics, and so on. 
TB: Do you see the revival of Islam as a reality? 
DP: Yes. Half a century ago Islam was waning, the application of its laws 
became ever more remote, and the sense existed that Islam, like other 
religions, was in decline. Since then there has been a sharp and I think 
indisputable reversal. We're all talking about Islam and its laws now. 
TB: At the same time you have raised an odd question: Can Islam 
survive Islamism? Can you explain that? 
DP: I draw a distinction between traditional Islam and Islamism. Islamism 
emerged in its modern form in the 1920s and is driven by a belief that 
Muslims can be strong and rich again if they follow the Islamic law 
severely and in its entirety. This is a response to the trauma of modern 
Islam. And yet this form of Islam is doing deep damage to faith, to the 
point that I wonder if Islam will ever recover. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028746 
TB: Give us the historical context. 
DP: The modern era for Muslims began with Napoleon's invasion of 
Egypt in 1798. Muslims experienced a great shock at seeing how 
advanced the blue-eyed peoples from the north had become. It would be 
roughly analogous to the Eskimos coming down south and decimating 
Westerners, who would uncomprehendingly ask in response, Who are 
these people and how are they defeating us? 
TB: So how did they respond? 
DP: Muslims over the past 200 years have made many efforts to figure out 
what went wrong. They have experimented with several answers. One was 
to emulate liberal Europe—Britain and France—until about 1920. Another 
was to emulate illiberal Europe—Germany and Russia—until about 1970. 
The third was to go back to what are imagined to be the sources of Islamic 
strength a millennium ago, namely the application of Islamic law. That's 
Islamism. It's a modern phenomenon, and it's making Muslims the center 
of world unrest. 
TB: But it is also creating discomfort? 
DP: It has terribly deleterious effects on Muslims. Many of them are put 
off by Islam. In Iran, for example, one finds a lot of alienation from Islam 
as a result of the Islamist rule of the last 30-odd years. 
TB: Has it happened anywhere else? 
DP: One hears reports, especially from Algeria and Iraq, of Muslims 
converting to Christianity. And in an unprecedented move, ex-Muslims 
living in the West have organized with the goal of becoming a political 
force. I believe the first such effort was the Centraal Comite voor Ex-
moslims in the Netherlands, but now it's all over the place. 
TB: Nonetheless, Islam has lasted for 1,500 years. 
DP: Yes, but modern Islamism has been around only since the 1920s, and 
I predict it will not last as a world-threatening force for more than a few 
decades. Will Muslims leave the faith or simply stop practicing it? These 
are the sort of questions I expect to be current before long. 
TB: What about Islam in the United States? 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028747 
DP: In the long term, the United States could greatly benefit Islam by 
uniquely freeing the religion from government constraints and permitting 
it to evolve in a positive, modern direction. But that's the long term. Right 
now, American Muslims labor under Saudi and other influences, their 
institutions are extreme, and things are heading in a destructive direction. 
It's also distressing to see how non-Muslim individuals and institutions, 
particularly those on the left, indulge Islamist misbehavior. 
TB: How do they do that? 
DP: Well, turn on the television, go to a class, follow the work of the 
ACLU or the Southern Poverty Law Center, and you will see corporations, 
nonprofits, and government institutions working with the Islamists, 
helping promote the Islamist agenda. The American left and the Islamists 
agree on what they dislike—conservatives—and, despite their profound 
differences, they cooperate. 
TB: Presumably some Muslims here deconvert, right? 
DP: There are some conversions out of Islam, yes. And the Muslim 
establishment in this country is quite concerned about that. But 
numerically it is not a significant number. 
TB: The ones who convert don't talk about it very much? 
DP: In some cases they do; they take advantage of Western freedoms to 
speak their minds. They are the exceptions, though. 
TB: I suspect that the decline of Christianity has encouraged Islam. 
DP: Very much so, as the contrast between Europe and the United States 
reveals. The hard kernel of American Christian faith, not present in 
Europe, means that Islamists are far better behaved in the United States. 
They see the importance of a Christian counterforce. 
TB: Earlier, you mentioned Algeria. It is a big Muslim state that we 
don't hear about today. 
DP: Twenty years ago Algeria was a major focus of attention. That long 
ago ended, although in France coverage is still significant. Algeria is ripe 
for the same kind of upheaval that we have seen in other North African 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028748 
states, such as Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt. I think it is likely to happen 
before too long. 
TB: What about Syria? 
DP: Assad's power is steadily diminishing and I cannot see how his 
regime will remain long in power. 
TB: Should the United States get involved there? 
DP: No, Americans have no dog in this fight and nothing in the U.S. 
Constitution requires us to get involved in every foreign conflict. Two 
wretched forces are killing each other; just look at the ghastly videos of 
the two sides torturing and executing the other. Listen also to what they 
are saying. It's a civil war involving the bad and the worse. I don't want 
the U.S. government involved. That would mean bearing some moral 
responsibility for what emerges, which I expect to be very unsavory. 
TB: So you are supporting the Obama position? 
DP: Yes, though he reaches it with far more angst. Also, there appears to 
be some serious, clandestine U.S. support for the rebel forces. The 
September 11 meeting in Benghazi between the Turkish and the American 
ambassadors was very curious. They are both based in Tripoli, hundreds 
of miles away. What were they doing in Benghazi? Arranging for 
American arms going via Turkey to Syria, it appears. 
TB: How important has Israel been to the revival of Islam? 
DP: It is a major factor in the neighboring states. But elsewhere, in 
Morocco, Iran, Malaysia, it has minor importance. 
TB: Since the Arab Spring, Israel seems increasingly beleaguered. 
DP: Not really, not yet, though I agree that it will be more beleaguered 
with time. Its neighbors are so consumed with their own affairs that they 
hardly pay Israel attention. But once the neighbors get their houses in 
order, Israel will most likely face new difficulties. 
TB: You have questioned U.S. support for Islamic democracy, which 
does seem naive. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028749 
DP: The U.S. has been the patron for democracy for a century, since 
Wilson's 14 Points, and a wonderful heritage it has been. When an 
American travels the world, he finds himself in country after country 
where his country played a monumentally positive role, especially in 
democratizing the system. We naturally want to extend this to Muslim-
majority countries. Sadly, these for some time have offered an unpleasant 
choice between brutal and greedy dictators or ideological, extreme, and 
antagonistic elected Islamists. It's not a choice we should accept. 
TB: So what should we do? 
DP: I offer three simple guidelines. One, always oppose the Islamists. Like 
fascists and Communists, they are the totalitarian enemy, whether they 
wear long beards in Pakistan or suits in Washington. 
Two, always support the liberal, modern, secular people who share our 
worldview. They look to us for moral and other sustenance; we should be 
true to them. They are not that strong, and cannot take power soon 
anywhere, but they represent hope, offering the Muslim world's only 
prospect of escape from the dreary dichotomy of dictatorship or 
extremism. 
Three, and more difficult, cooperate with dictators but condition it on 
pushing them toward reform and opening up. We need the Mubaraks of 
the world and they need us. Fine, but relentlessly keep the pressure on 
them to improve their rule. Had we begun this process with Abdullah 
Saleh of Yemen in 1978 or with Mubarak in 1981, things could have been 
very different by 2011. But we didn't. 
TB: Egypt might be the test case. 
DP: Well, it's a bit late. Mohammed Morsi is not a greedy dictator but he 
emerged from the Muslim Brotherhood, and his efforts since reaching 
power have been purely Islamist. 
TB: What about the recent elections? 
DP: I do not believe that a single one of the elections and referenda in 
Egypt was fairly conducted. It surprises me that Western governments and 
media are so gullible on this score. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028750 
TB: You could say we were supporting the democracy element in Cairo's 
Tahrir Square. Were we not? 
DP: Yes and rightly so. The initial demonstrations of early 2011 were 
spearheaded by the liberals and seculars who deserve U.S. support. But 
they got quickly pushed aside and Washington barely paid them further 
attention. 
TB: We gave foreign aid to Mubarak. Was that a bad idea? 
DP: That aid dates back to the utterly different circumstances of the 
Egypt-Israel peace treaty of 1979 and became progressively more wrong-
headed. It should long ago have been discontinued. More broadly, I 
believe in aid for emergencies (soup and blankets) and as a bribe, but not 
for economic development. That the Obama administration is 
contemplating aid, including military hardware, to the Morsi government 
outrages me.

022100 19 that some of the girls had filed against Mr. Epstein,
022102 20 her deposition was set, in fact, by my co-counsel,

o22105 21 Mr. Edwards, and then there was some haggling over a
o22i10 22 confidentiality agreement, you know, what are we

eza1e 2 of days before that deposition, she canceled. And well,
022123 3 she didn't cancel. Her -- her attorney called to cancel
022123 4 the deposition and represented that Miss Maxwell was
o2z2120 5 outside the United States of America and had no plans to
o22133 § return back to the United States.

o22i35 | 7 And $0, at that point, the deposition was --
o22140 8 was not able to go forward. But it turned out that she
o22143 9 had not left the United States for an extended period of
o22146 10 time. She was spotted later at a wedding of a prominent

022206 18 Jean Luc Brunel was another person who seemed

what his excuse was, but, you know, evaded the
deposition and, in fact, later information came to light
he was hiding out in, you know, in the mansion of
Epstein while he's claiming he's unavailable for -- for
deposition.

So -- so this pattern of Mr. Dershowitz, you
know, where there were three attempts to obtain
information from him, if that's all I had, I guess that

would have been one thing. But what I had was a pattern

of people who were implicated in this sex trafficking

ring evading questions, you know, quite in violation of

court orders and depositions and things -- I shouldn't

say court order -- in violation of the deposition

notices that were being sent and agreements being made,

you know, through counsel.
And then in addition to that, I had this, so

why -- why would you think that, you know, there's this

sex trafficking, you know, ring going on? It sounds
kind of farfetched.
Well -- well, one of the things that I had

available to me on December 30th was a photograph that

was widely available on the Internet, and that

photograph depicted three people.

It depicted Glenn Maxwell, Prince Andrew, and
Virginia Roberts, and the -- at the time that it looked

like Virginia Roberts was an underage girl. She was not
dressed in formal attire. And Prince Andrew had his arm
around her, I think if memory serves, and right next --
smiling in the background is Miss Maxwell, and it
appeared that that was a private residence, presumably
in London, close to Buckingham Palace where ~~ where
Prince Andrew lived.

And so here was Prince Andrew with this
underage girl with Glenn Maxwell, the -- the right-hand
girl, if that's the right expression -- I probably
should say -- strike that -- right-hand woman of --
of -- of Mr. Epstein -- that were there and somebody had
taken the photograph.

Given the surrounding circumstances, I
thought perhaps Mr. Epstein had taken the photograph.
So that would have shown Virginia Roberts's sexual abuse
was not confined just to Florida, not confined to the
New York mansion; it would have -- it would have
presumably continued into London where one of, you know,
the highest, most powerful persons in the governmental
structure that -- that exists in England was now
involved in -- in sexual abuse.

And so that created grave concern about, how
far did this sex trafficking ring reach; what were their
connections; what were their abilities to influence, you

nation.... This is the same as 'Islamic Awakening,' which is the result
of the victory of the big revolution of the Iranian nation, said
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Iran also broadcast speeches by Hezbollah's leader into Bahrain,
cheering the protesters on. Bahraini officials say that Iran went
further, providing money and even some weapons to some of the
more extreme opposition members. Protest leaders vehemently deny
any operational or political links to Iran, and foreign diplomats in
Bahrain say that they have seen little evidence of it.

March 14 was the critical turning point. At the invitation of Bahrain,
Saudi armed vehicles and tanks poured across the causeway that
separates the two countries. They came representing a special
contingent under the aegis of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a league
of Sunni-led Gulf states, but the Saudis were the major driver. The
Saudis publicly announced that 1,000 troops had entered Bahrain, but
privately they concede that the actual number is considerably higher.
If both Iran and Saudi Arabia see themselves responding to external
threats and opportunities, some analysts, diplomats and democracy
advocates see a more complicated picture. They say that the ramping
up of regional tensions has another source: fear of democracy itself.
Long before protests ousted rulers in the Arab world, Iran battled
massive street protests of its own for more than two years. It managed
to control them, and their calls for more representative government or
outright regime change, with massive, often deadly, force. Yet even
as the government spun the Arab protests as Iranian inspired, Iran's
Green Revolution opposition movement managed to use them to
boost their own fortunes, staging several of their best-attended rallies
in more than a year.

Saudi Arabia has kept a wary eye on its own population of Shiites,

autonomy. We might call this the Babylonian model.

The Davidic model exists primarily when there is no external
imperial power needing control of the Levant that is in a position
either to send direct force or to support surrogates in the immediate
region. The Persian model exists when Israel aligns itself with the
foreign policy interests of such an imperial power, to its own benefit.
The Babylonian model exists when Israel miscalculates on the
broader balance of power and attempts to resist an emerging
hegemon. When we look at Israeli behavior over time, the periods
when Israel does not confront hegemonic powers outside the region
are not rare, but are far less common than when it is confronting
them.

Given the period of the first iteration of Israel, it would be too much
to say that the Davidic model rarely comes into play, but certainly
since that time, variations of the Persian and Babylonian models have
dominated. The reason is geographic. Israel is normally of interest to
outside powers because of its strategic position. While Israel can deal
with local challenges effectively, it cannot deal with broader
challenges. It lacks the economic or military weight to resist.
Therefore, it is normally in the process of managing broader threats
or collapsing because of them.

The Geopolitics of Contemporary Israel

Let us then turn to the contemporary manifestation of Israel. Israel
was recreated because of the interaction between a regional great
power, the Ottoman Empire, and a global power, Great Britain.
During its expansionary phase, the Ottoman Empire sought to
dominate the eastern Mediterranean as well as both its northern and
southern coasts. One thrust went through the Balkans toward central
Europe. The other was toward Egypt. Inevitably, this required that
the Ottomans secure the Levant.

For the British, the focus on the eastern Mediterranean was as the

government) perspective. While she acknowledges that there is not much diversity in
the nature of the views represented by ICAS—there is no overt criticism of Chinese
government policies—she is hopeful that once ICAS gains greater standing, it will be
able to attract senior scholars from other institutions with a greater range of views to
write for its website.

More recently, Chinese publishing entrepreneur Zhou Zhixing has established the
US-China New Perspectives Foundation, with offices in both Los Angeles and
Washington, DC. As of yet, these offices have no track record of activities or publications.
It is likely that more such think tanks initiated with or without formal Chinese
government support will follow in the United States.

Think-Tank Funding

Different US think tanks have different funding models. At least one type (Federally
Funded Research and Development Centers, or FFRDCs) is funded entirely by the
US government, while several others accept some US government funding, as well
as money from other governments on a contracted work basis. Three think tanks
interviewed accept no US or other government funding: One is funded entirely
by central operating funds from an endowment, while two others rely on a mix
of foundation and private support. One think tank’s work is funded entirely by
foundations. Most interviewees allow Chinese funders to pay for travel and meeting
costs to Beijing for conferences, while a few categorically do not—either because of
regulations or on the principle of conflict of interest.

At least one think tank differentiates between funding that is dedicated to its work

in Washington and that which supports its center in China. For the center in China,

a US-based scholar has raised funds from the China Development Bank, Huawei
Corporation, and private entrepreneurs from Hong Kong. This same think tank has a
“China Council” of donors (including Chinese Americans, but no Chinese nationals)
that supports the think tank’s activities. Some US institutions refuse to accept funds
from China-based commercial entities, although they are occasionally willing to
accept donations from their US-based subsidiaries. Other think tanks, however, accept
funds from Chinese corporations and individual businesspeople. One has taken money
from Alibaba America for a particular event celebrating the fifteenth anniversary of
WTO accession; another has taken money from the Chinese real estate firm Vanke for
a project on the environment. A Chinese businessman, Fu Chen, supports work at one
China center that also has several prominent Chinese businesspersons on its board.
One has an advisory council with Chinese Americans, and yet another think tank

is building an advisory council that will include Chinese, but only those who have
become American citizens. (This analyst is also considering accepting private Chinese
money but not money from Chinese state-owned enterprises.)

consulting, noted, “Access to China is my livelihood.” At the same time, he argues,
“T never say anything contrary to my views, but I write in a way that is less shrill.”

Another scholar noted, “I don’t self-censor, but there is no need to launch a polemic
every day of the week... polemics get your visa cut off. China’s greatest power is
the power of visa control.” A third commented, “I don’t censor the substance, but

I may modulate what I say.” He argued that he sometimes indulges the sensibilities of
the PRC in order to get his deeper point across. As another analyst noted, “I avoid
sensationalizing. Iam willing to be critical, but I try not to make attacks on Xi.”
And different interviewees distinguish between writing and speaking: “I do not
compromise on writing, but I am cautious in interviews: I will say the same message
but indirectly, not confrontationally.” One analyst said, “I make sure that if I go into
battle, I do so thoughtfully, not accidentally.” She tries to be very strategic about the
messages that she sends and tries not to weigh in on every small issue or bluntly
charge, “You are wrong!” In a similar vein, one other scholar says he often uses an
interrogatory, rather than accusatory, approach when raising challenging issues, such
as human rights.

The knowledge that what an analyst says publicly reflects not only on the individual
but also on the analyst’s institution also shapes at least one scholar’s thinking: “There
is a conflict between protecting your institute and speaking truthfully. Whether it is
over access or money. Sometimes I put the positive first—and then say . . ’but some
people say.’ I might not start right off with Xi Jinping—I might be more indirect. In
public meetings, there is a tacit understanding that you will not be super critical of
China.” Another suggests that it is “very hard not to subconsciously self-censor.” This
person indicated that when their institute does projects on counterterrorism in the
Middle East or Southeast Asia, they are very careful about discussing China’s restive
region of Xinjiang where up to one million Uighurs are presently believed to be in
reeducation camps. In general, they do not take on projects concerning Taiwan or
Xinjiang.

Interviewees expressed a deep sensitivity around the issue of Taiwan and how to refer
to the island and its officials. One analyst observed that in an invitation, his institute
would not identify Taiwan’s representative to the United States as an “ambassador,” but
during the event, he would indeed orally introduce the official as the “ambassador.” Or
as another scholar noted, “I am tactful but keep to my original point of view. I don’t
change the substance. On Taiwan, in private conversations, I use President Tsai—but I
also maintain neutrality in public to ensure that is acceptable to Taiwan and the PRC.”

Two analysts stated that they do not self-censor “at all.” They understand the
temptation, but they try to write and say in public exactly what they would in private.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013145.txt,"12.6 The Ethical Treatment of AGIs 229

While the issue is subtle, our initial feeling is that the only ethical means by which to deprive
an AGI of the right to internal self modification is to write its code in such a way that it is
impossible for it to do so because it lacks the mechanisms by which to do this, as well as the
desire to achieve these mechanisms. Whether or not that is feasible is an open question, but
it seems unlikely. Direct self-modification may be denied, but what happens when that AGI
discovers compilers and computer programming? If it is intelligent and volitional, it can decide
to learn to rewrite its own code in the same way we perform that task. Because it is a designed
system, and its designers may be alive at the same time the AGI is, such an AGI would have a
distinct advantage over the human quest for medical self-modification. Even if any given AGI
could be provably deprived of any possible means of internal self-modification, if one single AGI
is given this ability by anyone, it may mean that particular AGI has such enormous advantages
over the compliant systems that it would render their influence moot. Since developers are
already giving software the means for self modification, it seems unrealistic to assume we could
just put the genie back into the bottle at this point. It’s better, in our view, to assume it will
happen, and approach that reality in a way which will encourage the AGI to use that capability
to benefit us as well as itself. Again, this leads on to the question of future scenarios for AGI
development — there are some scenarios in which restraint of AGI self-modification may be
possible, but the feasibility and desirability of these scenarios is needful of further exploration.

12.6.2 AGI Ethics as Boundaries Between Humans and AGIs
Become Blurred

Another important reason for valuing ethical treatment of AGIs is that the boundaries between
machines and people may increasingly become blurred as technology develops. As an exam-
ple, it’s likely that in future humans augmented by direct brain-computer integration (“neural
implants”) will be more able to connect directly into the information sharing network which po-
tentially comprises the distributed knowledge space of AGI systems. These neural cyborgs will
be part person, and part machine. Obviously, if there are radically different ethical standards
in place for treatment of humans versus AGIs, the treatment of cyborgs will be fraught with
logical inconsistencies, potentially leading to all sorts of problem situations.

Such cyborgs may be able to operate in such a way as to “share a mind” with an AGI or
another augmented human. In this case, a whole new range of ethical questions emerge, such
as: What does any one of the participant minds have the right to do in terms of interacting
with the others? Merely accepting such an arrangement should not necessarily be giving carte
blanche for any and all thoughts to be monitored by the other “joint thought” participants,
rather it should be limited only to the line of reasoning for which resources are being pooled.
No participant should be permitted to force another to accept any reasoning either — and in
the case with a mind-to-mind exchange, it may someday become feasible to implant ideas or
beliefs directly, bypassing traditional knowledge acquisition mechanisms and then letting the
new idea fight it out previously held ideas via internal revision. Also under such an arrangement,
if AGIs and humans do not have parity with respects to sentient rights, then one may become
subjugated to the will of the other in such a case.

Uploading presents a more directly parallel ethical challenge to AGIs in their probable initial
configuration. If human thought patterns and memories can be transferred into a machine in
such a way as that there is continuity of consciousness, then it is assumed that such an entity

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013145
"
IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022326.txt,"designed to get taxpayers through a particularly difficult period — such as the expiring extender dealing with
mortgage forgiveness. Enacted at the end of 2007 in response to turmoil in the housing market, this
provision was designed to help borrowers who were underwater with their home mortgages: previously, ifa
lender foreclosed on a home and sold it for less than the outstanding indebtedness, the forgiveness of the
unpaid balance generated taxable income for the borrower, as did a renegotiated mortgage that reduced the
outstanding indebtedness. Under this temporary provision, that forgiveness is not considered income —a
welcome result for taxpayers in this unhappy situation.

Yet what about temporary provisions that promote favored tax policies but that don’t respond to a particular
situation? If they're such a good idea, why not make them permanent? This gets to a basic reality:
permanent provisions are more costly than temporary ones. That is because the Joint Committee on
Taxation must use a current law “baseline” when it estimates the revenue impact of tax legislation. Such a
baseline assumes that a temporary measure, such as the mortgage forgiveness mentioned above,
generates only a short-term revenue loss, and will expire as scheduled — even if that is unlikely to occur.
This means that such measures can paint a rosier fiscal picture than is perhaps justified, and can therefore
be a more “cost-effective” way to continue desired tax benefits (and policies), regardless of how inefficient
and counter-productive the resulting uncertainty may be.

These current expiring extenders seem likely to languish — at least for a bit, especially considering that the
House has already recessed for the year. Although Congress has often renewed expiring provisions
retroactively, such a move early next year could take some of the steam out of tax reform (assuming it has a
chance). In addition, despite how inherently worthy these expiring provisions may be, Congress is under
less pressure to pass extenders legislation because of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA)
(Pub. L. 112-240). That is, in addition to making most of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent, ATRA,
which was enacted on January 2, 2013, made the “granddaddy’ of extenders permanent, by permanently
indexing the AMT exemption for inflation, thereby permanently sparing over 25+ million taxpayers from the
AMT, as opposed to the “mere” 4+ million currently affected by it (recall that the earliest incarnation of the
AMT in the late 1960’s was in response to 155 taxpayers who paid no income tax through use of permissible
credits and deductions).

Tax reform — and extenders — are thus moving targets. Even though Rep. Camp and Sen. Baucus, along
with others in Congress, say they would like to address tax reform in 2014, that is a tall order: not only will
members of Congress soon be pre-occupied with the November mid-term elections, there is also that small
matter of the philosophical divide between Republicans and Democrats — Republicans want tax reform to be
revenue-neutral, while Democrats want higher taxes on the top 1% to 2% of taxpayers. Finally, the latest fly
in the ointment is that Sen. Baucus, who is not running for re-election in 2014, reportedly will be nominated
as the next ambassador to China — meaning that he will not complete his final term in office, assuming he is
confirmed. Does this take additional momentum away from the prospect of tax reform in 2014? Arguably
yes, although Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), who could be Sen. Baucus’s successor as Chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee, is also interested in tax reform and has previously put forth bipartisan tax reform
proposals. It will be interesting to see what develops.

End of the year recap

With the end of 2013 upon us, we wanted to highlight a few of the tax and political developments that stood
out to us this year, and that have long-term implications:

ATRA. As mentioned above, the American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) made the AMT “patch” and most of
the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent. It also raised taxes on the top 1% to 2% of taxpayers, in part, by
bringing back the top income tax rate of 39.6% and, for those at that rate, the 20% rate on qualified
dividends and most long-term capital gains. In addition, ATRA reinstated the personal exemption phase-out
and what is generally a 3% limitation on itemized deductions, such as for mortgage interest, state and local

directly about it -- I saw evidence that he felt terrible about it, and I was sure that I could
devastate him by talking about it more. But still... I should have talked to him.

I also feel as though I should have supported her more, but I don't know what I could
have said. There were people who told her that she shouldn't be having a consensual
relationship with her rapist. It seemed wrong to tell her that -- I felt like it eroded her
agency, attacked her right to choose -- so I didn't say it. If I had said it, though, would
that have been helpful to her? What could I have done to be a better resource for her?
Especially given that I was such close friends with him?

I was young(er), but that's no excuse. Then again, what am I excusing? I did nothing. But
I should have done more.

Now, again, I have a friend, a good friend, who assaulted someone. It's a friend in the
local S&M community. I don't know the survivor at all. I have to talk to my friend about
it, but what do I say, and what happens next? Feminism instructs us that we should listen
to the voices of survivors, that community mores and community condemnation are what
stops rape from happening. I believe these things to be true; and there are people close to
me who have survived rape, and I really want to make sure I'm doing everything I can to
ensure that rape stops happening. But I intensely wish that I had more guidance on what
exactly to say, how exactly to act, to change the mores.

I emailed my ex-boyfriend Mr. Chastity for advice, because he's got one of the finest
ethical minds I've ever been lucky enough to engage with. Here's part of what he wrote
back:

I've tried to distill your messages into a few questions, and I ended up with How does
one parse a situation in which a friend, and an otherwise noble person, seems to have
done serious wrong?” and What are a person's moral obligations in this case?

Nobody is composed of unmixed goodness or evil, no matter how much of a
paragon/fiend I) they seem to be or 2) their principles require. People we respect and
love are not forces of nature or avatars of their cause of choice, no matter how
thoroughly they embody it to us. I don't say this because I think you haven't considered it,
but because I know I've had a lot of trouble absorbing it over the years and think it might
therefore bear restating to others, too.

As an individual, a person has a relatively large degree of freedom in action and
association. I think where this case becomes truly difficult to consider is when we bring
in justice and the community. Because the means of enforcement of the rules of these
communities is so interpersonal, one's interpersonal actions take on an unusual role of
community-level justice as well as merely justice between two people. I can't see how it
could ever be good to allow things like this to just slide. Honestly, I'm not sure what else
you can do but (as you suggest in one of your messages) politely ask your friend about
their take on the story. If nothing else, it will demonstrate that people are paying
attention to this thing and might give you some insight into their character and opinions
of the issue.

He's right. I agree. But. What now? How do I ask, what do I say? How can I tell if my

Tom Griffiths

Tom Griffiths is Henry R. Luce Professor of Information, Technology, Consciousness,
and Culture at Princeton University. He is co-author (with Brian Christian) of
Algorithms to Live By.

When you ask people to imagine a world that has successfully, beneficially incorporated
advances in artificial intelligence, everybody probably comes up with a slightly different
picture. Our idiosyncratic visions of the future might differ in the presence or absence of
spaceships, flying cars, or humanoid robots. But one thing doesn’t vary: the presence of
human beings. That’s certainly what Norbert Wiener imagined when he wrote about the
potential of machines to improve human society by interacting with humans and helping
to mediate their interactions with one another. Getting to that point doesn’t just require
coming up with ways to make machines smarter. It also requires a better understanding
of how human minds work.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning have resulted in
systems that can meet or exceed human abilities in playing games, classifying images, or
processing text. But if you want to know why the driver in front of you cut you off, why
people vote against their interests, or what birthday present you should get for your
partner, you’re still better off asking a human than a machine. Solving those problems
requires building models of human minds that can be implemented inside a computer—
something that’s essential not just to better integrate machines into human societies but to
make sure that human societies can continue to exist.

Consider the fantasy of having an automated intelligent assistant that can take on
such basic tasks as planning meals and ordering groceries. To succeed in these tasks, it
needs to be able to make inferences about what you want, based on the way you behave.
Although this seems simple, making inferences about the preferences of human beings
can be a tricky matter. For example, having observed that the part of the meal you most
enjoy is dessert, your assistant might start to plan meals consisting entirely of desserts.
Or perhaps it has heard your complaints about never having enough free time and
observed that looking after your dog takes up a considerable amount of that free time.
Following the dessert debacle, it has also understood that you prefer meals that
incorporate protein, so it might begin to research recipes that call for dog meat. It’s not a
long journey from examples like this to situations that begin to sound like problems for
the future of humanity (all of whom are good protein sources).

Making inferences about what humans want is a prerequisite for solving the AI
problem of value alignment—aligning the values of an automated intelligent system with
those of a human being. Value alignment is important if we want to ensure that those
automated intelligent systems have our best interests at heart. If they can’t infer what we
value, there’s no way for them to act in support of those values—and they may well act in
ways that contravene them.

Value alignment is the subject of a small but growing literature in artificial-
intelligence research. One of the tools used for solving this problem is inverse-
reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is a standard method for training
intelligent machines. By associating particular outcomes with rewards, a machine-

Struggling Havensight merchants see r�nt-abatement
as last chance for them to resuscitate their businesses
By AMANDA NORRIS
Daily News Staff
ST. THOMAS - For mercbants
at Havensight mail, it's summer
time, but the living is anything but
easy.
After being granted six months
offrec rent by the mall's owner, tbe
Governnient Employees Retirement
System, mauy said this has been
the worst off-season they -have
experienced.
They cited a perfect storm of
prolonged road construction in
front of the man, fewer cruise ships
docking in St. Thomas Harbor,
competition from Crown Bay mercbants
and skyrocketing utility
costS.
Whcn tbe GERS board voted to
relieve.the tenants of rent obligations
from July 1 to Dec. 31, tbey.
did so because tenants had accumulated
a delinquency of more than
$2 million and reported tbat tbey
could no longer sustain the cost of
doing business. The board discussed
tbe closure of Dockside
Booksbop, wbich'has announced
tbat it will close witbin tbe next
two weeks aftcI 35 years in
business.
GER·S. Administrator Austin
Nibbs presented tbe board with two
options: forego rent for six months
altogether witb tbe stipulation that
tenants pay all arrearages by April
1 or give tenants a 25 percent
reduction in rent over the next 24
months. Tbe board decided tbe six
month abatement, which would
cost GERS a little more tban $3
million, would be tbe most feasible
way to give tenants a chance to pay'
the $2 million in back rent owed.
I don't like this rent abatement,
but if we want'to continue· to have
tenants, we are· going to have to
belp them, Nibbs said.
At the meeting, some board
members were under the impression
that another Havensight business,
-an office supply store called
The Draugbting Shaft, was also
scheduled to clqse, but. according
to· Th� Draughtiog Sbaft owner,
Terry Robinson, that was never the
case.
Nevertheless, Robinson said, he
bas had discussions witb GERS
board members and attended meetings
to inform them of the adverse
conditions that had caused him to
fall bebind in his rent.
Robinsoo said his business, unlike
ID3I1Y of the boutiques and stores that
cater primarily to tourists, had been
unduly hit by prolonged construction.
with orange bamcades diverting
traffic into and out of the . mall's parking
lots.'

Dockside Bookshop in Havensight Mall is scheduled to close within the next .
two weeks after 35 years in business.
Many of our customers are locals
. and residents, and many have called
and said they just don't want.to come
in because they don't want to deal
with, it, Robinson said of the construction.
Robinson i's among a number of
long-time Havensight merchants who
say they have been in business for
decades but never had to weather

anything quite like tbe last six
months .
I remember in the 80s the slow
season was only three months. now
it is a full six. months, Ram Mirpuri,
president of tbe Havensigbt
Merchants Association said.
Mirpuri's son, Minoj Mirpuri, owns

Ram Mirpuri said he hoped tbe

Havensight Mall merchants say because of the ongoing Long' Bay road
project, rising \1.1. Water and Power Authority bills and other issues that they
, have had their worst off-season ever. The Government Employees R_etirement
System, the mall's owner, has granted the merchants six months of free rent
to help them repay $2 million in . ov.9fdue rent.
---  -
We were almost closing down. ,,(here was no way we
could survive_ We are extremely grateful for 'the
abatement. It will be a big help.
six-month abatement would be the
springboard Havensight merchants
need to recover. If not, about
30 percent of the association's.membership
bad reported that they would
go under this year or the next, he
said.
'The mall has been burting since
Crown Bay opened. We lost about
500,000 passengers because of that,
Mirpuri said. He added tbat the larger
Carnival cruise ships, the Oasis of
the Seas and tbe Allure of the Seas,
dock at Crown Bay, where the harbor
can support them.
Projections are that. with !TIOre
cruise sbips scbeduled tbrough
2014, businesses on tbe brin,k of closure
might be able to use the abatement
to get througb to a breakthrough
season in the winter of
.2014, Mirpuri said.
. Other mercbants said their WAPA
bills had tripled or quadrupled since
they opened, leaving them to wono
der if an abatement would be enough
to counter the rising rates.
WAPA is killing us, Sonny
Panjabi, owner·of the Casa Branca
jewelry store, said. Utility bills total
$3,000 during the busy season, and
- Sonny Panjabi,
jewelry store owner
$2,000 during the slow season, when
hours of operation are cut back, he
said. ' .
We were almost closing down.
There was no way we could swvive.
We are extremely grateful for the
abatement. It will be a big help, be
said.
Since the recession hit, travelers
seem to spend all their money on
the trip itself, and they come with
less disposable income/' according
to Jerry Woodhouse, president of St.
John's Bay Rum, a fragrance company
that supplies otber Havensigbt
stores and has offices be·hind the
mall.
Woodhouse also said that in the
last decade hotels, whicb used to provide
transportation to shopping districts,
have shifted to providing as
many amenities as possible to guests
and have limited the excursions to
beaches ratber than sbopping
districts.
They want to grab as much revenue
as possible per customer while
tbey are staying at tbe bote 1,

Public Services Commission
P'ublic Services Commis.sion
Executive Director Keithley Joseph
testified that it is the commission's
mission's goal to move from being a
government organization that is reactive
to a proactive public policy making
agency with results-based
management.
The Public Services Commission is
primarily funded through assessments
levied on the utilities it regolates.
Joseph testified that the fiscal 2014
budget request from the V.I. government
for the 'commission would be
$1,6io,740. This represents an
increase of $57,373, or 3.54 percent,
from its fiscal 2013 revenu ... ssessment
of $1,563,367. Pursuant to
VIrgin Islands Code establishing the
commission and stipulatiog that it be
100 percent funded by fees levied to
the utilities it regulates, the commission's
budget request reflects what it
needs to maintain operations while it
collects outstanding assess'ment from
communications, water and electric,
and public transportation companies,
Joseph said.
The commission's uncollected revenues
from fiscal 2013 are $384,630,
according to Joseph's testimony.
It·is anticipated that in fiscal 2014,
the commission will collect a total of
$1,620,739 from the V.1. Water and
Power Authority; VITELCO,
Innovative Cable, Varlack Ventures,
Transportation Services and the v.1.
Waste Management Authority, according
to testimony.
A to1al of$I,081,H3 will go toward
personal services and fringes,
according to testimony.
V.I. Economic
Development Authority
V.l. Economic Development
Authority Chief Executive Officer
Percival Clouden requested a General
Fund appropriation of $5,043,274.
This amount represents an increase
of $325,574, or 6.9 percent over the
fiscal 2013 appropriation.
According to Clouden, !lie additional.money·is
needed to match federal
funds for a small business incubator
program, to institute a more
aggre . ssive marketiog strategy for the
E c'o n om i c .of D e ve lop men t
Commission's tax incentive program
and to enhance computer data analys.is
programs for the Economic
Development Commission and'the
lending divisions, according to
Clouden's testimony.
DUring fiscal 2013, the authority
received $2 milliolil in grants from
the United States Department of
Commerce Economic Development
Administration to assist small and
mid-size businesses in the territory.
The authority also relocated its offices
on St. Thomas, realizing a 20 percent
savings rental costs, 48 percent
in utilities and 15 percent in other
related expenses, Clouden said.
Also during fiscal 2013, the
authority realized a 4 percent increase
in collections and saw a 37 percent
decrease in the number.of delinquent

ST. THOMAS - Although a

netted nine unregistered offenders in

still remain at large in the territory.
The Virgin Islands Department of
Justice paIred with local police and
U.S. marshals to sweep the islands
for unregistered sex offenders last
week, primarily targeting ones that
have been convicted within the
Virgin Islands. AU but two local
unregistered offenders .last week
were arrested and charged with fail,

Local police and U.S. Marshals
initially arrested five unregistered
offenders on St. Croix and three. on
St. Thomas in just seven days, and
then arrested another at th¢ very end

What a city owes its reside·nts
Though it is the biggest city in
U.S. history to file for bankruptcy,
Detroit is only one' of 26 urban
municipalities that qave gone into
bankruptcy or state rec�ivership for
fiscal insolvency since 2008. Detroit
should draw attention and debate to
a challenging issue underlying all
these public insolvencies: What
level of public services will we protect
and guarantee for U.S. cities?
The Bankruptcy Court will have
to fa ce that question. It will have to
determine whether Detroit can cut '
into current services any more than
it already has. Unless. the state or
federal government steps in with
funds for operating costs, the bahkruptcy
will function as a zero-sum
game, with residents fighting creditors
for a share of city revenue.
Creditors have contracts to monetize
what they are seeking, but how
should the court detennine the public
spending that residents need
today 'and tomorrow?
Politicians and judges who manage
local fiscal crises speak of
maintaining basic services and
e'nsuring residents' minimal health
and safety, but these concepts are
sbort on specifics. While our laws
provide an entitlement to a public
education, and we have long struggled
to interpret what constitutes a
legally adequate ed�cation, there is
little to nothing that would tell us
what other services the local public
sector must provide.
. As a matter of law, ther,e is no
such thing as a crime rate that is too
high or an ambulance response time
that is too long. Should tbere be?
For now, it is left: to politics and
mora/ judgment to determine whether
it is acceptable that less than one
in three streetlights are operational
in Detroit O( that th� city has 80,000
abandoned and blighted structures
that it cannot afford to demolish. In
Detroit, as in many other struggling
cities, dramatic police layoffs mean
that the average wait time after a
911 call for a police officer is 58 .
minutes, and a resident can rarely
summon an officer at all jf the
. reported crime is not in progress and
violent.
As for other public functions that
a high-poverty city (especially one
with..severe winters) might hope to
have - such as reliable bus service,
playground equipment, indoor
basketball F0urts, after-school programs,
active libraries and community
centers for the elderly - these

services are decades into deep cuts '
and widespread closures. Indeed,
having curtailed everything beyond .
emergency services, it would be
tempting to refer to a government
like Detroit's as a night-watchman
state - the libertarian ideaJ of a
government focused only on publ'ic
. safety,
That is, we'd be tempted 'to use
such a term for Detroit, and cities
like it, were it not such a cruel irony:
Detroit had'more than 15,200 violent
crimes and, 500 acts of arson in
2012. The night watchmen are
understaffed and underpaid.
According to a 2012 study by economists
Aaron' Chalfin and Justin
McCrary, public spending in Detroit
on each police officer (including all .
wages, benefits and retirement costs)
is less than 'two-thirds what it is just
45 miles away in the prosperolls
university town of Ann Arbor.
As a political and moral matter, as
much as a legal one, Detroit represents
an opportunity to take a stand·
for urban habitability. What belongs
on our list of minimum standards for
a city? Detroit invites us to have a
public conversation about what services
and public spaces we expect
from city governments for human
dignity and for humans to flourish,
We have a chance to say that no one
should have to wait hopelessly for
an ambulance, that a violent crime
in a neighborhood every few hours
. is intolerable.
Paying for such commitments
should not just be the burden of
creditors, Many of the city's creditors
are rank-and-file public employees
and reHrees who have counted
on a public pension and are not eligible
for Social Security. Detroit's
bankruptcy plan could send them
into poverty in their old age.
Basic services and safety in our
cities are the responsibility pf
states, the fe deral government, the
private sector and voters. It is all of
them - alt of us - who have a
role to play in the stabilization that
Detroit ·is seeking. through bankruptcy.
All of us have a responsibility
to help them give basic ·health
and safety real meaning, and to
make this bankruptcy a safety net,
not a punisliinent.

were living New Life, not earned by good works as in Hebraic Law, but by faith
through God’s Grace. Jesus had “paid their bills’ through His sacrifice at
Gethsemane. They both tried to explain inexplicable feelings of new energy, the
unseen hand of spiritual guidance and peace. One told me that the wind of the Holy
Ghost had taken him to the front of the pulpit, tearfully, thankfully, on his knees, to
accept Jesus as his personal Savior. They described how they had opened their
lives to the spiritual strength of /iving in Jesus.

Many things about them changed: their tastes in food, from hamburgers to
vegetables and fruit; from the jazz of John Coltrane and McCoy Tyner and the
cynicism of Frank Zappa’s “...only fourteen and knows how to nasty...,” to playing
strum guitar and singing the hymns of Wednesday night healing services; from t-
shirts hanging out of raggedy, Southern California, boutique store purchased,
stressed jeans, to polished dark shoes, starched white shirts and gray or tan khaki
slacks, sometimes with ties. They became cool, respectful, rational and more
distant with me. They repeated often the scriptural story about young Jesus,
accidentally separated from his parents on a visit to Jerusalem. When by standers
asked Him about where His parents were, He answered, “| have no mother and
father.” They told me that they, like God’s son Jesus, were filled to completeness
with the Father and the Holy Ghost.

On one hand, their experiences sounded like those of the activated mind
state of Abraham Abulafia, a suddenly emergent Nevesh and my father’s
metaphysical talks about personal transformation. My personal secular-
computational brain God spoke to me of the mechanisms of sudden personality
change, a phase transition in complex systems, in the context of the nonlinear
dynamics of brain and behavior. On the other hand, their global changes in mind felt
both alien and threatening. When | came to learn their churches’ full list of
expectations, rules, requirements and sociopolitical policies, | found that | could not
identify with this system of spiritual knowing at all. It felt rigid, righteous, unforgiving,
even angry, and it frightened me. | never anticipated that my culturally enriched,

luxury has completely changed,” says Jason Karadus of Town, who is director of sales
for the Charles along with Ginger Brokaw. “A lot of people in the industry smirked at
the pricing — about $2,500 per square foot ... Now it’s not so risky, which is why you’re
seeing companies like Extell building up what’s left to be developed up there.”

Every developable parcel seems to be getting snatched
up. Just take a three-story garage on 302 East 96th
Street, which developer Wonder Works bought in March
for $24 million. On the northernmost border with
Harlem, the developer plans to put up a 21-story, 48-
unit “affordable luxury” condo building — basically
right on the approach to the FDR. (Don’t worry, the
facade will have extra soundproofing.)

“The Second Avenue subway station for 96th street,
which will be one of the first ones opened, is just 200
feet away,” says Eric Brody, Wonder Works’ managing
partner, who adds that brokers are recommending
asking prices of $1,500 to $2,300 per square foot when
units go on sale next year. “The buyer is anyone who
can’t afford to be in all these downtown neighborhoods,
but still wants to live in the city and have incredibly
close access to a train.”

First look! Once a three-story Public transit of the future is why Andrew Ellis bought
garage, 302 E. 96th St. will become

a 21-story luxury condo.

Then came a massive year-long renovation that updated the windows and kitchen
appliances. He also completely redid the backyard, adding a rear deck and koi pond. In
Yorkville, Ellis discovered a “neighborhood feel” that was a far cry from the raucous
scrum of Murray Hill, where he had been renting.

“Thad sort of grown out of that,” says Ellis, who is no longer alone in his move uptown.
“My high school friends and some college friends are migrating to the Upper East Side.
One is two doors down, literally, and two others are a few blocks away. Having that
subway there eventually is really what did it for me. This place can only go up.”

Texas Billionaire's Heirs Save Some Money on 
Taxes 
10Jun 27, 2014 1:26 PM EDT 
By Matt Levine 
• a 
• A 
Every so often I hear a story that I find rather wonderful, and that I then pass along to you, just in case you and I 
share a similar sense of wonder. Here is one of those stories. It's about death and taxes. 
The story begins on Dec. 28 of last year, when a Dallas billionaire named Harold Simmons died at the age of 
82. He left the bulk of his $8 billion fortune to two of his daughters. Much of that fortune was in Contran 
Corp., a closely held entity that holds majority stakes in four publicly traded companies: Valhi Inc., NL 
Industries Inc., Kronos Worldwide Inc. and CompX International Inc. 
The biggest chunk of the estate was Contran's 93.8 percent stake in Valhi, which was 318,156,746 shares.' 
Valhi's stock closed on Dec. 27, 2013, at $14.91 per share, making that stake worth about $4.7 billion as of 
Simmons's death. Another 2,481,900 Valhi shares (0.7 percent, $37 million) were held by the Harold Simmons 
Foundation, a charity controlled by Simmons's daughters.2 Other family members owned about 2.8 million 
shares ($41 million). Public shareholders owned about 15.7 million shares ($234 million).3 
Here are two facts about the federal estate tax: 
• The estate tax rate for 2013 and 2014 is 40 percent of the value of the estate. 
• The executor can choose to determine the value of the estate either on the date of death, or on the 
alternate valuation date, which is the date six months after the date of death.5 
For Harold Simmons's estate, that alternate valuation date is tomorrow -- six months from his death. Today is 
the last trading day before that valuation. How's Valhi done in the last six months?

Source: Bloomberg 
Oh.6 The stock closed yesterday at $6.01, reducing the value of the estate's holdings by $2.8 billion -- and its 
estate-tax liability by $1.1 billion -- since Simmons's death. 
Is that good news or bad news for the estate? Well, the first law of tax is that it is always better to have more 
money than less money.' It's not actually a good idea to lose $2.8 billion of money to save $1.1 billion in taxes. 
Though the estate didn't exactly lose $2.8 billion of money. That tax liability is a cash expense: You've actually 
got to write a check to the IRS for $1.9 billion (using the December valuation) or $765 million (using 
yesterday's valuation), so the $1.1 billion you save is an actual cash savings. The $2.8 billion loss, on the other 
hand, is a paper loss. Perhaps it's just temporary. If there were some reason to think that it didn't reflect only a 
decline in the fundamental value of Valhi, you might not worry as much about that paper loss as you would 
about the cash taxes. 
So what's happened to Valhi? Well, it's not having a great year, with zero-ish net income last quarter. The board 
reduced the dividend by 60 percent, to its lowest level since 2005. And the few people who follow the stock are 
unimpressed. Bloomberg shows two analysts following Valhi, Barclays and EVA Dimensions. They both have 
sell ratings, and Barclays has a price target of $5.00, saying in May that from a SOTP analysis, we continue to 
view VHI as trading above its intrinsic value. A Seeking Alpha piece from a few weeks ago is similarly 
gloomy, with a $6 per share fair value. 
All of this suggests that Simmons's estate owes less tax because it's really worth less than it was six months ago. 
In fact, if you taxed Simmons's heirs now based on the value of Valhi six months ago, they'd have almost 
nothing left of their stock. 
But there's one more bit of the story. On June 11, about two weeks ago, the Harold Simmons Foundation -- the 
charitable foundation controlled by Simmons's heirs -- filed with the SEC a plan to sell all of its 2.5 million 
shares. That's not a lot of stock, exactly -- just 0.7 percent of the company, worth around $16 million at the time 
of the filing -- but it is a lot relative to the usual volume of trading in Valhi. Remember, 93.8 percent of Valhi is 
owned by Simmons's heirs and never trades. Between December 27, 2013, and June 10, 2014, Valhi traded an 
average of 42,311 shares a day, so the foundation's shares represented almost 59 days' volume. 
It sold them in 11 days:

filings, Bloomberg 
The foundation's sales over the last two weeks or so accounted for over half of the volume, on average, each 
day. And the foundation's average sale on each of those days was more than five times the average volume over 
the previous six months. From Jan. 1 to June 10 of this year, more than five months, Valhi traded a total of 4.6 
million shares. From June 11 to June 25, just over two weeks, it traded a total of 4.8 million shares -- more than 
half of them sold by the Harold Simmons Foundation. 
You might expect that to drive down the stock a bit? Actually the stock performed surprisingly well, all things 
considered; it closed on June 10 at $6.42 and on June 25 at $5.81, down just 9.5 percent. But just that change, 
from $6.42 per share to $5.81, would save Simmons's heirs almost $80 million in estate taxes.9 
The foundation sold the last of its shares on June 25 (this Wednesday). Without any more shares to sell, the 
foundation -- oh, wait, no, never mind, the foundation found some more shares to sell! On Wednesday, the day 
that it finished selling its 2.5 million shares, it received a Gift from Affiliate of another 900,000 shares. Those 
shares were gifted to the foundation by the Valhi Holding Company, the vehicle through which Simmons's heirs 
own their 318.2 million shares:0 
The Foundation immediately filed a plan to sell those shares too, with an approximate date of sale of June 26 
(yesterday). As of 1 p.m. today, I see Valhi trading in the $5.80s. 
Isn't that neat? Honestly, I have no idea what's going on here.12 But if you did want to minimize your estate 
taxes on a multi-billion-dollar controlled public corporation with an illiquid stock, a good way to do it would be 
to have a foundation that you control dump a ton of stock on the market in the couple of weeks leading up to the 
day your estate is valued for tax purposes -- and, when the foundation ran out of shares, give it a few more so it 
could keep selling. If the goal of this trading isn't to minimize taxes, I'll be very disappointed. Because it's 
working pretty well to do just that. 
1 That's based on a Schedule 13D/A referring to events of Dec. 28, 2013, but filed in February 2014 and mentioning a stock transfer 
after Simmons's death (In January 2014, Contran received as excess collateral 1,100,541 Shares from the CDCT (as defined below) 
and contributed 4,123,598 Shares to Dixie Rice, who contributed such shares on the same day to VHC.') I ignore that and assume 
that Contran owned all of the 318.2 million shares as of December 28; the difference is small. 
2 From the 13D/A again: 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029346 
The Foundation is a tax-exempt foundation organized for charitable purposes. Lisa K Simmons and Serena Simmons Connelly are the 
sole members of the Foundation, serve as two of the three the directors on the Foundation's board of directors and are the president 
and executive vice president, respectively of the Foundation. They may be deemed to control the Foundation but disclaim all Shares 
they do not hold directly. 
3 From a current Bloomberg HDS list I see BlackRock, Dimensional, Calpers, Fidelity and Citadel among the big-name holders, 
though all in fairly small size. 
Incidentally, Simmons had other daughters who seem to have been frozen out of Valhi. Here is a 1997 New York Times story about 
Simmons with the headline Daughters Do Battle With a Corporate King Lear. So. 
Minus an exemption that, compared to the size of Simmons's estate, is very very small (single-digit millions). 
5 This election only works if the estate has kept the property for the six months. Here's an Internal Revenue Service bulletin on the 
topic.

To be fair, Simmons was the chairman of the board in 2013, though the company was managed by a chief executive officer, Steven L. 
Watson, who remains in charge. 
I've cited my tax professor's two fundamental laws of tax before: that it is always better to have more money than less money, and 
that it is always better to die later than to die sooner. The second rule is always relevant in estate-tax situations too. 
I'm using yesterday for convenience but in fact you'd have to use today's valuation. And the stock is down again today! 
9 That is, 318.2 million shares times $0.61 per share times 40 percent is $77.6 million. 
Now 317.3 million, I guess. 
11 You shouldn't take that date too seriously; the foundation's June II filing stated an approximate date of sale of June 11, but it 
actually took about two weeks. Best guess, the foundation was/is selling those shares yesterday and today. 
12 Do I even need to tell you that Simmons was a libertarian anti-tax advocate, had various run-ins with the IRS, and called President 
Barack Obama the most dangerous man in America? Or that In 2009, a Dallas County jury found NL Industries -- one of the 
companies in Simmons's estate -- liable for not honoring contractual agreements and manipulating stock values?

was eager when he actually gave me a compliment. The rest of the
evening was always a surprise left up to a moments notice. Quite
regularly he would proceed with having the girls dress me up in some
sexy outfit and loads of makeup then entertain him with a lesbian
reenactment revolving him in the center. Sometimes they would use
dildos and other foreign sex toys, Ron liked to see us hurt during sex,
sometimes even penetrating me anally but I always resisted and would try
to redirect him with another sexual desire of his but I had no excuses
when it came to me having to use the sex toys on him, he told me how
men have g-spots in their rectum and instructed me on how to precisely
penetrate him. These nights went on what seemed like an eternal sentence
for the price of not living on the streets, where unfortunately for the one’s
still there, | feared and knew from my own personal experience, could be
much worse.

Needing some contact with someone of my adolescent mentality I
called one of my school friends from the past, whom I wont name out of
privacy, but PI call him T.J. We were so close and I knew very well, so
well, I had memorized his number a long time before. He was my first
puppy love sprung from of a childhood friendship. Being my very first
crush the summer before all of this happened he was the only person I
could think of that would care enough to talk to me.

In the middle of the day, the least busy time to be noticed, I snuck into
one of the vacant guest rooms and used the phone to call my good friend.
The sound of my voice radiated a chill in him. “It’s you, oh my God
Jenna! Are you okay?” he was so shocked to hear from me and the sheer
fact I was still alive. Nearly three months now without a single word to
my family or friends, every one doubted my return. My attempt to forge a
happy voice when I spoke to him failed and | absolutely crumbled when
he was at a loss for kind words for me. | told him of my current state of
affairs. Telling him of Ron and how I was terrified of him, trying to
escape in the middle of nowhere was useless. It was like being kept in
cage that I was unable to break free from. Going on to dump my issues on
T.J, I proceeded with how I longed to call my family and to be with my
them for good but was too afraid they didn’t want me, knowing I’d just
be sent away somewhere else again and to me after all this time was like
going from one cage to another.

He had been called by them numerously and promised me that they
were very worried and even hired private investigators to try and find me.
Given I was eleven years old the first time I was sent away, my trust in
there sincerity he spoke about was seriously doubted. | kept the
conversation short just in case my absence was being noticed and I left on

possible. | thought he was just trying to help in someway. Giving him
assurance in the fact I had survived this long obviously I can hold offa
while longer I gave him my love and told him I'd be in touch.

Thinking I had slipped away unnoticed I entered into the room that I
shared with Ron, hoping I got away with my brief and very needed phone
call. The place looked empty and everyone else seemed to be out and
about so I decided to have a bath in the spa and try to relax before the
night’s precautions. My body glided into the steamy water as I began to
think about T.J and how good it felt just to hear from a friendly voice. My
thoughts drifted into the days | missed when I felt | could be silly and
childlike and I nearly forgot for a moment how grown up | was acting
these days.

My first glimpse at the image surrounding me when | resurfaced above
the water was daunting. There was Ron was standing over my tub,
looking down at me with an eager display of his arousal. He began to
undo his pants and take them down when he told me “put your lips on my
cock”, [ was too slow in responding to his request so he grabbed me by
the back of the head and forced me into his groin. I had tears streaming
down my face as I looked up to him with the saddest blue eyes hoping he
would take pity and stop, but he never did. I was really hurt by his
aggression and he definitely knew it this time, which I believe only made
him more heated. I closed my eyes and began to count using the time to
keep my thoughts elsewhere believing every number I counted only
furthered me to the end of this. I just got over a hundred when he finally
exploded in fulfillment still half submerged in the deep bath I was
struggling to gain my bearings in as Ron was picked me up out of the
bath and carried me to go to the bedroom, which was just outside the
French adjoin doors. Still damp from the hot water in the spa I had goose
bumps from the chill of the fresh air where he brought me to the bed and
proceeded to deeply violate my every being. Eventually his scars that he
left were too deep ever to be healed and would even carry on through the
years to come.

Upon his bursting with pleasure for the second time, he just got up
and left, without even saying a word to me. Left alone I was awake for
hours after that. There was no escaping the pain that night. I lay naked
wrapped in the sheets, sobbing in the dark. My feelings of being hurt and
disgusted after his abusive ordeal ““When will it ever stop” | prayed to
God and begged for death rather than face another day in my life. | woke
up still alone the next day and exasperated from the misery I felt the night
before. Ushering through my drawers to find something to throw on |
could care less what lay in store for me today, couldn’t be as bad as being
raped by a scary man repeatedly.

more strongly what I’d told Leah by phone from New York after hearing
Yitzhak was dead: his murder would leave a huge hole — in me, in all Israelis.
He was an extraordinary mix of qualities: a brave officer, first in the pre-state
Palmach and then the new Israeli army; a chief of staff and defense minister at
critical periods in our history. Shy, even at times uncertain or hesitant, and
naturally cautious. Decisive, too, when he felt that he, and Israel, needed to be:
whether on Entebbe, or the prospect, with all its risks, of launching an operation
to kill Saddam Hussein. Humane, too: ready to negotiate with terrorists to save
the lives of those they were planning to kill, unless he was confident our
soldiers could save them first. Underpinning it all was a dedication to fighting
and defeating Isael’s enemies, yet a mindfulness that the real victory, if and
when it was possible, would be genuine peace with our neighbors. He and I had
had differences over particular policies: leaving our troops in Lebanon, for
instance, or more recently the architecture of Oslo. But I never doubted that we
were lucky to have Yitzhak leading Israel on the inevitably fraught road to a
negotiated peace. I never ceased to believe there was no politician more suited
to the role: that he would do everything he could to achieve it, yet would step
back if he saw that he was putting Israel’s security at risk.

On Sunday evening, Peres called a cabinet meeting in the kirya. He said our
task was to continue what Rabin had begun, and that at least for now he would
fill Rabin’s shoes not just as Prime Minister but Defense Minister as well. The
whole country stood still, shocked, until the state funeral two days after the
assassination. It was attended by dozens of leaders from around the world. My
role was to escort King Hussein and Queen Noor. On our drive into Jerusalem,
we passed the Old City walls. We were barely a mile from the stone terrace,
above the Western Wall of our ancient temple, where the golden Dome of the
Rock and the Al-Aqsa mosque stand. I knew Hussein had been there as a boy
when his grandfather, King Abdullah, was shot and killed by a Palestinian amid
rumors he was contemplating peace with Israel. Now, Rabin had been
murdered, by an Israeli. “To me, it’s like the closing of a circle,” Hussein said.
“Those who are murdered because they are not extreme enough. Because they
look for normalcy, and peace.”

PERVERSION OF JUSTICE 
Saturday, March 2, 2019 
Federal prosecutors admit backing down 
Epstein's attorneys applied relentless pressure, they say 
tliTaild` 
In recent court filings, the government was 
fore. to ans,Aer questions about its negotia-
tions, fin.ly admitting in 2013 that federal 
prosecutors had back. down under relentless 
pressure by Jeffrey Epstein, attomeys. 
The government admits that, at least in part 
as a result of objections lodg. by Epstein, law-
yers to victim notifications, the [Unit. States 
Attorney, Office] teev.uated its obligations 
to provide notification to victims and Jane Doe 
it 1 was thus not told that the 
USAO had entered into a

;A

Francey Hakes, the 
former feder. prosecutor 
I have never heard of a case 
where feder. prosecutors 
consult with a defense at-
Kenneth torney before they send out 
Starr standard victim notification 
letters. To negotiate what 
the letters ,rnuld say and whether they Aould be 
sent at all suggest that the victims' rights were 
violated mukiple times. 
Kenneth Staff, aggressive advocacy for 
Epstein against allegations of improper sexual 
behavior was in stark contr. to the path he 
took investigating President Bill Clinton as 
independent counsel for the Whitewater probe. 
The Starr Report, the summary of his find-
ings in the Whitewater investigation, which 
start. as a probe of a land deal gone sour and 
veer. into an investigation of sexu. miscon-
duct, savag. the president for his involvement 
with White House intern Monica Lewinslcy and 
was the basis for impeachment 
Starr himself Amid face criticism in 2016 - 
he stepp. down as president of Baylor Univer-
sity amid .legations that he and other university 
officials mishandled sexual assault allegations 
brought by fem.e students against members of 
the school, footb.I team. 
The Miami Herald reach. out to Starr, 
though cettifi. letter and through a spokesmail 
for his current law finn, the Lanier Finn, but did 
not receive a response for this story. 
Palm Beach police detective Joseph Recarey, 
one of the most highly decorat. officers on 
the P.m Beach Police Department, call. the 
Epstein case the most troubling of his 23-year 
career. 
Some of the victims were - and still are - 
afraid of Epstein:. he said as part of a series of 
interviews with the Her.d earlier this year. 
Privately, Michael Reiter and Recarey said 
they held onto hope that Epstein would be 
brought to trial someday, but they said that that 
notion had fad.. 
I always hop. that the plea would be 
drown out and that these teenage girls, who 
were labeled as prostitutes by prosecutors, 
would get to fmally shed that label and see him 
go to prison where he belongs:. Recarey said. 
Recarey died in May after a brief illness. He

Jeffrey Edward Epstein appeared at his

County Coutthouse dress. comfortably in a 
blue blazer, blue shirt, jeans and gray sneakers. 
His attorney, Jack Goldberger, was at his side.

At the end of the 68-minute hearing, the 
55-year-old silver-haired financier - accus. 
of sexually abusing dozens of underage girls 
- was fingerprinted and handcuffed, just like 
any other crimin. sentenced in Florida. 
But inmate No. W35755 would not be

Epstein would pay the girls for massages and 
offer them further money to bring him new 
girls every time he was at his home in P.m 
Beach, according to police reports. 
The girls, now in their late 20s and early 
30s, allege in a series of f.eral civil lawsuits 
fil. during the last decade that Epstein sexu-
.ly abused hundreds of girls, not only in P.m

what an American president's foreign
policy is likely to be, particularly in a
second term, don't listen to his State of the
Union speech. You'd probably have more
luck playing with Tarot cards, or reading
tea leaves or goat entrails. But not this year.
Barack Obama's fourth such address left a
trail of foreign-policy cookie crumbs that
lead directly to some pretty clear, if hardly
surprising or revolutionary, conclusions.
His first term contained no spectacular
successes (save killing Osama bin Laden),
but no spectacular failures either. And
more than likely, that's what the president
will settle for in a second, even as the Arab
world burns and rogues like Iran and North
Korea brandish new weapons. He's nothing
if not a cautious man.

Behold: I am the Extricator in Chief

Afghanistan -- the good war -- has been
pretty much MIA in Obama's speeches
since he became president. He's alternated
between spending a few words on the
mission there (2009) or a paragraph (2010,
2011, 2012). If his words have been brief,
the message has been stunningly clear: It's
about the leaving. And tonight was no
exception. Not more than two minutes in,
the president spoke about America's men
and women coming home from
Afghanistan.

My Fantasy Sex-Positive, Anti-Abuse Program

You can tell from the above list that relevant community efforts have focused on raising
internal awareness, consolidating useful information, and educating. If I were to get a
grant or something (ha!), I would certainly look for ways to use it on a dedicated pro-sex,
anti-abuse initiative, hopefully more expansive than a hotline, and considerably more
extensive than a pamphlet. I've never developed this thought too extensively -- I hate to
torture myself when I know there's no money for one of my ideas -- but I know I'd want
my Dream Anti-Abuse Team to have the following qualities:

* BDSM is obviously my main interest, because that's how I identify the core of my
sexuality. But I have a strong interest in destigmatizing all forms of sexual expression
practiced by consenting adults. Everyone involved in my initiative would emphasize that
people of all genders and sexualities could come for help -- whether straight, gay,
lesbian, bi, trans, asexual, BDSM, sex worker, polyamorous, swing, or whatever
amazing fetish could conceivably come up.

Ideally, I would personally try to shock the hell out of anyone before I agreed to work
with them... because anyone whose face twists up or who gasps at the idea of any kind of
consensual weird sex is a person who shouldn't be anywhere near altsexual abuse
survivors.

* I'd want destigmatizing alternative sexuality among the mainstream, especially
mainstream anti-abuse organizations, to be a major focus -- so that abuse survivors
could feel less anxious about being misunderstood while seeking help. So I'd need people
who were willing to go out and charismatically shock the abuse officers at police stations,
feminist organizations, college campuses, etc. I'd want us to be running everything from
anti-stigma poster campaigns to sex communication workshops.

* I'd want the program to be well-advertised to the general public, so that people who
aren't in the community -- yet who are practicing S&M _ or poly or whatever on their
own -- could still find us.

* Of course we'd also do the more traditional work of offering walk-in counseling to
abuse survivors, including help making a concrete plan, altsexual-friendly legal advice,
and so on.

So.

Anyone willing to fund my Dream Team?

The CIA also had its share of long-term successes, such as Alex-
ander Poteyev, who fed the CIA secrets for over ten years while
burrowing into Russian intelligence. In the choreography of these
operations, as in Le Carré’s fiction, rival intelligence services ensnared
and sacrificed recruits, as if playing a chess game, to advance their
moles. Despite notable successes such as Felfe and Poteyev, a great
number of these elaborate conspiracies fail to insinuate a mole into
their adversaries’ confidence. Intelligence services therefore also
take advantage of a more prosaic source: the self-generated spy, or,
as they are called in the trade, a “walk-in.”

Although they are largely unsung in novels, these walk-ins are an
important part of espionage. A counterespionage review done for the
Presidential Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) in 1990
found that most U.S. spies in the Cold War had taken documents on
their own volition and only afterward offered them to an adversary
service. Self-generated spies have diverse motives. Some intelligence
workers steal secrets for financial gain. Others take them to further
an ideological interest. As opportunistic enterprises, intelligence ser-

© vices do not turn walk-ins away if they have valuable intelligence. ©
Indeed, some of the most successful moles were not recruited, or even
controlled, by spy agencies. They were self-generated penetrations,
or “espionage sources,” as the KGB preferred to call them, who first
stole secrets and later voluntarily delivered them to an adversary.

Hanssen, who successfully penetrated the FBI for the Russian
intelligence services from 1979 to 2001, according to the assessment
of a 2002 presidential commission, had caused “the worst intelli-
gence disaster in US history.” Eleven years later, George Ellard, a
former NSA inspector general who had been a member of that com-
mission, compared Hanssen with Snowden “in that they both used
very well-honed IT abilities to steal and disclose classified informa-
tion vital to our national security.”

It is also possible to exploit a walk-in even after he has left his
service. For example, the KGB major Anatoliy Golitsyn was an ideo-
logical self-generated spy who walked into the U.S. embassy in Hel-
sinki on December 15, 1961. He asked to see the CIA officer on duty
and announced to him that he had collected a trove of KGB secrets,
including information that could identify its key spies in the West.

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021161.txt,"types of people. Their friendships and partnerships can change like the
weather.

I went home that night still confused on how I could let myself sink so
low, I had to put on an act like I enjoyed submitting my body and being
their new subservient plaything all for the fact that I was making
anywhere between $200-$400 for just a couple of hours. Then spent the
rest of the night regressing on the entire event in my head over and over
again. I battled those thoughts with the hope that I was receiving a
profession out of this and making good money in the meantime. Al! I had
to do was keep lying to myself long enough until I eventually believed it.

Arriving at Jeffrey’s on time the next afternoon, as I always did,
understanding punctuality was a sign of respect and I wanted them to feel
as if they had my deepest appreciation for the once in a lifetime chance
they had given to a girl of my history. This time when Juan answered the
door he told me Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell were waiting for me
upstairs in the massage room. I began my hike up the familiar spiraling
staircase and through to the room where my arrival was being deeply
anticipated. They were already in the steam room awaiting me to join
them. I undressed out of my uniform and folded them in a neat pile,
which I placed upon the marble basin. Having one last look in the mirror
before | exhaling a deep breath as if I was plunging into deep water, I
knew today was a big day. | either accepted their offer and trade my
morals for opportunity, or walk away with the prospect of one day many
years from now trying to make it on my own which I knew endowed
hardships of there own.

So confused about what decision to make, I just opened the door to the
steam room and let them do the talking. Used to the routine by now I sat
below Jeffrey and began to massage his feet and legs as I listened in on
their ongoing conversation about travel plans for the next few weeks.
Ghislane and Jeffrey turned their attention to me and he asked me how
would I like to go see the big city of Manhattan. I told them I had never
visited New York before and it sounded like an adventure but my job at
Mar-A-Lago was only a summer job and wouldn’t be able to get the time
off, especially that summer was so busy anyways.

Jeffrey then made his announcement, that I should just quit my job at
Mar-a-Lago and become his permanent travelling masseuse. He then
further persuaded me with all of the luxuries that came along with my
acceptance. Rather than being paid $9 dollars per hour at my current job I
could be earning $200 dollars per massage, which he even said could be a
few times a day. Tomorrow we could be leaving Palm Beach together in
his private jet first heading to his residence in the upper east side of
Manhattan, also the largest mansion in N.Y, and would next be setting off
to the Caribbean, where he owned a secluded island just past Little St.

James for a bit of relaxation. The temptation of his grandeur offer wasn’t
hard to give into, my vulnerability to be lewd into his grasp seemed
comforting at the time. The idea that females were nothing more than an
empty shell of beauty bound by only a body to offer was a notion I had
accepted a long time ago with my first teacher, Ron.

My reaction had to be more than amusing for their egos, even though I
was excited to be traveling | could only imagine the likeliness of having
to be at their beckon call as well. In my head I just told myself we all do
what we have to do in our lives to succeed no matter what it takes, and
with no one knowing the truth, I had no one to talk me out of it.
accepted his offer and knew from here on out 1 would be his servant to
his sexual desires until one day 1 would gain my credentials and only then
could I go out on my own and make it in this world that when so young
seems so unconquerable. The night advanced into the usual grooming of
his requirements, for the next hour and a half being exploited to satisfy
Jeffrey’s every sexual whim.

My mom cornered me that night, before I had a chance to avoid
speaking to anyone, heading to the shower then my bedroom, like [ had
been the last week. She knocked at my door with a hostile look in her
eyes, “ Virginia, what exactly does an older couple want with a fifteen
year old girl, who has no credentials and with no experience in massage
therapy?” She used that stern tone of voice that she’s always had, when |
was in trouble.

Thus, as impressionable as I was, my blue eyes batted their innocence
in her direction and I flashed her a girlish grin selling her the pitch that |
had been given earlier that night. Not mentioning the other side to the
glamorous lifestyle I would soon be living in. I told her about the money
I'd be earning, the places I’d be seeing, the people 1 could meet and most
of all the trade I’d be learning. It all sounded so good, except it was a
bunch of lies I had to tell her and myself to otherwise convince us, that
this was a once in a lifetime opportunity, and I had to take it.

She asked when all of this would start, and I as shocking as it was to me
too, | told her I had to go start packing. We were leaving the next
morning off to N.Y.C. At fifteen most girls would be sucking up to their
parents to go to a high-school dance or to go on a date to the movies with
anervous chap, but I wasn’t even asking her. I was simply letting her
know that I would be away for the next couple weeks, maybe three and
would keep in contact when | got free time. Her daughter was lost a long
time ago, and she just now realized it. Backing out of the bathroom, with
nothing she could say, she left me wondering to myself who | was
becoming.

Instead of driving me to work the next morning my Dad dropped me off
at Jeffrey’s mansion, he told me not to worry about calling Mar-A-Lago,

of de-escalation. But if it didn’t, the air strikes would intensify. The aim was not
target the nearly 250,000 Lebanese civilians who lived in the immediate border
area. It was to use our attacks, along with leaflet drops and radio messages, to
encourage them to flee north. My assessment was that this would bring pressure
on the Lebanese government and, through the Lebanese, on the real power in
Lebanon, the Syrians. I doubted Damascus would respond directly by telling
Hizbollah to cease fire. I did believe they’d be ready to engage with American
efforts to stop the fighting, and that Rabin and the government could then secure
terms we were prepared to accept.

On July 25, we began our heaviest air strikes since 1982. Far from producing
a sign of a climb-down by Hizbollah, it responded with intensified rocket fire.
We escalated over the following 24 hours, but still with no indication of any
change from Hizbollah. So as planned, we expanded our bombing to wider
areas of south Lebanon. Sadly, some Lebanese civilians were killed, which I’m
sure was a much greater cause of concern to us than to Hizbollah. Thankfully,
however, the majority fled north. In south Lebanon, this meant that our jets and
artillery had much greater freedom of operation against Hizbollah, which had
now lost its human shields. In Beirut, a government suddenly overwhelmed
with the need to provide shelter for the large number of refugees from the
fighting did press Syrian President Assad to help bring it to an end. Critically,
the new Clinton Administration, especially Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, reinforced that message.

Our military operation lasted just a week. It did not end Hizbollah attacks on
Israeli troops in the security zone, something I think even most Israelis were
coming to realize was impossible as long as our soldiers remained in Lebanon.
But the rocket attacks on northern Israel did stop, with very few exceptions, for
a period that lasted nearly two years.

The intifada, however, had not stopped. Nor, as I knew from my increasingly
frequent meetings with Rabin, had the search for a way both to control the
violence, and seek out any realistic prospect of a political path to resolving our
conflict with our Arab neighbors.
