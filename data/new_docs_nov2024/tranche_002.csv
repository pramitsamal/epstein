Expressions that deliberately disrupt a speaker with whom one disagrees

The Bruce Franklin case also included this alleged exception to the First Amendment—namely,
that although there is a constitutional right to heckle speakers (at least in some context), there is
no such right to silence a speaker by shouting him down. When Henry Cabot Lodge came to
speak at Stanford in January 1971, he was shouted down with cries of “pig” and “war criminal,”
and then drowned out by continuous chanting and clapping. Eventually, the program had to be
canceled (just as a similar program had been canceled several years earlier at Harvard.) Franklin
participated in the shouting but denied complicity in the chanting and clapping that brought the
program to an untimely end.

The ACLU brief that I filed vigorously disagreed with Franklin’s contention that there is a “right”
to silence a speaker who is deemed to be a “war criminal”:
“(If the Board concludes that Professor Franklin intentionally engaged in concerted
activity designed to silence Ambassador Lodge—that is, to prevent him from speaking at
all—then it is the Civil Liberties Union’s position that some discipline would be
appropriate.”

It defended, however, Franklin’s right to heckle, boo, and express displeasure at the speaker of
disagreement with his views. If members of the audience may cheer and applaud approval, they
must also have a coextensive right to demonstrate disapproval:

“The rule of thumb [is] that the speaker’s entire address must be allowed to be heard, but
it may be frequently interrupted, so long as he is permitted to continue a short time after
each interruption. This rule does not make for the most comfortable or effective oratory,
but the American Civil Liberties Union believes it to be the constitutionally required
balance...”

The Stanford Committee followed the ACLU guidelines and concluded that Franklin had not tried
to prevent Lodge from speaking.

Forty years later, I tried to get the Southern California branch of the ACLU to apply these same
guidelines to another case involving the disruption of a speaker who had been invited by a
university—this time the University of California at Irvine, a public university. But its leaders
refused to do so, because they disapproved of the speaker and favored the politics of those who
were trying to silence him. First, some background.

There is a growing international campaign to prevent pro-Israel advocates, who have been invited
to speak at universities, from delivering their speeches. The method used to silence these speakers
and preclude their audiences from hearing their message is exemplified by what occurred at the
University of California at Irvine.

Michael Oren -- a distinguished scholar and writer, a moderate supporter of the two-state
solution, and now Israel's Ambassador to the United States -- was invited to speak. The Muslim
Student Union set out to prevent him from delivering his talk. Here is the way Erwin
Chemerinksy, Dean of the law school, described what the students did:

interpretation by experts employing various explicit or implicit
models, the most prominent of which casts the regime as a “rational
actor” that calculates risks and rewards like any Western state. In this
model the highest goal is regime survival, a notion that doesn’t
necessarily apply to the Iranian clerical regime. Clerics, even
Christian ones from an earlier age, have been known to take their
otherworldly prerogatives seriously.

All we can say, then, is that the regime would not try to martyr itself,
nor would it be passive. Most likely, Iran would seek to prolong and
expand the war, attrite U.S. forces and morale, and weaken the
resolve of coalition members. Iran has the means, methods and allies
with which to respond in this fashion, and it has made clear that it
would use them.9

Important Iranian conventional war assets include short- and medium-
range missiles; strike aircraft; missile-equipped naval combatants and
small boats; naval mine-laying capabilities; regular army and IRGC
special forces; and air defense and coastal defense missiles. These
conventional capabilities provide Iran a substantial ability for a local
fight in the Strait of Hormuz, the Persian Gulf and along its
borders.10 Iran “leans” on the Persian Gulf states from a military and
political perspective. Shi‘a populations in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia
could be a useful resource and environment for terrorist and irregular
operations.

While the Iranian military is at its most dangerous close to its
frontiers, we are not “safe” from it anywhere. Missile systems
(principally the Shahab 3 variants and Seyjjl types) allow Iran to strike
targets throughout the Middle East, including population centers,
military facilities, infrastructure and U.S. forces based in the
region.11 Iranian missile numbers and launchers are limited, but Iran
has other means of waging a global conflict, including its allies. For
instance, Iran would likely attempt to induce Hizballah to attack

in Czechoslovakia is turning out to be apt in another way. For all the
attention the Mideast protests have received, their most notable
impact on the region thus far hasn't been an upswell of democracy. It
has been a dramatic spike in tensions between two geopolitical titans,
Iran and Saudi Arabia.

This new Middle East cold war comes complete with its own spy-
versus-spy intrigues, disinformation campaigns, shadowy proxy
forces, supercharged state rhetoric—and very high stakes.

The cold war is a reality, says one senior Saudi official. Iran is
looking to expand its influence. This instability over the last few
months means that we don't have the luxury of sitting back and
watching events unfold.

On March 14, the Saudis rolled tanks and troops across a causeway
into the island kingdom of Bahrain. The ruling family there, long a
close Saudi ally, appealed for assistance in dealing with increasingly
large protests. Iran soon rattled its own sabers. Iranian
parliamentarian Ruhollah Hosseinian urged the Islamic Republic to
put its military forces on high alert, reported the website for Press
TV, the state-run English-language news agency. I believe that the
Iranian government should not be reluctant to prepare the country's
military forces at a time that Saudi Arabia has dispatched its troops to
Bahrain, he was quoted as saying.

The intensified wrangling across the Persian—or, as the Saudis insist,
the Arabian—Gulf has strained relations between the U.S. and
important Arab allies, helped to push oil prices into triple digits and
tempered U.S. support for some of the popular democracy
movements in the Arab world. Indeed, the first casualty of the Gulf
showdown has been two of the liveliest democracy movements in
countries right on the fault line, Bahrain and the turbulent frontier
state of Yemen. But many worry that the toll could wind up much

Syria as Turkey’s domestic issue

Yusuf Kanli

May 15, 2011 -- Syria is no Libya for many reasons; not just because
it is a country right on the Turkish border or, like Turkey, it has a
Kurdish population and an explosion there may ignite an explosion
on this side of the border as well.

Like a broken watch that shows correct time twice a day, Prime
Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan as well occasionally makes some
correct analysis. Last week, while comparing the uprising in Libya
against the Moammar Gadhafi regime and the growing unrest in the
Syrian street against the Baathist regime of Bashar al-Assad, the
prime minister correctly said Libya and Syria were two totally
different issues for Turkey.

Erdogan explained while Turkey was very much concerned with
what’s happening in Libya and have been undertaking every possible
effort to contribute to a quick end to the tumult and restoration of
peace and order in Libya, Syria was very much like a domestic
incident for Turkey.

As part of its neo-Ottoman drive to enhance its influence in the
Middle Eastern territory of the former Ottoman Empire the ruling
Justice and development Party, or AKP, government of Turkey has
long waived visa requirement in travel between Turkey and Syria.
The aim behind that move was to plant the seeds of a future European
Union-like Middle Eastern union led by Turkey but the first tangible
result was not a marked increase in commercial, business or tourist
interactions, but a batch of 250 refugees running from the fire on the
Syrian street.

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017544.txt,"An impresario in the broadest and most creative sense

of the word, Quincy Jones’ career has encompassed the
roles of composer, record producer, artist, film producer,
arranger, conductor, instrumentalist, TV producer, record
company executive, magazine founder, multi-media
entrepreneur and humanitarian. As a master inventor of
musical hybrids, he has shuffled pop, soul, hip-hop, jazz,
classical, African and Brazilian music into many dazzling
fusions, traversing virtually every medium, including
records, live performance, movies and television.

Celebrating more than 60 years performing and
being involved in music, Quincy’s creative magic has spanned
over six decades, beginning with the music of the post-
swing era and continuing through today’s high-technology,
international multi-media hybrids. In the mid-50’s, he was
the first popular conductor-arranger to record with a Fender
bass. His theme from the hit TV series Ironside was the first
synthesizer-based pop theme song. As the first black composer
to be embraced by the Hollywood establishment in the 60’s,
he helped refresh movie music with badly needed infusions of
jazz and soul. His landmark 1989 album, Back On The Block—
named “Album Of The Year” at the 1990 Grammy Awards—
brought such legends as Dizzy Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah
Vaughan and Miles Davis together with Ice T, Big Daddy Kane
and Melle Mel to create the first fusion of the be bop and hip
hop musical traditions; while his 1993 recording of the critically
acclaimed Miles and Quincy Live At Montreux, featured
Quincy conducting Miles Davis’ live performance of the
historic Gil Evans arrangements from the Miles Ahead, Porgy
and Bess and Sketches of Spain sessions, garnered a Grammy
Award for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Performance. As producer
and conductor of the historic “We Are The World” recording
(the best-selling single of all time) and Michael Jackson’s
multi-platinum solo albums, Off The Wall, Bad and Thriller
(the best selling album of all time, with over 50 million copies
sold), Quincy Jones stands as one of the most successful and
admired creative artist/executives in the entertainment world.

His 1995 recording, Q’s Jook Joint, again showcased
Quincy’s ability to mold the unique talents of an eclectic
group of singers and musicians, in what resulted ina
retrospective of his broad and diverse career from that of
a seasoned Jazz musician, to skilled composer, arranger,
and bandleader, to acclaimed record producer.

Areference to the backwoods club houses of rural
America in the 1930’s, 40’s, and 50’s, the platinum selling
Q’s Jook Joint featured performances by artists such as
Bono, Brandy, Ray Charles, Phil Collins, Coolio, Kenny
“Babyface” Edmonds, Gloria Estefan, Rachelle Ferrell, Aaron
Hall, Herbie Hancock, Heavy D., Ron Isley, Chaka Khan, R.
Kelly, Queen Latifah, Tone Loc, the Luniz, Brian McKnight,
Melle Mel, Shaquille O’Neal, Joshua Redman, the Broadway
musical troupe Stomp, SWV, Take 6, newcomer Tamia,

Toots Thielemans, Mervyn Warren, Barry White, Warren
Wiebe, Charlie Wilson, Nancy Wilson, Stevie Wonder, Mr.
X, and Yo-Yo, among others, and garnered seven Grammy
nominations. His recording, From Q, With Love, featured a
collection of 26 love songs that he recorded over the last 32
years of his more than 50 year career in the music business.

Named by Time Magazine as one of the most
influential jazz musicians of the 2oth century, Quincy Jones
was born on March 14, 1933, in Chicago and brought up
in Seattle. While in junior high school, he began studying
trumpet and sang in a gospel quartet at age 12. His musical
studies continued at the prestigious Berklee College of
Music in Boston, where he remained until the opportunity
arose to tour with Lionel Hampton’s band as a trumpeter,

arranger and sometime-pianist. He moved on to New York
and the musical “big leagues” in 1951, where his reputation
as an arranger grew. By the mid-5o0’s, he was arranging and
recording for such diverse artists as Sarah Vaughan, Ray
Charles, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Big Maybelle, Dinah
Washington, Cannonball Adderly and LeVern Baker.

In 1957, Quincy decided to continue his musical
education by studying with Nadia Boulanger, the legendary
Parisian tutor to American expatriate composers such as
Leonard Bernstein and Aaron Copeland. To subsidize
his studies he took a job with Barclay Disques, Mercury’s
French distributor. Among the artists he recorded in Europe
were Charles Aznavour, Jacques Brel and Henri Salvador,
as well as such visitors from America as Sarah Vaughan,

Billy Eckstine and Andy Williams. Quincy’s love affair with
European audiences continues through the present: in 1991,
he began a continuing association with the Montreux Jazz
and World Music Festival, which he serves as co-producer.

Quincy won the first of his many Grammy’s in
1963 for his Count Basie arrangement of “I Can’t Stop
Loving You.” Quincy’s three-year musical association as
conductor and arranger with Frank Sinatra in the mid-60’s
also teamed him with Basie for the classic Sinatra At The
Sands, containing the famous arrangement of “Fly Me To
The Moon,” the first recording played by astronaut Buzz
Aldrin when he landed upon the moon’s surface in 1969.

When he became vice-president at Mercury Records
in 1961, Quincy became the first high-level black executive
of an established major record company. Toward the end of
his association with the label, Quincy turned his attention
to another musical area that had been closed to blacks--the
world of film scores. In 1963, he started work on the music
for Sidney Lumet’s The Pawnbroker and it was the first of
his 33 major motion picture scores. In 1985, he co-produced
Steven Spielberg’s adaptation of Alice Walker’s The Color
Purple, which garnered eleven Oscar nominations, introduced
Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey to film audiences, and
marked Quincy’s debut as a film producer. In 1991 Quincy
helped launch NBC-TV’s hit series, The Fresh Prince Of
Bel Air, for which he served as an executive producer.

In 1990, Quincy Jones formed Quincy Jones
Entertainment (QJE), a co-venture with Time Warner, Inc. The
new company, which Quincy served as CEO and chairman,
had a broad ranging, multi-media agenda which encompassed
programming for current and future technologies, including
theatrical motion pictures and network, cable and syndicated
television. QJE produced NBC Television’s Fresh Prince Of
Bel Air (now in syndication), and UPN’s In The House and
Fox Television’s Mad TV, among other syndicated shows and
television specials. In 1991 Jones founded VIBE Magazine,
and with his publishing group VIBE Ventures, would go on to

acquire SPIN Magazine before divesting his magazine interests.

In January 1992, Quincy Jones executive produced
the An American Reunion concert at Lincoln Memorial,
an all-star concert and celebration that was the first
official event of the presidential inaugural celebration
and drew widespread acclaim as an HBO telecast.

On March 25, 1996, Quincy Jones, executive
produced the most watched awards show in the
world, the 68th Annual Academy Awards. The show
received widespread acclaim as one of the most
memorable Academy Award shows in recent years.

In 1997, Quincy Jones formed the Quincy Jones
Media Group. QJMG’s feature film projects in development
include such highly anticipated films as the adaptations of the
Ralph Ellison novel Juneteeth, David Halberstam’s The Children

for Home Box Office in association with producers Kathleen

Kennedy and Frank Marshall, a bio-pic on the 19th century
Russian poet Alexander Pushkin, Pimp and Seeds of Peace for
Showtime, among others. For television, QJMG is developing
the sit-com The White Guy. QJMG is also active in live
entertainment, direct response marketing, and cross-media
projects for home entertainment and educational applications.

As arecord company executive, Quincy remained
highly active in the recording field throughout the 1990s as the
guiding force behind his own Qwest Records, which boasted
such important artists as New Order, Tevin Campbell, Andre
Crouch, Patti Austin, James Ingram, Siedah Garrett, Gregory
Jefferson and Justin Warfield. New Order’s album, Substance
earned Qwest a gold album in 1987. Tevin Campbell’s T.E.V.ILN
was both a critical sensation and major commercial success,
and the label’s release of the Boyz N The Hood soundtrack
album was among the most successful soundtrack recordings
of 1991. Qwest Records has also released soundtrack albums
from the major motion pictures Sarafina! and Malcolm X.

In 1994, Quincy Jones led a group of businessmen,
including Hall of Fame football player Willie Davis, television
producer Don Cornelius, television journalist Geraldo Rivera
and businesswoman Sonia Gonsalves Salzman in the formation
of Qwest Broadcasting, a minority controlled broadcasting
company which purchased television stations in Atlanta and
New Orleans for approximately $167 million, establishing it
as one of the largest minority owned broadcasting companies
in the United States. Quincy served as chairman and CEO of
Qwest Broadcasting. In 1999, taking advantage of the rapid
escalation of broadcast station values, Jones and his partners
sold Qwest Broadcasting for a reported $270 million.

The laurels, awards and accolades have been
innumerable: Quincy has won an Emmy Award for his score
of the of the opening episode of the landmark TV miniseries,
Roots, seven Oscar nominations, the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences’ Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award,
27 Grammy Awards, and N.A.R.A.S.’ prestigious Trustees’
Award and The Grammy Living Legend Award. He is the all-
time most nominated Grammy artist with a total of 79 Grammy
nominations. In 1990, France recognized Quincy with its most
distinguished title, the Commandeur de la Legion d’ Honneutr.
He is also the recipient of the French Ministry of Culture’s
Distinguished Arts and Letters Award. Quincy is the recipient
of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music’s coveted Polar
Music Prize, and the Republic of Italy’s Rudolph Valentino
Award. He is also the recipient of honorary doctorates from
Howard University, the Berklee College of Music, Seattle
University, Wesleyan University, Brandeis University,

Loyola University (New Orleans), Clark Atlanta University,
Claremont University’s Graduate School, the University of
Connecticut, Harvard University, Tuskegee University, New
York University, University of Miami and The American

Film Institute, among others. In 2001, Jones was named a
Kennedy Center Honoree, for his contributions to the cultural
fabric of the United States of America. He was recognized by
the National Endowment for the Arts as a Jazz Master—the
nation’s highest jazz honor, and was most recently bestowed
the National Medal of Arts, our nation’s highest artistic honor.

In 1990, his life and career were chronicled in
the critically acclaimed Warner Bros. film, Listen Up: The
Lives of Quincy Jones, produced by Courtney Sale Ross,

a film which helped illuminate not only Quincy’s life and
spirit, but also revealed much about the development of
the African American musical tradition. Reflecting on
the changes in pop music over the years, Quincy says, “If
there are any common denominators, they are spirit and

Dear Mr Epstein,

We are writing because a US media organisation, in concert with ourselves at the Guardian newspaper in

It is not illegal to have Swiss accounts. But as you may know, it is a topic of considerable public debate, and
several governments have been investigating the owners of such accounts.

There are a number of ways such accounts and also offshore trusts have been used to avoid inheritance tax,
UK domestic tax, or tax imposed by other countries. Such accounts have also been used to launder money.

We have seen records held in the US identifying you among those who have held accounts. These accounts

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016882.txt,"possibility that machines threaten a new fascism must be weighed against the vigor of the
liberal ideas, institutions, and norms that Wiener championed throughout the book. The
flaw in today’s dystopian prophecies is that they disregard the existence of these norms
and institutions, or drastically underestimate their causal potency. The result is a
technological determinism whose dark predictions are repeatedly refuted by the course of
events. The numbers “1984” and “2001” are good reminders.

I will consider two examples. Tech prophets often warn of a “surveillance state”
in which a government empowered by technology will monitor and interpret all private
communications, allowing it to detect dissent and subversion as it arises and make
resistance to state power futile. Orwell’s telescreens are the prototype, and in 1976
Joseph Weizenbaum, one of the gloomiest tech prophets of all time, warned my class of
graduate students not to pursue automatic speech recognition because government
surveillance was its only conceivable application.

Though I am on record as an outspoken civil libertarian, deeply concerned with
contemporary threats to free speech, I lose no sleep over technological advances in the
Internet, video, or artificial intelligence. The reason is that almost all the variation across
time and space in freedom of thought is driven by differences in norms and institutions
and almost none of it by differences in technology. Though one can imagine hypothetical
combinations of the most malevolent totalitarians with the most advanced technology, in
the real world it’s the norms and laws we should be vigilant about, not the tech.

Consider variation across time. If, as Orwell hinted, advancing technology was a
prime enabler of political repression, then Western societies should have gotten more and
more restrictive of speech over the centuries, with a dramatic worsening in the second
half of the 20th century continuing into the 21st. That’s not how history unfolded. It was
the centuries when communication was implemented by quills and inkwells that had
autos-da-fé and the jailing or guillotining of Enlightenment thinkers. During World War
I, when the state of the art was the wireless, Bertrand Russell was jailed for his pacifist
opinions. In the 1950s, when computers were room-size accounting machines, hundreds
of liberal writers and scholars were professionally punished. Yet in the technologically
accelerating, hyperconnected 21st century, 18 percent of social science professors are
Marxists”*; the President of the United States is nightly ridiculed by television comedians
as a racist, pervert, and moron; and technology’s biggest threat to political discourse
comes from amplifying too many dubious voices rather than suppressing enlightened
ones.

Now consider variations across place. Western countries at the technological
frontier consistently get the highest scores in indexes of democracy and human rights,
while many backward strongman states are at the bottom, routinely jailing or killing
government critics. The lack of a correlation between technology and repression is
unsurprising when you analyze the channels of information flow in any human society.
For dissidents to be influential, they have to get their message out to a wide network via
whatever channels of communication are available—pamphleteering, soap-box oration,
subversive soirées in cafés and pubs, word of mouth. These channels enmesh influential
dissidents in a broad social network which makes them easy to identify and track down.

that he had “moved away from Track 2 because China does not have much to say
beyond the Xi Catechism. Even in private conversations, we are not getting anything
interesting.” And yet another indicated that he no longer participates in many joint
events because they need to be “framed in a way to fit the Chinese narrative, including
the speakers, agenda, topics and writing.” Achieving true candor in such dialogues
with the Chinese side has long been difficult, as Chinese interlocutors routinely stick
to “talking points” and stock slogans, stay strictly “on message,” and are afraid to say
anything in front of their peers that might subsequently get them in political trouble
back home.

One US analyst commented that at a recent conference in Beijing, Chinese scholars
demonstrated little interest in putting forth ideas for cooperation, a marked change
from earlier meetings. This individual believes that tensions in the US-China
relationship are at least partially responsible. And it is not only the Americans who
see less utility in such dialogues. One Track 2 initiated by the Chinese side concerning
global norm cooperation ended abruptly when the Chinese said they did not see any
productive benefits, despite the willingness of the US side to move forward with the
project.

While these are long-standing problems, they have gotten demonstratively worse
during the Xi Jinping era. As one think tank scholar commented, “Collaboration

has become much more difficult, more authoritarian, and finding a common
definition of a program is more difficult. We could usually find areas on which to
work collaboratively, but there is a gap in worldview.” One US think tank analyst who
directs an innovative program to foster dialogue among rising American and Chinese
strategic thinkers, which used to be hosted alternately in both China and the United
States, has moved the program entirely out of China because of the repressive political
atmosphere. Another institution has transitioned away from cooperative projects with
China to emphasize bolstering the capacity of other countries in their dealings with
China.

Many US think tank scholars have also become concerned that the relationship
between Chinese and American scholars has regressed into a one-way street—with
Americans providing intelligence to Chinese interlocutors, whose main purpose is to
take the information back to their government. Indeed, some Chinese interlocutors
arrive in the offices of American think tanks with barely disguised “shopping lists”

of questions, which are presumably set by government “taskers” in Beijing. This is

a regular occurrence, but it tends to spike when a high-level governmental visit or
summit meeting is pending. A related Chinese goal is to transmit Chinese government
policy perspectives to American think-tank counterparts.

revenues.

At the beginning of 2018, the committee established financial performance goals that were challenging and reflective of Carvana’s fiscal 2018
operating plan, economic and market conditions, and forecasts at the time the performance goals were established. The target performance goal of each
metric is significantly above fiscal 2017’s actual results: over 92,000 retail units sold, a 108% increase over fiscal year 2017’s retail units sold of 44,252;
over $2,100 for gross profit per unit ex-Gift, a $561 increase over fiscal year 2017’s gross profit per unit ex-Gift of $1,539; and EBITDA margin ex-Gift of
less than (7.2)%, a 9.7 percentage point improvement over fiscal year 2017’s EBTIDA margin ex-Gift of (16.9)%.

Total Payouts

Based on the committee’s evaluation of our 2018 actual performance against the annual incentive plan goals, 88% of the target annual bonuses
were paid out, amounting to 59% of the NEOs’ respective base salaries. The annual incentive bonus received by each of the NEOs is included in the
“Non-Equity Performance Incentive Plan Compensation” column in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table in this proxy statement.

Each of the annual incentive metrics provided a payout range of 0%—199% as a percent of the target. For Retail Units Sold, weighted 40% of
the total, the target was over 92,000, and our actual performance was 94,108, resulting in a payout of 118% of the target payout. For gross profit per unit ex-
Gift, weighted 40% of the total, the target was over $2,100 and our actual performance was $2,133, resulting in a payout of 103% of the target. For
EBITDA Margin ex-Gift, weighted 20% of the total, our target was less than (7.2)% and our actual performance was (9.9)%, resulting in no payout.
Aggregating each of the respective payouts, weighted accordingly, resulted in a total payout of 88% of target. Applying the payout of 88% of target to each
of our NEOs respective target bonuses, Mr. Garcia achieved a $235,733 payout amount; Messrs. Jenkins and Huston achieved a payout of $221,000 each,
and Messrs. Keeton and Gill achieved a payout of $194,480 each.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PROGRAM

The Compensation and Nominating Committee believes that stock-based performance compensation is essential to align the interests of
Carvana’s management and its shareholders in enhancing the long-term value of our equity and to encourage executives to remain with the company.
Among the varied types of equity awards the committee is authorized to use under the equity plan, stock options are the ones that the committee has
determined are preferable for use with NEOs, because their

conversationally, but making a pedagogical point, ““money of a reality
altering scale. In fact, it used to be that the rich, reaching a certain point of
philanthropy, merely hoped to help make the world a better place, now they
want to change the world. Rockefeller and Carnegie were, as examples of
social-engineering philanthropy, unique. They alone had such resources and
will. Now you have legions of people who have to give away vastly larger
fortunes than Rockefeller or Carnegie had at their disposal, or might even
have imagined.

“Except that it’s actually hard to give away this kind of wealth,
without unintended consequences that can cause more problems than you’re
solving.”

Epstein’s long-time business thesis is that the rich know very little
about money. They may know about their own businesses, but the great
sums that are the result are an ultimate after thought and demand an entirely
different sort of intellectual discipline. The Forbes 400, says Epstein, not
immune to an amount of wonder, increased their wealth by $500 billion last
year, meaning, in effect, that on average every Forbes-list billionaire makes
more than another billion every year. And, points out the 62-year-old
Epstein, they will almost all be dead in 40 years, most well before that,
meaning $4.2 trillion, compounding everyday, will have to be given away.
“So, to understand the future, what you have to begin to do is follow the
money, not in Watergate-like terms backwards, as in who has gotten it, but
forwards to where it will go and who will get it.”

Epstein can find himself echoing aspects of Thomas Piketty on the
inequities of the accumulation of wealth (“the divide is between people with
assets, which appreciate, and people without assets, who fail to advance—
that is, of course, the miracle of compounded interest”), except for the fact
that Epstein, knowing the rich, understands a curious point that Piketty
doesn’t: “Nobody, nobody, wants to give it all to their children. Everybody
now has the modern appreciation that one of the curses of great wealth is
that it can make your kids weird and fucked up.”

Epstein’s position in this private allotment of a decent fraction of the
U.S. Gross Domestic Product is not as philanthropist but as a higher sort of
banker or guru or brain—a rich whisperer—making him, in addition to rich
himself, arguably, among the most influential people you’ ve never heard of.

Though, likely, you have heard of him, but not for his prowess with
high abstraction, but for a scandal of such luridness that he is, for a great
many, the poster child of the lawlessness of privilege, and for a much
smaller circle, the poster child for what can happen when you become the

Then a loud, sexy throb spills out of the earbuds: Britney Spears.
The bass line takes over, and she starts to dance, moving her

With a taste of a poison paradise...

Mary's swept away by the song. She's twirling around and

George Soros is betting big on gold.

As Bill reported yesterday, the billionaire speculator cut his

firm’s investments in U.S. stocks by more than one-third.

Soros has also disclosed a new stake in the world’s biggest

gold miner, Barrick Gold (ABX).

Soros Fund Management, his investment vehicle, bought a 1.7% of Barrick.

This makes it Soros’ biggest listed holding.

As today’s chart shows, Barrick has skyrocketed so far in 2016.

The company’s stock is up a jaw-dropping 156% year to date.

A. 1 don't remember having said that. But
within a minute, I had clear knowledge that every
document in the world would exonerate me because I
knew for absolute certainty that every aspect of her
allegation was totally false. That's why I
challenged the other side to produce videos, to
produce photographs. I knew that there could be no
evidence inculpating me because I knew I was
innocent. So I knew that all of my records would
prove that.

Facts are facts. And I just wasn't in any

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013179.txt,"13.6 Glocal Memory 263

e in which most memory items come in pairs, consisting of one local item and one global
item, so that activation of the local item (the “key”) frequently leads in the near future to
activation of the global item (the “map”)

Obviously, in the scope of all possible memory structures constructible within the above
formalism, glocal memories are going to be very rare and special. But, we suggest that they are
important, because they are generally going to be the most effective way for intelligent systems
to structure their memories.

Note also that many memories without glocal structure may be “well-aligned” in the above
sense.

An example of a predominantly local memory structure, in which nearly all significant mem-
ory items are local according to the above definition, is the Cyc logical reasoning engine [LG90].
To cast the Cye knowledge base in the present formal model, the tokens are logical predicates.
Cyc does not have an in-built notion of activation, but one may conceive the activation of a
logical formula in Cyc as the degree to which the formula is used in reasoning or query process-
ing during a certain interval in time. And one may define a basic metric for Cyc by associating
a predicate with its extension (the set of satisfying inputs), and defining the similarity of two
predicates as the symmetric distance of their extensions. Cyc is reasonably well-aligned, but
according to the dynamics of its querying and reasoning engines, it is basically a local memory
structure without significant global memory structure.

On the other hand, an example of a predominantly global memory structure, in which nearly
all significant memory items are global according to the above definition, is the Hopfield asso-
ciative memory network [Ami89]. Here memories are stored in the pattern of weights associated
with synapses within a network of formal neurons, and each memory in general involves a large
number of the neurons in the network. To cast the Hopfield net in the present formal model, the
tokens are neurons and synapses; the activations are neural net activations; the basic distance
between two neurons A and B may be defined as the percentage of the time that stimulating
one of the neurons leads to the other one firing; and to calculate a basic distance involving a
synapse, one may associate the synapse with its source and target neurons. With these defini-
tions, a Hopfield network is a well-aligned memory, and (by intentional construction) a markedly
global one. Local memory items will be very rare in a Hopfield net.

While predominantly local and predominantly global memories may have great value for par-
ticular applications, our suggestion is that they also have inherent limitations. If so, this means
that the most useful memories for general intelligence are going to be those that involve both
local and global memory items in central roles. However, this is a more general and less risky
claim than the assertion that glocal memory structure as defined above is important. Because,
“glocal” as defined above doesn’t just mean “neither predominantly global nor predominantly
local.” Rather, it refers to a specific pattern of coordination between local and global memory
items — what we have called the “keys and maps” pattern.

13.6.2 Glocal Memory in the Brain

Science’s understanding of human brain dynamics is still very primitive, one manifestation of
which is the fact that we really don’t understand how the brain represents knowledge, except
in some very simple respects. So anything anyone says about knowledge representation in the
brain, at this stage, has to be considered highly speculative. Existing neuroscience knowledge

Q. You then agree that if Bob Josefsberg
advanced the claims that I have described ina
complaint on behalf of a client, he would not have
done so unless he believed those allegations to be
truc, having conducted a fair and reasonable
investigation, correct?

MR. SCOTT: Objection, asked and answered

several times.

A. I don't know the answer to that question
because | don't know the context in which he made
these arguments. All I do know is that he never
would maintain a friendship with me if he believed
in any way that I was one of the people that she had
accused.

me, as he has, if he believed that | was one of

those academicians. Bob Josefsberg knows that | was
not one of those academicians, and the inference of
your question is beneath contempt, sir.

Q. Could we try to answer the question now?

A. The answer is that Bob Josefsberg would
never maintain a friendship with me if he believed
that there was any possibility that I was among the
academicians who she was accusing of sexual
misconduct. I do not believe that she ever accused
me of sexual misconduct to Bob Josefsberg, to the
FBI, to the U.S. attorney, or even, sir, to you and
Bradley Edwards, as she says in 2000, I think, 'IL.

1 think she made up this story on the eve of the
filing in 2014.

Q. You do agree that Bob Josefsberg would not
have advanced the claims that he advanced if he did
not have confidence that they were true, correct?

A. {have no idea what he believed or knew at
the time. I would say this: [ know Bob Josefsberg
is an extraordinarily ethical lawyer. I don’t know
what his responsibilities were in the case. I don't
know whether his responsibilities were to make those
kinds of judgments or whether his responsibility was
simply to make sure that money was paid to each of

A. Alberto Rodriguez --

Q. No, sir, Alfredo Rodriguez.

A. Alfredo Rodriguez, I never knew him by
name. He was, of course, there out -- well outside
of the timeframe of the alleged events in this case.
And so anything that he would be able to testify to
would bear no relationship whatsoever to the -- the
allegations here.

He was criminally prosecuted, to my
memory, for having stolen material and turned it
over to Bradley Edwards is my recollection. And as
the result of that clearly had a motive to lie. And
the same with Mr. Alessi, clearly would have a basis
for believing that I may have played a role as
Jeffrey Epstein's lawyer in seeking to do harm to
him.

But again, there’s nothing in
Mr. Rodriguez's testimony which is in any way
inculpatory of me. I think he has me sitting and --
and reading a book and drinking a glass of wine.

. No.

John Maeda (born 1966 in Seattle, Washington) is a

Japanese-American graphic designer, computer scientist,
academic, and author. His work in design, technology and
leadership explores the area where the fields merge. He is
the current President of the Rhode Island School of Design.
Maeda was originally a software engineering
student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, when
he became fascinated with the work of Paul Rand and Muriel
Cooper. Cooper was a director of MIT’s Visual Language
Workshop. After completing his bachelors and masters degrees
at MIT, Maeda studied in Japan at Tsukuba University’s
Institute of Art and Design to complete his Ph.D. in design.
As an artist, Maeda’s early work redefined
the use of electronic media as a tool for expression by
combining computer programming with traditional artistic
technique, laying the groundwork for the interactive motion
graphics that are taken for granted on the web today. He
has exhibited in one-man shows in London, New York
and Paris. His work is in the permanent collections of

the Museum of Modern Art, the San Francisco Museum
of Modern Art and the Cartier Foundation in Paris.

At RISD, Maeda is leading the movement to
transform STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Math) to STEAM by adding Art. He believes art and design
are poised to transform our economy in the 21st century
like science and technology did in the last century.

In 1999, he was named one of the 21 most important
people in the 21st century by Esquire. In 2001, he received
the National Design Award for Communication Design in
the United States and Japan’s Mainichi Design Prize.

In 2006, Maeda published Laws of Simplicity, his best-
selling book to date, based on a research project to find ways for
people to simplify their life in the face of growing complexity.

In 2009 he was inducted into the New
York Art Director’s Club Hall of Fame, and he
received the AIGA Medal in 2011. He is a trustee of
the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum.

Egypt, with which it has an enduring peace treaty.

The situation with Syria may not be exactly the same, however,
especially when the two countries are still officially in a state of war.
The regime of Bashar Assad, and his father before him, would have
never started a war with Israel unilaterally. It also suited them not to
have a peace treaty. Any new Syrian leader is not likely (for a
considerable period of time) to initiate a move toward a peace
agreement with Israel as this will weaken his position domestically.
Nor will he launch a war, however, since such a war will not result in
victory. A democratic regime in Syria, or any other Arab country for
that matter, will need a good 10 years to build democratic institutions
and stabilize a modern market economy needed in any democracy.
So, war won’t be on the agenda in the near future.

Prosperity increases the public’s stake in a stable economy, and this
will make people want to compromise to make their country more
prosperous and stable. However, everything will depend on how
prepared the free world is to help new democracies in the Middle
East survive and prosper. Small Islamic groups, organized and armed
with religious zeal, could hijack power from the moderates. This
would lead to a disaster for the whole region. Therefore, it 1s
imperative for the free world, Israel included, not to leave matters to
chance. A proactive stance is needed to nurture democracy and help
moderate forces organize themselves in order to govern the region

PREFACE TO THE EXPANDED AND
UPDATED EDITION
The 4-Hour Workweek was turned down by 26 out of 27 publishers.
After it was sold, the president of one potential marketing partner, a large bookseller, e-mailed me
historical bestseller statistics to make it clear—this wouldn’t be a mainstream success.
So I did all I knew how to do. I wrote it with two of my closest friends in mind, speaking directly to
them and their problems—problems I long had—and I focused on the unusual options that had worked
for me around the world.
I certainly tried to set conditions for making a sleeper hit possible, but I knew it wasn’t likely. I hoped
for the best and planned for the worst.
May 2, 2007, I receive a call on my cell phone from my editor.
“Tim, you hit the list.”
It was just past 5 P.M. in New York City, and I was exhausted. The book had launched five days
before, and I had just finished a series of more than twenty radio interviews in succession, beginning at 6
A.M. that morning. I never planned a book tour, preferring instead to “batch” radio satellite tours into 48
hours.
“Heather, I love you, but please don’t $#%* with me.”
“No, you really hit the list. Congratulations, Mr. New York Times bestselling author!”
I leaned against the wall and slid down until I was sitting on the floor. I closed my eyes, smiled, and
took a deep breath. Things were about to change.
Everything was about to change.
Lifestyle Design from Dubai to Berlin
The 4-Hour Workweek has now been sold into 35 languages. It’s been on the bestseller lists for more
than two years, and every month brings a new story and a new discovery.
From the Economist to the cover of the New York Times Style section, from the streets of Dubai to the
cafes of Berlin, lifestyle design has cut across cultures to become a worldwide movement. The original
ideas of the book have been broken apart, improved, and tested in environments and ways I never could
have imagined.
So why the new edition if things are working so well? Because I knew it could be better, and there
was a missing ingredient: you.
This expanded and updated edition contains more than 100 pages of new content, including the latest
cutting-edge technologies, field-tested resources, and—most important—real-world success stories
chosen from more than 400 pages of case studies submitted by readers.
Families and students? CEOs and professional vagabonds? Take your pick. There should be someone
whose results you can duplicate. Need a template to negotiate remote work, a paid year in Argentina,
perhaps? This time, it’s in here.
The Experiments in Lifestyle Design blog (www.fourhourblog.com) was launched alongside the book,
and within six months, it became one of the top 1,000 blogs in the world, out of more than 120 million.
Thousands of readers have shared their own amazing tools and tricks, producing phenomenal and
unexpected results. The blog became the laboratory I’d always wanted, and I encourage you to join us
there.
The new “Best of the Blog” section includes several of the most popular posts from the Experiments
in Lifestyle Design blog. On the blog itself, you can also find recommendations from everyone from
Warren Buffett (seriously, I tracked him down and show you how I did it) to chess prodigy Josh
Waitzkin. It’s an experimental playground for those who want better results in less time.
Not “Revised”
This is not a “revised” edition in the sense that the original no longer works. The typos and small
mistakes have been fixed over more than 40 printings in the U.S. This is the first major overhaul, but not
for the reason you’d expect.
Things have changed dramatically since April 2007. Banks are failing, retirement and pension funds
are evaporating, and jobs are being lost at record rates. Readers and skeptics alike have asked: Can the
principles and techniques in the book really still work in an economic recession or depression?
Yes and yes.
In fact, questions I posed during pre-crash lectures, including “How would your priorities and
decisions change if you could never retire?” are no longer hypothetical. Millions of people have seen
their savings portfolios fall 40% or more in value and are now looking for options C and D. Can they
redistribute retirement throughout life to make it more affordable? Can they relocate a few months per
year to a place like Costa Rica or Thailand to multiply the lifestyle output of their decreased savings?
Sell their services to companies in the UK to earn in a stronger currency? The answer to all of them is,
more than ever, yes.
The concept of lifestyle design as a replacement for multi-staged career planning is sound. It’s more
flexible and allows you to test different lifestyles without committing to a 10- or 20-year retirement plan
that can fail due to market fluctuations outside of your control. People are open to exploring alternatives
(and more forgiving of others who do the same), as many of the other options—the once “safe” options
—have failed.
When everything and everyone is failing, what is the cost of a little experimentation outside of the
norm? Most often, nothing. Flash forward to 2011; is a job interviewer asking about that unusual gap
year?
“Everyone was getting laid off and I had a once-in-a-lifetime chance to travel around the world. It
was incredible.”
If anything, they’ll ask you how to do the same. The scripts in this book still work.
Facebook and LinkedIn launched in the post-2000 dot-com “depression.” Other recession-born babies
include Monopoly, Apple, Cliff Bar, Scrabble, KFC, Domino’s Pizza, FedEx, and Microsoft. This is no
coincidence, as economic downturns produce discounted infrastructure, outstanding freelancers at
bargain prices, and rock-bottom advertising deals—all impossible when everyone is optimistic.
Whether a yearlong sabbatical, a new business idea, reengineering your life within the corporate beast,
or dreams you’ve postponed for “some day,” there has never been a better time for testing the
uncommon.
What’s the worst that could happen?
I encourage you to remember this often-neglected question as you begin to see the infinite possibilities
outside of your current comfort zone. This period of collective panic is your big chance to dabble.
It’s been an honor to share the last two years with incredible readers around the world, and I hope you
enjoy this new edition as much as I enjoyed putting it together.
I am, and will continue to be, a humble student of you all.
Un abrazo fuerte,
TIM FERRISS

FAQ—DOUBTERS READ THIS
Is lifestyle design for you? Chances are good that it is. Here are some of the most common doubts
and fears that people have before taking the leap and joining the New Rich:
Do I have to quit or hate my job? Do I have to be a risk-taker?
No on all three counts. From using Jedi mind tricks to disappear from the office to designing
businesses that finance your lifestyle, there are paths for every comfort level. How does a Fortune 500
employee explore the hidden jewels of China for a month and use technology to cover his tracks? How
do you create a hands-off business that generates $80K per month with no management? It’s all here.
Do I have to be a single twenty-something?
Not at all. This book is for anyone who is sick of the deferred-life plan and wants to live life large
instead of postpone it. Case studies range from a Lamborghini-driving 21-year-old to a single mother
who traveled the world for five months with her two children. If you’re sick of the standard menu of
options and prepared to enter a world of infinite options, this book is for you.
Do I have to travel? I just want more time.
No. It’s just one option. The objective is to create freedom of time and place and use both however
you want.
Do I need to be born rich?
No. My parents have never made more than $50,000 per year combined, and I’ve worked since age 14.
I’m no Rockefeller and you needn’t be either.
Do I need to be an Ivy League graduate?
Nope. Most of the role models in this book didn’t go to the Harvards of the world, and some are
dropouts. Top academic institutions are wonderful, but there are unrecognized benefits to not coming out
of one. Grads from top schools are funneled into high-income 80-hour-per-week jobs, and 15–30 years
of soul-crushing work has been accepted as the default path. How do I know? I’ve been there and seen
the destruction. This book reverses it.
MY STORY AND WHY YOU NEED THIS BOOK
Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.
Anyone who lives within their means suffers from a lack of imagination.
—OSCAR WILDE, Irish dramatist and novelist
—MARK TWAIN
My hands were sweating again.
Staring down at the floor to avoid the blinding ceiling lights, I was supposedly one of the best in the
world, but it just didn’t register. My partner Alicia shifted from foot to foot as we stood in line with nine
other couples, all chosen from over 1,000 competitors from 29 countries and four continents. It was the
last day of the Tango World Championship semifinals, and this was our final run in front of the judges,
television cameras, and cheering crowds. The other couples had an average of 15 years together. For us,
it was the culmination of 5 months of nonstop 6-hour practices, and finally, it was showtime.
“How are you doing?” Alicia, a seasoned professional dancer, asked me in her distinctly Argentine
Spanish.
“Fantastic. Awesome. Let’s just enjoy the music. Forget the crowd—they’re not even here.”
That wasn’t entirely true. It was hard to even fathom 50,000 spectators and coordinators in La Rural,
even if it was the biggest exhibition hall in Buenos Aires. Through the thick haze of cigarette smoke, you
could barely make out the huge undulating mass in the stands, and everywhere there was exposed floor,
except the sacred 30′ x 40′ space in the middle of it all. I adjusted my pin-striped suit and fussed with my
blue silk handkerchief until it was obvious that I was just fidgeting.
“Are you nervous?”
“I’m not nervous. I’m excited. I’m just going to have fun and let the rest follow.”
“Number 152, you’re up.” Our chaperone had done his job, and now it was our turn. I whispered an
inside joke to Alicia as we stepped on the hardwood platform: “Tranquilo”—Take it easy. She laughed,
and at just that moment, I thought to myself, “What on earth would I be doing right now, if I hadn’t left
my job and the U.S. over a year ago?”
The thought vanished as quickly as it had appeared when the announcer came over the loudspeaker
and the crowd erupted to match him: “Pareja numero 152, Timothy Ferriss y Alicia Monti, Ciudad de
Buenos Aires!!!”
We were on, and I was beaming.
THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL of American questions is hard for me to answer these days, and luckily so. If
it weren’t, you wouldn’t be holding this book in your hands.
“So, what do you do?”
Assuming you can find me (hard to do), and depending on when you ask me (I’d prefer you didn’t), I
could be racing motorcycles in Europe, scuba diving off a private island in Panama, resting under a palm
tree between kickboxing sessions in Thailand, or dancing tango in Buenos Aires. The beauty is, I’m not a
multimillionaire, nor do I particularly care to be.
I never enjoyed answering this cocktail question because it reflects an epidemic I was long part of: job
descriptions as self-descriptions. If someone asks me now and is anything but absolutely sincere, I
explain my lifestyle of mysterious means simply.
“I’m a drug dealer.”
Pretty much a conversation ender. It’s only half true, besides. The whole truth would take too long.
How can I possibly explain that what I do with my time and what I do for money are completely
different things? That I work less than four hours per week and make more per month than I used to
make in a year?
For the first time, I’m going to tell you the real story. It involves a quiet subculture of people called
the “New Rich.”
What does an igloo-dwelling millionaire do that a cubicle-dweller doesn’t? Follow an uncommon set
of rules.
How does a lifelong blue-chip employee escape to travel the world for a month without his boss even
noticing? He uses technology to hide the fact.
Gold is getting old. The New Rich (NR) are those who abandon the deferred-life plan and create
luxury lifestyles in the present using the currency of the New Rich: time and mobility. This is an art and
a science we will refer to as Lifestyle Design (LD).
I’ve spent the last three years traveling among those who live in worlds currently beyond your
imagination. Rather than hating reality, I’ll show you how to bend it to your will. It’s easier than it
sounds. My journey from grossly overworked and severely underpaid office worker to member of the
NR is at once stranger than fiction and—now that I’ve deciphered the code—simple to duplicate. There
is a recipe.
Life doesn’t have to be so damn hard. It really doesn’t. Most people, my past self included, have spent
too much time convincing themselves that life has to be hard, a resignation to 9-to-5 drudgery in
exchange for (sometimes) relaxing weekends and the occasional keep-it-short-or-get-fired vacation.
The truth, at least the truth I live and will share in this book, is quite different. From leveraging
currency differences to outsourcing your life and disappearing, I’ll show you how a small underground
uses economic sleight-of-hand to do what most consider impossible.
If you’ve picked up this book, chances are that you don’t want to sit behind a desk until you are 62.
Whether your dream is escaping the rat race, real-life fantasy travel, long-term wandering, setting world
records, or simply a dramatic career change, this book will give you all the tools you need to make it a
reality in the here-and-now instead of in the often elusive “retirement.” There is a way to get the rewards
for a life of hard work without waiting until the end.
How? It begins with a simple distinction most people miss—one I missed for 25 years.
People don’t want to be millionaires—they want to experience what they believe only millions can
buy. Ski chalets, butlers, and exotic travel often enter the picture. Perhaps rubbing cocoa butter on your
belly in a hammock while you listen to waves rhythmically lapping against the deck of your thatchedroof
bungalow? Sounds nice.
$1,000,000 in the bank isn’t the fantasy. The fantasy is the lifestyle of complete freedom it supposedly
allows. The question is then, How can one achieve the millionaire lifestyle of complete freedom without
first having $1,000,000?
In the last five years, I have answered this question for myself, and this book will answer it for you. I
will show you exactly how I have separated income from time and created my ideal lifestyle in the
process, traveling the world and enjoying the best this planet has to offer. How on earth did I go from
14-hour days and $40,000 per year to 4-hour weeks and $40,000-plus per month?
It helps to know where it all started. Strangely enough, it was in a class of soon-to-be investment
bankers.
In 2002, I was asked by Ed Zschau, übermentor and my former professor of High-tech
Entrepreneurship at Princeton University, to come back and speak to the same class about my business
adventures in the real world. I was stuck. There were already decamillionaires speaking to the same
class, and even though I had built a highly profitable sports supplement company, I marched to a
distinctly different drummer.
Over the ensuing days, however, I realized that everyone seemed to be discussing how to build large
and successful companies, sell out, and live the good life. Fair enough. The question no one really
seemed to be asking or answering was, Why do it all in the first place? What is the pot of gold that
justifies spending the best years of your life hoping for happiness in the last?
The lectures I ultimately developed, titled “Drug Dealing for Fun and Profit,” began with a simple
premise: Test the most basic assumptions of the work-life equation.
How do your decisions change if retirement isn’t an option?
What if you could use a mini-retirement to sample your deferredlife
plan reward before working 40 years for it?
Is it really necessary to work like a slave to live like a millionaire?
Little did I know where questions like these would take me.
The uncommon conclusion? The commonsense rules of the “real world” are a fragile collection of
socially reinforced illusions. This book will teach you how to see and seize the options others do not.
What makes this book different?
First, I’m not going to spend much time on the problem. I’m going to assume you are suffering from
time famine, creeping dread, or—worst case—a tolerable and comfortable existence doing something
unfulfilling. The last is most common and most insidious.
Second, this book is not about saving and will not recommend you abandon your daily glass of red
wine for a million dollars 50 years from now. I’d rather have the wine. I won’t ask you to choose
between enjoyment today or money later. I believe you can have both now. The goal is fun and profit.
Third, this book is not about finding your “dream job.” I will take as a given that, for most people,
somewhere between six and seven billion of them, the perfect job is the one that takes the least time. The
vast majority of people will never find a job that can be an unending source of fulfillment, so that is not
the goal here; to free time and automate income is.
I OPEN EACH class with an explanation of the singular importance of being a “dealmaker.” The manifesto
of the dealmaker is simple: Reality is negotiable. Outside of science and law, all rules can be bent or
broken, and it doesn’t require being unethical.
The DEAL of deal making is also an acronym for the process of becoming a member of the New
Rich.
The steps and strategies can be used with incredible results—whether you are an employee or an
entrepreneur. Can you do everything I’ve done with a boss? No. Can you use the same principles to
double your income, cut your hours in half, or at least double the usual vacation time? Most definitely.
Here is the step-by-step process you’ll use to reinvent yourself:
D for Definition turns misguided common sense upside down and introduces the rules and objectives of
the new game. It replaces self-defeating assumptions and explains concepts such as relative wealth and
eustress. 1 Who are the NR and how do they operate? This section explains the overall lifestyle design
recipe—the fundamentals—before we add the three ingredients.
E for Elimination kills the obsolete notion of time management once and for all. It shows exactly how I
used the words of an often-forgotten Italian economist to turn 12-hour days into two-hour days … in 48
hours. Increase your per-hour results ten times or more with counterintuitive NR techniques for
cultivating selective ignorance, developing a low-information diet, and otherwise ignoring the
unimportant. This section provides the first of the three luxury lifestyle design ingredients: time.
A for Automation puts cash flow on autopilot using geographic arbitrage, outsourcing, and rules of
nondecision. From bracketing to the routines of ultrasuccessful NR, it’s all here. This section provides
the second ingredient of luxury lifestyle design: income.
L for Liberation is the mobile manifesto for the globally inclined. The concept of mini-retirements is
introduced, as are the means for flawless remote control and escaping the boss. Liberation is not about
cheap travel; it is about forever breaking the bonds that confine you to a single location. This section
delivers the third and final ingredient for luxury lifestyle design: mobility.
I should note that most bosses are less than pleased if you spend one hour in the office each day, and
employees should therefore read the steps in the entrepreneurially minded DEAL order but implement
them as DELA. If you decide to remain in your current job, it is necessary to create freedom of location
before you cut your work hours by 80%. Even if you have never considered becoming an entrepreneur in
the modern sense, the DEAL process will turn you into an entrepreneur in the purer sense as first coined
by French economist J. B. Say in 1800—one who shifts economic resources out of an area of lower and
into an area of higher yield.
Last but not least, much of what I recommend will seem impossible and even offensive to basic
common sense—I expect that. Resolve now to test the concepts as an exercise in lateral thinking. If you
try it, you’ll see just how deep the rabbit hole goes, and you won’t ever go back.
Take a deep breath and let me show you my world. And remember—tranquilo. It’s time to have fun
and let the rest follow.

CHRONOLOGY OF A PATHOLOGY
An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field.
—NIELS BOHR, Danish physicist and Nobel Prize winner
Ordinarily he was insane, but he had lucid moments when he was merely stupid.
—HEINRICH HEINE, German critic and poet
This book will teach you the precise principles I have used to become the following:
Princeton University guest lecturer in high-tech entrepreneurship
First American in history to hold a Guinness World Record in
tango
Advisor to more than 30 world-record holders in professional and
Olympic sports
Wired magazine’s “Greatest Self-Promoter of 2008”
National Chinese kickboxing champion
Horseback archer (yabusame) in Nikko, Japan
Political asylum researcher and activist
MTV breakdancer in Taiwan
Hurling competitor in Ireland
Actor on hit TV series in mainland China and Hong Kong (Human
Cargo)
How I got to this point is a tad less glamorous:
1977 Born 6 weeks premature and given a 10% chance of living. I survive instead and grow so fat that
I can’t roll onto my stomach. A muscular imbalance of the eyes makes me look in opposite directions,
and my mother refers to me affectionately as “tuna fish.” So far so good.
1983 Nearly fail kindergarten because I refuse to learn the alphabet. My teacher refuses to explain
why I should learn it, opting instead for “I’m the teacher—that’s why.” I tell her that’s stupid and ask her
to leave me alone so I can focus on drawing sharks. She sends me to the “bad table” instead and makes
me eat a bar of soap. Disdain for authority begins.
1991 My first job. Ah, the memories. I’m hired for minimum wage as the cleaner at an ice cream
parlor and quickly realize that the big boss’s methods duplicate effort. I do it my way, finish in one hour
instead of eight, and spend the rest of the time reading kung-fu magazines and practicing karate kicks
outside. I am fired in a record three days, left with the parting comment, “Maybe someday you’ll
understand the value of hard work.” It seems I still don’t.
1993 I volunteer for a one-year exchange program in Japan, where people work themselves to death—
a phenomenon called karooshi—and are said to want to be Shinto when born, Christian when married,
and Buddhist when they die. I conclude that most people are really confused about life. One evening,
intending to ask my host mother to wake me the next morning (okosu), I ask her to violently rape me
(okasu). She is very confused.
1996 I manage to slip undetected into Princeton, despite SAT scores 40% lower than the average and
my high school admissions counselor telling me to be more “realistic.” I conclude I’m just not good at
reality. I major in neuroscience and then switch to East Asian studies to avoid putting printer jacks on cat
heads.
1997 Millionaire time! I create an audiobook called How I Beat the Ivy League, use all my money
from three summer jobs to manufacture 500 tapes, and proceed to sell exactly none. I will allow my
mother to throw them out only in 2006, just nine years of denial later. Such is the joy of baseless
overconfidence.
1998 After four shot-putters kick a friend’s head in, I quit bouncing, the highest-paying job on
campus, and develop a speed-reading seminar. I plaster campus with hundreds of god-awful neon green
flyers that read, “triple your reading speed in 3 hours!” and prototypical Princeton students proceed to
write “bullsh*t” on every single one. I sell 32 spots at $50 each for the 3-hour event, and $533 per hour
convinces me that finding a market before designing a product is smarter than the reverse. Two months
later, I’m bored to tears of speed-reading and close up shop. I hate services and need a product to ship.
Fall 1998 A huge thesis dispute and the acute fear of becoming an investment banker drive me to
commit academic suicide and inform the registrar that I am quitting school until further notice. My dad is
convinced that I’ll never go back, and I’m convinced that my life is over. My mom thinks it’s no big deal
and that there is no need to be a drama queen.
Spring 1999 In three months, I accept and quit jobs as a curriculum designer at Berlitz, the world’s
largest publisher of foreign-language materials, and as an analyst at a three-person political asylum
research firm. Naturally, I then fly to Taiwan to create a gym chain out of thin air and get shut down by
Triads, Chinese mafia. I return to the U.S. defeated and decide to learn kickboxing, winning the national
championship four weeks later with the ugliest and most unorthodox style ever witnessed.
Fall 2000 Confidence restored and thesis completely undone, I return to Princeton. My life does not
end, and it seems the yearlong delay has worked out in my favor. Twenty-somethings now have David
Koresh–like abilities. My friend sells a company for $450 million, and I decide to head west to sunny
California to make my billions. Despite the hottest job market in the history of the world, I manage to go
jobless until three months after graduation, when I pull out my trump card and send one start-up CEO 32
consecutive e-mails. He finally gives in and puts me in sales.
Spring 2001 TrueSAN Networks has gone from a 15-person nobody to the “number one privately
held data storage company” (how is that measured?) with 150 employees (what are they all doing?). I am
ordered by a newly appointed sales director to “start with A” in the phone book and dial for dollars. I ask
him in the most tactful way possible why we are doing it like retards. He says, “Because I say so.” Not a
good start.
Fall 2001 After a year of 12-hour days, I find out that I’m the second-lowest-paid person in the
company aside from the receptionist. I resort to aggressively surfing the web full-time. One afternoon,
having run out of obscene video clips to forward, I investigate how hard it would be to start a sports
nutrition company. Turns out that you can outsource everything from manufacturing to ad design. Two
weeks and $5,000 of credit card debt later, I have my first batch in production and a live website. Good
thing, too, as I’m fired exactly one week later.
2002–2003 BrainQUICKEN LLC has taken off, and I’m now making more than $40K per month
instead of $40K per year. The only problem is that I hate life and now work 12-hour-plus days 7 days a
week. Kinda painted myself into a corner. I take a one-week “vacation” to Florence, Italy, with my
family and spend 10 hours a day in an Internet café freaking out. Sh*t balls. I begin teaching Princeton
students how to build “successful” (i.e., profitable) companies.
Winter 2004 The impossible happens and I’m approached by an infomercial production company and
an Israeli conglomerate (huh?) interested in buying my baby BrainQUICKEN. I simplify, eliminate, and
otherwise clean house to make myself expendable. Miraculously, BQ doesn’t fall apart, but both deals
do. Back to Groundhog Day. Soon thereafter, both companies attempt to replicate my product and lose
millions of dollars.
June 2004 I decide that, even if my company implodes, I need to escape before I go Howard Hughes. I
turn everything upside down and—backpack in hand—go to JFK Airport in New York City, buying the
first one-way ticket to Europe I can find. I land in London and intend to continue on to Spain for four
weeks of recharging my batteries before returning to the salt mines. I start my relaxation by promptly
having a nervous breakdown the first morning.
July 2004–2005 Four weeks turn into eight, and I decide to stay overseas indefinitely for a final exam
in automation and experimental living, limiting e-mail to one hour each Monday morning. As soon as I
remove myself as a bottleneck, profits increase 40%. What on earth do you do when you no longer have
work as an excuse to be hyperactive and avoid the big questions? Be terrified and hold on to your ass
with both hands, apparently.
September 2006 I return to the U.S. in an odd, Zen-like state after methodically destroying all of my
assumptions about what can and cannot be done. “Drug Dealing for Fun and Profit” has evolved into a
class on ideal lifestyle design. The new message is simple: I’ve seen the promised land, and there is good
news. You can have it all.
Step I:
D is for Definition
Reality is merely an illusion,

Cautions and Comparisons
HOW TO BURN $1,000,000 A NIGHT
These individuals have riches just as we say that we “have a fever,” when really the fever has
us.
— SENECA (4 B.C.–A.D. 65)
I also have in mind that seemingly wealthy, but most terribly impoverished class of all, who
have accumulated dross, but know not how to use it, or get rid of it, and thus have forged their
own golden or silver fetters.
— HENRY DAVID THOREAU (1817–1862)
1:00 A.M. CST / 30,000 FEET OVER LAS VEGAS
His friends, drunk to the point of speaking in tongues, were asleep. It was just the two of us now in
first-class. He extended his hand to introduce himself, and an enormous—Looney Tunes enormous—
diamond ring appeared from the ether as his fingers crossed under my reading light.
Mark was a legitimate magnate. He had, at different times, run practically all the gas stations,
convenience stores, and gambling in South Carolina. He confessed with a half smile that, in an average
trip to Sin City, he and his fellow weekend warriors might lose an average of $500,000 to $1,000,000—
each. Nice.
He sat up in his seat as the conversation drifted to my travels, but I was more interested in his
astounding record of printing money.
“So, of all your businesses, which did you like the most?”
The answer took less than a second of thought.
“None of them.”
He explained that he had spent more than 30 years with people he didn’t like to buy things he didn’t
need. Life had become a succession of trophy wives—he was on lucky number three—expensive cars,
and other empty bragging rights. Mark was one of the living dead.
This is exactly where we don’t want to end up.
Apples and Oranges: A Comparison
So, what makes the difference? What separates the New Rich, characterized by options, from the
Deferrers (D), those who save it all for the end only to find that life has passed them by?
It begins at the beginning. The New Rich can be separated from the crowd based on their goals, which
reflect very distinct priorities and life philosophies.
Note how subtle differences in wording completely change the necessary actions for fulfilling what at
a glance appear to be similar goals. These are not limited to business owners. Even the first, as I will
show later, applies to employees.
D: To work for yourself.
NR: To have others work for you.
D: To work when you want to.
NR: To prevent work for work’s sake, and to do the minimum necessary for maximum effect (“minimum
effective load”).
D: To retire early or young.
NR: To distribute recovery periods and adventures (mini-retirements) throughout life on a regular basis
and recognize that inactivity is not the goal. Doing that which excites you is.
D: To buy all the things you want to have.
NR: To do all the things you want to do, and be all the things you want to be. If this includes some tools
and gadgets, so be it, but they are either means to an end or bonuses, not the focus.
D: To be the boss instead of the employee; to be in charge.
NR: To be neither the boss nor the employee, but the owner. To own the trains and have someone else
ensure they run on time.
D: To make a ton of money.
NR: To make a ton of money with specific reasons and defined dreams to chase, timelines and steps
included. What are you working for?
D: To have more.
NR: To have more quality and less clutter. To have huge financial reserves but recognize that most
material wants are justifications for spending time on the things that don’t really matter, including
buying things and preparing to buy things. You spent two weeks negotiating your new Infiniti with the
dealership and got $10,000 off? That’s great. Does your life have a purpose? Are you contributing
anything useful to this world, or just shuffling papers, banging on a keyboard, and coming home to a
drunken existence on the weekends?
D: To reach the big pay-off, whether IPO, acquisition, retirement, or other pot of gold.
NR: To think big but ensure payday comes every day: cash flow first, big payday second.
D: To have freedom from doing that which you dislike.
NR: To have freedom from doing that which you dislike, but also the freedom and resolve to pursue your
dreams without reverting to work for work’s sake (W4W). After years of repetitive work, you will
often need to dig hard to find your passions, redefine your dreams, and revive hobbies that you let
atrophy to near extinction. The goal is not to simply eliminate the bad, which does nothing more than
leave you with a vacuum, but to pursue and experience the best in the world.
Getting Off the Wrong Train
The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool.
—RICHARD P. FEYNMAN, Nobel Prize–winning physicist
Enough is enough. Lemmings no more. The blind quest for cash is a fool’s errand.
I’ve chartered private planes over the Andes, enjoyed many of the best wines in the world in between
world-class ski runs, and lived like a king, lounging by the infinity pool of a private villa. Here’s the
little secret I rarely tell: It all cost less than rent in the U.S. If you can free your time and location, your
money is automatically worth 3–10 times as much.
This has nothing to do with currency rates. Being financially rich and having the ability to live like a
millionaire are fundamentally two very different things.
Money is multiplied in practical value depending on the number of W’s you control in your life: what
you do, when you do it, where you do it, and with whom you do it. I call this the “freedom multiplier.”
Using this as our criterion, the 80-hour-per-week, $500,000-per-year investment banker is less
“powerful” than the employed NR who works ¼ the hours for $40,000, but has complete freedom of
when, where, and how to live. The former’s $500,000 may be worth less than $40,000 and the latter’s
$40,000 worth more than $500,000 when we run the numbers and look at the lifestyle output of their
money.
Options—the ability to choose—is real power. This book is all about how to see and create those
options with the least effort and cost. It just so happens, paradoxically, that you can make more money—
a lot more money—by doing half of what you are doing now.
So, Who Are the NR?
The employee who rearranges his schedule and negotiates a
remote work agreement to achieve 90% of the results in one-tenth
of the time, which frees him to practice cross-country skiing and
take road trips with his family two weeks per month.
The business owner who eliminates the least profitable customers
and projects, outsources all operations entirely, and travels the
world collecting rare documents, all while working remotely on a
website to showcase her own illustration work.
The student who elects to risk it all—which is nothing—to
establish an online video rental service that delivers $5,000 per
month in income from a small niche of Blu-ray aficionados, a
two-hour-per-week side project that allows him to work full-time
as an animal rights lobbyist.
The options are limitless, but each path begins with the same first step: replacing assumptions.
To join the movement, you will need to learn a new lexicon and recalibrate direction using a compass
for an unusual world. From inverting responsibility to jettisoning the entire concept of “success,” we
need to change the rules.
New Players for a New Game:
Global and Unrestricted
TURIN, ITALY
Civilization had too many rules for me, so I did my best to rewrite them.
—BILL COSBY
As he rotated 360 degrees through the air, the deafening noise turned to silence. Dale Begg-Smith
executed the backflip perfectly—skis crossed in an X over his head—and landed in the record books as
he slid across the finish.
It was February 16, 2006, and he was now a mogul-skiing gold medalist at the Turin Winter
Olympics. Unlike other full-time athletes, he will never have to return to a dead-end job after his
moment of glory, nor will he look back at this day as the climax of his only passion. After all, he was
only 21 years old and drove a black Lamborghini.
Born a Canadian and something of a late bloomer, Dale found his calling, an Internet-based IT
company, at the age of 13. Fortunately, he had a more-experienced mentor and partner to guide him: his
15-year-old brother, Jason. Created to fund their dreams of standing atop the Olympic podium, it would,
only two years later, become the third-largest company of its kind in the world.
While Dale’s teammates were hitting the slopes for extra sessions, he was often buying sake for clients
in Tokyo. In a world of “work harder, not smarter,” it came to pass that his coaches felt he was spending
too much time on his business and not enough time in training, despite his results.
Rather than choose between his business or his dream, Dale chose to move laterally with both, from
either/or to both/and. He wasn’t spending too much time on his business; he and his brother were
spending too much time with Canucks.
In 2002, they moved to the ski capital of the world, Australia, where the team was smaller, more
flexible, and coached by a legend. Three short years later, he received citizenship, went head-to-head
against former teammates, and became the third “Aussie” in history to win winter gold.
In the land of wallabies and big surf, Dale has since gone postal. Literally. Right next to the Elvis
Presley commemorative edition, you can buy stamps with his face on them.
Fame has its perks, as does looking outside the choices presented to you. There are always lateral
options.
NEW CALEDOINA, SOUTH PACIFIC OCEAN
Once you say you’re going to settle for second, that’s what happens to you in life.
—JOHN F. KENNEDY
Some people remain convinced that just a bit more money will make things right. Their goals are
arbitrary moving targets: $300,000 in the bank, $1,000,000 in the portfolio, $100,000 a year instead of
$50,000, etc. Julie’s goal made intrinsic sense: come back with the same number of children she had left
with.
She reclined in her seat and glanced across the aisle past her sleeping husband, Marc, counting as she
had done thousands of times—one, two, three. So far so good. In 12 hours, they would all be back in
Paris, safe and sound. That was assuming the plane from New Caledonia held together, of course.
New Caledonia?
Nestled in the tropics of the Coral Sea, New Caledonia was a French territory and where Julie and
Marc had just sold the sailboat that took them 15,000 miles around the world. Of course, recouping their
initial investment had been part of the plan. All said and done, their 15-month exploration of the globe,
from the gondola-rich waterways of Venice to the tribal shores of Polynesia, had cost between $18,000
and $19,000. Less than rent and baguettes in Paris.
Most people would consider this impossible. Then again, most people don’t know that more than 300
families set sail from France each year to do the same.
The trip had been a dream for almost two decades, relegated to the back of the line behind an evergrowing
list of responsibilities. Each passing moment brought a new list of reasons for putting it off. One
day, Julie realized that if she didn’t do it now, she would never do it. The rationalizations, legitimate or
not, would just continue to add up and make it harder to convince herself that escape was possible.
One year of preparation and one 30-day trial run with her husband later, they set sail on the trip of a
lifetime. Julie realized almost as soon as the anchor lifted that, far from being a reason not to travel and
seek adventure, children are perhaps the best reason of all to do both.
Pre-trip, her three little boys had fought like banshees at the drop of a hat. In the process of learning to
coexist in a floating bedroom, they learned patience, as much for themselves as for the sanity of their
parents. Pre-trip, books were about as appealing as eating sand. Given the alternative of staring at a wall
on the open sea, all three learned to love books. Pulling them out of school for one academic year and
exposing them to new environments had proven to be the best investment in their education to date.
Now sitting in the plane, Julie looked out at the clouds as the wing cut past them, already thinking of
their next plans: to find a place in the mountains and ski all year long, using income from a sail-rigging
workshop to fund the slopes and more travel.
Now that she had done it once, she had the itch.
LIFESTYLE DESIGN IN ACTION
I was done with driving across town to collect my son from child- care only to slide across icy
highways trying to get back to work with him in tow to finish my work. My mini-retirement brought us
both to live at an alternative boarding school full of creative lifestyle redesigning children and staff in a
gorgeous Florida forest with a spring-fed pond and plenty of sunshine. You can easily search for
alternative schools or traditional schools that might accept your children during your stay. Alternative
schools often see themselves as supportive communities and are exceptionally welcoming. You might
even find an opportunity to work at a school where you could experience a new environment with your
child.
—DEB
Tim,
Your book and blog have inspired me to quit my job, write two e-books, sky dive, backpack through
South America, sell all the clutter in my life, and host an annual convention of the world’s top dating
instructors (my primary business venture, third year running). The best part? I can’t even buy a drink yet.
Thank you so much, bro!
—ANTHONY
Rules That Change the Rules
EVERYTHING POPULAR IS WRONG
I can’t give you a surefire formula for success, but I can give you a formula for failure: try to
please everybody all the time.
—HERBERT BAYARD SWOPE, American editor and journalist; first recipient of the Pulitzer Prize
Everything popular is wrong.
—OSCAR WILDE, The Importance of Being Earnest
Beating the Game, Not Playing the Game
In 1999, sometime after quitting my second unfulfilling job and eating peanut-butter sandwiches for
comfort, I won the gold medal at the Chinese Kickboxing (Sanshou) National Championships.
It wasn’t because I was good at punching and kicking. God forbid. That seemed a bit dangerous,
considering I did it on a dare and had four weeks of preparation. Besides, I have a watermelon head—it’s
a big target.
I won by reading the rules and looking for unexploited opportunities, of which there were two:
1. Weigh-ins were the day prior to competition: Using dehydration techniques commonly practiced by
elite powerlifters and Olympic wrestlers, I lost 28 pounds in 18 hours, weighed in at 165 pounds, and
then hyperhydrated back to 193 pounds. 2 It’s hard to fight someone from three weight classes above you.
Poor little guys.
2. There was a technicality in the fine print: If one combatant fell off the elevated platform three times
in a single round, his opponent won by default. I decided to use this technicality as my principal
technique and push people off. As you might imagine, this did not make the judges the happiest Chinese
I’ve ever seen.
The result? I won all of my matches by technical knock-out (TKO) and went home national champion,
something 99% of those with 5–10 years of experience had been unable to do.
But, isn’t pushing people out of the ring pushing the boundaries of ethics? Not at all—it’s no more
than doing the uncommon within the rules. The important distinction is that between official rules and
self-imposed rules. Consider the following example, from the official website of the Olympic movement
(www.olympic.org).
The 1968 Mexico City Olympics marked the international debut of Dick Fosbury and his celebrated
“Fosbury flop,” which would soon revolutionize high-jumping. At the time, jumpers… swung their
outside foot up and over the bar [called the “straddle,” much like a hurdle jump, it allowed you to land on
your feet]. Fosbury’s technique began by racing up to the bar at great speed and taking off from his right
(or outside) foot. Then he twisted his body so that he went over the bar head-first with his back to the
bar. While the coaches of the world shook their heads in disbelief, the Mexico City audience was
absolutely captivated by Fosbury and shouted, “Olé!” as he cleared the bar. Fosbury cleared every height
through 2.22 metres without a miss and then achieved a personal record of 2.24 metres to win the gold
medal.
By 1980, 13 of the 16 Olympic finalists were using the Fosbury flop.
The weight-cutting techniques and off-platform throwing I used are now standard features of Sanshou
competition. I didn’t cause it, I just foresaw it as inevitable, as did others who tested this superior
approach. Now it’s par for the course.
Sports evolve when sacred cows are killed, when basic assumptions are tested.
The same is true in life and in lifestyles.
Challenging the Status Quo vs. Being Stupid
Most people walk down the street on their legs. Does that mean I walk down the street on my hands?
Do I wear my underwear outside of my pants in the name of being different? Not usually, no. Then
again, walking on my legs and keeping my thong on the inside have worked just fine thus far. I don’t fix
it if it isn’t broken.
Different is better when it is more effective or more fun.
If everyone is defining a problem or solving it one way and the results are subpar, this is the time to
ask, What if I did the opposite? Don’t follow a model that doesn’t work. If the recipe sucks, it doesn’t
matter how good a cook you are.
When I was in data storage sales, my first gig out of college, I realized that most cold calls didn’t get
to the intended person for one reason: gatekeepers. If I simply made all my calls from 8:00–8:30 A.M.
and 6:00–6:30 P.M., for a total of one hour, I was able to avoid secretaries and book more than twice as
many meetings as the senior sales executives who called from 9–5. In other words, I got twice the results
for 1/8 the time.
From Japan to Monaco, from globetrotting single mothers to multimillionaire racecar drivers, the basic
rules of successful NR are surprisingly uniform and predictably divergent from what the rest of the
world is doing.
The following rules are the fundamental differentiators to keep in mind throughout this book.
1. Retirement Is Worst-Case-Scenario Insurance.
Retirement planning is like life insurance. It should be viewed as nothing more than a hedge against the
absolute worst-case scenario: in this case, becoming physically incapable of working and needing a
reservoir of capital to survive.
Retirement as a goal or final redemption is flawed for at least three solid reasons:
1. It is predicated on the assumption that you dislike what you are doing during the most physically
capable years of your life. This is a nonstarter—nothing can justify that sacrifice.
2. Most people will never be able to retire and maintain even a hotdogs-for-dinner standard of living.
Even one million is chump change in a world where traditional retirement could span 30 years and
inflation lowers your purchasing power 2–4% per year. The math doesn’t work. 3 The golden years
become lower-middle-class life revisited. That’s a bittersweet ending.
3. If the math does work, it means that you are one ambitious, hardworking machine. If that’s the
case, guess what? One week into retirement, you’ll be so damn bored that you’ll want to stick
bicycle spokes in your eyes. You’ll probably opt to look for a new job or start another company.
Kinda defeats the purpose of waiting, doesn’t it?
I’m not saying don’t plan for the worst case—I have maxed out 401(k)s and IRAs I use primarily for
tax purposes—but don’t mistake retirement for the goal.
2. Interest and Energy Are Cyclical.
If I offered you $10,000,000 to work 24 hours a day for 15 years and then retire, would you do it? Of
course not—you couldn’t. It is unsustainable, just as what most define as a career: doing the same thing
for 8+ hours per day until you break down or have enough cash to permanently stop.
How else can my 30-year-old friends all look like a cross between Donald Trump and Joan Rivers?
It’s horrendous—premature aging fueled by triple bypass frappuccinos and impossible workloads.
Alternating periods of activity and rest is necessary to survive, let alone thrive. Capacity, interest, and
mental endurance all wax and wane. Plan accordingly.
The NR aims to distribute “mini-retirements” throughout life instead of hoarding the recovery and
enjoyment for the fool’s gold of retirement. By working only when you are most effective, life is both
more productive and more enjoyable. It’s the perfect example of having your cake and eating it, too.
Personally, I now aim for one month of overseas relocation or high-intensity learning (tango, fighting,
whatever) for every two months of work projects.
3. Less Is Not Laziness.
Doing less meaningless work, so that you can focus on things of greater personal importance, is NOT
laziness. This is hard for most to accept, because our culture tends to reward personal sacrifice instead of
personal productivity.
Few people choose to (or are able to) measure the results of their actions and thus measure their
contribution in time. More time equals more self-worth and more reinforcement from those above and
around them. The NR, despite fewer hours in the office, produce more meaningful results than the next
dozen non-NR combined.
Let’s define “laziness” anew—to endure a non-ideal existence, to let circumstance or others decide life
for you, or to amass a fortune while passing through life like a spectator from an office window. The size
of your bank account doesn’t change this, nor does the number of hours you log in handling unimportant
e-mail or minutiae.
Focus on being productive instead of busy.
4. The Timing Is Never Right.
I once asked my mom how she decided when to have her first child, little ol’ me. The answer was
simple: “It was something we wanted, and we decided there was no point in putting it off. The timing is
never right to have a baby.” And so it is.
For all of the most important things, the timing always sucks. Waiting for a good time to quit your
job? The stars will never align and the traffic lights of life will never all be green at the same time. The
universe doesn’t conspire against you, but it doesn’t go out of its way to line up all the pins either.
Conditions are never perfect. “Someday” is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you.
Pro and con lists are just as bad. If it’s important to you and you want to do it “eventually,” just do it and
correct course along the way.
5. Ask for Forgiveness, Not Permission.
If it isn’t going to devastate those around you, try it and then justify it. People—whether parents,
partners, or bosses—deny things on an emotional basis that they can learn to accept after the fact. If the
potential damage is moderate or in any way reversible, don’t give people the chance to say no. Most
people are fast to stop you before you get started but hesitant to get in the way if you’re moving. Get
good at being a troublemaker and saying sorry when you really screw up.
6. Emphasize Strengths, Don’t Fix Weaknesses.
Most people are good at a handful of things and utterly miserable at most. I am great at product creation
and marketing but terrible at most of the things that follow.
My body is designed to lift heavy objects and throw them, and that’s it. I ignored this for a long time.
I tried swimming and looked like a drowning monkey. I tried basketball and looked like a caveman.
Then I became a fighter and took off.
It is far more lucrative and fun to leverage your strengths instead of attempting to fix all the chinks in
your armor. The choice is between multiplication of results using strengths or incremental improvement
fixing weaknesses that will, at best, become mediocre. Focus on better use of your best weapons instead
of constant repair.
7. Things in Excess Become Their Opposite.
It is possible to have too much of a good thing. In excess, most endeavors and possessions take on the
characteristics of their opposite. Thus:
Pacifists become militants.
Freedom fighters become tyrants.
Blessings become curses.
Help becomes hindrance. More becomes less. 4
Too much, too many, and too often of what you want becomes what you don’t want. This is true of
possessions and even time. Lifestyle Design is thus not interested in creating an excess of idle time,
which is poisonous, but the positive use of free time, defined simply as doing what you want as opposed
to what you feel obligated to do.
8. Money Alone Is Not the Solution.
There is much to be said for the power of money as currency (I’m a fan myself), but adding more of it
just isn’t the answer as often as we’d like to think. In part, it’s laziness. “If only I had more money” is
the easiest way to postpone the intense self-examination and decision-making necessary to create a life
of enjoyment—now and not later. By using money as the scapegoat and work as our all-consuming
routine, we are able to conveniently disallow ourselves the time to do otherwise: “John, I’d love to talk
about the gaping void I feel in my life, the hopelessness that hits me like a punch in the eye every time I
start my computer in the morning, but I have so much work to do! I’ve got at least three hours of
unimportant e-mail to reply to before calling the prospects who said ‘no’ yesterday. Gotta run!”
Busy yourself with the routine of the money wheel, pretend it’s the fix-all, and you artfully create a
constant distraction that prevents you from seeing just how pointless it is. Deep down, you know it’s all
an illusion, but with everyone participating in the same game of make-believe, it’s easy to forget.
The problem is more than money.
9. Relative Income Is More Important Than Absolute Income.
Among dietitians and nutritionists, there is some debate over the value of a calorie. Is a calorie a calorie,
much like a rose is a rose? Is fat loss as simple as expending more calories than you consume, or is the
source of those calories important? Based on work with top athletes, I know the answer to be the latter.
What about income? Is a dollar is a dollar is a dollar? The New Rich don’t think so.
Let’s look at this like a fifth-grade math problem. Two hardworking chaps are headed toward each
other. Chap A moving at 80 hours per week and Chap B moving at 10 hours per week. They both make
$50,000 per year. Who will be richer when they pass in the middle of the night? If you said B, you would
be correct, and this is the difference between absolute and relative income.
Absolute income is measured using one holy and inalterable variable: the raw and almighty dollar.
Jane Doe makes $100,000 per year and is thus twice as rich as John Doe, who makes $50,000 per year.
Relative income uses two variables: the dollar and time, usually hours. The whole “per year” concept
is arbitrary and makes it easy to trick yourself. Let’s look at the real trade. Jane Doe makes $100,000 per
year, $2,000 for each of 50 weeks per year, and works 80 hours per week. Jane Doe thus makes $25 per
hour. John Doe makes $50,000 per year, $1,000 for each of 50 weeks per year, but works 10 hours per
week and hence makes $100 per hour. In relative income, John is four times richer.
Of course, relative income has to add up to the minimum amount necessary to actualize your goals. If I
make $100 per hour but only work one hour per week, it’s going to be hard for me to run amuck like a
superstar. Assuming that the total absolute income is where it needs to be to live my dreams (not an
arbitrary point of comparison with the Joneses), relative income is the real measurement of wealth for the
New Rich.
The top New Rich mavericks make at least $5,000 per hour. Out of college, I started at about $5. I’ll
get you closer to the former.
10. Distress Is Bad, Eustress Is Good.
Unbeknownst to most fun-loving bipeds, not all stress is bad. Indeed, the New Rich don’t aim to
eliminate all stress. Not in the least. There are two separate types of stress, each as different as euphoria
and its seldom-mentioned opposite, dysphoria.
Distress refers to harmful stimuli that make you weaker, less confident, and less able. Destructive
criticism, abusive bosses, and smashing your face on a curb are examples of this. These are things we
want to avoid.
Eustress, on the other hand, is a word most of you have probably never heard. Eu-, a Greek prefix for
“healthy,” is used in the same sense in the word “euphoria.” Role models who push us to exceed our
limits, physical training that removes our spare tires, and risks that expand our sphere of comfortable
action are all examples of eustress—stress that is healthful and the stimulus for growth.
People who avoid all criticism fail. It’s destructive criticism we need to avoid, not criticism in all
forms. Similarly, there is no progress without eustress, and the more eustress we can create or apply to
our lives, the sooner we can actualize our dreams. The trick is telling the two apart.
The New Rich are equally aggressive in removing distress and finding eustress.
Q&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS
1. How has being “realistic” or “responsible” kept you from the life you want?
2. How has doing what you “should” resulted in subpar experiences or regret for not having done
something else?
3. Look at what you’re currently doing and ask yourself, “What would happen if I did the opposite of
the people around me? What will I sacrifice if I continue on this track for 5, 10, or 20 years?”
2. Most people will assume this type of weight manipulation is impossible, so I’ve provided sample

FEAR-SETTING AND ESCAPING PARALYSIS
Many a false step was made by standing still.
—FORTUNE COOKIE
Named must your fear be before banish it you can.
—YODA, from Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back
RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL
Twenty feet and closing.
“Run! Ruuuuuuuuuun!” Hans didn’t speak Portuguese, but the meaning was clear enough—haul ass.
His sneakers gripped firmly on the jagged rock, and he drove his chest forward toward 3,000 feet of
nothing.
He held his breath on the final step, and the panic drove him to near unconsciousness. His vision
blurred at the edges, closing to a single pinpoint of light, and then … he floated. The all-consuming
celestial blue of the horizon hit his visual field an instant after he realized that the thermal updraft had
caught him and the wings of the paraglider. Fear was behind him on the mountaintop, and thousands of
feet above the resplendent green rain forest and pristine white beaches of Copacabana, Hans Keeling had
seen the light.
That was Sunday.
On Monday, Hans returned to his law office in Century City, Los Angeles’s posh corporate haven, and
promptly handed in his three-week notice. For nearly five years, he had faced his alarm clock with the
same dread: I have to do this for another 40–45 years? He had once slept under his desk at the office
after a punishing half-done project, only to wake up and continue on it the next morning. That same
morning, he had made himself a promise: two more times and I’m out of here. Strike number three came
the day before he left for his Brazilian vacation.
We all make these promises to ourselves, and Hans had done it before as well, but things were now
somehow different. He was different. He had realized something while arcing in slow circles toward the
earth—risks weren’t that scary once you took them. His colleagues told him what he expected to hear: He
was throwing it all away. He was an attorney on his way to the top—what the hell did he want?
Hans didn’t know exactly what he wanted, but he had tasted it. On the other hand, he did know what
bored him to tears, and he was done with it. No more passing days as the living dead, no more dinners
where his colleagues compared cars, riding on the sugar high of a new BMW purchase until someone
bought a more expensive Mercedes. It was over.
Immediately, a strange shift began—Hans felt, for the first time in a long time, at peace with himself
and what he was doing. He had always been terrified of plane turbulence, as if he might die with the best
inside of him, but now he could fly through a violent storm sleeping like a baby. Strange indeed.
More than a year later, he was still getting unsolicited job offers from law firms, but by then had
started Nexus Surf, 5 a premier surf-adventure company based in the tropical paradise of Florianopolis,
Brazil. He had met his dream girl, a Carioca with caramel-colored skin named Tatiana, and spent most of
his time relaxing under palm trees or treating clients to the best times of their lives.
Is this what he had been so afraid of?
These days, he often sees his former self in the underjoyed and overworked professionals he takes out
on the waves. Waiting for the swell, the true emotions come out: “God, I wish I could do what you do.”
His reply is always the same: “You can.”
The setting sun reflects off the surface of the water, providing a Zen-like setting for a message he
knows is true: It’s not giving up to put your current path on indefinite pause. He could pick up his law
career exactly where he left off if he wanted to, but that is the furthest thing from his mind.
As they paddle back to shore after an awesome session, his clients get ahold of themselves and regain
their composure. They set foot on shore, and reality sinks its fangs in: “I would, but I can’t really throw it
all away.”
He has to laugh.
The Power of Pessimism: Defining the Nightmare
Action may not always bring happiness, but there is no happiness without action.
—BENJAMIN DISRAELI, former British Prime Minister
To door not to do? To try or not to try? Most people will vote no, whether they consider themselves
brave or not. Uncertainty and the prospect of failure can be very scary noises in the shadows. Most
people will choose unhappiness over uncertainty. For years, I set goals, made resolutions to change
direction, and nothing came of either. I was just as insecure and scared as the rest of the world.
The simple solution came to me accidentally four years ago. At that time, I had more money than I
knew what to do with—I was making $70K or so per month—and I was completely miserable, worse
than ever. I had no time and was working myself to death. I had started my own company, only to realize
it would be nearly impossible to sell. 6 Oops. I felt trapped and stupid at the same time. I should be able to
figure this out, I thought. Why am I such an idiot? Why can’t I make this work?! Buckle up and stop
being such a (insert expletive)! What’s wrong with me? The truth was, nothing was wrong with me. I
hadn’t reached my limit; I’d reached the limit of my business model at the time. It wasn’t the driver, it
was the vehicle.
Critical mistakes in its infancy would never let me sell it. I could hire magic elves and connect my
brain to a supercomputer—it didn’t matter. My little baby had some serious birth defects. The question
then became, How do I free myself from this Frankenstein while making it self-sustaining? How do I pry
myself from the tentacles of workaholism and the fear that it would fall to pieces without my 15-hour
days? How do I escape this self-made prison? A trip, I decided. A sabbatical year around the world.
So I took the trip, right? Well, I’ll get to that. First, I felt it prudent to dance around with my shame,
embarrassment, and anger for six months, all the while playing an endless loop of reasons why my copout
fantasy trip could never work. One of my more productive periods, for sure.
Then, one day, in my bliss of envisioning how bad my future suffering would be, I hit upon a gem of
an idea. It was surely a highlight of my “don’t happy, be worry” phase: Why don’t I decide exactly what
my nightmare would be—the worst thing that could possibly happen as a result of my trip?
Well, my business could fail while I’m overseas, for sure. Probably would. A legal warning letter
would accidentally not get forwarded and I would get sued. My business would be shut down, and
inventory would spoil on the shelves while I’m picking my toes in solitary misery on some cold shore in
Ireland. Crying in the rain, I imagine. My bank account would crater by 80% and certainly my car and
motorcycle in storage would be stolen. I suppose someone would probably spit on my head from a highrise
balcony while I’m feeding food scraps to a stray dog, which would then spook and bite me squarely
on the face. God, life is a cruel, hard bitch.
Conquering Fear = Defining Fear
Set aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantiest and
cheapest fare, with course and rough dress, saying to yourself the while: “Is this the condition
that I feared?”
—SENECA
Then a funny thing happened. In my undying quest to make myself miserable, I accidentally began to
backpedal. As soon as I cut through the vague unease and ambiguous anxiety by defining my nightmare,
the worst-case scenario, I wasn’t as worried about taking a trip. Suddenly, I started thinking of simple
steps I could take to salvage my remaining resources and get back on track if all hell struck at once. I
could always take a temporary bartending job to pay the rent if I had to. I could sell some furniture and
cut back on eating out. I could steal lunch money from the kindergarteners who passed by my apartment
every morning. The options were many. I realized it wouldn’t be that hard to get back to where I was, let
alone survive. None of these things would be fatal—not even close. Mere panty pinches on the journey
of life.
I realized that on a scale of 1–10, 1 being nothing and 10 being permanently life-changing, my socalled
worst-case scenario might have a temporary impact of 3 or 4. I believe this is true of most people
and most would-be “holy sh*t, my life is over” disasters. Keep in mind that this is the one-in-a-million
disaster nightmare. On the other hand, if I realized my best-case scenario, or even a probable-case
scenario, it would easily have a permanent 9 or 10 positive life-changing effect.
In other words, I was risking an unlikely and temporary 3 or 4 for a probable and permanent 9 or 10,
and I could easily recover my baseline workaholic prison with a bit of extra work if I wanted to. This all
equated to a significant realization: There was practically no risk, only huge life-changing upside
potential, and I could resume my previous course without any more effort than I was already putting
forth.
That is when I made the decision to take the trip and bought a one-way ticket to Europe. I started
planning my adventures and eliminating my physical and psychological baggage. None of my disasters
came to pass, and my life has been a near fairy tale since. The business did better than ever, and I
practically forgot about it as it financed my travels around the world in style for 15 months.
Uncovering Fear Disguised as Optimism
There’s no difference between a pessimist who says, “Oh, it’s hopeless, so don’t bother doing
anything,” and an optimist who says, “Don’t bother doing anything, it’s going to turn out fine
anyway.” Either way, nothing happens.
—YVON CHOUINARD, 7 founder of Patagonia
Fear comes in many forms, and we usually don’t call it by its four-letter name. Fear itself is quite fearinducing.
Most intelligent people in the world dress it up as something else: optimistic denial. Most who
avoid quitting their jobs entertain the thought that their course will improve with time or increases in
income. This seems valid and is a tempting hallucination when a job is boring or uninspiring instead of
pure hell. Pure hell forces action, but anything less can be endured with enough clever rationalization.
Do you really think it will improve or is it wishful thinking and an excuse for inaction? If you were
confident in improvement, would you really be questioning things so? Generally not. This is fear of the
unknown disguised as optimism.
Are you better off than you were one year ago, one month ago, or one week ago?
If not, things will not improve by themselves. If you are kidding yourself, it is time to stop and plan
for a jump. Barring any James Dean ending, your life is going to be LONG. Nine to five for your
working lifetime of 40–50 years is a long-ass time if the rescue doesn’t come. About 500 months of solid
work.
How many do you have to go? It’s probably time to cut your losses.
Someone Call the Maître D’
You have comfort. You don’t have luxury. And don’t tell me that money plays a part. The
luxury I advocate has nothing to do with money. It cannot be bought. It is the reward of those
who have no fear of discomfort.
—JEAN COCTEAU, French poet, novelist, boxing manager, and filmmaker, whose
collaborations were the inspiration for the term “surrealism”
Sometimes timing is perfect. There are hundreds of cars circling a parking lot, and someone pulls out
of a spot 10 feet from the entrance just as you reach his or her bumper. Another Christmas miracle!
Other times, the timing could be better. The phone rings during sex and seems to ring for a half hour.
The UPS guy shows up 10 minutes later. Bad timing can spoil the fun.
Jean-Marc Hachey landed in West Africa as a volunteer, with high hopes of lending a helping hand. In
that sense, his timing was great. He arrived in Ghana in the early 1980s, in the middle of a coup d’état, at
the peak of hyperinflation, and just in time for the worst drought in a decade. For these same reasons,
some people would consider his timing quite poor from a more selfish survival standpoint.
He had also missed the memo. The national menu had changed, and they were out of luxuries like
bread and clean water. He would be surviving for four months on a slushlike concoction of corn meal
and spinach. Not what most of us would order at the movie theater.
“WOW, I CAN SURVIVE.”
Jean-Marc had passed the point of no return, but it didn’t matter. After two weeks of adjusting to the
breakfast, lunch, and dinner (Mush à la Ghana), he had no desire to escape. The most basic of foods and
good friends proved to be the only real necessities, and what would seem like a disaster from the outside
was the most life-affirming epiphany he’d ever experienced: The worst really wasn’t that bad. To enjoy
life, you don’t need fancy nonsense, but you do need to control your time and realize that most things
just aren’t as serious as you make them out to be.
Now 48, Jean-Marc lives in a nice home in Ontario, but could live without it. He has cash, but could
fall into poverty tomorrow and it wouldn’t matter. Some of his fondest memories still include nothing
but friends and gruel. He is dedicated to creating special moments for himself and his family and is
utterly unconcerned with retirement. He’s already lived 20 years of partial retirement in perfect health.
Don’t save it all for the end. There is every reason not to.
Q&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS
I am an old man and have known a great many troubles, but most of them never happened.
—MARK TWAIN
If you are nervous about making the jump or simply putting it off out of fear of the unknown, here is
your antidote. Write down your answers, and keep in mind that thinking a lot will not prove as fruitful or
as prolific as simply brain vomiting on the page. Write and do not edit—aim for volume. Spend a few
minutes on each answer.
1. Define your nightmare, the absolute worst that could happen if you did what you are
considering. What doubt, fears, and “what-ifs” pop up as you consider the big changes you can—
or need—to make? Envision them in painstaking detail. Would it be the end of your life? What
would be the permanent impact, if any, on a scale of 1–10? Are these things really permanent?
How likely do you think it is that they would actually happen?
2. What steps could you take to repair the damage or get things back on the upswing, even if
temporarily? Chances are, it’s easier than you imagine. How could you get things back under
control?
3. What are the outcomes or benefits, both temporary and permanent, of more probable
scenarios? Now that you’ve defined the nightmare, what are the more probable or definite positive
outcomes, whether internal (confidence, self-esteem, etc.) or external? What would the impact of
these more-likely outcomes be on a scale of 1–10? How likely is it that you could produce at least
a moderately good outcome? Have less intelligent people done this before and pulled it off?
4. If you were fired from your job today, what would you do to get things under financial
control? Imagine this scenario and run through questions 1–3 above. If you quit your job to test
other options, how could you later get back on the same career track if you absolutely had to?
5. What are you putting off out of fear? Usually, what we most fear doing is what we most need to
do. That phone call, that conversation, whatever the action might be—it is fear of unknown
outcomes that prevents us from doing what we need to do. Define the worst case, accept it, and do
it. I’ll repeat something you might consider tattooing on your forehead: What we fear doing most is
usually what we most need to do. As I have heard said, a person’s success in life can usually be
measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have. Resolve to
do one thing every day that you fear. I got into this habit by attempting to contact celebrities and
famous businesspeople for advice.
6. What is it costing you—financially, emotionally, and physically—to postpone action? Don’t
only evaluate the potential downside of action. It is equally important to measure the atrocious cost
of inaction. If you don’t pursue those things that excite you, where will you be in one year, five
years, and ten years? How will you feel having allowed circumstance to impose itself upon you
and having allowed ten more years of your finite life to pass doing what you know will not fulfill
you? If you telescope out 10 years and know with 100% certainty that it is a path of
disappointment and regret, and if we define risk as “the likelihood of an irreversible negative
outcome,” inaction is the greatest risk of all.
7. What are you waiting for? If you cannot answer this without resorting to the previously rejected
concept of good timing, the answer is simple: You’re afraid, just like the rest of the world.
Measure the cost of inaction, realize the unlikelihood and re-pairability of most missteps, and
develop the most important habit of those who excel and enjoy doing so: action.

BEING UNREASONABLE AND UNAMBIGUOUS
“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”

“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.

the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.
—GEORGE BERNARD SHAW, Maxims for Revolutionists
SPRING 2005 / PRINCETON , NEW JERSEY
I had to bribe them. What other choice did I have?
They formed a circle around me, and, while the names differed, the question was one and the same:
“What’s the challenge?” All eyes were on me.
My lecture at Princeton University had just ended with excitement and enthusiasm. At the same time, I
knew that most students would go out and promptly do the opposite of what I preached. Most of them
would be putting in 80-hour weeks as high-paid coffee fetchers unless I showed that the principles from
class could actually be applied.
Hence the challenge.
I was offering a round-trip ticket anywhere in the world to anyone who could complete an undefined
“challenge” in the most impressive fashion possible. Results plus style. I told them to meet me after class
if interested, and here they were, nearly 20 out of 60 students.
The task was designed to test their comfort zones while forcing them to use some of the tactics I teach.
It was simplicity itself: Contact three seemingly impossible-to-reach people—J.Lo, Bill Clinton, J. D.
Salinger, I don’t care—and get at least one to reply to three questions.
Of 20 students, all frothing at the mouth to win a free spin across the globe, how many completed the
challenge?
Exactly … none. Not a one.
There were many excuses: “It’s not that easy to get someone to …” “I have a big paper due, and …”
“I would love to, but there’s no way I can….” There was but one real reason, however, repeated over and
over again in different words: It was a difficult challenge, perhaps impossible, and the other students
would outdo them. Since all of them overestimated the competition, no one even showed up.
According to the rules I had set, if someone had sent me no more than an illegible one-paragraph
response, I would have been obligated to give them the prize. This result both fascinated and depressed
me.
The following year, the outcome was quite different.
I told the above cautionary tale and 6 out of 17 finished the challenge in less than 48 hours. Was the
second class better? No. In fact, there were more capable students in the first class, but they did nothing.
Firepower up the wazoo and no trigger finger.
The second group just embraced what I told them before they started, which was …
Doing the Unrealistic Is Easier Than Doing the Realistic
From contacting billionaires to rubbing elbows with celebrities—the second group of students did both
—it’s as easy as believing it can be done.
It’s lonely at the top. Ninety-nine percent of people in the world are convinced they are incapable of
achieving great things, so they aim for the mediocre. The level of competition is thus fiercest for
“realistic” goals, paradoxically making them the most time-and energy-consuming. It is easier to raise
$1,000,000 than it is $100,000. It is easier to pick up the one perfect 10 in the bar than the five 8s.
If you are insecure, guess what? The rest of the world is, too. Do not overestimate the competition and
underestimate yourself. You are better than you think.
Unreasonable and unrealistic goals are easier to achieve for yet another reason.
Having an unusually large goal is an adrenaline infusion that provides the endurance to overcome the
inevitable trials and tribulations that go along with any goal. Realistic goals, goals restricted to the
average ambition level, are uninspiring and will only fuel you through the first or second problem, at
which point you throw in the towel. If the potential payoff is mediocre or average, so is your effort. I’ll
run through walls to get a catamaran trip through the Greek islands, but I might not change my brand of
cereal for a weekend trip through Columbus, Ohio. If I choose the latter because it is “realistic,” I won’t
have the enthusiasm to jump even the smallest hurdle to accomplish it. With beautiful, crystal-clear
Greek waters and delicious wine on the brain, I’m prepared to do battle for a dream that is worth
dreaming. Even though their difficulty of achievement on a scale of 1–10 appears to be a 10 and a 2
respectively, Columbus is more likely to fall through.
The fishing is best where the fewest go, and the collective insecurity of the world makes it easy for
people to hit home runs while everyone else is aiming for base hits. There is just less competition for
bigger goals.
Doing big things begins with asking for them properly.
What Do You Want? A Better Question, First of All
Most people will never know what they want. I don’t know what I want. If you ask me what I want
to do in the next five months for language learning, on the other hand, I do know. It’s a matter of
specificity. “What do you want?” is too imprecise to produce a meaningful and actionable answer. Forget
about it.
“What are your goals?” is similarly fated for confusion and guesswork. To rephrase the question, we
need to take a step back and look at the bigger picture.
Let’s assume we have 10 goals and we achieve them—what is the desired outcome that makes all the
effort worthwhile? The most common response is what I also would have suggested five years ago:
happiness. I no longer believe this is a good answer. Happiness can be bought with a bottle of wine and
has become ambiguous through overuse. There is a more precise alternative that reflects what I believe
the actual objective is.
Bear with me. What is the opposite of happiness? Sadness? No. Just as love and hate are two sides of
the same coin, so are happiness and sadness. Crying out of happiness is a perfect illustration of this. The
opposite of love is indifference, and the opposite of happiness is—here’s the clincher—boredom.
Excitement is the more practical synonym for happiness, and it is precisely what you should strive to
chase. It is the cure-all. When people suggest you follow your “passion” or your “bliss,” I propose that
they are, in fact, referring to the same singular concept: excitement.
This brings us full circle. The question you should be asking isn’t, “What do I want?” or “What are
my goals?” but “What would excite me?”
Adult-Onset ADD: Adventure Deficit Disorder
Somewhere between college graduation and your second job, a chorus enters your internal dialogue:
Be realistic and stop pretending. Life isn’t like the movies.
If you’re five years old and say you want to be an astronaut, your parents tell you that you can be
anything you want to be. It’s harmless, like telling a child that Santa Claus exists. If you’re 25 and
announce you want to start a new circus, the response is different: Be realistic; become a lawyer or an
accountant or a doctor, have babies, and raise them to repeat the cycle.
If you do manage to ignore the doubters and start your own business, for example, ADD doesn’t
disappear. It just takes a different form.
When I started BrainQUICKEN LLC in 2001, it was with a clear goal in mind: Make $1,000 per day
whether I was banging my head on a laptop or cutting my toenails on the beach. It was to be an
automated source of cash flow. If you look at my chronology, it is obvious that this didn’t happen until a
meltdown forced it, despite the requisite income. Why? The goal wasn’t specific enough. I hadn’t
defined alternate activities that would replace the initial workload. Therefore, I just continued working,
even though there was no financial need. I needed to feel productive and had no other vehicles.
This is how most people work until death: “I’ll just work until I have X dollars and then do what I
want.” If you don’t define the “what I want” alternate activities, the X figure will increase indefinitely to
avoid the fear-inducing uncertainty of this void.
This is when both employees and entrepreneurs become fat men in red BMWs.
The Fat Man in the Red BMW Convertible
There have been several points in my life—among them, just before I was fired from TrueSAN and
just before I escaped the U.S. to avoid taking an Uzi into McDonald’s—at which I saw my future as
another fat man in a midlife-crisis BMW. I simply looked at those who were 15–20 years ahead of me on
the same track, whether a director of sales or an entrepreneur in the same industry, and it scared the hell
out of me.
It was such an acute phobia, and such a perfect metaphor for the sum of all fears, that it became a
pattern interrupt between myself and fellow lifestyle designer and entrepreneur Douglas Price. Doug and
I traveled parallel paths for nearly five years, facing the same challenges and self-doubt and thus keeping
a close psychological eye on each other. Our down periods seem to alternate, making us a good team.
Whenever one of us began to set our sights lower, lose faith, or “accept reality,” the other would
chime in via phone or e-mail like an A A sponsor: “Dude, are you turning into the bald fat man in the
red BMW convertible?” The prospect was terrifying enough that we always got our asses and priorities
back on track immediately. The worst that could happen wasn’t crashing and burning, it was accepting
terminal boredom as a tolerable status quo.
Remember—boredom is the enemy, not some abstract “failure.”
Correcting Course: Get Unrealistic
There is a process that I have used, and still use, to reignite life or correct course when the Fat Man in
the BMW rears his ugly head. In some form or another, it is the same process used by the most
impressive NR I have met around the world: dreamlining. Dreamlining is so named because it applies
timelines to what most would consider dreams.
It is much like goal-setting but differs in several fundamental respects:
1. The goals shift from ambiguous wants to defined steps.
2. The goals have to be unrealistic to be effective.
3. It focuses on activities that will fill the vacuum created when work is removed. Living like a
millionaire requires doing interesting things and not just owning enviable things.
Now it’s your turn to think big.
How to Get George Bush Sr. or the
CEO of Google on the Phone
The article below, titled “Fail Better” and written by Adam Gottesfeld, explores how I teach Princeton
students to connect with luminary-level business mentors and celebrities of various types. I’ve edited it
for length in a few places.
People are fond of using the “it’s not what you know, it’s who you know” adage as an excuse for
inaction, as if all successful people are born with powerful friends.
Nonsense.
Here’s how normal people build supernormal networks.
Fail Better
BY ADAM GOTTESFELD
MOST PRINCETON students love to procrastinate in writing their dean’s date [term] papers. Ryan Marrinan
’07, from Los Angeles, was no exception. But while the majority of undergraduates fill their time by
updating their Facebook profiles or watching videos on YouTube, Marrinan was discussing Soto Zen
Buddhism via e-mail with Randy Komisar, a partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield
and Byers, and asking Google CEO Eric Schmidt via e-mail when he had been happiest in his life.
(Schmidt’s answer: “Tomorrow.”)
Prior to his e-mail, Marrinan had never contacted Komisar. He had met Schmidt, a Princeton
University trustee, only briefly at an academic affairs meeting of the trustees in November. A selfdescribed
“naturally shy kid,” Marrinan said he would never have dared to randomly e-mail two of the
most powerful men in Silicon Valley if it weren’t for Tim Ferriss, who offered a guest lecture in
Professor Ed Zschau’s “High-Tech Entrepreneurship” class. Ferriss challenged Marrinan and his fellow
seniors to contact high-profile celebrities and CEOs and get their answers to questions they have always
wanted to ask.
For extra incentive, Ferriss promised the student who could contact the most hard-to-reach name and
ask the most intriguing question a round-trip plane ticket anywhere in the world.
“I believe that success can be measured in the number of uncomfortable conversations you’re willing
to have. I felt that if I could help students overcome the fear of rejection with cold-calling and cold e-
mail, it would serve them forever,” Ferriss said. “It’s easy to sell yourself short, but when you see
classmates getting responses from people like [former president] George Bush, the CEOs of Disney,
Comcast, Google, and HP, and dozens of other impossible-to-reach people, it forces you to reconsider
your self-set limitations.” … Ferriss lectures to the students of “High-Tech Entrepreneurship” each
semester about creating a startup and designing the ideal lifestyle.
“I participate in this contest every day,” said Ferriss. “I do what I always do: find a personal e-mail if
possible, often through their little-known personal blogs, send a two- to three-paragraph e-mail which
explains that I am familiar with their work, and ask one simple-to-answer but thought-provoking
question in that e-mail related to their work or life philosophies. The goal is to start a dialogue so they
take the time to answer future e-mails—not to ask for help. That can only come after at least three or
four genuine e-mail exchanges.”
With “textbook execution of the Tim Ferriss Technique,” as he put it, Marrinan was able to strike up a
bond with Komisar. In his initial e-mail, he talked about reading one of Komisar’s Harvard Business
Review articles and feeling inspired to ask him, “When were you happiest in your life?” After Komisar
replied with references to Tibetan Buddhism, Marrinan responded, “Just as words are inadequate to
explain true happiness, so too are words inadequate to express my thanks.” His e-mail included his
personal translation of a French poem by Taisen Deshimaru, the former European head of Soto Zen. An
e-mail relationship was formed, and Komisar even e-mailed Marrinan a few days later with a link to a
New York Times article on happiness.
Contacting Schmidt proved more challenging. For Marrinan, the toughest part was getting Schmidt’s
personal e-mail address. He e-mailed a Princeton dean asking for it. No response. Two weeks later, he e-
mailed the same dean again, defending his request by reminding her that he had previously met Schmidt.
The dean said no, but Marrinan refused to give up. He e-mailed her a third time. “Have you ever made
an exception?” he asked. The dean finally gave in, he said, and provided him with Schmidt’s e-mail.
“I know some of my classmates pursued the alternative scattershot technique with some success, but
that’s not my bag,” Marrinan said, explaining his perseverance. “I deal with rejection by persisting, not
by taking my business elsewhere. My maxim comes from Samuel Beckett, a personal hero of mine:
‘Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.’ You won’t believe what you can
accomplish by attempting the impossible with the courage to repeatedly fail better.”
Nathan Kaplan, another participant in the contest, was most proud of the way that he was able to
contact former Newark mayor Sharpe James. Because James had made a campaign contribution to Al
Sharpton, the website www.fundrace.org listed James’s home address. Kaplan then input James’s address
into an online serach-by-address phone directory, through which he received the former mayor’s phone
number. Kaplan left a message for James, and a few days later finally got to ask him about childhood
education.
Ferriss is proud of the effort students have put into his contest. “Most people can do absolutely aweinspiring
things,” he said. “Sometimes they just need a little nudge.”
Q&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS
The existential vacuum manifests itself mainly in a state of boredom.

Dreamlining will be fun, and it will be hard. The harder it is, the more you need it. To save time, I
recommend using the automatic calculators and forms at www.fourhourblog.com. Refer to the model
worksheet as you complete the following steps:
1. What would you do if there were no way you could fail? If you were 10 times smarter than the
rest of the world?
Create two timelines—6 months and 12 months—and list up to five things you dream of having
(including, but not limited to, material wants: house, car, clothing, etc.), being (be a great cook, be fluent
in Chinese, etc.), and doing (visiting Thailand, tracing your roots overseas, racing ostriches, etc.) in that
order. If you have difficulty identifying what you want in some categories, as most will, consider what
you hate or fear in each and write down the opposite. Do not limit yourself, and do not concern yourself
with how these things will be accomplished. For now, it’s unimportant. This is an exercise in reversing
repression.
Be sure not to judge or fool yourself. If you really want a Ferrari, don’t put down solving world
hunger out of guilt. For some, the dream will be fame, for others fortune or prestige. All people have
their vices and insecurities. If something will improve your feeling of self-worth, put it down. I have a
racing motorcycle, and quite apart from the fact that I love speed, it just makes me feel like a cool dude.
There is nothing wrong with that. Put it all down.
2. Drawing a blank?
For all their bitching about what’s holding them back, most people have a lot of trouble coming up with
the defined dreams they’re being held from. This is particularly true with the “doing” category. In that
case, consider these questions:
1. What would you do, day to day, if you had $100 million in the bank?
2. What would make you most excited to wake up in the morning to another day?
Don’t rush—think about it for a few minutes. If still blocked, fill in the five “doing” spots with the
following:
one place to visit
one thing to do before you die (a memory of a lifetime)
one thing to do daily
one thing to do weekly
one thing you’ve always wanted to learn
3. What does “being” entail doing?
Convert each “being” into a “doing” to make it actionable. Identify an action that would characterize this
state of being or a task that would mean you had achieved it. People find it easier to brainstorm “being”
first, but this column is just a temporary holding spot for “doing” actions. Here are a few examples:
Great cook
make Christmas dinner without help
Fluent in Chinese have a five-minute conversation
with a Chinese co-worker
4. What are the four dreams that would change it all?
Using the 6-month timeline, star or otherwise highlight the four most exciting and/or important dreams
from all columns. Repeat the process with the 12-month timeline if desired.
5. Determine the cost of these dreams and calculate your Target Monthly Income (TMI) for both
timelines.
If financeable, what is the cost per month for each of the four dreams (rent, mortgage, payment plan
installments, etc.)? Start thinking of income and expense in terms of monthly cash flow—dollars in and
dollars out—instead of grand totals. Things often cost much, much less than expected. For example, a
Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder, fresh off the showroom floor at $260,000, can be had for $2,897.80 per
month. I found my personal favorite, an Aston Martin DB9 with 1,000 miles on it, through eBay for
$136,000—$2,003.10 per month. How about a Round-the-World trip (Los Angeles Tokyo
Singapore Bangkok Delhi or Bombay London Frankfurt Los Angeles) for $1,399?
For some of these costs, the Tools and Tricks at the end of Chapter 14 will help.
Last, calculate your Target Monthly Income (TMI) for realizing these dreamlines. This is how to do it:
First, total each of the columns A, B, and C, counting only the four selected dreams. Some of these
column totals could be zero, which is fine. Next, add your total monthly expenses x 1.3 (the 1.3
represents your expenses plus a 30% buffer for safety or savings). This grand total is your TMI and the
target to keep in mind for the rest of the book. I like to further divide this TMI by 30 to get my TDI—
Target Daily Income. I find it easier to work with a daily goal. Online calculators on our companion site
do all the work for you and make this step a cinch.
Chances are that the figure is lower than expected, and it often decreases over time as you trade more
and more “having” for once-in-a-lifetime “doing.” Mobility encourages this trend. Even if the total is
intimidating, don’t fret in the least. I have helped students get to more than $10,000 per month in extra
income within three months.

Dreamline Math—Another Good Option
There could be a different way of handling monthly and one-time goals. I’ll use your example of an
Aston Martin’s monthly payment, a personal assistant’s monthly payment, and a trip to the Croatian
coast. While the first two should certainly be totaled and included in your target monthly income, the trip
is something that should be divided by the number of months between now and the dreamline’s total
time.
Thus if you had a six-month dreamline:
Aston Martin = 2,003 per month
Personal assistant = 400 per month
Croatian trip = 934 total, and thus 934/6 per month
Right now in the book and in the spreadsheet we have (2003 + 400 + 934) x 1.3 monthly expenses =
Target Monthly Income (or TMI).
But I think it should be (2003 + 400 + 934/6 x 1.3 monthly expenses = TMI.
Or, more generally: [Monthly Goals + (One-Time Goals / Total Months)] x 1.3 monthly expenses =
TMI.

6. Determine three steps for each of the four dreams in just the 6-month timeline and take the first
step now.
I’m not a big believer in long-term planning and far-off goals. In fact, I generally set 3-month and 6-
month dreamlines. The variables change too much and in-the-future distance becomes an excuse for
postponing action. The objective of this exercise isn’t, therefore, to outline every step from start to finish,
but to define the end goal, the required vehicle to achieve them (TMI, TDI), and build momentum with
critical first steps. From that point, it’s a matter of freeing time and generating the TMI, which the
following chapters cover.
First, let’s focus on those critical first steps. Define three steps for each dream that will get you closer
to its actualization. Set actions—simple, well-defined actions—for now, tomorrow (complete before 11
A.M.) and the day after (again completed before 11 A.M.).
Once you have three steps for each of the four goals, complete the three actions in the “now” column.
Do it now. Each should be simple enough to do in five minutes or less. If not, rachet it down. If it’s the
middle of the night and you can’t call someone, do something else now, such as send an e-mail, and set
the call for first thing tomorrow.
If the next stage is some form of research, get in touch with someone who knows the answer instead of
spending too much time in books or online, which can turn into paralysis by analysis. The best first step,
the one I recommend, is finding someone who’s done it and ask for advice on how to do the same. It’s
not hard.
Other options include setting a meeting or phone call with a trainer, mentor, or salesperson to build
momentum. Can you schedule a private class or a commitment that you’ll feel bad about canceling? Use
guilt to your advantage.
Tomorrow becomes never. No matter how small the task, take the first step now!
COMFORT CHALLENGE
The most important actions are never comfortable.
Fortunately, it is possible to condition yourself to discomfort and overcome it. I’ve trained myself to
propose solutions instead of ask for them, to elicit desired responses instead of react, and to be assertive
without burning bridges. To have an uncommon lifestyle, you need to develop the uncommon habit of
making decisions, both for yourself and for others.
From this chapter forward, I’ll take you through progressively more uncomfortable exercises, simple
and small. Some of the exercises will appear deceptively easy and even irrelevant (such as the next) until
you try them. Look at it as a game and expect some butterflies and sweat—that’s the whole point. For
most of these exercises, the duration is two days. Mark the exercise of the day on your calendar so you
don’t forget, and don’t attempt more than one Comfort Challenge at a time.
Remember: There is a direct correlation between an increased sphere of comfort and getting what you
want.
Here we go.
Learn to Eye Gaze (2 days)
My friend Michael Ellsberg invented a singles event called Eye Gazing. It is similar to speed dating but
different in one fundamental respect—no speaking is permitted. It involves gazing into the eyes of each
partner for three minutes at a time. If you go to such an event, it becomes clear how uncomfortable most
people are doing this. For the next two days, practice gazing into the eyes of others—whether people you
pass on the street or conversational partners—until they break contact. Hints:
1. Focus on one eye and be sure to blink occasionally so you don’t look like a psychopath or get your
ass kicked.
2. In conversation, maintain eye contact when you are speaking. It’s easy to do while listening.
3. Practice with people bigger or more confident than yourself. If a passerby asks you what the hell
you’re staring at, just smile and respond, “Sorry about that. I thought you were an old friend of
mine.”

—WILLIAM OF OCCAM (1300–1350), originator of “Occam’s Razor”
Just a few words on time management: Forget all about it.
In the strictest sense, you shouldn’t be trying to do more in each day, trying to fill every second with a
work fidget of some type. It took me a long time to figure this out. I used to be very fond of the resultsby-volume
approach.
Being busy is most often used as a guise for avoiding the few critically important but uncomfortable
actions. The options are almost limitless for creating “busyness”: You could call a few hundred
unqualified sales leads, reorganize your Outlook contacts, walk across the office to request documents
you don’t really need, or fuss with your BlackBerry for a few hours when you should be prioritizing.
In fact, if you want to move up the ladder in most of corporate America, and assuming they don’t
really check what you are doing (let’s be honest), just run around the office holding a cell phone to your
head and carrying papers. Now, that is one busy employee! Give them a raise. Unfortunately for the NR,
this behavior won’t get you out of the office or put you on an airplane to Brazil. Bad dog. Hit yourself
with a newspaper and cut it out.
After all, there is a far better option, and it will do more than simply increase your results—it will
multiply them. Believe it or not, it is not only possible to accomplish more by doing less, it is mandatory.
Enter the world of elimination.
How You Will Use Productivity
Now that you have defined what you want to do with your time, you have to free that time. The trick,
of course, is to do so while maintaining or increasing your income.
The intention of this chapter, and what you will experience if you follow the instructions, is an
increase in personal productivity between 100 and 500%. The principles are the same for both employees
and entrepreneurs, but the purpose of this increased productivity is completely different.
First, the employee. The employee is increasing productivity to increase negotiating leverage for two
simultaneous objectives: pay raises and a remote working arrangement.
Recall that, as indicated in the first chapter of this book, the general process of joining the New Rich is
D-E-A-L, in that order, but that employees intent on remaining employees for now need to implement
the process as D-E-L-A. The reason relates to environment. They need to Liberate themselves from the
office environment before they can work ten hours a week, for example, because the expectation in that
environment is that you will be in constant motion from 9–5. Even if you produce twice the results you
had in the past, if you’re working a quarter of the hours of your colleagues, there is a good chance of
receiving a pink slip. Even if you work 10 hours a week and produce twice the results of people working
40, the collective request will be, “Work 40 hours a week and produce 8 times the results.” This is an
endless game and one you want to avoid. Hence the need for Liberation first.
If you’re an employee, this chapter will increase your value and make it more painful for the company
to fire you than to grant raises and a remote working agreement. That is your goal. Once the latter is
accomplished, you can drop hours without bureaucratic interference and use the resultant free time to
fulfill dreamlines.
The entrepreneur’s goals are less complex, as he or she is generally the direct beneficiary of increased
profit. The goal is to decrease the amount of work you perform while increasing revenue. This will set
the stage for replacing yourself with Automation, which in turn permits Liberation.
For both tracks, some definitions are in order.
Being Effective vs. Being Efficient
Effectiveness is doing the things that get you closer to your goals. Efficiency is performing a given
task (whether important or not) in the most economical manner possible. Being efficient without regard
to effectiveness is the default mode of the universe.
I would consider the best door-to-door salesperson efficient—that is, refined and excellent at selling
door-to-door without wasting time—but utterly ineffective. He or she would sell more using a better
vehicle such as e-mail or direct mail.
This is also true for the person who checks e-mail 30 times per day and develops an elaborate system
of folder rules and sophisticated techniques for ensuring that each of those 30 brain farts moves as
quickly as possible. I was a specialist at such professional wheel-spinning. It is efficient on some
perverse level, but far from effective.
Here are two truisms to keep in mind:
1. Doing something unimportant well does not make it important.
2. Requiring a lot of time does not make a task important.
From this moment forward, remember this: What you do is infinitely more important than how you do
it. Efficiency is still important, but it is useless unless applied to the right things.
To find the right things, we’ll need to go to the garden.
Pareto and His Garden: 80/20 and
Freedom from Futility
What gets measured gets managed.
—PETER DRUCKER, management theorist, author of 31 books, recipient of Presidential Medal of
Freedom
Four years ago, an economist changed my life forever. It’s a shame I never had a chance to buy him a
drink. My dear Vilfredo died almost 100 years ago.
Vilfredo Pareto was a wily and controversial economist-cum-sociologist who lived from 1848 to 1923.
An engineer by training, he started his varied career managing coal mines and later succeeded Léon
Walras as the chair of political economy at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. His seminal work,
Cours d’economie politique, included a then little-explored “law” of income distribution that would later
bear his name: “Pareto’s Law” or the “Pareto Distribution,” in the last decade also popularly called the
“80/20 Principle.”
The mathematical formula he used to demonstrate a grossly uneven but predictable distribution of
wealth in society—80% of the wealth and income was produced and possessed by 20% of the population
—also applied outside of economics. Indeed, it could be found almost everywhere. Eighty percent of
Pareto’s garden peas were produced by 20% of the peapods he had planted, for example.
Pareto’s Law can be summarized as follows: 80% of the outputs result from 20% of the inputs.
Alternative ways to phrase this, depending on the context, include:
80% of the consequences flow from 20% of the causes.
80% of the results come from 20% of the effort and time.
80% of company profits come from 20% of the products and customers.
80% of all stock market gains are realized by 20% of the investors and 20% of an individual portfolio.
The list is infinitely long and diverse, and the ratio is often skewed even more severely: 90/10, 95/5, and
99/1 are not uncommon, but the minimum ratio to seek is 80/20.
When I came across Pareto’s work one late evening, I had been slaving away with 15-hour days seven
days per week, feeling completely overwhelmed and generally helpless. I would wake up before dawn to
make calls to the United Kingdom, handle the U.S. during the normal 9–5 day, and then work until near
midnight making calls to Japan and New Zealand. I was stuck on a runaway freight train with no brakes,
shoveling coal into the furnace for lack of a better option. Faced with certain burnout or giving Pareto’s
ideas a trial run, I opted for the latter. The next morning, I began a dissection of my business and
personal life through the lenses of two questions:
1. Which 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness?
2. Which 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness?
For the entire day, I put aside everything seemingly urgent and did the most intense truth-baring
analysis possible, applying these questions to everything from my friends to customers and advertising to
relaxation activities. Don’t expect to find you’re doing everything right—the truth often hurts. The goal is
to find your inefficiencies in order to eliminate them and to find your strengths so you can multiply them.
In the 24 hours that followed, I made several simple but emotionally difficult decisions that literally
changed my life forever and enabled the lifestyle I now enjoy.
The first decision I made is an excellent example of how dramatic and fast the ROI of this analytical
fat-cutting can be: I stopped contacting 95% of my customers and fired 2%, leaving me with the top 3%
of producers to profile and duplicate.
Out of more than 120 wholesale customers, a mere 5 were bringing in 95% of the revenue. I was
spending 98% of my time chasing the remainder, as the aforementioned 5 ordered regularly without any
follow-up calls, persuasion, or cajoling. In other words, I was working because I felt as though I should
be doing something from 9–5. I didn’t realize that working every hour from 9–5 isn’t the goal; it’s
simply the structure most people use, whether it’s necessary or not. I had a severe case of work-for-work
(W4W), the most-hated acronym in the NR vocabulary.
All, and I mean 100%, of my problems and complaints came from this unproductive majority, with
the exception of two large customers who were simply world-class experts of the “here is the fire I
started, now you put it out” approach to business. I put all of these unproductive customers on passive
mode: If they ordered, great—let them fax in the order. If not, I would do absolutely no chasing: no
phone calls, no e-mail, nothing. That left the two larger customers to deal with, who were professional
ball breakers but contributed about 10% to the bottom line at the time.
You’ll always have a few of these, and it is a quandary that causes all sorts of problems, not the least
of which are self-hatred and depression. Up to that point, I had taken their browbeating, insults, timeconsuming
arguments, and tirades as a cost of doing business. I realized during the 80/20 analysis that
these two people were the source of nearly all my unhappiness and anger throughout the day, and it
usually spilled over into my personal time, keeping me up at night with the usual “I should have said X,
Y, and Z to that penis” self-flagellation. I finally concluded the obvious: The effect on my self-esteem
and state of mind just wasn’t worth the financial gain. I didn’t need the money for any precise reason,
and I had assumed I needed to take it. The customers are always right, aren’t they? Part of doing
business, right? Hell, no. Not for the NR, anyway. I fired their asses and enjoyed every second of it. The
first conversation went like this:
Customer: What the &#@$? I ordered two cases and they arrived two days late. [Note: He had sent the
order to the wrong person via the wrong medium, despite repeated reminders.] You guys are the most
disorganized bunch of idiots I’ve ever worked with. I have 20 years of experience in this industry, and
this is the worst.
Any NR—in this case, me: I will kill you. Be afraid, be very afraid.
I wish. I did rehearse that a million times in my mental theater, but it actually went something more like
this:
I’m sorry to hear that. You know, I’ve been taking your insults for a while now, and it’s unfortunate that
it seems we won’t be able to do business anymore. I’d recommend you take a good look at where this
unhappiness and anger is actually coming from. In any case, I wish you well. If you would like to order
product, we’ll be happy to supply it, but only if you can conduct yourself without profanity and
unnecessary insults. You have our fax number. All the best and have a nice day. [Click.]
I did this once via phone and once through e-mail. So what happened? I lost one customer, but the
other corrected course and simply faxed orders, again and again and again. Problem solved, minimum
revenue lost. I was immediately 10 times happier.
I then identified the common characteristics of my top-five customers and secured three or so similarly
profiled buyers in the following week. Remember, more customers is not automatically more income.
More customers is not the goal and often translates into 90% more housekeeping and a paltry 1–3%
increase in income. Make no mistake, maximum income from minimal necessary effort (including
minimum number of customers) is the primary goal. I duplicated my strengths, in this case my top
producers, and focused on increasing the size and frequency of their orders.
The end result? I went from chasing and appeasing 120 customers to simply receiving large orders
from 8, with absolutely no pleading phone calls or e-mail haranguing. My monthly income increased
from $30K to $60K in four weeks and my weekly hours immediately dropped from over 80 to
approximately 15. Most important, I was happy with myself and felt both optimistic and liberated for the
first time in over two years.
In the ensuing weeks, I applied the 80/20 Principle to dozens of areas, including the following:
1. Advertising
I identified the advertising that was generating 80% or more of revenue, identified the commonalities
among them, and multiplied them, eliminating all the rest at the same time. My advertising costs dropped
over 70% and my direct sales income nearly doubled from a monthly $15K to $25K in 8 weeks. It would
have doubled immediately had I been using radio, newspapers, or television instead of magazines with
long lead times.
2. Online Affiliates and Partners
I fired more than 250 low-yield online affiliates or put them in holding patterns to focus instead on the
two affiliates who were generating 90% of the income. My management time decreased from 5–10 hours
per week to 1 hour per month. Online partner income increased more than 50% in that same month.
Slow down and remember this: Most things make no difference. Being busy is a form of laziness—lazy
thinking and indiscriminate action.
Being overwhelmed is often as unproductive as doing nothing, and is far more unpleasant. Being
selective—doing less—is the path of the productive. Focus on the important few and ignore the rest.
Of course, before you can separate the wheat from the chaff and eliminate activities in a new
environment (whether a new job or an entrepreneurial venture), you will need to try a lot to identify what
pulls the most weight. Throw it all up on the wall and see what sticks. That’s part of the process, but it
should not take more than a month or two.
It’s easy to get caught in a flood of minutiae, and the key to not feeling rushed is remembering that
lack of time is actually lack of priorities. Take time to stop and smell the roses, or—in this case—to
count the pea pods.
The 9–5 Illusion and Parkinson’s Law
I saw a bank that said “24-Hour Banking,” but I don’t have that much time.
—STEVEN WRIGHT, comedian
If you’re an employee, spending time on nonsense is, to some extent, not your fault. There is often no
incentive to use time well unless you are paid on commission. The world has agreed to shuffle papers
between 9:00 A.M. and 5:00 P.M., and since you’re trapped in the office for that period of servitude, you
are compelled to create activities to fill that time. Time is wasted because there is so much time available.
It’s understandable. Now that you have the new goal of negotiating a remote work arrangement instead
of just collecting a paycheck, it’s time to revisit the status quo and become effective. The best employees
have the most leverage.
For the entrepreneur, the wasteful use of time is a matter of bad habit and imitation. I am no
exception. Most entrepreneurs were once employees and come from the 9–5 culture. Thus they adopt the
same schedule, whether or not they function at 9:00 A.M. or need 8 hours to generate their target income.
This schedule is a collective social agreement and a dinosaur legacy of the results-by-volume approach.
How is it possible that all the people in the world need exactly 8 hours to accomplish their work? It isn’t.
9–5 is arbitrary.
You don’t need 8 hours per day to become a legitimate millionaire—let alone have the means to live
like one. Eight hours per week is often excessive, but I don’t expect all of you to believe me just yet. I
know you probably feel as I did for a long time: There just aren’t enough hours in the day.
But let’s consider a few things we can probably agree on.
Since we have 8 hours to fill, we fill 8 hours. If we had 15, we would fill 15. If we have an emergency
and need to suddenly leave work in 2 hours but have pending deadlines, we miraculously complete those
assignments in 2 hours.
It is all related to a law that was introduced to me by Ed Zschau in the spring of 2000.
I had arrived to class nervous and unable to concentrate. The final paper, worth a full 25% of the
semester’s grade, was due in 24 hours. One of the options, and that which I had chosen, was to interview
the top executives of a start-up and provide an in-depth analysis of their business model. The corporate
powers that be had decided last minute that I couldn’t interview two key figures or use their information
due to confidentiality issues and pre-IPO precautions. Game over.
I approached Ed after class to deliver the bad news.
“Ed, I think I’m going to need an extension on the paper.” I explained the situation, and Ed smiled
before he replied without so much as a hint of concern.
“I think you’ll be OK. Entrepreneurs are those who make things happen, right?”
Twenty-four hours later and one minute before the deadline, as his assistant was locking the office, I
handed in a 30-page final paper. It was based on a different company I had found, interviewed, and
dissected with an intense all-nighter and enough caffeine to get an entire Olympic track team
disqualified. It ended up being one of the best papers I’d written in four years, and I received an A.
Before I left the classroom the previous day, Ed had given me some parting advice: Parkinson’s Law.
Parkinson’s Law dictates that a task will swell in (perceived) importance and complexity in relation to
the time allotted for its completion. It is the magic of the imminent deadline. If I give you 24 hours to
complete a project, the time pressure forces you to focus on execution, and you have no choice but to do
only the bare essentials. If I give you a week to complete the same task, it’s six days of making a
mountain out of a molehill. If I give you two months, God forbid, it becomes a mental monster. The end
product of the shorter deadline is almost inevitably of equal or higher quality due to greater focus.
This presents a very curious phenomenon. There are two synergistic approaches for increasing
productivity that are inversions of each other:
1. Limit tasks to the important to shorten work time (80/20).
2. Shorten work time to limit tasks to the important (Parkinson’s Law).
The best solution is to use both together: Identify the few critical tasks that contribute most to income
and schedule them with very short and clear deadlines.
If you haven’t identified the mission-critical tasks and set aggressive start and end times for their
completion, the unimportant becomes the important. Even if you know what’s critical, without deadlines
that create focus, the minor tasks forced upon you (or invented, in the case of the entrepreneur) will swell
to consume time until another bit of minutiae jumps in to replace it, leaving you at the end of the day
with nothing accomplished. How else could dropping off a package at UPS, setting a few appointments,
and checking e-mail consume an entire 9–5 day? Don’t feel bad. I spent months jumping from one
interruption to the next, feeling run by my business instead of the other way around.
THE 80/20 PRINCIPLE and Parkinson’s Law are the two cornerstone concepts that will be revisited in
different forms throughout this entire section. Most inputs are useless and time is wasted in proportion to
the amount that is available.
Fat-free performance and time freedom begins with limiting intake overload. In the next chapter, we’ll
put you on the real breakfast of champions: the Low-Information Diet.
Love of bustle is not industry.
—SENECA
A Dozen Cupcakes and One Question
MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA.
“Saturdays are my days off,” I offered to the crowd of strangers staring at me, friends of a friend. It
was true. Can you eat All-Bran and chicken seven days a week? Me neither. Don’t be so judgmental.
Between my tenth and twelfth cupcakes, I plopped down on the couch to revel in the sugar high until
the clock struck midnight and sent me back to my adultsville Sunday–Friday diet. There was another
party guest seated next to me on a chair, nursing a glass of wine, not his twelfth but certainly not his first,
and we struck up a conversation. As usual, I had to struggle to answer “What do you do?” and, as usual,
my answer left someone to wonder whether I was a pathological liar or a criminal.
How was it possible to spend so little time on income generation? It’s a good question. It’s THE
question.
In almost all respects, Charney had it all. He was happily married with a two-year-old son and another
due to arrive in three months. He was a successful technology salesman, and though he wanted to earn
$500,000 more per year as all do, his finances were solid.
He also asked good questions. I had just returned from another trip overseas and was planning a new
adventure to Japan. He drilled me for two hours with a refrain: How is it possible to spend so little time
on income generation?
“If you’re interested, we can make you a case study and I’ll show you how,” I offered.
Charney was in. The one thing he didn’t have was time.
One e-mail and five weeks of practice later, Charney had good news: He had accomplished more in
the last week than he had in the previous four combined. He did so while taking Monday and Friday off
and spending at least 2 more hours per day with his family. From 40 hours per week, he was down to 18
and producing four times the results.
Was it from mountaintop retreats and secret kung fu training? Nope. Was it a new Japanese
management secret or better software? Nein. I just asked him to do one simple thing consistently without
fail.
At least three times per day at scheduled times, he had to ask himself the following question:
Am I being productive or just active?
Charney captured the essence of this with less-abstract wording:
Am I inventing things to do to avoid the important?
He eliminated all of the activities he used as crutches and began to focus on demonstrating results instead
of showing dedication. Dedication is often just meaningless work in disguise. Be ruthless and cut the fat.
It is possible to have your cupcake and eat it, too.
Q&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS
We create stress for ourselves because you feel like you have to do it. You have to. I don’t feel
that anymore.
—OPRAH WINFREY, actress and talk-show host, The Oprah Winfrey Show
The key to having more time is doing less, and there are two paths to getting there, both of which
should be used together: (1) Define a to-do list and (2) define a not-to-do list. In general terms, there are
but two questions:
What 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness?
What 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcome and happiness?
Hypothetical cases help to get us started:
1. If you had a heart attack and had to work two hours per day, what would you do?
Not five hours, not four hours, not three—two hours. It’s not where I want you to ultimately be, but it’s a
start. Besides, I can hear your brain bubbling already: That’s ridiculous. Impossible! I know, I know. If I
told you that you could survive for months, functioning quite well, on four hours of sleep per night,
would you believe me? Probably not. Notwithstanding, millions of new mothers do it all the time. This
exercise is not optional. The doctor has warned you, after triple-bypass surgery, that if you don’t cut
down your work to two hours per day for the first three months post-op, you will die. How would you do
it?
2. If you had a second heart attack and had to work two hours per week, what would you do?
3. If you had a gun to your head and had to stop doing 4/5 of different time-consuming activities,
what would you remove? Simplicity requires ruthlessness. If you had to stop
of time-consuming
activities—e-mail, phone calls, conversations, paperwork, meetings, advertising, customers, suppliers,
products, services, etc.—what would you eliminate to keep the negative effect on income to a minimum?
Used even once per month, this question alone can keep you sane and on track.
4. What are the top-three activities that I use to fill time to feel as though I’ve been productive?
These are usually used to postpone more important actions (often uncomfortable because there is a
chance of failure or rejection). Be honest with yourself, as we all do this on occasion. What are your
crutch activities?
5. Who are the 20% of people who produce 80% of your enjoyment and propel you forward, and
which 20% cause 80% of your depression, anger, and second-guessing?
Identify:
Positive friends versus time-consuming friends: Who is helping
versus hurting you, and how do you increase your time with the
former while decreasing or eliminating your time with the latter?
Who is causing me stress disproportionate to the time I spend with
them? What will happen if I simply stop interacting with these
people? Fear-setting helps here.
When do I feel starved for time? What commitments, thoughts,
and people can I eliminate to fix this problem?
Exact numbers aren’t needed to realize that we spend too much time with those who poison us with
pessimism, sloth, and low expectations of themselves and the world. It is often the case that you have to
fire certain friends or retire from particular social circles to have the life you want. This isn’t being
mean; it is being practical. Poisonous people do not deserve your time. To think otherwise is masochistic.
The best way to approach a potential break is simple: Confide in them honestly but tactfully and
explain your concerns. If they bite back, your conclusions have been confirmed. Drop them like any
other bad habit. If they promise to change, first spend at least two weeks apart to develop other positive
influences in your life and diminish psychological dependency. The next trial period should have a set
duration and consist of pass-or-fail criteria.
If this approach is too confrontational for you, just politely refuse to interact with them. Be in the
middle of something when the call comes, and have a prior commitment when the invitation to hang out
comes. Once you see the benefits of decreased time with these people, it will be easier to stop
communication altogether.
I’m not going to lie: It sucks. It hurts like pulling out a splinter. But you are the average of the five
people you associate with most, so do not underestimate the effects of your pessimistic, unambitious, or
disorganized friends. If someone isn’t making you stronger, they’re making you weaker.
Remove the splinters and you’ll thank yourself for it.
6. Learn to ask, “If this is the only thing I accomplish today, will I be satisfied with my day?”
Don’t ever arrive at the office or in front of your computer without a clear list of priorities. You’ll just
read unassociated e-mail and scramble your brain for the day. Compile your to-do list for tomorrow no
later than this evening. I don’t recommend using Outlook or computerized to-do lists, because it is
possible to add an infinite number of items. I use a standard piece of paper folded in half three times,
which fits perfectly in the pocket and limits you to noting only a few items.
There should never be more than two mission-critical items to complete each day. Never. It just isn’t
necessary if they’re actually high-impact. If you are stuck trying to decide between multiple items that all
seem crucial, as happens to all of us, look at each in turn and ask yourself, If this is the only thing I
accomplish today, will I be satisfied with my day?
To counter the seemingly urgent, ask yourself: What will happen if I don’t do this, and is it worth
putting off the important to do it? If you haven’t already accomplished at least one important task in the
day, don’t spend the last business hour returning a DVD to avoid a $5 late charge. Get the important task
done and pay the $5 fine.
7. Put a Post-it on your computer screen or set an Outlook reminder to alert you at least three
times daily with the question: Are you inventing things to do to avoid the important?
I also use free time-tracking software called RescueTime (www.rescuetime.com) to alert me when I
spend more than an allotted time on certain websites or programs often used to avoid the important
(Gmail, Facebook, Outlook, etc.). It also summarizes your time use each week and compares your
performance to peers.
8. Do not multitask.
I’m going to tell you what you already know. Trying to brush your teeth, talk on the phone, and answer
e-mail at the same time just doesn’t work. Eating while doing online research and instant messaging?
Ditto.
If you prioritize properly, there is no need to multitask. It is a symptom of “task creep”—doing more
to feel productive while actually accomplishing less. As stated, you should have, at most, two primary
goals or tasks per day. Do them separately from start to finish without distraction. Divided attention will
result in more frequent interruptions, lapses in concentration, poorer net results, and less gratification.
9. Use Parkinson’s Law on a Macro and Micro Level.
Use Parkinson’s Law to accomplish more in less time. Shorten schedules and deadlines to necessitate
focused action instead of deliberation and procrastination.
On a weekly and daily macro level, attempt to take Monday and/or Friday off, as well as leave work at
4 P.M. This will focus you to prioritize more effectively and quite possibly develop a social life. If you’re
under the hawklike watch of a boss, we’ll discuss the nuts and bolts of how to escape in later chapters.
On a micro task level, limit the number of items on your to-do list and use impossibly short deadlines
to force immediate action while ignoring minutiae.
If doing work online or near an online computer, http://e.ggtimer.com/ is a convenient countdown
timer. Just type the desired time limit directly into the URL field and hit enter. The http:// can often be
omitted. For example:
http://e.ggtimer.com/5minutes (or just “e.ggtimer.com/5min”insomebrowsers)
http://e.ggtimer.com/1hour30minutes30seconds
http://e.ggtimer.com/30 (if you just put in a number, it assumes seconds)
COMFORT CHALLENGE
Learn to Propose (2 Days)
Stop asking for opinions and start proposing solutions. Begin with the small things. If someone is going
to ask, or asks, “Where should we eat?” “What movie should we watch?” “What should we do tonight?”
or anything similar, do NOT reflect it back with, “Well, what do you want to … ?” Offer a solution. Stop
the back-and-forth and make a decision. Practice this in both personal and professional environments.
Here are a few lines that help (my favorites are the first and last):
“Can I make a suggestion?”
“I propose …”
“I’d like to propose …”
“I suggest that … What do you think?”
“Let’s try … and then try something else if that doesn’t work.”
LIFESTYLE DESIGN IN ACTION
I’m a musician who got your book because Derek Sivers at CD Baby recommended it. Checking
Pareto’s Law I realized that 78% of my downloads came from just one of my CDs and that 55% of my
total download income came from only five songs! It showed me what my fans are looking for and
allowed me to showcase those on my web site. Downloads are the way to go. iTunes sells the song and
CD Baby direct deposits it to my account. Fully automated once the recording is done. There are some
months I can live off download income. Once I finish paying off debt, it should be no problem to travel
as an artist and create new fans all over the world and have a cyber income stream.
—VICTOR JOHNSON
As for “outsourcing” your banking, any company that needs to take checks (cheques) should consider
a lock box solution. Just about any bank that does business banking offers it. All checks go to a PO box
at the bank, the bank processes the checks and deposits them, and according to your instructions can
send you a file of all the checks that are deposited. Normally this can be done in either a flat, Excel or
other file type that can interface with any accounting systems from Excel, to Quicken to SAP. Quite cost
effective.
—ANONYMOUS
The Low-Information Diet
CULTIVATING SELECTIVE IGNORANCE
What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence,
a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention
efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.
—HERBERT SIMON, recipient of Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics 8 and the A.M. Turing
Award, the “Nobel Prize of Computer Science”
Reading, after a certain age, diverts the mind too much from its creative pursuits. Any man who
reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking.
—ALBERT EINSTEIN
I hope you’re sitting down. Take that sandwich out of your mouth so you don’t choke. Cover the
baby’s ears. I’m going to tell you something that upsets a lot of people.
I never watch the news and have bought one single newspaper in the last five years, in Stansted
Airport in London, and only because it gave me a discount on a Diet Pepsi.
I would claim to be Amish, but last time I checked, Pepsi wasn’t on the menu.
How obscene! I call myself an informed and responsible citizen? How do I stay up-to-date with
current affairs? I’ll answer all of that, but wait—it gets better. I usually check business e-mail for about
an hour each Monday, and I never check voicemail when abroad. Never ever.
But what if someone has an emergency? It doesn’t happen. My contacts now know that I don’t
respond to emergencies, so the emergencies somehow don’t exist or don’t come to me. Problems, as a
rule, solve themselves or disappear if you remove yourself as an information bottleneck and empower
others.
Cultivating Selective Ignorance
There are many things of which a wise man might wish to be ignorant.
—RALPH WALDO EMERSON (1803–1882)
From this point forward, I’m going to propose that you develop an uncanny ability to be selectively
ignorant. Ignorance may be bliss, but it is also practical. It is imperative that you learn to ignore or
redirect all information and interruptions that are irrelevant, unimportant, or unactionable. Most are all
three.
The first step is to develop and maintain a low-information diet. Just as modern man consumes both
too many calories and calories of no nutritional value, information workers eat data both in excess and
from the wrong sources.
Lifestyle design is based on massive action—output. Increased output necessitates decreased input.
Most information is time-consuming, negative, irrelevant to your goals, and outside of your influence. I
challenge you to look at whatever you read or watched today and tell me that it wasn’t at least two of the
four.
I read the front-page headlines through the newspaper machines as I walk to lunch each day and
nothing more. In five years, I haven’t had a single problem due to this selective ignorance. It gives you
something new to ask the rest of the population in lieu of small talk: “Tell me, what’s new in the
world?” And, if it’s that important, you’ll hear people talking about it. Using my crib notes approach to
world affairs, I also retain more than someone who loses the forest for the trees in a sea of extraneous
details.
From an actionable information standpoint, I consume a maximum of one-third of one industry
magazine (Response magazine) and one business magazine (Inc.) per month, for a grand total of
approximately four hours. That’s it for results-oriented reading. I read an hour of fiction prior to bed for
relaxation.
How on earth do I act responsibly? Let me give an example of how I and other NR both consider and
obtain information. I voted in the last presidential election, 9 despite having been in Berlin. I made my
decision in a matter of hours. First, I sent e-mails to educated friends in the U.S. who share my values
and asked them who they were voting for and why. Second, I judge people based on actions and not
words; thus, I asked friends in Berlin, who had more perspective outside of U.S. media propaganda, how
they judged the candidates based on their historical behavior. Last, I watched the presidential debates.
That was it. I let other dependable people synthesize hundreds of hours and thousands of pages of media
for me. It was like having dozens of personal information assistants, and I didn’t have to pay them a
single cent.
That’s a simple example, you say, but what if you need to learn to do something your friends haven’t
done? Like, say, sell a book to the world’s largest publisher as a first-time author? Funny you should
ask. There are two approaches I used:
1. I picked one book out of dozens based on reader reviews and the fact that the authors had actually
done what I wanted to do. If the task is how-to in nature, I only read accounts that are “how I did it” and
autobiographical. No speculators or wannabes are worth the time.
2. Using the book to generate intelligent and specific questions, I contacted 10 of the top authors and
agents in the world via e-mail and phone, with a response rate of 80%.
I only read the sections of the book that were relevant to immediate next steps, which took less than
two hours. To develop a template e-mail and call script took approximately four hours, and the actual e-
mails and phone calls took less than an hour. This personal contact approach is not only more effective
and more efficient than all-you-can-eat info buffets, it also provided me with the major league alliances
and mentors necessary to sell this book. Rediscover the power of the forgotten skill called “talking.” It
works.
Once again, less is more.
How to Read 200% Faster in 10 Minutes
There will be times when, it’s true, you will have to read. Here are four simple tips that will lessen the
damage and increase your speed at least 200% in 10 minutes with no comprehension loss:
1. Two Minutes: Use a pen or finger to trace under each line as you read as fast as possible.
Reading is a series of jumping snapshots (called saccades), and using a visual guide prevents
regression.
2. Three Minutes: Begin each line focusing on the third word in from the first word, and end
each line focusing on the third word in from the last word. This makes use of peripheral vision
that is otherwise wasted on margins. For example, even when the highlighted words in the next
line are your beginning and ending focal points, the entire sentence is “read,” just with less eye
movement:
“Once upon a time, an information addict decided to detox.”
Move in from both sides further and further as it gets easier.
3. Two Minutes: Once comfortable indenting three or four words from both sides, attempt to
take only two snapshots—also known as fixations—per line on the first and last indented
words.
4. Three Minutes: Practice reading too fast for comprehension but with good technique (the
above three techniques) for five pages prior to reading at a comfortable speed. This will
heighten perception and reset your speed limit, much like how 50 mph normally feels fast but
seems like slow motion if you drop down from 70 mph on the freeway.
To calculate reading speed in words per minute (wpm)—and thus progress—in a given book, add up
the number of words in ten lines and divide by ten to get the average words per line. Multiply this by the
number of lines per page and you have the average words per page. Now it’s simple. If you initially read
1.25 pages in one minute at 330 average words per page, that’s 412.5 words per minute. If you then read
3.5 pages after training, it’s 1,155 words per minute and you’re in the top 1% of the world’s fastest
readers.
Q&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS
Learning to ignore things is one of the great paths to inner peace.
—ROBERT J. SAWYER, Calculating God
1. Go on an immediate one-week media fast.
The world doesn’t even hiccup, much less end, when you cut the information umbilical cord. To realize
this, it’s best to use the Band-Aid approach and do it quickly: a one-week media fast. Information is too
much like ice cream to do otherwise. “Oh, I’ll just have a half a spoonful” is about as realistic as “I just
want to jump online for a minute.” Go cold turkey.
If you want to go back to the 15,000-calorie potato chip information diet afterward, fine, but beginning
tomorrow and for at least five full days, here are the rules:
No newspapers, magazines, audiobooks, or nonmusic radio. Music is permitted at all times.
No news websites whatsoever (cnn.com, drudgereport.com, msn.com, 10 etc.).
No television at all, except for one hour of pleasure viewing each evening.
No reading books, except for this book and one hour of fiction 11 pleasure reading prior to bed.
No web surfing at the desk unless it is necessary to complete a work task for that day. Necessary means
necessary, not nice to have.
Unnecessary reading is public enemy number one during this one-week fast.
What do you do with all the extra time? Replace the newspaper at breakfast with speaking to your
spouse, bonding with your children, or learning the principles in this book. Between 9–5, complete your
top priorities as per the last chapter. If you complete them with time to spare, do the exercises in this
book. Recommending this book might seem hypocritical, but it’s not: The information in these pages is
both important and to be applied now, not tomorrow or the day after.
Each day at lunch break, and no earlier, get your five-minute news fix. Ask a well-informed colleague
or a restaurant waiter, “Anything important happening in the world today? I couldn’t get the paper
today.” Stop this as soon as you realize that the answer doesn’t affect your actions at all. Most people
won’t even remember what they spent one to two hours absorbing that morning.
Be strict with yourself. I can prescribe the medicine, but you need to take it.
Download the Firefox web browser (www.firefox.com) and use LeechBlock to block certain sites
entirely for set periods. From their site (http://www.proginosko.com/leechblock.html):
You can specify up to six sets of sites to block, with different times and days for each set. You can block
sites within fixed time periods (e.g., between 9am and 5pm), after a time limit (e.g., 10 minutes in every
hour), or with a combination of time periods and time limit (e.g., 10 minutes in every hour between 9am
and 5pm). You can also set a password for access to the extension options, just to slow you down in
moments of weakness!
2. Develop the habit of asking yourself, “Will I definitely use this information for something
immediate and important?”
It’s not enough to use information for “something”—it needs to be immediate and important. If “no” on
either count, don’t consume it. Information is useless if it is not applied to something important or if you
will forget it before you have a chance to apply it.
I used to have the habit of reading a book or site to prepare for an event weeks or months in the future,
and I would then need to reread the same material when the deadline for action was closer. This is stupid
and redundant. Follow your to-do short list and fill in the information gaps as you go.
Focus on what digerati Kathy Sierra calls “just-in-time” information instead of “just-in-case”
information.
3. Practice the art of nonfinishing.
This is another one that took me a long time to learn. Starting something doesn’t automatically justify
finishing it.
If you are reading an article that sucks, put it down and don’t pick it back up. If you go to a movie and
it’s worse than Matrix III, get the hell out of there before more neurons die. If you’re full after half a
plate of ribs, put the damn fork down and don’t order dessert.
More is not better, and stopping something is often 10 times better than finishing it. Develop the habit
of nonfinishing that which is boring or unproductive if a boss isn’t demanding it.
COMFORT CHALLENGE
Get Phone Numbers (2 Days)
Being sure to maintain eye contact, ask for the phone numbers of at least two (the more you attempt, the
less stressful it will be) attractive members of the opposite sex on each day. Girls, this means you’re in
the game as well, and it doesn’t matter if you’re 50+. Remember that the real goal is not to get numbers,
but to get over the fear of asking, so the outcome is unimportant. If you’re in a relationship, sign up to
(or pretend to) gather information for Greenpeace. Just toss the numbers if you get them.
Go to a mall if you want to get some rapid-fire practice—my preference for getting over the
discomfort quickly—and aim to ask three people in a row within five minutes. Feel free to use some
variation of the following script:
“Excuse me. I know this is going to sound strange, but if I don’t ask you now, I’ll be kicking myself
for the rest of the day. I’m running to meet a friend [i.e., I have friends and am not a stalker], but I think
you’re really [extremely, drop-dead] cute [gorgeous, hot]. Could I have your phone number? I’m not a
psycho—I promise. You can give me a fake one if you’re not interested.”

impossible to have perfect and complete information at any given time to make a decision.

10. LOL.
11. As someone who read exclusively nonfiction for nearly 15 years, I can tell you two things: It’s not
productive to read two fact-based books at the same time (this is one), and fiction is better than
sleeping pills for putting the happenings of the day behind you.
Interrupting Interruption and the
Art of Refusal
Do your own thinking independently. Be the chess player, not the chess piece.
—RALPH CHARELL
Meetings are an addictive, highly self-indulgent activity that corporations and other
organizations habitually engage in only because they cannot actually masturbate.
—DAVE BARRY, Pulitzer Prize–winning American humorist
SPRING 2000, PRINCETON , NEW JERSEY
1:35 P.M.
“I think I understand. Moving on. In the next paragraph, it explains that …” I had detailed notes and
didn’t want to miss a single point.
3:45 P.M.
“OK. That makes sense, but if we look at the following example …” I paused for a moment midsentence.
The teaching assistant had both hands on his face.
“Tim, let’s end here for now. I’ll be sure to keep these points in mind.” He had had enough. Me too,
but I knew I’d only have to do it once.
For all four years of school, I had a policy. If I received anything less than an A on the first paper or
non-multiple-choice test in a given class, I would bring 2–3 hours of questions to the grader’s office
hours and not leave until the other had answered them all or stopped out of exhaustion.
This served two important purposes:
1. I learned exactly how the grader evaluated work, including his or her prejudices and pet peeves.
2. The grader would think long and hard about ever giving me less than an A. He or she would never
consider giving me a bad grade without exceptional reasons for doing so, as he or she knew I’d
come a’knocking for another three-hour visit.
Learn to be difficult when it counts. In school as in life, having a reputation for being assertive will
help you receive preferential treatment without having to beg or fight for it every time.
Think back to your days on the playground. There was always a big bully and countless victims, but
there was also that one small kid who fought like hell, thrashing and swinging for the fences. He or she
might not have won, but after one or two exhausting exchanges, the bully chose not to bother him or her.
It was easier to find someone else.
Be that kid.
Doing the important and ignoring the trivial is hard because so much of the world seems to conspire to
force crap upon you. Fortunately, a few simple routine changes make bothering you much more painful
than leaving you in peace.
It’s time to stop taking information abuse.
Not All Evils Are Created Equal
For our purposes, an interruption is anything that prevents the start-to-finish completion of a critical
task, and there are three principal offenders:
1. Time wasters: those things that can be ignored with little or no consequence. Common time
wasters include meetings, discussions, phone calls, web surfing, and e-mail that are unimportant.
2. Time consumers: repetitive tasks or requests that need to be completed but often interrupt highlevel
work. Here are a few you might know intimately: reading and responding to e-mail, making
and returning phone calls, customer service (order status, product assistance, etc.), financial or
sales reporting, personal errands, all necessary repeated actions and tasks.
3. Empowerment failures: instances where someone needs approval to make something small
happen. Here are just a few: fixing customer problems (lost shipments, damaged shipments,
malfunctions, etc.), customer contact, cash expenditures of all types.
Let’s look at the prescriptions for all three in turn.
Time Wasters: Become an Ignoramus
The best defense is a good offense.
—DAN GABLE, Olympic gold medalist in wrestling and the most successful coach in history;
personal record: 299–6–3, with 182 pins
Time wasters are the easiest to eliminate and deflect. It is a matter of limiting access and funneling all
communication toward immediate action.
First, limit e-mail consumption and production. This is the greatest single interruption in the modern
world.
1. Turn off the audible alert if you have one on Outlook or a similar program and turn off
automatic send/receive, which delivers e-mail to your inbox as soon as someone sends them.
2. Check e-mail twice per day, once at 12:00 noon or just prior to lunch, and again at 4:00 P.M.
12:00 P.M. and 4:00 P.M. are times that ensure you will have the most responses from previously
sent e-mail. Never check e-mail first thing in the morning. 12 Instead, complete your most
important task before 11:00 A.M. to avoid using lunch or reading e-mail as a postponement excuse.

Before implementing the twice-daily routine, you must create an e-mail autoresponse that will train
your boss, co-workers, suppliers, and clients to be more effective. I would recommend that you do not
ask to implement this. Remember one of our ten commandments: Beg for forgiveness; don’t ask for
permission.
If this gives you heart palpitations, speak with your immediate supervisor and propose to trial the
approach for one to three days. Cite pending projects and frustration with constant interruptions as the
reasons. Feel free to blame it on spam or someone outside of the office.
Here is a simple e-mail template that can be used:
Greetings, Friends [or Esteemed Colleagues],
Due to high workload, I am currently checking and responding to e-mail twice daily at 12:00 p.m.
ET [or your time zone] and 4:00 p.m. ET.
If you require urgent assistance (please ensure it is urgent) that cannot wait until either 12:00 p.m.
or 4:00 p.m., please contact me via phone at 555–555–5555.
Thank you for understanding this move to more efficiency and effectiveness. It helps me
accomplish more to serve you better.
Sincerely,
Tim Ferriss
MOVE TO ONCE-PER-DAY as quickly as possible. Emergencies are seldom that. People are poor judges of
importance and inflate minutiae to fill time and feel important. This autoresponse is a tool that, far from
decreasing collective effectiveness, forces people to re-evaluate their reason for interrupting you and
helps them decrease meaningless and time-consuming contact.
I was initially terrified of missing important requests and inviting disaster, just as you might be upon
reading this recommendation. Nothing happened. Give it a shot and work out the small bumps as you
progress.
For an extreme example of a personal autoresponder that has never prompted a complaint and allowed
me to check e-mail once per week, send an e-mail to template@fourhourworkweek.com. It has been
revised over three years and works like a charm.
The second step is to screen incoming and limit outgoing phone calls.
1. Use two telephone numbers if possible—one office line (non urgent) and one cellular (urgent). This
could also be two cell phones, or the non-urgent line could be an Internet phone number that routes calls
to online voicemail (www.skype.com, for example).
Use the cell number in the e-mail autoresponse and answer it at all times unless it is an unknown caller
or it is a call you don’t want to answer. If in doubt, allow the call to go to voicemail and listen to the
voicemail immediately afterward to gauge importance. If it can wait, let it wait. The offending parties
have to learn to wait.
The office phone should be put on silent mode and allowed to go to voicemail at all times. The
voicemail recording should sound familiar:
You’ve reached the desk of Tim Ferriss.
I am currently checking and responding to voicemail twice daily at 12:00 p.m. ET [or your time
zone] and 4:00 p.m. ET.
If you require assistance with a truly urgent matter that cannot wait until either 12:00 p.m. or 4:00
p.m., please contact me on my cell at 555–555–5555. Otherwise, please leave a message and I will
return it at the next of those two times. Be sure to leave your e-mail address, as I am often able to
respond faster that way.
Thank you for understanding this move to more efficiency and effectiveness. It helps me
accomplish more to serve you better.
Have a wonderful day.
2. If someone does call your cell phone, it is presumably urgent and should be treated as such. Do not
allow them to consume time otherwise. It’s all in the greeting. Compare the following:
Jane (receiver):Hello?
John (caller): Hi, is this Jane?
Jane: This is Jane.
John: Hi, Jane, it’s John.
Jane: Oh, hi, John. How are you? (or) Oh, hi, John. What’s going on?
John will now digress and lead you into a conversation about nothing, from which you will have to
recover and then fish out the ultimate purpose of the call. There is a better approach:
Jane: This is Jane speaking.
John: Hi, it’s John.
Jane: Hi, John. I’m right in the middle of something. How can I help you out?
Potential continuation:
John: Oh, I can call back.
Jane: No, I have a minute. What can I do for you?
Don’t encourage people to chitchat and don’t let them chitchat. Get them to the point immediately. If
they meander or try to postpone for a later undefined call, reel them in and get them to come to the point.
If they go into a long description of a problem, cut in with, “[Name], sorry to interrupt, but I have a call
in five minutes. What can I do to help out?” You might instead say, “[Name], sorry to interrupt, but I
have a call in five minutes. Can you send me an e-mail?”
The third step is to master the art of refusal and avoiding meetings.
THE FIRST DAY our new Sales VP arrived at TrueSAN in 2001, he came into the all-company meeting
and made an announcement in just about this many words: “I am not here to make friends. I have been
hired to build a sales team and sell product, and that’s what I intend to do. Thanks.” So much for small
talk.
He proceeded to deliver on his promise. The office socializers disliked him for his no-nonsense
approach to communication, but everyone respected his time. He wasn’t rude without reason, but he was
direct and kept the people around him focused. Some didn’t consider him charismatic, but no one
considered him anything less than spectacularly effective.
I remember sitting down in his office for our first one-on-one meeting. Fresh off four years of
rigorous academic training, I immediately jumped into explaining the prospect profiles, elaborate
planning I’d developed, responses to date, and so forth and so on. I had spent at least two hours
preparing to make this first impression a good one. He listened with a smile on his face for no more than
two minutes and then held up a hand. I stopped. He laughed in a kind-hearted manner and said, “Tim, I
don’t want the story. Just tell me what we need to do.”
Over the following weeks, he trained me to recognize when I was unfocused or focused on the wrong
things, which meant anything that didn’t move the top two or three clients one step closer to signing a
purchase order. Our meetings were now no more than five minutes long.
From this moment forward, resolve to keep those around you focused and avoid all meetings, whether
in person or remote, that do not have clear objectives. It is possible to do this tactfully, but expect that
some time wasters will be offended the first few times their advances are rejected. Once it is clear that
remaining on task is your policy and not subject to change, they will accept it and move on with life.
Hard feelings pass. Don’t suffer fools or you’ll become one.
It is your job to train those around you to be effective and efficient. No one else will do it for you.
Here are a few recommendations:
1. Decide that, given the non-urgent nature of most issues, you will steer people toward the following
means of communication, in order of preference: e-mail, phone, and in-person meetings. If someone
proposes a meeting, request an e-mail instead and then use the phone as your fallback offer if need be.
Cite other immediately pending work tasks as the reason.
2. Respond to voicemail via e-mail whenever possible. This trains people to be concise. Help them
develop the habit.
Similar to our opening greeting on the phone, e-mail communication should be streamlined to prevent
needless back-and-forth. Thus, an e-mail with “Can you meet at 4:00 P.M.?” would become “Can you
meet at 4:00 P.M.? If so If not, please advise three other times that work for you.”
This “if … then” structure becomes more important as you check e-mail less often. Since I only check
e-mail once a week, it is critical that no one needs a “what if?” answered or other information within
seven days of a given e-mail I send. If I suspect that a manufacturing order hasn’t arrived at the shipping
facility, for example, I’ll send an e-mail to my shipping facility manager along these lines: “Dear Susan
… Has the new manufacturing shipment arrived? If so, please advise me on … If not, please contact John
Doe at 555–5555 or via e-mail at john@doe.com (he is also CC’d) and advise on delivery date and
tracking. John, if there are any issues with the shipment, please coordinate with Susan, reachable at 555–
4444, who has the authority to make decisions up to $500 on my behalf. In case of emergency, call me
on my cell phone, but I trust you two. Thanks.” This prevents most follow-up questions, avoids two
separate dialogues, and takes me out of the problem-solving equation.
Get into the habit of considering what “if … then” actions can be proposed in any e-mail where you
ask a question.
3. Meetings should only be held to make decisions about a predefined situation, not to define the
problem. If someone proposes that you meet with them or “set a time to talk on the phone,” ask that
person to send you an e-mail with an agenda to define the purpose:
That sounds doable. So I can best prepare, can you please send me an e-mail with an agenda? That is,
the topics and questions we’ll need to address? That would be great. Thanks in advance.
Don’t give them a chance to bail out. The “thanks in advance” before a retort increases your chances
of getting the e-mail.
The e-mail medium forces people to define the desired outcome of a meeting or call. Nine times out
of ten, a meeting is unnecessary and you can answer the questions, once defined, via e-mail. Impose this
habit on others. I haven’t had an in-person meeting for my business in more than five years and have had
fewer than a dozen conference calls, all lasting less than 30 minutes.
4. Speaking of 30 minutes, if you absolutely cannot stop a meeting or call from happening, define the end
time. Do not leave these discussions open-ended, and keep them short. If things are well-defined,
decisions should not take more than 30 minutes. Cite other commitments at odd times to make them more
believable (e.g., 3:20 vs. 3:30) and force people to focus instead of socializing, commiserating, and
digressing. If you must join a meeting that is scheduled to last a long time or that is open-ended, inform
the organizer that you would like permission to cover your portion first, as you have a commitment in 15
minutes. If you have to, feign an urgent phone call. Get the hell out of there and have someone else
update you later. The other option is to be completely transparent and voice your opinion of how
unnecessary the meeting is. If you choose this route, be prepared to face fire and offer alternatives.
5. The cubicle is your temple—don’t permit casual visitors. Some suggest using a clear “do not disturb”
sign of some type, but I have found that this is ignored unless you have an office. My approach was to
put headphones on, even if I wasn’t listening to anything. If someone approached me despite this
discouragement, I would pretend to be on the phone. I’d put a finger to my lips, say something like, “I
hear you,” and then say into the mic, “Can you hold on a second?” Next, I’d turn to the invader and say,
“Hi. What can I do for you?” I wouldn’t let them “get back to me” but rather force the person to give me
a five-second summary and then send me an e-mail if necessary.
If headphone games aren’t your thing, the reflexive response to an invader should be the same as when
answering the cell phone: “Hi, invader. I’m right in the middle of something. How can I be of help?” If
it’s not clear within 30 seconds, ask the person to send you an e-mail about the chosen issue; do not offer
to send them an e-mail first: “I’ll be happy to help, but I have to finish this first. Can you send me a
quick e-mail to remind me?” If you still cannot deflect an invader, give the person a time limit on your
availability, which can also be used for phone conversations: “OK, I only have two minutes before a call,
but what’s the situation and what can I do to help?”
6. Use the Puppy Dog Close to help your superiors and others develop the no-meeting habit. The Puppy
Dog Close in sales is so named because it is based on the pet store sales approach: If someone likes a
puppy but is hesitant to make the life-altering purchase, just offer to let them take the pup home and
bring it back if they change their minds. Of course, the return seldom happens.
The Puppy Dog Close is invaluable whenever you face resistance to permanent changes. Get your foot
in the door with a “let’s just try it once” reversible trial.
Compare the following:
“I think you’d love this puppy. It will forever add to your responsibilities until he dies 10 years from
now. No more care-free vacations, and you’ll finally get to pick up poop all over the city—what do
you think?”
vs.
Now imagine walking up to your boss in the hallway and clapping a hand on her shoulder:
“I’d like to go to the meeting, but I have a better idea. Let’s never have another one, since all we do is
waste time and not decide anything useful.”
vs.
The second set of alternatives seem less permanent, and they’re intended to appear so. Repeat this
routine and ensure that you achieve more outside of the meeting than the attendees do within it; repeat
the disappearing act as often as possible and cite improved productivity to convert this slowly into a
permanent routine change.
Learn to imitate any good child: “Just this once! Please!!! I promise I’ll do X!” Parents fall for it
because kids help adults to fool themselves. It works with bosses, suppliers, customers, and the rest of
the world, too.
Use it, but don’t fall for it. If a boss asks for overtime “just this once,” he or she will expect it in the
future.
Time Consumers: Batch and Do Not Falter
A schedule defends from chaos and whim.
—ANNIE DILLARD, winner of Pulitzer Prize in nonfiction, 1975
If you have never used a commercial printer before, the pricing and lead times could surprise you.
Let’s assume it costs $310 and takes one week to print 20 customized T-shirts with 4-color logos. How
much and how long does it take to print 3 of the same T-shirt?
$310 and one week.
How is that possible? Simple—the setup charges don’t change. It costs the printer the same amount in
materials for plate preparation ($150) and the same in labor to man the press itself ($100). The setup is
the real time-consumer, and thus the job, despite its small size, needs to be scheduled just like the other,
resulting in the same one-week delivery date. The lower economy of scale picks up the rest: The cost for
3 shirts is $20 per shirt x 3 shirts instead of $3 per shirt x 20 shirts.
The cost- and time-effective solution, therefore, is to wait until you have a larger order, an approach
called “batching.” Batching is also the solution to our distracting but necessary time consumers, those
repetitive tasks that interrupt the most important.
If you check mail and make bill payments five times a week, it might take 30 minutes per instance and
you respond to a total of 20 letters in two and a half hours. If you do this once per week instead, it might
take 60 minutes total and you still respond to a total of 20 letters. People do the former out of fear of
emergencies. First, there are seldom real emergencies. Second, of the urgent communication you will
receive, missing a deadline is usually reversible and otherwise costs a minimum to correct.
There is an inescapable setup time for all tasks, large or minuscule in scale. It is often the same for one
as it is for a hundred. There is a psychological switching of gears that can require up to 45 minutes to
resume a major task that has been interrupted. More than a quarter of each 9–5 period (28%) is
consumed by such interruptions. 13
This is true of all recurring tasks and is precisely why we have already decided to check e-mail and
phone calls twice per day at specific predetermined times (between which we let them accumulate).
From mid-2004 to 2007, I checked mail no more than once a week, often not for up to four weeks at a
time. Nothing was irreparable, and nothing cost more than $300 to fix. This batching has saved me
hundreds of hours of redundant work. How much is your time worth?
Let’s use a hypothetical example:
1. $20 per hour is how much you are paid or value your time. This would be the case, for example, if you
are paid $40,000 per year and get two weeks of vacation per year ($40,000 divided by [40 hours per
week x 50 = 2,000] = $20/hour). Estimate your hourly income by cutting the last three zeroes off of your
annual income and halving the remaining number (e.g., $50,000/year p $25/hour.
2. Estimate the amount of time you will save by grouping similar tasks together and batching them, and
calculate how much you have earned by multiplying this hour number by your per-hour rate ($20 here):
3. Test each of the above batching frequencies and determine how much problems cost to fix in each
period. If the cost is less than the above dollar amounts, batch even further apart.
For example, using our above math, if I check e-mail once per week and that results in an average loss
of two sales per week, totaling $80 in lost profit, I will continue checking once per week because $200
(10 hours of time) minus $80 is still a $120 net gain, not to mention the enormous benefits of completing
other main tasks in those 10 hours. If you calculate the financial and emotional benefit of completing just
one main task (such as landing a major client or completing a life-changing trip), the value of batching is
much more than the per-hour savings.
If the problems cost more than hours saved, scale back to the next-less-frequent batch schedule. In this
case, I would drop from once per week to twice per week (not daily) and attempt to fix the system so that
I can return to once per week. Do not work harder when the solution is working smarter. I have batched
both personal and business tasks further and further apart as I’ve realized just how few real problems
come up. Some of my scheduled batches in 2007 were e-mail (Mondays 10:00 A.M.), phone (completely
eliminated), laundry (every other Sunday at 10:00 P.M.), credit cards and bills (most are on automatic
payment, but I check balances every second Monday after e-mail), strength training (every 4th day for
30 minutes), etc.
Empowerment Failure: Rules and Readjustment
The vision is really about empowering workers, giving them all the information about what’s
going on so they can do a lot more than they’ve done in the past.
—BILL GATES, cofounder of Microsoft, richest man in the world
Empowerment failure refers to being unable to accomplish a task without first obtaining permission or
information. It is often a case of being micromanaged or micromanaging someone else, both of which
consume your time.
For the employee, the goal is to have full access to necessary information and as much independent
decision-making ability as possible. For the entrepreneur, the goal is to grant as much information and
independent decision-making ability to employees or contractors as possible.
Customer service is often the epitome of empowerment failure, and a personal example from
BrainQUICKEN illustrates just how serious but easily solved the problem can be.
In 2002, I had outsourced customer service for order tracking and returns but still handled product-
related questions myself. The result? I received more than 200 e-mail per day, spending all hours
between 9–5 responding to them, and the volume was growing at a rate of more than 10% per week! I
had to cancel advertising and limit shipments, as additional customer service would have been the final
nail in the coffin. It wasn’t a scalable model. Remember this word, as it will be important later. It wasn’t
scalable because there was an information and decision bottleneck: me.
The clincher? The bulk of the e-mail that landed in my inbox was not product-related at all but
requests from the outsourced customer service reps seeking permission for different actions:
The customer claims he didn’t receive the shipment. What should we do?
The customer had a bottle held at customs. Can we reship to a U.S. address?
The customer needs the product for a competition in two days. Can we ship overnight, and if so, how
much should we charge?
It was endless. Hundreds upon hundreds of different situations made it impractical to write a manual, and
I didn’t have the time or experience to do so regardless.
Fortunately, someone did have the experience: the outsourced reps themselves. I sent one single e-
mail to all the supervisors that immediately turned 200 e-mail per day into fewer than 20 e-mail per
week:
Hi All,
I would like to establish a new policy for my account that overrides all others.
Keep the customer happy. If it is a problem that takes less than $100 to fix, use your
judgment and fix it yourself.
This is official written permission and a request to fix all problems that cost under $100
without contacting me. I am no longer your customer; my customers are your customer. Don’t
ask me for permission. Do what you think is right, and we’ll make adjustments as we go along.
Thank you,
Tim
Upon close analysis, it became clear that more than 90% of the issues that prompted e-mail could be
resolved for less than $20. I reviewed the financial results of their independent decision-making on a
weekly basis for four weeks, then a monthly basis, and then on a quarterly basis.
It’s amazing how someone’s IQ seems to double as soon as you give them responsibility and indicate
that you trust them. The first month cost perhaps $200 more than if I had been micromanaging. In the
meantime, I saved more than 100 hours of my own time per month, customers received faster service,
returns dropped to less than 3% (the industry average is 10–15%), and outsourcers spent less time on my
account, all of which resulted in rapid growth, higher profit margins, and happier people on all sides.
People are smarter than you think. Give them a chance to prove themselves.
If you are a micromanaged employee, have a heart-to-heart with your boss and explain that you want
to be more productive and interrupt him or her less. “I hate that I have to interrupt you so much and pull
you away from more important things I know you have on your plate. I was doing some reading and had
some thoughts on how I might be more productive. Do you have a second?”
Before this conversation, develop a number of “rules” like the previous example that would allow you
to work more autonomously with less approval-seeking. The boss can review the outcome of your
decisions on a daily or weekly basis in the initial stages. Suggest a one-week trial and end with “I’d like
to try it. Does that sound like something we could try for a week?” or my personal favorite, “Is that
reasonable?” It’s hard for people to label things unreasonable.
Realize that bosses are supervisors, not slave masters. Establish yourself as a consistent challenger of
the status quo and most people will learn to avoid challenging you, particularly if it is in the interest of
higher per-hour productivity.
If you are a micromanaging entrepreneur, realize that even if you can do something better than the rest
of the world, it doesn’t mean that’s what you should be doing if it’s part of the minutiae. Empower
others to act without interrupting you.
SET THE RULES in your favor: Limit access to your time, force people to define their requests before
spending time with them, and batch routine menial tasks to prevent postponement of more important
projects. Do not let people interrupt you. Find your focus and you’ll find your lifestyle.
The bottom line is that you only have the rights you fight for.
In the next section, Automation, we’ll see how the New Rich create management-free money and
eliminate the largest remaining obstacle of all: themselves.
Q&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS
People think it must be fun to be a super genius, but they don’t realize how hard it is to put up
with all the idiots in the world.
—CALVIN, from Calvin and Hobbes
Blaming idiots for interruptions is like blaming clowns for scaring children—they can’t help it. It’s
their nature. Then again, I had (who am I kidding—and have), on occasion, been known to create
interruptions out of thin air. If you’re anything like me, that makes us both occasional idiots. Learn to
recognize and fight the interruption impulse.
This is infinitely easier when you have a set of rules, responses, and routines to follow. It is your job
to prevent yourself and others from letting the unnecessary and unimportant prevent the start-to-finish
completion of the important.
This chapter differs from the previous in that the necessary actions, due to the inclusion of examples
and templates, have been presented throughout from start to finish. This Q & A will thus be a summary
rather than a repetition. The devil is in the details, so be sure to reread this chapter for the specifics.
The 50,000-foot review is as follows:
1. Create systems to limit your availability via e-mail and phone and deflect inappropriate contact.
Get the autoresponse and voicemail script in place now, and master the various methods of evasion.
Replace the habit of “How are you?” with “How can I help you?” Get specific and remember—no
stories. Focus on immediate actions. Set and practice interruption-killing policies.
Avoid meetings whenever possible:
Use e-mail instead of face-to-face meetings to solve problems.
Beg-off going (this can be accomplished through the Puppy Dog
Close).
If meetings are unavoidable, keep the following in mind:
Go in with a clear set of objectives.
Set an end time or leave early.
2. Batch activities to limit setup cost and provide more time for dreamline milestones.
What can I routinize by batching? That is, what tasks (whether laundry, groceries, mail, payments, or
sales reporting, for example) can I allot to a specific time each day, week, month, quarter, or year so that
I don’t squander time repeating them more often than is absolutely necessary?
3. Set or request autonomous rules and guidelines with occasional review of results.
Eliminate the decision bottleneck for all things that are nonfatal if misperformed. If an employee, believe
in yourself enough to ask for more independence on a trial basis. Have practical “rules” prepared and ask
the boss for the sale after surprising him or her with an impromptu presentation. Remember the Puppy
Dog Close—make it a one-time trial and reversible.
For the entrepreneur or manager, give others the chance to prove themselves. The likelihood of
irreversible or expensive problems is minimal and the time savings are guaranteed. Remember, profit is
only profitable to the extent that you can use it. For that you need time.
TOOLS AND TRICKS
Eliminating Paper Distractions, Capturing Everything
Evernote ( www.evernote.com )
This is perhaps the most impressive tool I’ve found in the last year, introduced to me by some of the
most productive technologists in the world. Evernote has eliminated more than 90% of the paper in my
life and eliminated nearly all of the multiple tabs I used to leave open in web browsers, both of which
distracted me to no end. It can clear out your entire office clutter in one to three hours.
Evernote allows you to easily capture information from anywhere using whatever device is at hand,
and everything is then searchable (read: findable) from anywhere. I use it to:
Take photographs of everything I might want to remember or find
later—business cards, handwritten notes, wine labels, receipts,
whiteboard sessions, and more. Evernote identifies the text in all
of these pictures automatically, so it’s all searchable(!), whether
from an iPhone, your laptop, or the web. Just as one example, I
can store and find the contact information from any business card
in seconds (often using the built in iSight camera on Mac to
capture it), rather than spending hours inputting it all into contacts
or searching through e-mail for that lost phone number. It’s mindnumbing
how much time this saves.
Scan all agreements, paper articles, etc., that would otherwise sit
in file folders or on my desk. I use the Mac Fujitsu ScanSnap
miniscanner ( http://bit.ly/scansnapmac ), the best I’ve found,
which scans all of it directly to Evernote in seconds with one
button.
Take snapshots of websites, capturing all text and links, so that I
can read them offline when traveling or doing later research. Get
rid of all those scattered bookmarks, favorites, and open tabs.
Screening and Avoiding Unwanted Calls
GrandCentral (www.grandcentral.com) and YouMail (www.youmail.com)
In a world where your physical address will change more often than your cell phone number (and e-
mail), it can be disastrous if your number becomes public or gets in the wrong hands. Enter
GrandCentral, which will give you a number with the area code of your choosing that then forwards to
your own phone(s). I now give a GrandCentral number to anyone besides family and close friends. Some
of the benefits:
Identify any incoming number as unwanted, and that caller will
then hear a “number not in service” message when attempting to
call you.
Customize your voicemail message to individual callers (spouse,
boss, colleague, client, etc.) and listen in on messages as they’re
being left, so you can “pick up” if the message is worth the
interruption. Call recording is also an option.
Use an area code outside of your hometown to prevent people and
companies from finding and misusing addresses you’d prefer to
keep private.
Establish do-not-disturb hours, when calls are routed directly to
voicemail with no ring.
Have voicemail sent to your cell phone as SMS (text messages).
YouMail, another option, can also transcribe voicemails and send them to your phone as text
messages. Getting calls while stuck in a time-wasting meeting? No problem: Respond to voicemails via
SMS during the meeting so you’re not stuck returning calls afterward.
One Shot, One Kill Scheduling Without E-mail Back-and-Forth
Few things are as time-consuming as scheduling via e-mail. Person A: “How about Tues. at 3 P.M.?”
Person B: “I can make it.” Person C: “I have a meeting. How about Thurs.?” Person D: “I’m on a concall.
How about 10 A.M. on Fri.?” Use these tools to make scheduling simple and fast instead of another
part-time job.
Doodle ( www.doodle.com )
The best free tool I’ve found for herding cats (multiple people) for scheduling without excessive e-mail.
Create and poll in 30 seconds with the proposed options and forward a link to everyone invited. Check
back a few hours later and you’ll have the best time for the most people.
TimeDriver ( www.timedriver.com )
Let colleagues and clients self-schedule with you based on your availability, which is determined by
integration with Outlook or Google Calendar. Embed a “schedule now” button in e-mail messages and
you’ll never have to tell people when you can make a call or meeting. Let them see what’s open and
choose.
Choosing the Best E-mail Batching Times
Xobni ( www.xobni.com/special )
Xobni—inbox spelled backwards—is a free program for putting Outlook on steroids. It offers many
features, but the most relevant to this chapter is its ability to identify “hotspots,” or periods of time when
you receive the bulk of e-mail from your most important contacts. These “hotspots” are batching times
that will enable you to keep critical contacts (clients, bosses, etc.) smiling even while you reduce
checking e-mail to 1–3 times per day. It will also populate your contacts automatically by pulling phone
numbers, addresses, etc., from separate e-mail buried in the inbox.
E-mailing Without Entering the Black Hole of the Inbox
Don’t enter the black hole of the inbox off hours because you’re afraid you’ll forget something. Use
these services instead to keep focused, whether on completing a critical project or simply enjoying the
weekend.
Jott ( www.jott.com )
Capture thoughts, create to-do’s, and set reminders with a simple toll-free phone call. The service
transcribes your message (15–30 seconds) and e-mails it to whomever you want, including yourself, or
to your Google calendar for automatic scheduling. Jott also enables you to post voice message links to
Twitter (www.twitter.com), Facebook (www.facebook.com), and other services that tend to consume
hours if you visit the sites themselves.
Copy talk ( www.copytalk.com )
Dictate any message up to four minutes and have the transcription e-mailed to you within hours.
Excellent for brainstorming, and the accuracy is astounding.
Preventing Web Browsing Completely
Freedom ( http://www.ibiblio.org/fred/freedom/ )
Freedom is a free application that disables networking on an Apple computer for 1–480 mintues (up to
eight hours) at a time. Freedom will free you from the distractions of the Internet, allowing you the focus
to get real work done.
Freedom enforces freedom; a reboot is the only method for turning Freedom off before the time limit
you’ve set for yourself. The hassle of rebooting means you’re less likely to cheat, and you’ll be more
productive. Experiment with the software for short periods of time at first (30–60 minutes.)
COMFORT CHALLENGE
Revisit the Terrible Twos (2 Days)
For the next two days, do as all good two-year-olds do and say “no” to all requests. Don’t be selective.
Refuse to do all things that won’t get you immediately fired. Be selfish. As with the last exercise, the
objective isn’t an outcome—in this case, eliminating just those things that waste time—but the process:
getting comfortable with saying “no.” Potential questions to decline include the following:
Do you have a minute?
Want to see a movie tonight/tomorrow?
Can you help me with X?
“No” should be your default answer to all requests. Don’t make up elaborate lies or you’ll get called
on them. A simple “I really can’t—sorry; I’ve got too much on my plate right now” will do as a catch-all
response.
LIFESTYLE DESIGN IN ACTION
Batching tool—PO Box: This might be stating the obvious, but one easy way to encourage batching of
your mail is to use a PO Box versus getting mail delivered to your house. We got our PO Box to limit
access to our physical address online, but it also encourages you to get the mail less and deal with it in
batch. Our post office has recycling bins, so at least 60% of the mail doesn’t even come home with us.
For a while I was only getting and managing the mail once a week, and I found not only did it take less
time overall, I did a better job managing it and getting it out of the way versus looking at it and setting it
aside for future follow up.
—LAURA TURNER
For families, the four-hour workweek doesn’t have to mean four months on a sailboat in the Caribbean
unless that’s their dream, but even the simple ideal of having time to take a walk in the park every
evening or spending weekends together, makes taking actions to implement this program worthwhile.
[There are many different approaches for making this work]: Kids have to promise they won’t bother
Mommy in the evening while she works on the computer, the husband watches the kids in the evening,
both parents make plans once a week to have someone take care of the kids, etc. Then close with the
huge payoff for the family of having more time to spend with each other.
—ADRIENNE JENKINS
Why not combine a mini-retirement with dentistry (or medical) geoarbitrage and finance your trip
with the savings? I lived in Thailand for four months and got root canal treatment and a crown for of
the price that it costs in Australia. There are many upmarket clinics set up for “expats” and health
travelers in Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam, Goa, etc., with English-speaking dentists. And in Europe
many people go to Poland or Hungary. To research, just Google “dentist” and the country and you will
come across practices advertising to foreigners. Talk to expats when you’re in the country or on online
chat forums for recommendations. Now I’m in Australia I still combine my travels with annual dentist
checkups—and the savings often finance my airfare. Even between developed countries there are
significant cost differences. For example France is far cheaper than the UK and Australia is cheaper than
the U.S. [Note from Tim: Learn more about the incredible world of medical tourism and geoarbitrage at

treatments and surgeries.]

Outsourcing Life
OFF-LOADING THE REST AND A TASTE OF GEOARBITRAGE 14
A man is rich in proportion to the number of things he can afford to let alone.
—HENRY DAVID THOREAU, naturalist
If I told you this story, you wouldn’t believe me, so I’ll let AJ tell it. It will set the stage for even
more incredible things to come, all of which you will do yourself.
My Outsourced Life
A true account by AJ Jacobs, editor-at-large at Esquire magazine (ellipses represent passage of time
between entries)
IT BEGAN a month ago. I was midway through The World Is Flat, the bestseller by Tom Friedman. I
like Friedman, despite his puzzling decision to wear a mustache. His book is all about how outsourcing
to India and China is not just for tech support and carmakers but is poised to transform every industry in
America, from law to banking to accounting.
I don’t have a corporation; I don’t even have an up-to-date business card. I’m a writer and editor
working from home, usually in my boxer shorts or, if I’m feeling formal, my penguin-themed pajama
bottoms. Then again, I think, why should Fortune 500 firms have all the fun? Why can’t I join in on the
biggest business trend of the new century? Why can’t I outsource my low-end tasks? Why can’t I
outsource my life?
The next day I e-mail Brickwork, one of the companies Friedman mentions in his book. Brickwork—
based in Bangalore, India—offers “remote executive assistants,” mostly to financial firms and healthcare
companies that want data processed. I explain that I’d like to hire someone to help with Esquire-related
tasks—doing research, formatting memos, like that. The company’s CEO, Vivek Kulkarni, responds, “It
would be a great pleasure to be talking to a person of your stature.” Already I’m liking this. I’ve never
had stature before. In America, I barely command respect from a Bennigan’s maître d’, so it’s nice to
know that in India I have stature.
A couple of days later, I get an e-mail from my new “remote executive assistant.”
Dear Jacobs,
My name is Honey K. Balani. I would be assisting you in your editorial and personal job…. I
would try to adapt myself as per your requirements that would lead to desired satisfaction.
Desired satisfaction. This is great. Back when I worked at an office, I had assistants, but there was
never any talk of desired satisfaction. In fact, if anyone ever used the phrase “desired satisfaction,” we’d
all end up in a solemn meeting with HR.
I GO OUT to dinner with my friend Misha, who grew up in India, founded a software firm, and
subsequently became nauseatingly rich. I tell him about Operation Outsource. “You should call Your
Man in India,” he says. Misha explains that this is a company for Indian businessmen who have moved
overseas but who still have parents back in New Delhi or Mumbai. YMII is their overseas concierge
service—it buys movie tickets and cell phones and other sundries for abandoned moms.
Perfect. This could kick my outsourcing up to a new level. I can have a nice, clean division of labor:
Honey will take care of my business affairs, and YMII can attend to my personal life—pay my bills,
make vacation reservations, buy stuff online. Happily, YMII likes the idea, and just like that the support
team at Jacobs Inc. has doubled.
HONEY HAS completed her first project for me: research on the person Esquire has chosen as the
Sexiest Woman Alive. I’ve been assigned to write a profile of this woman, and I really don’t want to
have to slog through all the heavy-breathing fan websites about her. When I open Honey’s file, I have
this reaction: America is f*cked. There are charts. There are section headers. There is a well-organized
breakdown of her pets, measurements, and favorite foods (e.g., swordfish). If all Bangalorians are like
Honey, I pity Americans about to graduate college. They’re up against a hungry, polite, Excel-proficient
Indian army.
IN FACT, in the next few days, I outsource a whole mess of online errands to Asha (from the personal
service YMII): paying my bills, getting stuff from drugstore.com, finding my son a Tickle Me Elmo.
(Actually, the store was out of Tickle Me Elmos, so Asha bought a Chicken Dance Elmo—good
decision.) I had her call Cingular to ask about my cell-phone plan. I’m just guessing, but I bet her call
was routed from Bangalore to New Jersey and then back to a Cingular employee in Bangalore, which
makes me happy for some reason.
IT’S THE fourth morning of my new, farmed-out life, and when I flip on my computer, my e-mail
inbox is already filled with updates from my overseas aides. It’s a strange feeling having people work for
you while you sleep. Strange, but great. I’m not wasting time while I drool on my pillow; things are
getting done.
HONEY IS my protector. Consider this: For some reason, the Colorado Tourism Board e-mails me all
the time. (Most recently, they informed me about a festival in Colorado Springs featuring the world’s
most famous harlequin.) I request that Honey gently ask them to stop with the press releases. Here’s what
she sent:
Dear All,
Jacobs often receives mails from Colorado news, too often. They are definitely interesting topics.
However, these topics are not suitable for “Esquire.”
Further, we do understand that you have taken a lot of initiatives working on these articles and
sending it to us. We understand. Unfortunately, these articles and mails are too time consuming to be
read.
Currently, these mails are not serving right purpose for both of us. Thus, we request to stop sending
these mails.
We do not mean to demean your research work by this.
We hope you understand too.
Thanking you,
Honey K B
That is the best rejection notice in journalism history. It’s exceedingly polite, but there’s a little
undercurrent of indignation. Honey seems almost outraged that Colorado would waste the valuable time
of Jacobs.
I DECIDE to test the next logical relationship: my marriage. These arguments with my wife are killing
me—partly because Julie is a much better debater than I am. Maybe Asha can do better:
Hello Asha,
My wife got annoyed at me because I forgot to get cash at the automatic bank machine … I wonder
if you could tell her that I love her, but gently remind her that she too forgets things—she has lost her
wallet twice in the last month. And she forgot to buy nail clippers for Jasper.
AJ
I can’t tell you what a thrill I got from sending that note. It’s pretty hard to get much more passiveaggressive
than bickering with your wife via an e-mail from a subcontinent halfway around the world.
The next morning, Asha CC’d me on the e-mail she sent to Julie.
Julie,
Do understand your anger that I forgot to pick up the cash at the automatic machine. I have been
forgetful and I am sorry about that.
But I guess that doesn’t change the fact that I love you so much….
Love
AJ
P. S. This is Asha mailing on behalf of Mr. Jacobs.
As if that weren’t enough, she also sent Julie an e-card. I click on it: two teddy bears embracing, with
the words, “Anytime you need a hug, I’ve got one for you…. I’m sorry.”
Damn! My outsourcers are too friggin’ nice! They kept the apology part but took out my little jabs.
They are trying to save me from myself. They are superegoing my id. I feel castrated.
Julie, on the other hand, seems quite pleased: “That’s nice, sweetie. I forgive you.”
DESPITE THREE weeks with my support team, I’m still stressed. Perhaps it’s the fault of Chicken
Dance Elmo, whom my son loves to the point of dry humping, but who is driving me slowly insane.
Whatever the reason, I figure it’s time to conquer another frontier: outsourcing my inner life.
First, I try to delegate my therapy. My plan is to give Asha a list of my neuroses and a childhood
anecdote or two, have her talk to my shrink for 50 minutes, then relay the advice. Smart, right? My
shrink refused. Ethics or something. Fine. Instead, I have Asha send me a meticulously researched memo
on stress relief. It had a nice Indian flavor to it, with a couple of yogic postures and some visualization.
This was okay, but it didn’t seem quite enough. I decided I needed to outsource my worry. For the last
few weeks I’ve been tearing my hair out because a business deal is taking far too long to close. I asked
Honey if she would be interested in tearing her hair out in my stead. Just for a few minutes a day. She
thought it was a wonderful idea. “I will worry about this every day,” she wrote. “Do not worry.”
The outsourcing of my neuroses was one of the most successful experiments of the month. Every time
I started to ruminate, I’d remind myself that Honey was already on the case, and I’d relax. No joke—this
alone was worth it.
At a Glance: Where You Will Be
The future is here. It’s just not widely distributed yet.
—WILLIAM GIBSON, author of Neuromancer; coined term “cyberspace” in 1984
Here is a sneak preview of full automation.
I woke up this morning, and given that it’s Monday, I checked my e-mail for one hour after an
exquisite Buenos Aires breakfast.
Sowmya from India had found a long-lost high school classmate of mine, and Anakool from YMII
had put together Excel research reports for retiree happiness and the average annual hours worked in
different fields. Interviews for this week had been set by a third Indian virtual assistant, who had also
found contact information for the best Kendo schools in Japan and the top salsa teachers in Cuba. In the
next e-mail folder, I was pleased to see that my fulfillment account manager in Tennessee, Beth, had
resolved nearly two dozen problems in the last week—keeping our largest clients in China and South
Africa smiling—and had also coordinated California sales tax filing with my accountants in Michigan.
The taxes had been paid via my credit card on file, and a quick glance at my bank accounts confirmed
that Shane and the rest of the team at my credit card processor were depositing more cash than last
month. All was right in the world of automation.
It was a beautiful sunny day, and I closed my laptop with a smile. For an all-you-can-eat buffet
breakfast with coffee and orange juice, I paid $4 U.S. The Indian outsourcers cost between $4–10 U.S.
per hour. My domestic outsourcers are paid on performance or when product ships. This creates a curious
business phenomenon: Negative cash flow is impossible.
Fun things happen when you earn dollars, live on pesos, and compensate in rupees, but that’s just the
beginning.
But I’m an Employee! How Does This Help Me?
Nobody can give you freedom. Nobody can give you equality or justice or anything. If you’re a
man, you take it.
—MALCOLM X, Malcolm X Speaks
Getting a remote personal assistant is a huge departure point and marks the moment that you learn
how to give orders and be commander instead of the commanded. It is small-scale training wheels for the
most critical of NR skills: remote management and communication.
It is time to learn how to be the boss. It isn’t time-consuming. It’s low-cost and it’s low-risk. Whether
or not you “need” someone at this point is immaterial. It is an exercise.
It is also a litmus test for entrepreneurship: Can you manage (direct and chastise) other people? Given
the proper instruction and practice, I believe so. Most entrepreneurs fail because they jump into the deep
end of the pool without learning to swim first. Using a virtual assistant (VA) as a simple exercise with no
downside, the basics of management are covered in a 2–4-week test costing between $100–400. This is
an investment, not an expense, and the ROI is astounding. It will be repaid in a maximum of 10–14 days,
after which it is pure timesaving profit.
Becoming a member of the NR is not just about working smarter. It’s about building a system to
replace yourself.
This is the first exercise.
Even if you have no intention of becoming an entrepreneur, this is the ultimate continuation of our
80/20 and elimination process: Preparing someone to replace you (even if it never happens) will produce
an ultrarefined set of rules that will cut remaining fat and redundancy from your schedule. Lingering
unimportant tasks will disappear as soon as someone else is being paid to do them.
But what about the cost?
This is a hurdle that is hard for most. If I can do it better than an assistant, why should I pay them at
all? Because the goal is to free your time to focus on bigger and better things.
This chapter is a low-cost exercise to get you past this lifestyle limiter. It is absolutely necessary that
you realize that you can always do something more cheaply yourself. This doesn’t mean you want to
spend your time doing it. If you spend your time, worth $20–25 per hour, doing something that someone
else will do for $10 per hour, it’s simply a poor use of resources. It is important to take baby steps
toward paying others to do work for you. Few do it, which is another reason so few people have their
ideal lifestyles.
Even if the cost is occasionally more per hour than you currently earn, the trade is often worth it. Let’s
assume you make $50,000 and thus $25 per hour (working from 9–5, Monday through Friday, for 50
weeks per year). If you pay a top-notch assistant $30 per hour and he or she saves you one full 8-hour
shift per week, your cost (subtracting what you’re being paid) is $40 to free an extra day. Would you pay
$40 per week to work Monday to Thursday? I would, and I do. Keep in mind that this is a worst-case
cost scenario.
But what if your boss freaks out?
It’s largely a non-issue, and prevention is better than cure. There is no ethical or legal reason for the
boss to know if you choose non-sensitive tasks. The first option is to assign personal items. Time is time,
and if you’re spending time on chores and errands that could be spent better elsewhere, a VA will
improve life and the management learning curve is similar. Second, you can delegate business tasks that
don’t include financial information or identify your company.
Ready to build an army of assistants? Let’s first look at the dark side of delegation. A review is in
order to prevent abuses of power and wasteful behavior.
Delegation Dangers: Before Getting Started
The first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient
operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient
operation will magnify the inefficiency.
—BILL GATES
Have you ever been given illogical assignments, handed unimportant work, or commanded to do
something in the most inefficient fashion possible? Not fun and not productive.
Now it’s your turn to show that you know better. Delegation is to be used as a further step in
reduction, not as an excuse to create more movement and add the unimportant. Remember—unless
something is well-defined and important, no one should do it.
Eliminate before you delegate.
Never automate something that can be eliminated, and never delegate something that can be automated
or streamlined. Otherwise, you waste someone else’s time instead of your own, which now wastes your
hard-earned cash. How’s that for incentive to be effective and efficient? Now you’re playing with your
own dough. It’s something I want you to get comfortable with, and this baby step is small stakes.
Did I mention to eliminate before you delegate?
For example, it is popular among executives to have assistants read e-mail. In some cases this is
valuable. In my case, I use spam filters, autoresponders with FAQs, and automatic forwarding to
outsourcers to limit my e-mail obligation to 10–20 e-mail responses per week. It takes me 30 minutes per
week because I used systems—elimination and automation—to make it so.
Nor do I use an assistant to set meetings and conference calls because I have eliminated meetings. If I
need to set the odd 20-minute call for a given month, I’ll send one two-sentence e-mail and be done
with it.
Principle number one is to refine rules and processes before adding people. Using people to leverage a
refined process multiplies production; using people as a solution to a poor process multiplies problems.
The Menu: A World of Possibilities
I am not interested in picking up crumbs of compassion thrown from the table of someone who
considers himself my master. I want the full menu of rights.
—BISHOP DESMOND TUTU, South African cleric and activist
The next question then becomes, “What should you delegate?” It’s a good question, but I don’t want
to answer it. I want to watch Family Guy.
The truth be told, it is a hell of a lot of work writing about not working. Ritika of Brickwork and
Venky of YMII are more than capable of writing this section, so I’ll just mention two guidelines and
leave the mental hernia of detail work to them.
Golden Rule #1: Each delegated task must be both time-consuming and well-defined. If you’re
running around like a chicken with its head cut off and assign your VA to do that for you, it doesn’t
improve the order of the universe.
Golden Rule #2: On a lighter note, have some fun with it. Have someone in Bangalore or Shanghai
send e-mails to friends as your personal concierge to set lunch dates or similar basics. Harass your
boss with odd phone calls in strong accents from unknown numbers. Being effective doesn’t mean
being serious all the time. It’s fun being in control for a change. Get a bit of repression off your chest
so it doesn’t turn into a complex later.
Getting Personal and Going Howard Hughes
Howard Hughes, the ultrarich filmmaker and eccentric from The Aviator, was notorious for assigning odd
tasks to his assistants. Here are a few from Donald Bartlett’s Howard Hughes: His Life and Madness you
might want to consider.
1. After his first plane crash, Hughes confided in a friend that he believed his recovery was due to his
consumption of orange juice and its healing properties. He believed that exposure to the air diluted the
juice’s potency, so he demanded that fresh oranges be sliced and juiced in front of him.
2. When Hughes was partaking of the nightlife in Las Vegas, his aides were charged with approaching
any girls he took a liking to. If a girl was invited to join the Hughes table and agreed, an aide would
pull out a waiver and agreement for her to sign.
3. Hughes had a barber on call 24/7 but had his hair and nails trimmed about once a year.
4. In his hotel-bound years, Hughes was rumored to have instructed assistants to place a single
cheeseburger in a specific tree outside his penthouse room at a 4:00 P.M. each day, whether he was
there or not.
Such a world of possibilities! Just as the Model-T brought transportation to the masses, virtual
assistants bring eccentric billionaire behavior within reach of each man, woman, and child. Now, that’s
progress.
Without further ado, let me pass the mic. Note that YMII performs both personal and business tasks,
whereas Brickwork focuses solely on business projects. Let’s start with the important but dull stuff and
move quickly from the sublime to the ridiculous. To give a true taste of what to expect, I have not
corrected non-native-sounding English.
Venky: Don’t limit yourself. Just ask us if something is possible. We’ve arranged parties, organized
caterers, researched summer courses, cleaned up accounting books, created 3D drafts based on blueprints.
Just ask us. We could find the closest kid-friendly restaurant to your house for your son’s birthday,
finding out costs and organizing the birthday party. This frees up your time to work or hang out with
your son.
What can we not do? We can’t do anything that would require our physical presence. But you would
be surprised as to how small a set of tasks that is in this day and age.
Here are the most common tasks we handle:
scheduling interviews and meetings web-research following up on appointments, errands, and
tasks online purchases creation of legal documents website maintenance (web design, publishing,
uploading files) that doesn’t require a professional designer

Venky: We have a forgetful client who has us call him all the time with various reminders. One of our
clients on a custom plan has us wake him up every morning. We’ve done the legwork and found people
who fell out of contact after Katrina. Found jobs for clients! My favorite so far: One of our clients has a
pair of trousers that he really likes that aren’t in production anymore. He’s sending them to Bangalore
(from London) to have created exact replicas at a tiny fraction of the price.
Here are a few other YMII custom requests:
Reminding an overzealous client to pay his current parking fines,
as well as not speed and collect parking fines.
Apologizing and sending flowers and cards to spouses of clients.
Charting a diet plan, reminding client on it regularly, ordering
groceries based on the specific diet plan.
Getting a job for a person who lost his job due to outsourcing a
year back. We did the job search, did the cover letters, did the
resume tuning, and got the client a job in 30 days.
Fixing a broken windowpane of a house in Geneva, Switzerland.
Collecting homework information from teacher’s voicemail and e-
mailing it to the client (parents of the kid).
Research on how to tie a shoelace meant for a kid (client’s son).
Find a parking slot for your car in some other city even before you
make the trip.
Ordered garbage bins for home.
Get an authenticated weather forecast and weather report for a
particular time in a particular place on a particular day, five years
ago. This was to be used as supportive evidence for a lawsuit.
Talking to parents in our client’s stead.
Here’s another real example of personal outsourcing from reader David Cross, who got a personal chef
at home for less than $5 per meal. Just thinking of the possibilities is enough to make you start drooling.
He explains:
I wanted to find someone to prepare food I love. I trained as a chef but I am often so busy and as I am
the only one in the house who really cooks, I often don’t have time to prepare the food that makes me
feel the healthiest so I wrote the attached ad and dropped it on Craigslist.
This was a very tight focus—ultraspecific—I had just two applicants in two months—one who was a
2/10 match but the guy we just OK’d was a Hare Krishna follower for many years, lived in India, and his
sample menu proved he knew what he’s doing so we just started him.
The food is absolutely awesome. The hourly rate is *extremely reasonable,* he’s a five-minute detour
when either of us are in town to collect food and I now have delicious Indian food for less than $5 a
meal and it’s as good as anything I’ve ever eaten anywhere.
I’m going to progress to other cuisines now… Thai, Italian, Chinese, etc., and it means when I do have
time to cook I’ll enjoy doing it that much more as I am not the only one cooking!
Indian/Asian Vegetarian Cook Needed
Date: 2007–06–07, 12:25PM PDT
Hello.
We are a local, international family who love Indian and Asian vegetarian food. We are looking for a
cook experienced in this wonderful cuisine to prepare delicious, fresh, healthy, authentic Indian/Asian
vegetarian meals for us.
If you’ve cooked a curry once or twice or need to follow recipes, this position is probably not for you,
but if you know Indian vegetarian cooking in depth and can prepare delicious, healthy, fresh, authentic
Indian vegetarian food then we’d like to hear from you. This could be an ideal opportunity if you are
Indian, Pakistani, Punjabi, etc., and are looking for a great way to apply your experience and love of
Indian vegetarian food, cooking and culture. Knowledge of Ayurved and how this relates to food and
diet is a plus though not essential.
Please reply with details of your experience and some dishes you could prepare. If we like what you
have to offer, we’ll arrange for you to cook a sample meal or two which we will pay you for and then
we’ll see what works out for us all.
This is a part-time position. You will be self-employed and responsible for your own taxes, etc. We’ll
pay you an hourly rate we will agree with you plus grocery bills for the food you prepare. You can
prepare food in your own place and we can arrange to collect it from you, possibly for us to freeze for
later eating. We will work with you to come up with menus and schedules that work out for you and
us.
Thank you for your interest.
Basic Choices: New Delhi or New York?
There are tens of thousands of VAs—how on earth do you find the right one? The resources at the
end of this chapter will show you where to look, but it is overwhelming and confusing unless you have a
few criteria determined in advance.
It often helps to begin with the question “Where on Earth?”
Remote or Local?
“Made in the USA” doesn’t have the ring it used to. The pros of jumping time zones and visiting thirdworld
currency are twofold: People work while you sleep, and the per-hour expense is less. Time savings
and cost savings. Ritika explains the former with an example.
One can give the remote personal assistant in India their assignment when they are leaving work at the
end of the day in New York City, and they will have the presentation ready the next morning. Because
of the time difference with India, assistants can work on it while they are asleep and have it back in their
morning. When they wake up, they will find the completed summary in their inbox. These assistants can
also help them keep pace with what they want to read, for example.
Indian and Chinese VAs, as well as most from other developing countries, will run $4–15 per hour,
the lower end being limited to simple tasks and the higher end including the equivalent of Harvard or
Stanford M.B.A.s and Ph.D.s. Need a business plan to raise funding? Brickwork can provide it for
between $2,500–5,000 instead of $15,000–20,000. Foreign assistance isn’t just for the small time. I know
from firsthand discussions that executives from big five accounting and management consulting firms
routinely charge clients six figures for research reports that are then farmed to India for low four figures.
In the U.S. or Canada, the per-hour range is often $25–100. Seems like an obvious choice, right?
Bangalore 100%? It’s not. The important metric is cost per completed task, not cost per hour.
The biggest challenge with overseas help will be the language barrier, which often quadruples backand-forth
discussion and the ultimate cost. The first time I hired an Indian VA, I made the fundamental
mistake of not setting an hour cap for three simple tasks. I checked in later that week and found he had
spent 23 hours chasing his tail. He had scheduled one tentative interview for the following week, set at
the wrong time! Mind boggling. 23 hours? It ended up costing me, at $10 per hour, $230. The same tasks,
assigned later that week to a native English speaker in Canada, were completed in two hours at $25 per
hour. $50 for more than four times the results. That said, I later requested another Indian VA from the
same firm who was able to duplicate the native speaker results.
How do you know which to choose? That’s the beautiful part: You don’t. It’s a matter of testing a few
assistants to both sharpen your communication skills and determine who is worth hiring and who is
worth firing. Being a results-based boss isn’t as simple as it looks.
There are a number of lessons to be learned here.
First, per-hour cost is not the ultimate determinant of cost. Look at per-task cost. If you need to spend
time restating the task and otherwise managing the VA, determine the time required of you and add this
(using your per-hour rate from earlier chapters) to the end sticker price of the task. It can be surprising.
As cool as it is to say that you have people working for you in three countries, it’s uncool to spend time
babysitting people who are supposed to make your life easier.
Second, the proof is in the pudding. It is impossible to predict how well you will work with a given
VA without a trial. Luckily, there are things you can do to improve your odds, and one of them is using a
VA firm instead of a solo operator.
Solo vs. Support Team
Let’s suppose you find the perfect VA. He or she is performing all of your noncritical tasks and you’ve
decided to take a much-deserved vacation to Thailand. It’s nice to know someone besides you will be
manning the wheel and putting out fires for a change. Finally, some relief! Two hours before your flight
from Bangkok to Phuket, you receive an e-mail: Your VA is out of commission and will be in the
hospital for the next week. Not good. Vacation FUBAR.
I don’t like being dependent on one person, and I don’t recommend it in the least. In the world of high
technology, this type of dependency would be referred to as a “single point of failure”—one fragile item
upon which all else depends. In the world of IT, 15 the term “redundancy” is used as a selling point for
systems that continue to function if there is a malfunction or mechanical failure in any given part. In the
context of VAs, redundancy entails having fallback support.
I recommend that you hire a VA firm or VAs with backup teams instead of sole operators. Examples
abound, of course, of people who have had a single assistant for decades without incident, but I suggest
that this is the exception rather than the rule. Better safe than sorry. Besides simple disaster avoidance, a
group structure provides a pool of talent that allows you to assign multiple tasks without bothering to find
a new person with the qualifications. Brickwork and YMII both exemplify this type of structure and
provide a single point of contact, a personal account manager, who then farms out your tasks to the
most-capable people in the group and across different shifts. Need graphic design? Covered. Need
database management? Covered. I don’t like calling and coordinating multiple people. I want one-stop
shopping and am willing to pay 10% more to have it. I encourage you to be similarly pound-wise and
penny-foolish.
Team preference doesn’t mean that bigger is better, just that multiple people are better than one
person. The best VA I have used to date is an Indian with five backup assistants under him. Three can be
more than sufficient, but two is toeing the line.
The #1 Fear: “Sweetheart, Did You Buy
a Porsche in China?”
I’m sure you might have your fears. AJ certainly did:
My outsourcers now know an alarming amount about me—not just my schedule but my cholesterol, my
infertility problems, my Social Security number, my passwords (including the one that is a particularly
adolescent curse word). Sometimes I worry that I can’t piss off my outsourcers or I’ll end up with a
$12,000 charge on my MasterCard bill from the Louis Vuitton in Anantapur.
The good news is that misuse of financial and confidential information is rare. In all of the interviews I
conducted for this section, I could find only one case of information abuse, and I had to search long and
hard. It involved an overworked U.S.-based VA who hired freelance help at the last moment.
Commit to memory the following—never use the new hire. Prohibit small-operation VAs from
subcontracting work to untested freelancers without your written permission. The more established and
higher-end firms, Brickwork in the below example, have security measures that border on excessive and
make it simple to pinpoint abusers in the case of a breach:
Employees undergo background checks and sign NDAs
(nondisclosure agreements) in accordance with the company
policy of maintaining confidentiality of client information
Electronic access card for entry and exit
Credit card information keyed only by select supervisors
Removal of paper from the offices is prohibited
VLAN-based access restrictions between different teams; this
ensures that there is no unauthorized access of information
between people of different teams in the organization
Regular reporting on printer logs
Floppy drives and USB ports disabled
BS779 certification for accomplished international security
standards
128-bit encryption technology for all data exchange
Secure VPN connection
I bet there is a fair chance that sensitive data is 100 times safer with Brickwork than on your own
computer.
Still, information theft is best thought of as inevitable in a digital world, and precautions should be
taken with damage control in mind. There are two rules that I use to minimize damage and allow for fast
repair.
1. Never use debit cards for online transactions or with remote assistants. Reversing unauthorized credit
card charges, particularly with American Express, is painless and near instantaneous. Recovering funds
withdrawn from your checking account via unauthorized debit card use takes dozens of hours in
paperwork alone and can take months to receive, if approved at all.
2. If your VA will be accessing websites on your behalf, create a new unique login and password to be
used on those sites. Most of us reuse both logins and passwords on multiple sites, and taking this
precaution limits possible damage. Instruct them to use these unique logins to create accounts on new
sites if needed. Note that this is particularly important when using assistants who have access to live
commercial websites (developers, programmers, etc.).
If information or identity theft hasn’t hit you, it will. Use these guidelines and you’ll realize when it
happens that, just like most nightmares, it’s not that big a deal and is reversible.
The Complicated Art of Simplicity:
Common Complaints
My assistant is an idiot! It took him 23 hours to book an interview! This was the first complaint I
had, for sure. 23 hours! I was heated up for a shouting match. My original e-mail to this first assistant
seemed clear enough.
Dear Abdul,
Here are the first tasks, due at the end of next Tuesday. Please call or e-mail with any questions:
1. Go to this article http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12666060/site/newsweek/, get the phone/email/website
contacts for Carol Milligan and Marc and Julie Szekely. Also find the same info for Rob
Long here http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12652789/site/newsweek/.
2. Schedule 30-minute interviews for Carol, Marc/Julie, and Rob. Use www.myevents.com
(username: notreal, password: donttryit) to book them in my calendar for next week any time between
9–9 ET.
3. Find the name, e-mail, and phone (phone is least important) of workers in the U.S. who have
negotiated remote work agreements (telecommuting) despite resistant bosses. Those who have
traveled outside the U.S. are ideal. Other keywords could include “teleworking” and
“telecommuting.” The important factor is that they negotiated with difficult bosses. Please send me
links to their profiles or write a paragraph describing why they fit the profile above.
Look forward to seeing what you can do. Please e-mail if you don’t understand or have questions.
Best,
Tim
The truth is—I was at fault. This is not a good debut demand, and I made fatal mistakes even before
composing it. If you are an effective person but unaccustomed to issuing commands, assume that most
problems at the outset are your fault. It is tempting to immediately point the finger at someone else and
huff and puff, but most beginner bosses repeat the same mistakes I made.
1. I accepted the first person the firm provided and made no special requests at the outset.
Request someone who has “excellent” English and indicate that phone calls will be required (even if not).
Be fast to request a replacement if there are repeated communication issues.
2. I gave imprecise directions.
I asked him to schedule interviews but didn’t indicate that it was for an article. He assumed, based on
work with previous clients, that I wanted to hire someone and he misspent time compiling spreadsheets
and combing online job sites for additional information I didn’t need.
Sentences should have one possible interpretation and be suitable for a 2nd-grade reading level. This
goes for native speakers as well and will make requests clearer. Ten-dollar words disguise imprecision.
Note that I asked him to respond if he didn’t understand or had questions. This is the wrong approach.
Ask foreign VAs to rephrase tasks to confirm understanding before getting started.
3. I gave him a license to waste time.
This brings us again to damage control. Request a status update after a few hours of work on a task to
ensure that the task is both understood and achievable. Some tasks are, after initial attempts, impossible.
4. I set the deadline a week in advance.
Use Parkinson’s Law and assign tasks that are to be completed within no more than 72 hours. I have had
the best luck with 48 and 24 hours. This is another compelling reason to use a small group (three or
more) rather than a single individual who can become overtaxed with last-minute requests from multiple
clients. Using short deadlines does not mean avoiding larger tasks (e.g., business plan), but rather
breaking them into smaller milestones that can be completed in shorter time frames (outline, competitive
research summaries, chapters, etc.).
5. I gave him too many tasks and didn’t set an order of importance.
I advise sending one task at a time whenever possible and no more than two. If you want to cause your
computer to hang or crash, open 20 windows and applications at the same time. If you want to do the
same to your assistant, assign him or her a dozen tasks without prioritizing them. Recall our mantra:
Eliminate before you delegate.
WHAT DOES A good VA task e-mail look like? The following example was recently sent to an Indian VA
whose results have been nothing short of spectacular:
Dear Sowmya,
Thank you. I would like to start with the following task.
TASK: I need to find the names and e-mails of editors of men’s magazines in the US (for example:
maxim, stuff, GQ, esquire, blender, etc.) who also have written books. An example of such a person
would be AJ Jacobs who is Editor-at-Large of Esquire (www.ajjacobs.com). I already have his
information and need more like him.
Can you do this? If not, please advise. Please reply and confirm what you will plan to do to
complete this task.
DEADLINE: Since I’m in a rush, get started after your next e-mail and stop at 3 hours and tell me
what results you have. Please begin this task now if possible. The deadline for these 3 hours and
reported results is end-of-day ET Monday.
Thank you for your fastest reply,
Tim
Short, sweet, and to the point. Clear writing, and therefore clear commands, come from clear thinking.
Think simple.
IN THE NEXT several chapters, the communication skills you develop with our virtual assistant experiment
will be applied to a much larger and obscenely profitable playing field: automation. The extent to which
you will outsource next makes delegation look like finger painting.
In the world of automation, not all business models are created equal. How do you assemble a
business and coordinate all its parts without lifting a finger? How do you automate cash deposits in your
bank account while avoiding the most common problems? It begins with understanding the options, the
art of dodging information flow, and what we will call “muses.”
The next chapter is a blueprint for the first step: a product.
Go with the Flow
Here is a flowchart of 4HWW from reader Jed Wood, who has used it for faster decision making,
more output with less input, and more time with his wife and children.
Q&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS
1. Get an assistant—even if you don’t need one.
Develop the comfort of commanding and not being commanded. Begin with a one-time test project or
small repetitive task (daily preferred). I advise using domestic help for language-intensive tasks and using
foreign assistants in the early stages to improve the general clarity of your communication. Pick one
from each group and get started.
The following sites, split up geographically, are useful resources.
U.S. and Canada ($20/hour+)
http://www.iavoa.com (International Association of Virtual Office Assistants). Global directory that
includes the U.S.
http://www.cvac.ca (Canadian Virtual Assistant Connection)
http://www.canadianva.net/files/va-locator.html (Canada)
www.onlinebusinessmanager.com
North America and International ($4/hour+)
www.elance.com (Search “virtual assistants,” “personal assistants,” and “executive assistants.”) The
client feedback reviews on Elance enabled me to find my best VA to date, who costs $4/hour. Similar
marketplaces with positive reviews include www.guru.com and www.rentacoder.com.
India
www.tryasksunday.com ($20–60 per month for 24/7 concierge, free one-week trial). AskSunday is one
of the sophisticated new kids on the personal outsourcing block. Their site was nominated the #2 website
of the year in 2007 by Time magazine. Just dial a 212 (NYC) area code and get routed to well-spoken
assistants in India and the Philippines. I use this service 80% of the time, as most tasks take less than 10
minues to complete. For longer projects, there are teams available for $12/hour.
www.b2kcorp.com ($15/hour+) From Fortune 10 oil companies and Fortune 500 clients to Big 5
accounting firms and U.S. congressmen, Brickwork can handle it all. This is reflected in the costs of this
pure suit-and-tie operation—business only. No flowers for auntie.
www.taskseveryday.com ($6.98/hour for a dedicated virtual assistant) Based in Mumbai, available via
phone and e-mail from the U.S., UK, and Australia. Must choose between 20 or 40 hours per week and
pre-purchase hours.
www.yourmaninindia.com ($6.25/hour+) YMII handles both business and personal tasks and can work
with you in real time (there are people on duty 24/7) and complete work while you sleep. English
capability and effectiveness vary tremendously across VAs, so interview yours before getting started or
assigning important tasks. Important: Following the publication of the first edition of this book, there
have been some complaints of lower quality and up to four-week wait lists to become a client.
2. Start small but think big.
Tina Forsyth, an online business manager (higher-level VA) who helps six-figure-income clients achieve
seven figures with business model redesigns, makes the following recommendations.
Look at your to-do list—what has been sitting on it the longest?
Each time you are interrupted or change tasks, ask, “Could a VA
do this?”
Examine pain points—what causes you the most frustration and
boredom?
Here are a few common time-consumers in small businesses with online presences.
Submitting articles to drive traffic to site and build mailing lists
Participating in or moderating discussion forums and message
boards
Managing affiliate programs
Creating content for and publishing newsletters and blog postings
Background research components of new marketing initiatives or
analysis of current marketing results
Don’t expect miracles from a single VA, but don’t expect too little, either. Let go of the controls a bit.
Don’t assign crap tasks that end up consuming rather than saving time. It makes little sense to spend 10–
15 minutes sending an e-mail to India to get a price quote on a plane ticket when you could do the same
online in 10 minutes and avoid all the subsequent back-and-forth.
Push outside your comfort zone—that is the entire point of the exercise.
It is always possible to reclaim a task for yourself if the VA proves incapable, so test the limits of their
capabilities. Remember Brickwork’s suggestion: Don’t limit yourself.
3. Identify your top five time-consuming non-work tasks and five personal tasks you could assign
for sheer fun.
4. Keep in sync: scheduling and calendars.
If you decide to have an assistant schedule appointments and add things to your calendar, it will be
important to ensure what you both see is updated. There are several options:
BusySync (www.busysync.com) I have two Gmail accounts: one private account for me and one for my
assistant, where general e-mail is sent. I use BusySync to synchronize her Google Calendar with iCal
(Mac calendar) on my laptop. I have also used SpanningSync (www.spanningsync.com) successfully for
the same purpose.
WebEx Office (www.weboffice.com) Share your calendar online while masking personal appointments.
Can be synchronized with Outlook, and also offers document sharing and other assistant- or teamfriendly
features. I suggest you compare this to synchronizing your Outlook with an assistant’s Google
Calendar.
COMFORT CHALLENGE
Use the Criticism Sandwich (2 Days and Weekly)
Chances are good that someone—be it a co-worker, boss, customer, or significant other—does
something irritating or at a subpar level. Rather than avoid the topic out of fear of confrontation, let’s
chocolate-coat it and ask them to fix it. Once per day for two days, and then each Thursday (M-W is too
tense and Friday is too relaxed) for the next three weeks, resolve to use what I call the Criticism
Sandwich with someone. It’s called the Criticism Sandwich because you first praise the person for
something, then deliver the criticism, and then close with topic-shifting praise to exit the sensitive topic.
Here’s an example with a superior or boss, with keywords and phrases in italics.
You: Hi, Mara. Do you have a second?
Mara: Sure. What’s up?
You: First, I wanted to thank you for helping me with the Meelie Worm account [or whatever]. I really
appreciate you showing me how to handle that. You’re really good at fixing the technical issues.
Mara: No problem.
You: Here’s the thing. 16 There is a lot of work coming down on everyone, and I’m feeling 17 a bit
overwhelmed. Normally, priorities are really clear to me 18 but I’ve been having trouble recently figuring
out which tasks are highest on the list. Could you help me by pointing out the most important items when
a handful need to be done? I’m sure it’s just me, 19 but I’d really appreciate it, and I think it would help.
Mara: Uhh … I’ll see what I can do.
You: That means a lot to me. Thanks. Before I forget, 20 last week’s presentation was excellent.
Mara: Did you think so? Blah, blah, blah …
LIFESTYLE DESIGN IN ACTION
THE BEST TIMES TO SEND E-MAIL
You’ve suggested people check e-mail only a few times a day. Here’s a twist: I reply to e-mails
when it’s convenient, but I time it to arrive when it’s also convenient for me. In Outlook you can
delay e-mail delivery to any time of day. For example, when I return e-mails at 3 p.m., I don’t want
my staff instantly zinging me responses or clarifying questions. (This also prevents e-mail chats.) So I
hit send, but it’s delayed to arrive later in the evening or at 8 A.M. when my employees arrive the
next day. This is how e-mail was meant to be! It’s mail, not a chat service.
—JIM LARRANAGA
14. To leverage global pricing and currency differences for profit or lifestyle purposes.
15. Information technology.
16. Don’t call it a problem if you can avoid it.
17. No one can argue with your feelings, so use this to avoid a debate about external circumstances.
18. Notice how I take “you” out of the sentence to avoid finger-pointing, even though it’s implicit.
“Normally, you make priorities clear” sounds like a backhanded insult. If this is a significant other,
you can skip this formality, but never use “you always do X,” which is just a fight starter.
19. Take a little bit of the heat off with this. The point has already been made.
20. “Before I forget” is a great segue to the closing compliment, which is also a topic shifter and gets
you off the sensitive topic without awkwardness.

The Renaissance Minimalist
Douglas Price was waking up to another beautiful summer morning in his Brooklyn brownstone. First
things first: coffee. The jet lag was minor, considering he had just returned from a two-week jaunt
through the islands of Croatia. It was just one of six countries he had visited in the last 12 months. Japan
was next on the agenda.
Buzzing with a smile and his coffee mug in hand, he ambled over to his Mac to check on personal e-
mail first. There were 32 messages and all brought good news.
One of his friends and business partners, also a cofounder of Limewire, had an update: Last Bamboo,
their start-up poised to reinvent peer-to-peer technology, was rounding the final corners of development.
It could be their billion-dollar baby, but Doug was letting the engineers run wild first.
Samson Projects, one of the hottest contemporary art galleries in Boston, had compliments for Doug’s
latest work and requests for expanded involvement with new exhibits as their sound curator.
The last e-mail in his inbox was a fan letter addressed to “Demon Doc” and praise for his latest
instrumental hip-hop album, onliness VI.O.I. Doug had released his album as what he termed “open
source music”—anyone could download the album for free and use sounds from any track in his or her
own compositions.
He smiled again, polished off his dark roast, and opened a window to deal with business e-mail next.
It would take much less time. In fact, less than 30 minutes for the day and 2 hours for the week.
How much things change.
Two years earlier, in June of 2004, I was in Doug’s apartment checking e-mail for what I hoped would
be the last time for a long time. I was headed to JFK Airport in New York in a matter of hours and was
preparing for an indefinite quest around the world. Doug looked on with amusement. He had similar
plans for himself and was finally extricating himself from a venture-funded Internet startup that had once
been a cover story and his passion but was now just a job. The euphoria of the dot-com era was long
dead, along with most chances for a sale or an IPO.
He bid me farewell and made a decision as the taxi pulled from the curb—enough of the complicated
stuff. It was time to return to basics.
Prosoundeffects.com, launched in January of 2005 after one week of sales testing on eBay, was
designed to do one thing: give Doug lots of cash with minimal time investment.
This brings us back to his business inbox in 2006.
There are 10 orders for sound libraries, CDs that film producers, musicians, video game designers, and
other audio professionals use to add hard-to-find sounds—whether the purr of a lemur or an exotic
instrument—to their own creations. These are Doug’s products, but he doesn’t own them, as that would
require physical inventory and upfront cash. His business model is more elegant than that. Here is just
one revenue stream:
1. A prospective customer sees his Pay-Per-Click (PPC) advertising on Google or other search
engines and clicks through to his site, www.prosoundeffects.com.
2. The prospect orders a product for $325 (the average purchase price, though prices range from $29–
7,500) on a Yahoo shopping cart, and a PDF with all their billing and shipping information is
automatically e-mailed to Doug.
3. Three times a week, Doug presses a single button in the Yahoo management page to charge all his
customers’ credit cards and put cash in his bank account. Then he saves the PDFs as Excel purchase
orders and e-mails the purchase orders to the manufacturers of the CD libraries. Those companies
mail the products to Doug’s customers—this is called drop-shipping—and Doug pays the
manufacturers as little as 45% of the retail price of the products up to 90 days later (net-90 terms).
Let’s look at the mathematical beauty of his system for full effect.
For each $325 order at his cost of 55% off retail, Doug is entitled to $178.75. If we subtract 1% of the
full retail price (1% of $325 = $3.25) for the Yahoo Store transaction fee and 2.5% for the credit card
processing fee (2.5% of $325 = $8.13), Doug is left with a pretax profit of $167.38 for this one sale.
Multiply this by 10 and we have $1673.80 in profit for 30 minutes of work. Doug is making $3,347.60
per hour and purchases no product in advance. His initial start-up costs were $1,200 for the webpage
design, which he recouped in the first week. His PPC advertising costs approximately $700 per month
and he pays Yahoo $99 per month for their hosting and shopping cart.
He works less than two hours a week, often pulls more than $10,000 per month, and there is no
financial risk whatsoever.
Now Doug spends his time making music, traveling, and exploring new businesses for excitement.
Prosoundeffects.com is not his end-all-be-all, but it has removed all financial concerns and freed his
mind to focus on other things.
What would you do if you didn’t have to think about money? If you follow the advice in this chapter,
you will soon have to answer this question.
It’s time to find your muse.
THERE ARE A million and one ways to make a million dollars. From franchising to freelance consulting,
the list is endless. Fortunately, most of them are unsuited to our purpose. This chapter is not for people
who want to run businesses but for those who want to own businesses and spend no time on them.
The response I get when I introduce this concept is more or less universal: Huh?
People can’t believe that most of the ultrasuccessful companies in the world do not manufacture their
own products, answer their own phones, ship their own products, or service their own customers. There
are hundreds of companies that exist to pretend to work for someone else and handle these functions,
providing rentable infrastructure to anyone who knows where to find them.
Think Microsoft manufactures the Xbox 360 or that Kodak designs and distributes their digital
cameras? Guess again. Flextronics, a Singapore-based engineering and manufacturing firm with
locations in 30 countries and $15.3 billion in annual revenue, does both. Most popular brands of
mountain bikes in the U.S. are all manufactured in the same three or four plants in China. Dozens of call
centers press one button to answer calls for the JC Penneys of the world, another to answer calls for the
Dell Computers of the world, and yet another to answer calls for the New Rich like me.
It’s all beautifully transparent and cheap.
Before we create this virtual architecture, however, we need a product to sell. If you own a service
business, this section will help you convert expertise into a downloadable or shippable good to escape the
limits of a per-hour-based model. If starting from scratch, ignore service businesses for now, as constant
customer contact makes absence difficult. 21
To narrow the field further, our target product can’t take more than $500 to test, it has to lend itself to
automation within four weeks, and—when up and running—it can’t require more than one day per week
of management.
Can a business be used to change the world, like The Body Shop or Patagonia? Yes, but that isn’t our
goal here.
Can a business be used to cash out through an IPO or sale? Yes, but that isn’t our goal either.
Our goal is simple: to create an automated vehicle for generating cash without consuming time. That’s
it. 22 I will call this vehicle a “muse” whenever possible to separate it from the ambiguous term
“business,” which can refer to a lemonade stand or a Fortune 10 oil conglomerate—our objective is more
limited and thus requires a more precise label.
So first things first: cash flow and time. With these two currencies, all other things are possible.
Without them, nothing is possible.
Why to Begin with the End in Mind: A Cautionary Tale
Sarah is excited.
It has been two weeks since her line of humorous T-shirts for golfers went online, and she is averaging
5 T-shirt sales per day at $15 each. Her cost per unit is $5, so she is grossing $50 in profit (minus 3% in
credit card fees) per 24 hours, as she passes shipping and handling on to customers. She should soon
recoup the cost of her initial order of 300 shirts (including plate charges, setup, etc.)—but wants to earn
more.
It’s a nice reversal of fortune, considering the fate of her first product. She had spent $12,000 to
develop, patent, and manufacture a high-tech stroller for new moms (she has never been a new mom),
only to find that no one was interested.
The T-shirts, in contrast, were actually selling, but sales were beginning to slow.
It appears she has reached her online sales ceiling, as well-funded and uneducated competitors are now
spending too much for advertising and driving up costs. Then it strikes her—retail!
Sarah approaches the manager of her local golf shop, Bill, who immediately expresses interest in
carrying the shirts. She’s thrilled.
Bill asks for the customary 40% minimum discount for wholesale pricing. This means her sell price is
now $9 instead of $15 and her profit has dropped from $10 to $4. Sarah decides to give it a shot and
does the same with three other stores in surrounding towns. The shirts begin to move off the shelves, but
she soon realizes that her small profit is being eaten by extra hours she spends handling invoices and
additional administration.
She decides to approach a distributor 23 to alleviate this labor, a company that acts as a shipping
warehouse and sells products from various manufacturers to golf stores nationwide. The distributor is
interested and asks for its usual pricing—70% off of retail or $4.50—which would leave Sarah 50 cents
in the hole on each unit. She declines.
To make matters worse, the four local stores have already started discounting her shirts to compete
among one another and are killing their own profit margins. Two weeks later, reorders disappear. Sarah
abandons retail and returns to her website demoralized. Sales online have dropped to almost nothing with
new competition. She has not recouped her initial investment, and she still has 50 shirts in her garage.
Not good.
It all could have been prevented with proper testing and planning.
ED “MR. CREATINE” BYRD is no Sarah. He does not invest and hope for the best.
His San Francisco–based company, MRI, had the top-selling sports supplement in the U.S. from
2002–2005, NO 2 . It is still a top-seller despite dozens of imitators. He did it through smart testing, smart
positioning, and brilliant distribution.
Prior to manufacturing, MRI first offered a low-priced book related to the product through ¼-page
advertisements in men’s health magazines. Once the need had been confirmed with a mountain of book
orders, NO 2 was priced at an outrageous $79.95, positioned as the premium product on the market, and
sold exclusively through GNC stores nationwide. No one else was permitted to sell it.
How can it make sense to turn away business? There are a few good reasons.
First, the more competing resellers there are, the faster your product goes extinct. This was one of
Sarah’s mistakes.
It works like this: Reseller A sells the product for your recommended advertised price of $50, then
reseller B sells it for $45 to compete with A, and then C sells it for $40 to compete with A and B. In no
time at all, no one is making profit from selling your product and reorders disappear. Customers are now
accustomed to the lower pricing and the process is irreversible. The product is dead and you need to
create a new product. This is precisely the reason why so many companies need to create new product
after new product month after month. It’s a headache.
I had one single supplement, BrainQUICKEN® (also sold as BodyQUICK®) for six years and
maintained a consistent profit margin by limiting wholesale distribution, particularly online, to the top
one or two largest resellers who could move serious quantities of product and who agreed to maintain a
minimum advertised pricing. 24 Otherwise, rogue discounters on eBay and mom-and-pop independents
will drive you broke.
Second, if you offer someone exclusivity, which most manufacturers try to avoid, it can work in your
favor. Since you are offering one company 100% of the distribution, it is possible to negotiate better
profit margins (offering less of a discount off of retail price), better marketing support in-store, faster
payment, and other preferential treatment.
It is critical that you decide how you will sell and distribute your product before you commit to a
product in the first place. The more middlemen are involved, the higher your margins must be to maintain
profitability for all the links in the chain.
Ed Byrd realized this and exemplifies how doing the opposite of what most do can reduce risk and
increase profit. Choosing distribution before product is just one example.
Ed drives a Lamborghini down the California coast when not traveling or in the office with his small
focused staff and his two Australian shepherds. This outcome is not accidental. His product-creation
methods—and those of the New Rich in general—can be emulated.
Here’s how you do it in the fewest number of steps.
Step One: Pick an Affordably Reachable Niche Market
When I was younger … I [didn’t] want to be pigeonholed … Basically, now you want to be
pigeonholed. It’s your niche.
—JOAN CHEN, actress; appeared in The Last Emperor and Twin Peaks
Creating demand is hard. Filling demand is much easier. Don’t create a product, then seek someone
to sell it to. Find a market—define your customers—then find or develop a product for them.
I have been a student and an athlete, so I developed products for those markets, focusing on the male
demographic whenever possible. The audiobook I created for college guidance counselors failed because
I have never been a guidance counselor. I developed the subsequent speed-reading seminar after
realizing that I had free access to students, and the business succeeded because—being a student myself
—I understood their needs and spending habits. Be a member of your target market and don’t speculate
what others need or will be willing to buy.
Start Small, Think Big
Some people are just into lavish dwarf entertainment.
–DANNY BLACK (42″), part-owner of Shortdwarf.com 25
Danny Black rents dwarfs as entertainment for $149 per hour. How is that for a niche market?
It is said that if everyone is your customer, then no one is your customer. If you start off aiming to sell
a product to dog- or car-lovers, stop. It’s expensive to advertise to such a broad market, and you are
competing with too many products and too much free information. If you focus on how to train German
shepherds or a restoration product for antique Fords, on the other hand, the market and competition
shrink, making it less expensive to reach your customers and easier to charge premium pricing.
BrainQUICKEN was initially designed for students, but the market proved too scattered and difficult
to reach. Based on positive feedback from student-athletes, I relaunched the product as BodyQUICK and
tested advertising in magazines specific to martial artists and powerlifters. These are minuscule markets
compared to the massive student market, but not small. Low media cost and lack of competition enabled
me to dominate with the first “neural accelerator” 26 in these niches. It is more profitable to be a big fish
in a small pond than a small undefined fish in a big pond. How do you know if it’s big enough to meet
your TMI? For a detailed real-life example of how I determined the market size of a recent product, see
“Muse Math” on this book’s companion site.
Ask yourself the following questions to find profitable niches.
1. Which social, industry, and professional groups do you belong to, have you belonged to, or do
you understand, whether dentists, engineers, rock climbers, recreational cyclists, car restoration
aficionados, dancers, or other?
Look creatively at your resume, work experience, physical habits, and hobbies and compile a list of all
the groups, past and present, that you can associate yourself with. Look at products and books you own,
include online and offline subscriptions, and ask yourself, “What groups of people purchase the same?”
Which magazines, websites, and newsletters do you read on a regular basis?
2. Which of the groups you identified have their own magazines?
Visit a large bookstore such as Barnes & Noble and browse the magazine rack for smaller specialty
magazines to brainstorm additional niches. There are literally thousands of occupation- and
interest/hobby-specific magazines to choose from. Use Writer’s Market to identify magazine options
outside the bookstores. Narrow the groups from question 1 above to those that are reachable through one
or two small magazines. It’s not important that these groups all have a lot of money (e.g., golfers)—only
that they spend money (amateur athletes, bass fishermen, etc.) on products of some type. Call these
magazines, speak to the advertising directors, and tell them that you are considering advertising; ask them
to e-mail their current advertising rate card and include both readership numbers and magazine backissue
samples. Search the back issues for repeat advertisers who sell direct-to-consumer via 800 numbers
or websites—the more repeat advertisers, and the more frequent their ads, the more profitable a
magazine is for them … and will be for us.
Step Two: Brainstorm (Do Not Invest In) Products
Genius is only a superior power of seeing.
—JOHN RUSKIN, famed art and social critic
Pick the two markets that you are most familiar with that have their own magazines with full-page
advertising that costs less than $5,000. There should be no fewer than 15,000 readers.
This is the fun part. Now we get to brainstorm or find products with these two markets in mind.
The goal is come up with well-formed product ideas and spend nothing; in Step 3, we will create
advertising for them and test responses from real customers before investing in manufacturing. There are
several criteria that ensure the end product will fit into an automated architecture.
The Main Benefit Should Be Encapsulated in One Sentence.
People can dislike you—and you often sell more by offending some—but they should never
misunderstand you.
The main benefit of your product should be explainable in one sentence or phrase. How is it different
and why should I buy it? ONE sentence or phrase, folks. Apple did an excellent job of this with the iPod.
Instead of using the usual industry jargon with GB, bandwidth, and so forth, they simply said, “1,000
songs in your pocket.” Done deal. Keep it simple and do not move ahead with a product until you can do
this without confusing people.
It Should Cost the Customer $50–200.
The bulk of companies set prices in the midrange, and that is where the most competition is. Pricing low
is shortsighted, because someone else is always willing to sacrifice more profit margin and drive you
both bankrupt. Besides perceived value, there are three main benefits to creating a premium, high-end
image and charging more than the competition.
1. Higher pricing means that we can sell fewer units—and thus manage fewer customers—and fulfill
our dreamlines. It’s faster.
2. Higher pricing attracts lower-maintenance customers (better credit, fewer complaints/questions,
fewer returns, etc.). It’s less headache. This is HUGE.
3. Higher pricing also creates higher profit margins. It’s safer.
I personally aim for an 8–10x markup, which means a $100 product can’t cost me more than $10–
12.50. 27 If I had used the commonly recommended 5 x markup with BrainQUICKEN, it would have
gone bankrupt within 6 months due to a dishonest supplier and late magazine. The profit margin saved it,
and within 12 months it was generating up to $80,000 per month.
High has its limits, however. If the per-unit price is above a certain point, prospects need to speak to
someone on the phone before they are comfortable enough to make the purchase. This is contraindicated
on our low-information diet.
I have found that a price range of $50–200 per sale provides the most profit for the least customer
service hassle. Price high and then justify.
It Should Take No More Than 3 to 4 Weeks to Manufacture.
This is critically important for keeping costs low and adapting to sales demand without stockpiling
product in advance. I will not pursue any product that takes more than three to four weeks to
manufacture, and I recommend aiming for one to two weeks from order placement to shippable product.
How do you know how long something takes to manufacture?
Contact contract manufacturers who specialize in the type of products you’re considering:
http://www.thomasnet.com/. Call a related manufacturer (e.g., toilet bowls) if you need a referral to a
related manufacturer you cannot find (e.g., toilet cleaning solutions). Still no luck? Google different
synonyms for your product in combination with “organization” and “association” to contact the
appropriate industry organizations. Ask them for referrals to contract manufacturers and for the names of
their trade magazines, which often contain advertisements for contract manufacturers and related service
providers we’ll need for your virtual architecture later. Request pricing from the contract manufacturers
to ensure the proper markup is possible. Determine the per-unit costs of production for 100, 500, 1,000,
and 5,000 units.
It Should Be Fully Explainable in a Good Online FAQ.
Here is where I really screwed up in my product choice with Brain-QUICKEN.
Even though ingestibles have enabled my NR life, I would not wish them on anyone. Why not? You
get 1,000 questions from every customer: Can I eat bananas with your product? Will it make me fart
during dinner? On and on, ad nauseam. Choose a product that you can fully explain in a good online
FAQ. If not, the task of travelling and otherwise forgetting about work becomes very difficult or you end
up spending a fortune on call center operators.
Understanding these criteria, a question remains: “How does one obtain a good muse product that
satisfies them?” There are three options we’ll cover in ascending order of recommendation.
Option One: Resell a Product
Purchasing an existing product at wholesale and reselling it is the easiest route but also the least
profitable. It is the fastest to set up but the fastest to die off due to price competition with other resellers.
The profitable life span of each product is short unless an exclusivity agreement prevents others from
selling it. Reselling is, however, an excellent option for secondary back-end 28 products that can be sold
to existing customers or cross-sold 29 to new customers online or on the phone.
To purchase at wholesale, use these steps.
1. Contact the manufacturer and request a “wholesale pricelist” (generally 40% off retail) and terms.
2. If a business tax ID number is needed, print out the proper forms from your state’s Secretary of
State website and file for an LLC (which I prefer) or similar protective business structure for
$100–200.
Do NOT purchase product until you have completed Step 3 in the next chapter. It is enough at this
point to confirm the profit margin and have product photos and sales literature.
That’s reselling. Not much more to it.
Option Two: License a Product
I not only use all the brains that I have, but all that I can borrow.
—WOODROW WILSON
Some of the world’s best-known brands and products have been borrowed from someone or
somewhere else.
The basis for the energy drink Red Bull came from a tonic in Thailand, and the Smurfs were brought
from Belgium. Pokémon came from the land of Honda. The band KISS made millions in record and
concert sales, but the real profit has been in licensing—granting others the right to produce hundreds of
products with their name and image in exchange for a percentage of sales.
There are two parties involved in a licensing deal, and a member of the New Rich could be either.
First, there is the inventor of the product, 30 called the “licensor,” who can sell others the right to
manufacture, use, or sell his or her product, usually for 3–10% of the wholesale price (usually around
40% off retail) for each unit sold. Invent, let someone else do the rest, and cash checks. Not a bad model.
The other side of the equation is the person interested in manufacturing and selling the inventor’s
product for 90–97% of the profit: the licensee. This is, for me and most NR, more interesting.
Licensing is, however, dealmaking-intensive on both sides and a science unto itself. Creative contract
negotiation is essential and most readers will run into problems if it’s their first product. For real-world
case studies on both sides, ranging from Teddy Ruxpin to Tae-Bo, and full agreements with actual dollar
amounts, visit www.fourhourblog.com. From how to sell inventions without prototypes or patents to how
to secure rights to products as a no-name beginner, it’s all there. The economics are fascinating and the
profits can be astounding.
In the meantime, we will focus on the least complicated and most profitable option open to the most
people: product creation.
Option Three: Create a Product
Creation is a better means of self-expression than possession; it is through creating, not
possessing, that life is revealed.
—VIDA D. SCUDDER, The Life of the Spirit in the Modern English Poets
Creating a product is not complicated. “Create” sounds more involved than it actually is. If the idea is
a hard product—an invention—it is possible to hire mechanical engineers or industrial designers on
www.elance.com to develop a prototype based on your description of its function and appearance, which
is then taken to a contract manufacturer. If you find a generic or stock product made by a contract
manufacturer that can be re-purposed or positioned for a special market, it’s even easier: Have them
manufacture it, stick a custom label on it for you, and presto—new product. This latter example is often
referred to as “private labeling.” Have you ever seen a massage therapist’s office with its own line of
vitamin products or the Kirkland brand at Costco? Private labeling in action.
It is true that we’ll be testing market response without manufacturing, but if the test is successful,
manufacturing is the next step. This means we need to keep in mind setup costs, per-unit costs, and order
minimums. Innovative gadgets and devices are great but often require special tooling, which makes the
manufacturing start-up costs too expensive to meet our criteria.
Putting mechanical devices aside and forgetting about welding and engineering, there is one class of
product that meets all of our criteria, has a manufacturing lead time of less than a week in small
quantities, and often permits not just an 8–10 x markup, but a 20–50 x markup.
No, not heroin or slave labor. Too much bribing and human interaction required.
Information.
Information products are low-cost, fast to manufacture, and time-consuming for competitors to
duplicate. Consider that the top-selling non-information infomercial products—whether exercise
equipment or supplements—have a useful life span of two to four months before imitators flood the
market. I studied economics in Beijing for six months and observed firsthand how the latest Nike sneaker
or Callaway golf club could be duplicated and on eBay within a week of first appearing on shelves in the
U.S. This is not an exaggeration, and I am not talking about a look-alike product—I mean an exact
duplicate for 1/20 the cost.
Information, on the other hand, is too time-consuming for most knockoff artists to bother with when
there are easier products to replicate. It’s easier to circumvent a patent than to paraphrase an entire
course to avoid copyright infringement. Three of the most successful television products of all time—all
of which have spent more than 300 weeks on the infomercial top-10 bestseller lists—reflect the
competitive and profit margin advantage of information products.
No Down Payment (Carlton Sheets)
Attacking Anxiety and Depression (Lucinda Bassett)
Personal Power (Tony Robbins)
I know from conversations with the principal owners of one of the above products that more than $65
million worth of information moved through their doors in 2002. Their infrastructure consisted of fewer
than 25 in-house operators, and the rest of the infrastructure, ranging from media purchasing to shipping,
was outsourced.
Their annual revenue-per-employee is more than $2.7 million. Incredible.
On the opposite end of the market size spectrum, I know a man who created a low-budget how-to
DVD for less than $200 and sold it to owners of storage facilities who wanted to install security systems.
It’s hard to get more niche than that. In 2001, selling DVDs that cost $2 to duplicate for $95 apiece
through trade magazines, he made several hundred thousand dollars with no employees.
But I’m Not an Expert!
If you aren’t an expert, don’t sweat it.
First, “expert” in the context of selling product means that you know more about the topic than the
purchaser. No more. It is not necessary to be the best—just better than a small target number of your
prospective customers. Let’s suppose that your current dreamline—to compete in the 1,150-mile Iditarod
dogsledding race in Alaska—requires $5,000 to realize. If there are 15,000 readers and even 50 (0.33%)
can be convinced of your superior expertise in skill X and spend $100 for a program that teaches it, that
is $5,000. Bring on the Huskies. Those 50 customers are what I call the “minimal customer base”—the
minimum number of customers you need to convince of your expertise to fulfill a given dreamline.
Second, expert status can be created in less than four weeks if you understand basic credibility
indicators. It’s important to learn how the PR pros phrase resume points and position their clients. See
the boxed text later in this chapter to learn how.
The degree to which you personally need expert status also depends on how you obtain your content.
There are three main options.
1. Create the content yourself, often via paraphrasing and combining points from several books on a
topic.
2. Repurpose content that is in the public domain and not subject to copyright protection, such as
government documents and material that predates modern copyright law.
3. License content or compensate an expert to help create content. Fees can be one-time and paid up
front or royalty-based (5–10% of net revenue, for example).
If you choose option 1 or 2, you need expert status within a limited market.
Let’s assume you are a real estate broker and have determined that, like yourself, most brokers want a
simple but good website to promote themselves and their businesses. If you read and understand the three
top-selling books on home-page design, you will know more about that topic than 80% of the readership
of a magazine for real estate brokers. If you can summarize the content and make recommendations
specific to the needs of the real estate market, a 0.5–1.5% response from an ad you place in the magazine
is not unreasonable to expect.
Use the following questions to brainstorm potential how-to or informational products that can be sold
to your markets using your expertise or borrowed expertise. Aim for a combination of formats that will
lend itself to $50–200 pricing, such as a combination of two CDs (30–90 minutes each), a 40-page
transcription of the CDs, and a 10-page quickstart guide. Digital delivery is perfectly acceptable—in
some cases, ideal—if you can create a high enough perceived value.
1. How can you tailor a general skill for your market—what I call “niching down”—or add to what is
being sold successfully in your target magazines? Think narrow and deep rather than broad.
2. What skills are you interested in that you—and others in your markets—would pay to learn? Become
an expert in this skill for yourself and then create a product to teach the same. If you need help or want
to speed up the process, consider the next question.
3. What experts could you interview and record to create a sellable audio CD? These people do not need
to be the best, but just better than most. Offer them a digital master copy of the interview to do with or
sell as they like (this is often enough) and/or offer them a small up-front or ongoing royalty payment.
Use Skype.com with HotRecorder (more on these and related tools in Tools and Tricks) to record these
conversations directly to your PC and send the mp3 file to an online transcription service.
4. Do you have a failure-to-success story that could be turned into a how-to product for others? Consider
problems you’ve overcome in the past, both professional and personal.
The Expert Builder: How to Become a Top Expert in 4 Weeks
It’s time to obliterate the cult of the expert. Let the PR world scorn me. First and foremost, there is a
difference between being perceived as an expert and being one. In the context of business, the former is
what sells product and the latter, relative to your “minimal customer base,” is what creates good products
and prevents returns.
It is possible to know all there is to know about a subject—medicine, for example—but if you don’t
have M.D. at the end of your name, few will listen. The M.D. is what I term a “credibility indicator.” The
so-called expert with the most credibility indicators, whether acronyms or affiliations, is often the most
successful in the marketplace, even if other candidates have more in-depth knowledge. This is a matter
of superior positioning, not deception.
How, then, do we go about acquiring credibility indicators in the least time possible? Emulating the
client-grooming techniques of some of the best PR firms in New York City and Los Angeles isn’t a bad
place to start.
It took a friend of mine just three weeks to become a “top relationship expert who, as featured in
Glamour and other national media, has counseled executives at Fortune 500 companies on how to
improve their relationships in 24 hours or less.” How did she do it?
She followed a few simple steps that created a credibility snowball effect. Here’s how you can do the
same.
1. Join two or three related trade organizations with official-sounding names. In her case, she
chose the Association for Conflict Resolution (www.acrnet.org) and The International Foundation for
Gender Education (www.ifge.org). This can be done online in five minutes with a credit card.
2. Read the three top-selling books on your topic (search historical New York Times bestseller lists
online) and summarize each on one page.
3. Give one free one-to-three-hour seminar at the closest well-known university, using posters to
advertise. Then do the same at branches of two well-known big companies (AT&T, IBM, etc.) located
in the same area. Tell the company that you have given seminars at University X or X College and are
a member of those groups from step 1. Emphasize that you are offering it to them for free to get
additional speaking experience outside of academics and will not be selling products or services.
Record the seminars from two angles for later potential use as a CD/DVD product.
4. Optional: Offer to write one or two articles for trade magazines related to your topics, citing
what you have accomplished in steps 1 and 3 for credibility. If they decline, offer to interview a
known expert and write the article—it still gets your name listed as a contributor.
5. Join ProfNet, which is a service that journalists use to find experts to quote for articles. Getting PR
is simple if you stop shouting and start listening. Use steps 1, 3, and 4 to demonstrate credibility and
online research to respond to journalist queries. Done properly, this will get you featured in media
ranging from small local publications to the New York Times and ABC News.
Becoming a recognized expert isn’t difficult, so I want to remove that barrier now.
I am not recommending pretending to be something you’re not. I can’t! “Expert” is nebulous mediaspeak
and so overused as to be indefinable. In modern PR terms, proof of expertise in most fields is
shown with group affiliations, client lists, writing credentials, and media mentions, not IQ points or
Ph.D.s.
Presenting the truth in the best light, but not fabricating it, is the name of the game.
See you on CNN.
Q&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS
For this hands-on chapter, the Q&A is simple. In fact, it’s more like a Q.
The question is, “Did you read the chapter and follow the directions?” If not, do it! Instead of the
usual Q&A, the end of this chapter and the following two will feature more extensive resources for
taking the action steps described in detail in the text.
COMFORT CHALLENGE
Find Yoda (3 Days)
Call at least one potential superstar mentor per day for three days. E-mail only after attempting a phone
call. I recommend calling before 8:30 A.M. or after 6:00 P.M. to reduce run-ins with secretaries and other
gatekeepers. Have a single question in mind, one that you have researched but have been unable to
answer yourself. Shoot for “A” players—CEOs, ultrasuccessful entrepreneurs, famous authors, etc.—and
don’t aim low to make it less frightening. Use www.contactanycelebrity.com if need be, and base your
script on the following.
Unknown answerer: This is Acme Inc. [or “the office of Mentor X”].
You: Hi, this is Tim Ferriss calling for John Grisham, please. 31
Answerer: May I ask what this is regarding?
You: Sure. I know this might sound a bit odd, 32 but I’m a first-time author and just read his interview in
Time Out New York. 33 I’m a longtime 34 fan and have finally built up the courage to 35 call him for one
specific piece of advice. It wouldn’t take more than two minutes of his time. Is there any way you can
help me get through to him? 36 I really, really appreciate whatever you can do.
Answerer: Hmmm … Just a second. Let me see if he’s available. [two minutes later] Here you go. Good

You: Hi, Mr. Grisham. My name is Tim Ferriss. I know this might sound a bit odd, but I’m a first-time
author and a longtime fan. I just read your interview in Time Out New York and finally built up the
courage to call. I have wanted to ask you for a specific piece of advice for a long time, and it shouldn’t
take more than two minutes of your time. May I? 37
John Grisham: Uh … OK. Go ahead. I have to be on a call in a few minutes.
You (at the very end of the call): Thank you so much for being so generous with your time. If I have the
occasional tough question—very occasional—is there any chance I could keep in touch via e-mail? 38

OVER THE MOON
My 13-year-old daughter would like to be an astronaut when she grows up. Last year she had an
extreme challenge to deal with. The phrase from Apollo 13 “Failure is not an option” sort of became our
motto. I got the idea of contacting the commander of Apollo 13, Jim Lovell. It didn’t take much to find
him and he sent her a wonderful letter about his ordeal just to get into the Apollo program, not to
mention dealing with a crippled spacecraft. His letter made a big difference to my daughter. A couple
months later, we were able to take things a little further by getting her VIP access to a shuttle launch.

Finding Products to Resell or Manufacturing
Affiliate Networks: Clickbank ( www.clickbank.com ),
Commission Junction ( www.cj.com ), Amazon Associates ( www.amazon.com/associates )
No inventory, no invoices. Experimenting with products and categories through affiliate networks such
as Clickbank and Commission Junction, which pay you 10–75% of each purchase, is a fast method for
doing a proof-of-concept using similar products. It’s often worth setting up accounts at both just to
observe how bestselling items are being sold and promoted.
Amazon Associates averages 7–10% commissions, but bestselling books are excellent for testing target
markets for more elaborate informational products. For all of the above: Do not get into bidding wars
against other affiliates using expensive general keywords or overexposed brand names. Go niche or go
broke.
Alibaba ( www.alibaba.com )
Based in China, Alibaba is the world’s largest business-to-business marketplace. From MP3 players for
$9 each to red wine for $2 per bottle, this site is the source. If someone here doesn’t make it, it probably
can’t be made.

Finding Public Domain Information to Repurpose
Be sure to speak with an intellectual property attorney before using apparent public domain material. If
someone modifies 20% of a public domain work (through abridging and footnotes, for example), their
“new” complete work can be copyrighted. Using it without permission would then be a punishable
infringement. The details can get confusing. Do the beginning research yourself, but get a pro to look
over your findings before moving ahead with product development.

Licensing Ideas to Others for Royalties
InventRight ( www.inventright.com ) (800–701–7993)
Stephen Key is the most consistently successful inventor I’ve ever met, with millions in royalties from
companies like Disney, Nestlé, and Coca-Cola. He is not high-tech but specializes in creating simple
products, or improving on existing products, and then licensing (renting) his ideas to large corporations.
He comes up with the idea, files a provisional patent for less than $200, and then lets another company
do the work while he collects checks. This site introduces his fail-proof process for doing the same. His
techniques for cold-calling alone are invaluable. Highly recommended.
Guthy-Renker Corporation (www.guthyrenker.com) (760–773–9022) GRC is the 800-pound
infomercial gorilla. It brings in more than $1.3 billion per year in sales with mega-hits like Tony
Robbins, Proactiv Solution, and Winsor Pilates. Don’t expect more than a 2–4% royalty if you make the

Bon Jour Tim,
I was in Barnes & Noble at the help desk this past Saturday, April 25, waiting for an employee to get a
book for me (Tropic of Cancer if you must know). While I was waiting, I noticed a copy of 4-Hour
Workweek on the counter that someone else had ordered. Not one to be shy, I reached over the counter
and started reading their copy. As you might guess, I had the employee go back and get me my own
copy. Haven’t finished Tropic of Cancer but finished your book …
… On Monday I got a yes when I asked my boss to work two days remotely per week. I start next
week.
On Monday I also booked the most stunning apartment in Paris for the month of September, at a cost
of half of the rent I pay in Southern California. I plan to increase my remote time now through August so
that September will be an easy ask to leave for remote work. If the answer happens to be no (which I
now doubt), I will be prepared to quit my job.
Now at work on my Income Autopilot project.
Tim: amazing. My life has changed in three days. (Plus, your book was funny as hell.) Thank
you!!! —CINDY FRANKEY
21. There are a few limited exceptions, such as online membership sites that don’t require content
generation, but as a general rule, products require much less maintenance and will get you to your
TMI faster.
22. Muses will provide the time and financial freedom to realize your dreamlines in record time, after
which one can (and often does) start additional companies to change the world or sell.
23. Distributors are sometimes also referred to as “wholesalers,” depending on the industry.
24. It is illegal to control how much someone sells your product for, but you can dictate how much
they advertise it for. This is done by including a Minimum Advertised Pricing (MAP) policy in your
General Terms and Conditions (GTC), which are agreed to automatically when a written wholesale
order is placed. Sample GTC and order forms are available at www.fourhourblog.com.
25. The Wall Street Journal, July 18, 2005 (http://www.technologyinvestor.com/login/2004/Jul18–

26. This was a new product category that I created to eliminate and preempt the competition. Strive to
be the largest, best, or first in a precise category. I prefer being first.
27. If you decide to resell someone else’s higher-end products like Doug, especially with dropshipping,
the risk is lower and smaller margins can suffice.
28. “Back-end” products are products sold to customers once the sale of a primary product has been
made. iPod covers and car GPS systems are two examples. These products can have lower margins,
because there is no advertising cost to acquire the customer.
29. “Cross-selling” is selling a related product to a customer while they’re still on the phone or in an
online shopping cart after the sale of a primary product has been made. For a full marketing and direct
response (DR) glossary, visit www.fourhourblog.com.
30. This also refers to owners of copyrights or trademarks.
31. Said casually and with confidence, this alone will get you through surprisingly often. “I’d like to
speak with Mr./Ms. X, please” is a dead giveaway that you don’t know them. If you want to up the
chances of getting though but risk looking foolish if they call the bluff, ask for the target mentor by
first name only.
32. I use this type of lead-in whenever making off-the-wall requests. It softens it and makes the
person curious enough to listen before spitting out an automatic “no.”
33. This answers the questions they’ll have in their head: “Who are you and why are you calling
now?” I like to be a “first-time” something to play the sympathy card, and I find a recent media
feature online to cite as the trigger for calling.
34. I call people I’m familiar with. If you can’t call yourself a longtime fan, tell them that you have
followed the mentor’s career or business exploits for a certain number of years.
35. Don’t pretend to be strong. Make it clear you’re nervous and they’ll lower their guard. I often do
this even if I’m not nervous.
36. The wording here is critical. Ask them to “help” you do something.
37. Just rework the gatekeeper paragraph for this, and don’t dillydally—get to the point quickly and
ask for permission to pull the trigger.
38. End the conversation by opening the door for future contact. Start with e-mail and let the
mentoring relationship develop from there.

TESTING THE MUSE
Many of these theories have been killed off only when some decisive experiment exposed their
incorrectness…. Thus the yeoman work in any science … is done by the experimentalist, who
must keep the theoreticians honest.
—MICHIO KAKU, theoretical physicist and cocreator of String Field Theory, Hyperspace
Fewer than 5% of the 195,000 books published each year sell more than 5,000 copies. Teams of
publishers and editors with decades of combined experience fail more times than not. The founder of
Border’s Books lost $375 million of investor funding with WebVan, 39 a nationwide grocery delivery
service. The problem? No one wanted it.
The moral is that intuition and experience are poor predictors of which products and businesses will be
profitable. Focus groups are equally misleading. Ask ten people if they would buy your product. Then
tell those who said “yes” that you have ten units in your car and ask them to buy. The initial positive
responses, given by people who want to be liked and aim to please, become polite refusals as soon as real
money is at stake.
To get an accurate indicator of commercial viability, don’t ask people if they would buy—ask them to
buy. The response to the second is the only one that matters. The approach of the NR reflects this.
Step Three: Micro-Test Your Products
Micro-testing involves using inexpensive advertisements to test consumer response to a product
prior to manufacturing. 40
In the pre-Internet era, this was done using small classified ads in newspapers or magazines that led
prospects to call a prerecorded sales message. Prospects would leave their contact information, and based
on the number of callers or response to a follow-up sales letter, the product would be abandoned or
manufactured.
In the Internet era, there are better tools that are both cheaper and faster. We’ll test the product ideas
from the last chapter on Google Adwords—the largest and most sophisticated Pay-Per-Click (PPC)
engine—in five days for $500 or less. PPC here refers to the highlighted search results that are listed
above and to the right of normal search results on Google. Advertisers pay to have these ads displayed
when people search for a certain term related to the advertisers’ product, such as “cognitive supplement,”
and are charged a small fee from $.05 to over $1 each time someone clicks through to their site. For a
good introduction to Google Adwords and PPC, visit www.google.com/onlinebusiness. For expanded
examples of the following PPC strategies, visit www.fourhourblog.com and search “PPC.”
The basic test process consists of three parts, each of which is covered in this chapter.
Best: Look at the competition and create a more-compelling offer on a basic one-to-three-page website
(one to three hours).
Test: Test the offer using short Google Adwords advertising campaigns (three hours to set up and five
days of passive observation).
Divest or Invest: Cut losses with losers and manufacture the winner(s) for sales rollout.
Let’s use two people, Sherwood and Johanna, and their two product ideas—French sailor shirts and a
how-to yoga DVD for rock climbers—as case studies of what the testing steps look like and how you
can do the same.
Sherwood bought a striped sailing shirt in France while traveling last summer, and upon returning to
NYC has been continually approached by 20–30-year-old males on the street who want to know where
to get their own. Sensing an opportunity, he requests back issues of NYC-based weekly magazines
aimed at this demographic and calls the manufacturer in France for pricing. He learns that he can
purchase shirts at a wholesale price of $20 that sell for $100 retail. He adds $5 per shirt to account for
shipping to the U.S. and arrives at a per-shirt cost of $25. It’s not quite our ideal markup (4x vs. 8–10x),
but he wants to test the product regardless.
Johanna is a yoga instructor who has noticed her growing client base of rock climbers. She is also a
rock climber and is considering creating a yoga instructional DVD tailored to that sport, which would
include a 20-page spiral-bound manual and be priced at $80. She predicts that production of a lowbudget
first edition of the DVD would cost nothing more than a borrowed digital camera and a friend’s
iMac for simple editing. She can burn small quantities of this first-edition DVD—no menus, just straight
footage and titles—on the laptop and create labels with freeware from www.download.com. She has
contacted a duplication house and learned that more-professional DVDs will cost $3–5 apiece to
duplicate in small quantities (minimum of 250), including cases.
Now that they have ideas and estimates of start-up costs, what next?
Besting the Competition
First and foremost, each product must pass a competitive litmus test. How can Sherwood and Johanna
beat the competition and offer a superior product or guarantee?
1. Sherwood and Johanna Google the top terms each would use to try and find their respective products.
To come up with related terms and derivative terms, both use search term suggestion tools.
Google Adwords Keyword Tool (http://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal) Enter the
potential search terms to find search volume and alternative terms with more search traffic. Click on the
“Approx Avg Search Volume” column to sort results from most to least searched.
SEOBook Keyword Tool, SEO for Firefox Extension (http://tools.seobook.com/) This is an
outstanding resource page with searches powered by Wordtracker (www.wordtracker.com).
Both then visit the three websites that consistently appear in top search and PPC positions. How can
Sherwood and Johanna differentiate themselves?
Use more credibility indicators? (media, academia, associations,
and testimonials)
Create a better guarantee?
Offer better selection? 41
Free or faster shipping?
Sherwood notices that the shirts are often hard to find on the competitive sites, all of which feature
dozens of products, and the shirts are either made in the U.S. (inauthentic) or shipped from France
(customers must wait two to four weeks). Johanna cannot find a “yoga for rock climbing” DVD, so she
is starting from a blank slate.
2. Sherwood and Johanna now need to create a one-page (300–600 words) testimonial-rich
advertisement that emphasizes their differentiators and product benefits using text and either personal
photos or stock photos from stock photo websites. Both have spent two weeks collecting advertisements
that have prompted them to make purchases or that have caught their attention in print or online—these
will serve as models. 42 Johanna asks her clients for testimonials and Sherwood lets his friends try on the
shirts to get several for his page. Sherwood also asks the manufacturer for photos and advertising
samples.
See www.pxmethod.com for a good example of how I have created a test page using testimonials
from seminar attendees. Please note that it’s just a template for readers and not a live sales page. Free
how-to seminars as recommended in the Expert Builder are ideal for identifying popular selling points
and securing testimonials.
Testing the Advertisement
Sherwood and Johanna now need to test actual customer response to their advertisements. Sherwood first
tests his concept with a 72-hour eBay auction that includes his advertising text. He sets the “reserve” (the
lowest price he’ll accept) for one shirt at $50 and cancels the auction last minute to avoid legal issues
since he doesn’t have product to ship. He has received bids up to $75 and decides to move to the next
phase of testing. Johanna doesn’t feel comfortable with the apparent deception and skips this preliminary
testing.
Sherwood’s cost: <$5.
Both register domain names for their soon-to-be one-page sites using the cheap domain registrar
www.domainsinseconds.com. Sherwood chooses www.shirtsfromfrance.com and Johanna chooses
www.yogaclimber.com. For additional domain names, Johanna uses www.domainsinseconds.com.
Cost to both: <$20.
Sherwood uses www.weebly.com to create his one-page site advertisement and then creates two
additional pages using the form builder www.wufoo.com. If someone clicks on the “purchase” button at
the bottom of the first page, it takes them to a second page with pricing, shipping and handling, 43 and
basic contact fields to fill out (including e-mail and phone). If the visitor presses “continue with order,” it
takes them to a page that states, “Unfortunately, we are currently on back order but will contact you as
soon as we have product in stock. Thank you for your patience.” This structure allows him to test the
first-page ad and his pricing separately. If someone gets to the last page, it is considered an order.
Johanna is not comfortable with “dry testing,” as Sherwood’s approach is known, even though it is
legal if the billing data isn’t captured. She instead uses the same two services to create a single webpage
with the content of her one-page ad and an e-mail sign-up for a free “top 10 tips” list for using yoga for
rock climbing. She will consider 60% of the sign-ups as hypothetical orders.
Cost to both: <$0.
Both set up simple Google Adwords campaigns with 50–100 search terms to simultaneously test
headlines while driving traffic to their pages. Their daily budget limits are set at $50 per day. (At this
segue into PPC testing, I recommend you first visit www.adwords/google.com/onlinebusiness and then
follow along by creating your own account, which should take about 10 minutes. It would be a waste of
rain forests to use ten pages to explain terms that can be understood at a glance online.)
Sherwood and Johanna decide on the best search terms by using the search term suggestion tools
mentioned earlier. Both aim for specific terms when possible (“french sailor shirts” vs. “french shirts;”
“yoga for sports” vs. “yoga”) for higher conversion rates (the percentage of visitors that purchase) and
lower cost-per-click (CPC). They aim also for second through fourth positioning, but no more than $.20
CPC.
Sherwood will use Google’s free analytical tools to track “orders” and page abandonment rates—what
percentage of visitors leave the site from which pages. Johanna will use www.wufoo.com to track e-mail
sign-ups on this small testing scale. 44
Cost to both: $0.
Both Johanna and Sherwood design Adwords ads that focus on their differentiators. Each Google
Adwords ad consists of a headline and then two lines of description, neither of which can exceed 35
characters. In Sherwood’s case, he creates five groups of 10 search terms each. The following are two of
his ads.
SAILOR SHIRTS FROM FRANCE
Johanna creates the same five groups of 10 terms each and tests a number of ads, including these:
Notice that these ads can be used to test not just headlines but guarantees, product names, and domain
names. It’s as simple as creating several ads, rotated automatically by Google, that are identical except
for the one variable to be tested. How do you think I determined the best title for this book?
Both Sherwood and Johanna disable the feature on Google that serves only the best-performing ad.
This is necessary to later compare the click-through rates from each and combine the best elements
(headline, domain name, and body text) into a final ad.
Last but not least, ensure that the ads don’t trick prospects into visiting the site. The product offer
should be clear. Our goal is qualified traffic, so we do not want to offer something “free” or otherwise
attract window shoppers or the curious who are unlikely to buy.
Cost to both: $50 or less per day x 5 days = $250. 45
Investing or Divesting
Five days later, it’s time to tally the results.
What can we consider a “good” click-through and conversion rate? This is where the math can be
deceiving. If we’re selling a $10,000 abominable snowman suit with an 80% profit margin, we obviously
need a much lower conversion rate than someone who is selling a $50 DVD with a 70% profit margin.
For sophisticated tools and free spreadsheets that do all sorts of calculations for you, visit the reader-only
resources at www.fourhourblog.com.
Johanna and Sherwood decide to keep it simple at this stage: How much did they spend on PPC ads
and how much did they “sell”?
Johanna has done well. The traffic wasn’t enough to make the test stand up to statistical scrutiny, but
she spent about $200 on PPC and got 14 sign-ups for a free 10-tip report. If she assumes 60% would
purchase, that means 8.4 people x $75 profit per DVD = $630 in hypothetical total profit. This is also not
taking into account the potential lifetime value of each customer.
The results of her small test are no guarantee of future success, but the indications are positive enough
that she decides to set up a Yahoo Store for $99 per month and a small per-transaction fee. Her credit
isn’t excellent, so she will opt to use www.paypal.com to accept credit cards online instead of
approaching her bank for a merchant account. 46 She e-mails the 10-tip report to those who signed up and
asks for their feedback and recommendations for content on the DVD. Ten days later, she has a first
attempt at the DVD ready to ship and her store is online. Her sales to the original sign-ups cover costs of
production and she is soon selling a respectable 10 DVDs per week ($750 profit) via Google Adwords.
She plans to test advertising in niche magazines and blogs and now needs to create an automation
architecture to remove herself from the equation.
Sherwood didn’t fare as well but still sees potential. He spent $150 on PPC and “sold” three shirts for
a hypothetical $225 in profit. He had more than enough traffic, but the bulk of visitors left the site on the
pricing page. Rather than drop pricing, he decides to test a “2x money-back guarantee” on the pricing
page, which will enable customers to get a $200 refund if the $100 shirts aren’t the “most comfortable
they’ve ever owned.” He retests and “sells” seven shirts for $525 in profit. Based on these results, he sets
up a merchant account through his bank and Authorize.net to process credit cards, orders a dozen shirts
from France, and sells them all over the following ten days. This gives him enough profit to buy a small
display ad at 50% off (asking for a “first-time advertiser discount” and then citing a competing magazine
to get another 20% off) in a local weekly art magazine, in which he calls the shirt “Jackson Pollock
Shirts.” He orders two dozen more shirts with net-30 payment terms and puts a toll-free number 47 in the
print ad that forwards to his cell phone. He does this instead of using a website for two reasons: (1) He
wants to determine the most common questions for his FAQ online, and (2) he wants to test an offer of
$100 for one shirt ($75 in profit) or “buy two, get one free” ($200 - $75 = $125 profit).
He sells all 24 shirts in the first five days the magazine runs, most through the special offer. Success.
He redesigns the print ad, putting answers to common questions in the text to cut down on calls for
information, and decides to negotiate a longer-term ad agreement with the magazine. He sends his sales
rep a check for four issues at 30% of their published rates. He calls to confirm that they received his
check via FedEx and, with check in hand and deadlines looming, they don’t refuse.
Sherwood wants to go to Berlin during a two-week break from his job, which he is now considering
quitting. How can he roll out his success and escape his own company? He needs to build the
architecture and get his mobile M.B.A.
That’s where the next chapter comes in.
New Rich Revisited: How Doug Did It
Remember Doug from ProSoundEffects.com? How did he test the idea and go from $0 to $10,000
per month in the process? He followed these steps.
1. Market Selection
He chose music and television producers as his market because he is a musician himself and has used
these products.
2. Product Brainstorm
He chose the most popular products available for resale from the largest manufacturers of sound libraries
and arranged a wholesale purchase and drop-ship agreement with them. Many of these libraries cost well
above $300 (up to $7,500), and this is precisely why he needs to answer more customer-service
questions than someone with a lower-priced product of $50–200.
3. Micro-Testing
He auctioned the products on eBay to test demand (and the highest possible pricing) before purchasing
inventory. He ordered product only when people placed orders from him, and product shipped
immediately from the manufacturers’ warehouses. Based on this demand confirmed on eBay, Doug
created a Yahoo Store with these products and began testing Google Adwords and other PPC search
engines.
4. Rollout and Automation
Following this testing, and upon generating sufficient cash flow, Doug began experimenting with print
advertising in trade magazines. Simultaneously, he streamlined and outsourced operations to reduce his
time requirements from two hours per day to two hours per week.
COMFORT CHALLENGE
Rejecting First Offers and Walking Away (3 Days)
Before performing this exercise, if possible, read the bonus chapter “How to Get $700,000 of
Advertising for $10,000” on our companion site, and then set aside two hours on a consecutive Saturday,
Sunday, and Monday.
On Saturday and Sunday, go to a farmers’ market or other outdoor event where goods are sold. If this
isn’t possible, go to small independent retailers (not chains or mass retail).
Set a budget of $100 for your negotiating tuition and look for items to purchase that total at least $150.
Your job is to get the sellers down to a total of $100 or less for the lot. It is better to practice on many
cheap items rather than a few big items. Be sure to reply to their first offer with, “What type of discount
can you offer?” to let them negotiate against themselves. Negotiate near closing time, choose your
objective price, bracket, and make a firm offer with cash in hand for that amount. 48 Practice walking
away if your objective price isn’t met. On Monday, call two magazines (expect the first to be awkward)
and use the script on the companion site to negotiate, minus the last firm offer. Get them as low as
possible and then call them back later to indicate that your proposal was refused by upper management
or otherwise vetoed.
This is the negotiating equivalent of paper trading. 49 Get used to refusing offers and countering in
person and—most importantly—on the phone.

hours and have it appear on the front page of Google for “timothy ferriss” searches within 48 hours. It is,
like WordPress.com below, designed to be very SEO-friendly (search-engine optimization) without any
knowledge or action on your part. No HTML or Internet expertise is required.
WordPress.com ( www.wordpress.com )
I used WordPress.com to set up www.litliberation.org from a coffee shop in Bratislava, Slovakia, when a
U.S.-based designer flaked out and left me scrambling. It took me less than three hours to learn how to
use it and build the site. The site, an experimental educational fundraiser, ended up raising 200%+ more
than Stephen Colbert in the same period of time. I also use their free open-sourced version of WordPress
(www.wordpress.org, which requires separate hosting) to manage everything for my top-1,000 blog at
www.fourhourblog.com. This offers greater customization but requires more management and technical
know-how.
Both Weebly and WordPress.com host your site for you, so additional hosting setup isn’t required.
If you choose to use www.wordpress.org (not.com) for greater customizability, I suggest using a
hosting service with one-click WordPress installation like www.bluehost.com. The Shopp plug-in
(http://shopplugin.net/) or Market Theme plug-in (http://www.markettheme.com/) can then be used to
add e-commerce capabilities. Shopify.com (discussed later) is another good all-in-one alternative.
Create Forms in Seconds for Testing Checkout with or Without Payment
Wufoo ( www.wufoo.com )
Wufoo does not offer a full-featured shopping cart, but it provides the cleanest, easiest-to-use forms on
the web. Create a checkout page that connects to PayPal and you can (1) link to this checkout page from
your site on Weebly, WordPress.com, or elsewhere, or (2) drop the code into your own website and have
it hosted there. Wufoo is appropriate for testing and selling single products, as people can’t add multiple
items to a shopping cart or otherwise customize the order à la Amazon. For those additional options,
which are often desirable after successful testing, you will want to use an “end-to-end site solutions”
listed later in these resources.
Cost-Effective Trademark Filing and Company Formation (LLC, C-Corp, etc.)
Though I also have a C-Corporation (often used to issue common and preferred stock to investors),
created through the second option below, LLCs and S-Corps are generally favored by small businesses.
Consult your accountant to determine the best entity form.
LegalZoom ( www.legalzoom.com )
Company formation, trademarks, and nearly all legal documents. I know one founder who used this
service to incorporate his tech start-up, which is now worth more than $200 million.
Corporate Creations ( www.corporatecreations.com )
Domestic and overseas company formation.
Services for Selling Downloadable Products (e-books, videos, audio, etc., in descending order of
reader preference)
E-Junkie ( www.e-junkie.com )
Lulu ( www.lulu.com )
Lulu will also do print-on-demand and other forms of manufacture and fulfillment. Like Lightning
Source (www.lightningsource.com), it offers distribution through Amazon, Barnes & Noble online, and
other major outlets.
CreateSpace ( www.createspace.com )
A subsidiary of Amazon.com that offers inventory-free, physical distribution of books, CD and DVDs on
Demand, as well as video downloads through Amazon Video On Demand (tm) .
Clickbank ( www.clickbank.com )
Provides integrated access to affiliates willing to sell your product for a percentage of sales.
Introduction to Pay-Per-Click (PPC) Advertising and Testing
Google Adwords ( www.google.com/adwords )
Market Sizing and Keyword Suggestion Tools
Brainstorm additional PPC search terms and determine the number of people who are searching for them.
Google Adwords Keyword Tool ( http://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal )
Enter the potential search terms to find search volume and alternative terms with more search traffic.
Click on the “Approx Avg Search Volume” column to sort results from most to least searched.
SEOBook Keyword Tool, SEO for Firefox Extension ( http://tools.seobook.com /)
Outstanding resource page with searches powered by Wordtracker (www.wordtracker.com).
Low-Cost Domain Registration
Domains in Seconds ( www.domainsinseconds.com ) I have
registered more than 100 domains through this service.
Joker ( www.joker.com )
GoDaddy ( www.godaddy.com )
Inexpensive but Dependable Hosting Services
Shared hosting solutions, where your site is hosted alongside other sites on a single server, are so cheap
that I recommend using two providers, one as a primary and one as a backup. Put your site pages on
each host and sign up with www.no-ip.com, which can redirect traffic (DNS) to the backup in five
minutes instead of the usual 24 to 48 hours.
1and1 ( www.1and1.com )
BlueHost ( www.bluehost.com )
RackSpace ( www.rackspace.com ; known for dedicated and
managed servers )
Hosting.com ( www.hosting.com ; known for dedicated and

Royalty-Free Photos and Materials
iStockphoto ( www.istockphoto.com )
iStockphoto is the Internet’s original member-generated image and design site, which has more than 4
million photographs, vector illustrations, videos, audio tracks, and Flash files available for use.
Getty Images ( www.gettyimages.com )
This is where the pros go. Stock photos and film of anything for a price. I pay $150–400 for most images
I use in national print campaigns and the quality is outstanding.
E-mail Sign-up Tracking and Scheduled Autoresponders
Both of these programs can be used to embed e-mail address sign-up forms on your site.
AWeber ( www.aweber.com )
MailChimp ( www.mailchimp.com )
End-to-End Site Solutions with Payment Processing
Shopify ( www.shopify.com )
This is a reader favorite that, in addition to beautiful design, offers full SEO (search-engine
optimization), drag-and-drop use, statistics, and product fulfillment through one of their certified
partners such as Fulfillment by Amazon.com. Clients range from small-business owners to Tesla Motors.
Unlike with Yahoo and eBay, however, you will need to set up a payment-processing service to accept
payments from customers. (See below—PayPal is the easiest to integrate.)
Yahoo! Store ( http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/ecommerce ) (866–781–9246)
This is what Doug of Pro Sound Effects used. As little as $40 a month with 1.5% per transaction.
eBay Store ( http://pages.ebay.com/storefronts/start.html )
From $15–500 per month, plus eBay fees.
Simple Payment Processing for Testing Pages, from Least to Most Involved
PayPal Cart (www.paypal.com; see “merchant”)
Accept credit card payments in minutes. No monthly fees, 1.9–2.9% of each transaction (called “discount
rate”) and $0.30 per transaction.
Google Checkout ( http://checkout.google.com/sell )
Get $10 in free processing for each $1 spent on AdWords; 2% and $0.20 per transaction thereafter.
Requires that customers have a Google ID, and is thus most useful as a supplement to one of the
aforementioned payment solutions. Be sure to link your Checkout account to your AdWords account to
receive credit. Important note: free transaction processing for nonprofits.
Authorize.net ( www.authorize.net )
The Authorize.Net Payment Gateway can help you accept credit card and electronic check payments
quickly and affordably. More than 230,000 merchants trust Authorize.net to manage their transactions,
help prevent fraud, and grow their business. The fees per transaction are lower than PayPal or Google
Checkout, but setup will require a merchant account, covered in the next chapter, and other timeconsuming
applications. I suggest setting up Authorize.net only after a product has tested successfully
through one of the other two options above.
Software for Understanding Web Traffic (Web Analytics)
How are people finding, browsing, and leaving your site? How many prospective customers are being
delivered by each PPC ad, and which pages are most popular? These programs tell you all this and more.
Google is free for most low-volume sites—and better than a lot of paid software-and the others cost $30
and upward per month.
Google Analytics ( www.google.com/analytics )
CrazyEgg ( www.crazyegg.com )
I use CrazyEgg to see exactly where people are clicking most and least on homepages and landing pages.
It is particularly helpful for repositioning the most important links or buttons to help prompt visitors to
take specific next actions. Don’t guess what’s working or not—measure it.
Clicktracks (www.clicktracks.com)
WebTrends ( www.webtrends.com )
A/B Testing Software
Testing is, as you know, the name of the game, but testing all the variables can be confusing. How do
you know which combination of headlines, text, and images on your homepage results in the most sales?
Instead of using one version for a bit, then alternating, which is time-consuming, use software that serves
up different versions to prospects at random, then does the math for you.
Google Website Optimizer (WO) ( http://www.google.com/websiteoptimizer )
This is a free tool that, like Google Analytics, is better than most paid services. I used Google WO to test
three potential homepages for www.dailyburn.com and increased sign-ups 19%, then again by more than
16%.
Offermatica ( www.offermatica.com )
Vertster.com ( www.vertster.com )
Optimost ( www.optimost.com )
Low-Cost Toll-free Numbers
TollFreeMAX (www.tollfreemax.com) (877–888–8MAX) and Kall8 (www.kall8.com)
TollFreeMAX and Kall8 both allow you to set up toll-free numbers in 2–5 minutes. Calls can then be
forwarded to any other numbers, and voicemail and statistics can be managed online or via e-mail.

Freelance Designers and Programmers
99Designs (www.99designs.com) and Crowdspring (www.crowdspring.com)
I used 99Designs to get an excellent logo for www.litliberation.org in 24 hours for less than $150. I
submitted the concept, more than 50 designers worldwide uploaded their best attempts, which I could
browse, and I chose the best after suggesting a few improvements. From Crowdspring’s site: “Name
your price, name your deadline, see entries within hours and be done in just days. The average project
gets a whopping 68 entries. 25 entries or your money back.”

LIFESTYLE DESIGN IN ACTION
I’m a U.S. citizen and it was impossible for my friends and relatives to track me down by phone. Enter
Skype In. It’s not new but allows you to lease a fixed U.S. (or other country) phone number which then
forwards to your Skype account. About $60/year. Within Skype you can then set up call forwarding to
ring you at your local number. You pay the rate as if you were calling from the United States to
wherever you are. I’ve used this in about 40 countries and it works like a treat. The call quality is usually
great and the convenience is amazing. http://www.skype.com/allfeatures/onlinenumber/. A caveat is to
always, ALWAYS get a local SIM card for your unlocked GSM phone. Roaming is for amateurs. A
local SIM also gets you GPRS, Edge, or 3G. Sometimes even free Wifi. Cheers, —TY KROLL
Basically I try to keep all of my tools online so that if my laptop gets stolen, I can buy a new one and
have everything up and running within 24 hours. Here are a few of the tools I use on a regular basis:
RememberTheMilk.com has been really crucial to me keeping on top of my daily tasks.
Freshbooks.com for online invoicing
Highrise (http://www.highrisehq.com/) for online CRM
Dropbox (getdropbox.com) for easy file sharing/automatic backup of critical files while on the
road
TrueCrypt (truecrypt.org) for keeping your laptop data secure while on the road. [Tim comment:
This can also be used with a USB flash drive, and another cool feature—it provides two levels of
“plausible deniability” (hidden volumes, etc.) if someone forces you to reveal the password.]
PBwiki.com-Wiki site that helps me keep on top of the notes and ideas that I collect as I go
through life.
FogBugz on Demand: http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBUGZ/IntrotoOnDemand.html. It’s a “bug
tracker” aimed at software development companies, but I use it every day for both personal and
business tasks. It’s almost like a VA, as you can route your mail through it and it will help you sort
it and keep track of it. It has great features to track e-mails, and there’s a free version for two users
(me + VA!). —RB CARTER
A really useful service is Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. With a small investment in time or money, a
business that requires hundreds of people doing small bits of defined work becomes possible for
extraordinarily low work-per-unit costs. Examples include the search for Steve Fosset (literally thousands
of people looked at satellite photos that would have overwhelmed SAR agencies) and a trouble-ticket
business that utilizes qualified labor all over the world (see Amazon.com/webservices). I am not an
owner nor do I have any stake in Amazon—but I have used their services and some are trans forming
when it comes to muse creation. Cheers, —J MARYMEE
FAST TO MARKET
The fastest way to market with a product idea is: Registera.com. Get hosting from dathorn.com [a
cheap reseller account, like www.domainsinseconds.com]. With two clicks set up a wordpress blog.
Apply a theme to it. Add your content and a buy now button. The buy now button links to an enter e-
mail address, phone number, etc., page. The user then clicks a continue to PayPal button. This
automatically e-mails me their details, but then shows the user a message stating that the link to PayPal
is currently not working. I use this to determine how many sales I would have achieved. I use Google
ads to drive traffic … I calculate theoretical ROI (ideally using Google analytics). If after a week or two
I can see a positive ROI that’s worth my effort I create or outsource the creation of the product (emag,
PDF, whatever). I set it all up with a working link to PayPal, and then retrospectively send a message to
the users who already tried to buy. Normally within hours I’ve got all my money back, and the cash
starts to roll. An example is the DIY public relations pack at www.mybusinesspr.com.au. Great work of
the 4HWW … looking forward to the next edition. Regards, MATT SCHMIDT

40. It can be illegal to charge customers prior to shipment—so we will not charge customers—but it is
still common practice. Why do so many commercials state “allow three to four weeks for delivery” if
it only takes three to five days for a shipment to get from New York to California? It gives the
companies time to manufacture product and use customers’ credit card payments to finance it. Clever
but often against the law.
41. This applies to Sherwood and not Johanna.
42. How did I come up with the most successful BodyQUICK headline (“The Fastest Way to Increase
Power and Speed Guaranteed”)? I borrowed it from the longest-running, and thus most profitable,
Rosetta Stone headline: “The Fastest Way to Learn a Language Guaranteed. (tm) ” Reinventing the
wheel is expensive—become an astute observer of what is already working and adapt it. I keep a
folder of all print and direct mail advertising that compels me to call a number or visit a website, and
I use www.delicious.com to bookmark websites that convince me to provide my e-mail address or
make a purchase.
43. Sherwood includes shipping and handling prior to the final order page so that people don’t finalize
the order just to confirm total pricing. He wants his “orders” to reflect real orders and not price
checkers.
44. If you are rolling out after a successful test or building a large e-mail database, tools like
www.aweber.com in the resources are better at scaling.
45. Keeping in mind that 100 specific terms at $0.10 per click will perform better than 10 broad terms
at $1.00 per click, the more you spend, and thus the more traffic you drive, the more statistically valid
the results will be. If budget permits, increase the number of related terms and daily expenditure so
that the entire PPC test costs $500–1,000.
46. This is a checking account for receiving credit card payments.
47. Set this up using services detailed at the end of this chapter and the next.
48. See the online bonus chapter on www.fourhourblog.com to understand all of these terms in
context. Search “Jedi Mind Tricks.”
49. “Paper trading” refers to setting an imaginary budget, “purchasing” stocks (writing their current
values on a piece of paper), and then tracking their performance over time to see how your investment
would have done had it been for real. It is a no-risk method for honing investment skills before
putting skin in the game.

Hmm … Whom to follow? If you are fast on your feet, you’ll notice that I just offered you an eitheror
option. The good news is that, as usual, there is a third option.
The contradictory advice you find in business books and elsewhere usually relates to managing
employees—how to handle the human element. Herb tells you to give them a hug, Revson tells you to
kick them in the balls, and I tell you to solve the problem by eliminating it altogether: Remove the
human element.
Once you have a product that sells, it’s time to design a self-correcting business architecture that runs
itself.

RURAL PENNSYLVANIA
In a 200-year-old stone farmhouse, a quiet “experiment in 21st-century leadership” is proceeding
exactly as planned. 51 Stephen McDonnell is upstairs in his flip-flops looking at a spreadsheet on his
computer. His company has increased its annual revenue 30% per year since it all began, and he is able
to spend more time with his three daughters than he ever thought possible.
The experiment? As CEO of Applegate Farms, he insists on spending just one day per week at the
company headquarters in Bridgewater, New Jersey. He’s not the only CEO who spends time at home, of
course—there are hundreds who have heart attacks or nervous breakdowns and need time to recover—
but there is a huge difference. McDonnell has been doing it for more than 17 years. Rarer still, he started
doing it just six months after founding the company.
This intentional absence has enabled him to create a process-driven instead of founder-driven
business. Limiting contact with managers forces the entrepreneur to develop operational rules that enable
others to deal with problems themselves instead of calling for help.
This isn’t just for small operations. Applegate Farms sells more than 120 organic and natural meat
products to high-end retailers and generates more than $35 million in revenue per year.
It is all possible because McDonnell started with the end in mind.
Behind the Scenes: The Muse Architecture
Orders are nobody can see the Great Oz! Not nobody, not nohow!
—GUARDIAN OF THE EMERALD CITY GATES, The Wizard of Oz
Starting with the end in mind—an organizational map of what the eventual business will look like—is
not new.
Infamous deal-maker Wayne Huizenga copied the org chart of McDonald’s to turn Blockbuster into a
billion-dollar behemoth, and dozens of titans have done much the same. In our case, it’s the “end in
mind” that is different. Our goal isn’t to create a business that is as large as possible, but rather a
business that bothers us as little as possible. The architecture has to place us out of the information flow
instead of putting us at the top of it.
I didn’t get this right the first time I tried.
In 2003, I was interviewed in my home office for a documentary called As Seen on TV. We were
interrupted every 20–30 seconds with beeping e-mail notifications, IM pings, and ringing phones. I
couldn’t leave them unanswered, because dozens of decisions depended on me. If I didn’t ensure the
trains were running on time and put out the fires, no one would.
The Anatomy of Automation
THE 4-HOUR WORKWEEK VIRTUAL ARCHITECTURE
Splitting the Pie: Outsourcer Economics
Each outsourcer takes a piece of the revenue pie. Here is what the general profit-loss might look like
for a hypothetical $80 product sold via phone and developed with the help of an expert, who is paid a
royalty. I recommend calculating profit margins using higher-than-anticipated expenses. This will
account for unforeseen costs (read: screwups) and miscellaneous fees such as monthly reports, etc.
How do you factor in advertising cost? If a $1,000 ad or $1,000 in PPC produces 50 sales, my
advertising cost per order (CPO) is $20. This makes the actual‘ per-unit profit $40.94.
I set a new goal after that experience, and when I was interviewed six months later as a follow-up, one
change was more pronounced than all others: silence. I had redesigned the business from the ground up
so that I had no phone calls to answer and no e-mail to respond to.
I’m often asked how big my company is—how many people I employ full-time. The answer is one.
Most people lose interest at that point. If someone were to ask me how many people run Brain-
QUICKEN LLC, on the other hand, the answer is different: between 200 and 300. I am the ghost in the
machine. 52
From advertisements—print in this example—to a cash deposit in my bank account, the diagram is
what a simplified version of my architecture looks like, including some sample costs. If you have
developed a product based on the guidelines in the last two chapters, it will plug into this structure handin-glove.
Where am I in the diagram? Nowhere.
I am not a tollbooth through which anything needs to pass. I am more like a police officer on the side
of the road who can step in if need be, and I use detailed reports from outsourcers to ensure the cogs are
moving as intended. I check reports from fulfillment each Monday and monthly reports from the same
the first of each month. The latter reports include orders received from the call center, which I can
compare to the call center bills to gauge profit. Otherwise, I just check bank accounts online on the first
and fifteenth of each month to look for odd deductions. If I find something, one e-mail will fix it, and if
not, it’s back to kendo, painting, hiking, or whatever I happen to be doing at the time.
Removing Yourself from the Equation: When and How
The system is the solution.
—AT&T
The diagram should be your rough blueprint for designing a self-sustaining virtual architecture. There
could be differences—more or fewer elements—but the main principles are the same:
1. Contract outsourcing companies 53 that specialize in one function vs. freelancers whenever
possible so that if someone is fired, quits, or doesn’t perform, you can replace them without
interrupting your business. Hire trained groups of people who can provide detailed reporting and
replace one another as needed.
2. Ensure that all outsourcers are willing to communicate among themselves to solve problems, and
give them written permission to make most inexpensive decisions without consulting you first (I
started at less than $100 and moved to $400 after two months).
How do you get there? It helps to look at where entrepreneurs typically lose their momentum and stall
permanently.
Most entrepreneurs begin with the cheapest tools available, bootstrapping and doing things themselves
to get up and running with little cash. This isn’t the problem. In fact, it’s necessary so that the
entrepreneurs can train outsourcers later. The problem is that these same entrepreneurs don’t know when
and how to replace themselves or their homemade infrastructure with something more scalable.
By “scalable,” I mean a business architecture that can handle 10,000 orders per week as easily as it can
handle 10 orders per week. Doing this requires minimizing your decision-making responsibilities, which
achieves our goal of time freedom while setting the stage for doubling and tripling income with no
change in hours worked.
Call the companies at the end of the chapter to research costs. Plan and budget accordingly to upgrade
infrastructure at the following milestones, which I measure in units of product shipped:
Phase I: 0–50 Total Units of Product Shipped
Do it all yourself. Put your phone number on the site for both general questions and order-taking—this is
important in the beginning—and take customer calls to determine common questions that you will
answer later in an online FAQ. This FAQ will also be the main material for training phone operators and
developing sales scripts.
Is PPC, an offline advertisement, or your website too vague or misleading, thus attracting unqualified
and time-consuming consumers? If so, change them to answer common questions and make the product
benefits (including what it isn’t or doesn’t do) clearer.
Answer all e-mail and save your responses in one folder called “customer service questions.” CC
yourself on responses and put the nature of the customers’ questions in the subject lines for future
indexing. Personally pack and ship all product to determine the cheapest options for both. Investigate
opening a merchant account from your local small bank (easier to get than with a larger bank) for later
outsourced credit card processing at higher roll-out volumes.
Phase II: >10 Units Shipped Per Week
Add the extensive FAQ to your website and continue to add answers to common questions as received.
Find local fulfillment companies in the yellow pages under “fulfillment services” or “mailing services.”
If you cannot find one there or at www.mfsanet.org, call local printers and ask them for
recommendations. Narrow the field to those (often the smallest) who will agree not to charge you setup
fees and monthly minimums. If this isn’t possible, ask for at least 50% off both and then request that the
setup fee be applied as an advance against shipping or their other fees.
Limit the candidates further to those who can respond to order status e-mail (ideal) or phone calls
from customers. The e-mail from your “customer service” folder will be provided as copy-and-paste
responses, especially those related to order status and refund requests. 54
To lower or eliminate miscellaneous fees, explain that you are a start-up and that your budget is small.
Tell them you need the cash for advertising that will drive more shipments. If needed, mention the
competitive companies that you are considering and pit them against one another, using lower pricing or
concessions from one to get larger discounts and bonuses from the others.
Before making your final selection, ask for at least three client references and use the following to
elicit the negatives: “I understand they’re good, but everyone has weaknesses. If you had to point out
where you’ve had some issues and what they’re not the best at, what would you say? Can you please
describe an incident or a disagreement? I expect these with all companies, so it’s no big deal, and it’s
confidential, of course.”
Ask for “net-30 terms”—payment for services 30 days after they’re rendered—after one month of
prompt payment for their services. It is easier to negotiate all of the above points with smaller operations
that need the business. Have your contract manufacturer ship product directly to the fulfillment house
once you have decided on one and put the fulfillment house’s e-mail (you can use an e-mail address at
your domain and forward it) or phone number on the online “thank you” page for order status questions.
Phase III: >20 Units Shipped Per Week
Now you will have the cash flow to afford the setup fees and the monthly minimums that bigger, more
sophisticated outsourcers will ask for. Call the end-to-end fulfillment houses that handle it all—from
order status to returns and refunds. Interview them about costs and ask them for referrals to call centers
and credit card processors they’ve collaborated with for file transfers and problem solving. Don’t
assemble an architecture of strangers—there will be programming costs and mistakes, both of which are
expensive.
Set up an account with the credit card processor first, for which you will need your own merchant
account. This is critical, as the fulfillment house can only handle refunds and declined cards for
transactions they process themselves through an outsourced credit card processor.
Optionally, set up an account with one of the call centers your new fulfillment center recommends.
These will often have toll-free numbers you can use instead of purchasing your own. Look at the
percentage split of online to phone orders during testing and consider carefully if the extra revenue from
the latter is worth the hassle. It often isn’t. Those who call to order will generally order online if given no
other option.
Before signing on with a call center, get several 800 numbers they answer for current clients and make
test calls, asking difficult product-related questions and gauging sales abilities. Call each number at least
three times (morning, afternoon, and evening) and note the make-or-break factor: wait time. The phone
should be answered within three to four rings, and if you are put on hold, the shorter the wait the better.
More than 15 seconds will result in too many abandoned calls and waste advertising dollars.
The Art of Undecision: Fewer Options = More Revenue
Companies go out of business when they make the wrong decisions or, just as important, make
too many decisions. The latter creates complexity.
—MIKE MAPLES, cofounder of Motive Communications (IPO to $260 million market cap),
founding executive of Tivoli (sold to IBM for $750 million), and investor in companies such as
Digg.com
Joseph Sugarman is the marketing genius behind dozens of direct-response and retail successes,
including the BluBlocker sunglasses phenomenon. Prior to his string of home runs on television (he sold
20,000 pairs of BluBlockers within 15 minutes of his first QVC appearance), his domain was print media,
where he made millions and built an empire called JS&A Group. He was once recruited to design an
advertisement for a manufacturer’s watch line. The manufacturer wanted to feature nine different
watches in the ad, and Joe recommended featuring just one. The client insisted and Joe offered to do
both and test them in the same issue of The Wall Street Journal. The result? The one-watch offer outsold
the nine-watch offer 6-to-1. 55
Henry Ford once said, referring to his Model-T, the bestselling car of all time, 56 “The customer can
have any color he wants, so long as it’s black.” He understood something that businesspeople seem to
have forgotten: Serving the customer (“customer service”) is not becoming a personal concierge and
catering to their every whim and want. Customer service is providing an excellent product at an
acceptable price and solving legitimate problems (lost packages, replacements, refunds, etc.) in the fastest
manner possible. That’s it.
The more options you offer the customer, the more indecision you create and the fewer orders you
receive—it is a disservice all around. Furthermore, the more options you offer the customer, the more
manufacturing and customer service burden you create for yourself.
The art of “undecision” refers to minimizing the number of decisions your customers can or need to
make. Here are a few methods that I and other NR have used to reduce service overhead 20–80%:
1. Offer one or two purchase options (“basic” and “premium,” for example) and no more.
2. Do not offer multiple shipping options. Offer one fast method instead and charge a premium.
3. Do not offer overnight or expedited shipping (it is possible to refer them to a reseller who does, as
is true with all of these points), as these shipping methods will produce hundreds of anxious phone
calls.
4. Eliminate phone orders completely and direct all prospects to online ordering. This seems
outrageous until you realize that success stories like Amazon.com have depended on it as a
fundamental cost-saver to survive and thrive.
5. Do not offer international shipments. Spending 10 minutes per order filling out customs forms and
then dealing with customer complaints when the product costs 20–100% more with tariffs and
duties is about as fun as headbutting a curb. It’s about as profitable, too.
Some of these policies hint at what is perhaps the biggest time-saver of all: customer filtering.
Not All Customers Are Created Equal
Once you reach Phase III and have some cash flow, it’s time to re-evaluate your customers and thin
the herd. There are good and bad versions of all things: good food, bad food; good movies, bad movies;
good sex, bad sex; and, yes, good customers and bad customers.
Decide now to do business with the former and avoid the latter. I recommend looking at the customer
as an equal trading partner and not as an infallible blessing of a human being to be pleased at all costs. If
you offer an excellent product at an acceptable price, it is an equal trade and not a begging session
between subordinate (you) and superior (customer). Be professional but never kowtow to unreasonable
people.
Instead of dealing with problem customers, I recommend you prevent them from ordering in the first
place.
I know dozens of NR who don’t accept Western Union or checks as payment. Some would respond to
this with, “You’re giving up 10–15% of your sales!” The NR, in turn, would say, “I am, but I’m also
avoiding the 10–15% of the customers who create 40% of the expenses and eat 40% of my time.” It’s
classic 80/20.
Those who spend the least and ask for the most before ordering will do the same after the sale. Cutting
them out is both a good lifestyle decision and a good financial decision. Low-profit and highmaintenance
customers like to call operators and spend up to 30 minutes on the phone asking questions
that are unimportant or answered online, costing—in my case—$24.90 (30 x $0.83) per 30-minute
incident, eliminating the minuscule profit they contribute in the first place.
Those who spend the most complain the least. In addition to our premium $50–200 pricing, here are a
few additional policies that attract the high-profit and low-maintenance customers we want:
1. Do not accept payment via Western Union, checks, or money order.
2. Raise wholesale minimums to 12–100 units and require a tax ID number to qualify resellers who
are real businesspeople and not time-intensive novices. Don’t run a personal business school.
3. Refer all potential resellers to an online order form that must be printed, filled out, and faxed in.
Never negotiate pricing or approve lower pricing for higher-volume orders. Cite “company policy”
due to having had problems in the past.
4. Offer low-priced products (à la MRI’s NO2 book) instead of free products to capture contact
information for follow-up sales. Offering something for free is the best way to attract time-eaters
and spend money on those unwilling to return the favor.
5. Offer a lose-win guarantee (see boxed text) instead of free trials.
6. Do not accept orders from common mail fraud countries such as Nigeria.
Make your customer base an exclusive club, and treat the members well once they’ve been accepted.
The Lose-Win Guarantee—How to Sell Anything to Anyone
If you want a guarantee, buy a toaster.
—CLINT EASTWOOD
The 30-day money-back guarantee is dead. It just doesn’t have the pizzazz it once did. If a product
doesn’t work, I’ve been lied to and will have to spend an afternoon at the post office to return it. This
costs me more than just the price I paid for the product, both in time and actual postage. Risk elimination
just isn’t enough.
This is where we enter the neglected realm of lose-win guarantees and risk reversal. The NR use what
most consider an afterthought—the guarantee—as a cornerstone sales tool.
The NR aim to make it profitable for the customer even if the product fails. Lose-win guarantees not
only remove risk for the consumer but put the company at financial risk.
Here are a few examples of putting your money where your mouth is.
Delivered in 30 minutes or less or it’s free!
(Domino’s Pizza built its business on this guarantee.)
We’re so confident you’ll like CIALIS, if you don’t we’ll pay for the brand of your choice.
(The “CIALIS® Promise Program” offers a free sample of CIALIS and then offers to pay for
competing products if CIALIS doesn’t live up to the hype.)
If your car is stolen, we’ll pay $500 of your insurance deductible.
(This guarantee helped THE CLUB become the #1-selling mechanical automobile anti-theft device in
the world.)
110% guaranteed to work within 60 minutes of the first dose.
(This was for BodyQUICK and a first among sports nutrition products. I offered to not only refund
customers the price of the product if it didn’t work within 60 minutes of the first dose, but also to send
them a check for 10% more.)
The lose-win guarantee might seem like a big risk, especially when someone can abuse it for profit like
in the BodyQUICK example, but it isn’t … if your product delivers. Most people are honest.
Let’s look at some actual numbers.
Returns for BodyQUICK, even with a 60-day return period (and partially because of it 57 ), are less
than 3% in an industry in which the average is 12–15% for a normal 30-day 100% money-back
guarantee. Sales increased more than 300% within four weeks of introducing the 110% guarantee, and
returns decreased overall.
Johanna adopted this lose-win offer and came up with “Increase sport-specific flexibility 40% in two
weeks or return it for a full refund (including shipping) and keep the 20-minute bonus DVD as our gift.”
Sherwood found his guarantee as well: “If these shirts are not the most comfortable you’ve ever worn,
return them and get 2-times your purchase price back. Each shirt is also guaranteed for life—if it gets
threadbare, send it back and we’ll replace it free of charge.”
Both of them increased sales more than 200% in the first two months. Return percentage remained the
same for Johanna and increased 50% for Sherwood, from 2 to 3%. Disaster? Far from it. Instead of
selling 50 and getting one back with a 100% guarantee [(50 x $100) – $100 = $4,900 in revenue], he sold
200 and got six back with the 200% guarantee [(200 x $100) – (6 x $200) = $18,800 in revenue]. I’ll take
the latter.
Lose-win is the new win-win. Stand out and reap the rewards.
Little Blue Chip: How to Look Fortune 500 in 45 Minutes
Are you tired of sand being kicked in your face? I promise you new muscles in days!
—CHARLES ATLAS, strongman who sold more than $30 million worth of “dynamic-tension”
muscle courses through comic books
If approaching large resellers or potential partners, small company size will be an obstacle. This
discrimination is often as insurmountable as it is unfounded. Fortunately, a few simple steps can
dramatically upgrade your budding Fortune 500 image and take your muse from coffee shop to
boardroom in 45 minutes or less.
1. Don’t be the CEO or founder.
Being the “CEO” or “Founder” screams start-up. Give yourself the mid-level title of “vice president”
(VP), “director,” or something similar that can be added to depending on the occasion (Director of
Sales, Director of Business Development, etc.). For negotiation purposes as well, remember that it is
best not to appear to be the ultimate decision-maker.
2. Put multiple e-mail and phone contacts on the website.
Put various e-mail addresses on the “contact us” page for different departments, such as “human
resources,” “sales,” “general inquiries,” “wholesale distribution,” “media/PR,” “investors,” “web
comments,” “order status,” and so on. In the beginning, these will all forward to your e-mail address.
In Phase III, most will forward to the appropriate outsourcers. Multiple toll-free numbers can be used
in the same fashion.
3. Set up an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) remote receptionist.
It is possible to sound like a blue chip for less than $30. In fewer than ten minutes on a site such as
www.angel.com, which boasts clients such as Reebok and Kellog’s, it is possible to set up an 800
number that greets callers with a voice prompt such as, “Thank you for calling [business name].
Please say the name of the person or department you would like to reach or just hold on for a list of
options.”
Upon speaking your name or selecting the appropriate department, the caller is forwarded to your
preferred phone or the appropriate outsourcer—with on-hold music and all.
4. Do not provide home addresses.
Do not use your home address or you will get visitors. Prior to securing an end-to-end fulfillment
house that can handle checks and money orders—if you decide to accept them—use a post office box
but leave out the “PO Box” and include the street address of the post office itself. Thus “PO Box 555,
Nowhere, US 11936” becomes “Suite 555, 1234 Downtown Ave., US 11936.”
Go forth and project professionalism with a well-designed image. Perceived size does matter.
COMFORT CHALLENGE
Relax in Public (2 days)
This is the last Comfort Challenge, placed prior to the chapter that tackles the most uncomfortable
turning point for most office dwellers: negotiating remote work agreements. This challenge is intended to
be fun while showing—in no uncertain terms—that the rules most follow are nothing more than social
conventions. There are no legal boundaries stopping you from creating an ideal life … or just being selfentertained
and causing mass confusion.
So, relaxing in public. Sounds easy, right? I’m somewhat famous for relaxing in style to get a laugh
out of friends. Here is the deal, and I don’t care if you’re male or female, 20 or 60, Mongolian or
Martian. I call the following a “time-out.”
Once per day for two days, simply lie down in the middle of a crowded public place at some point.
Lunchtime is ideal. It can be a well-trafficked sidewalk, the middle of a popular Starbucks, or a popular
bar. There is no real technique involved. Just lie down and remain silent on the ground for about ten
seconds, and then get up and continue on with whatever you were doing before. I used to do this at
nightclubs to clear space for break-dancing circles. No one responded to pleading, but going catatonic on
the ground did the trick.
Don’t explain it at all. If someone asks about it after the fact (he or she will be too confused to ask you
while you’re doing it for 10 seconds), just respond, “I just felt like lying down for a second.” The less
you say, the funnier and more gratifying this will be. Do it on solo missions for the first two days, and
then feel free to do it when with a group of friends. It’s a riot.
It isn’t enough to think outside the box. Thinking is passive. Get used to acting outside the box.

Call Centers (per-minute and/or per-sale fees)
There are generally two classes of call centers: order takers and commissioned reps. Interview each
provider you consider to understand the options and costs involved.
The former is a good option if you give the product price in an advertisement (hard offer), are offering
free information (lead generation), or don’t need trained salespeople who can overcome objections. In
other words, your ad or website is pre-qualifying prospects.
The latter would more appropriately be called “sales centers.” Operators are commissioned and trained
“closers” whose sole goal is to convert callers to buyers. These calls are often in response to “call for
information/ trial/sample” ads that don’t feature a price (soft offers). Expect higher costs per sale.
LiveOps ( www.liveops.com )
Pioneer in home-based reps, which often ensures more calls are answered. Provides comprehensive
service with agents, IVR, and Spanish. Often used for one-step order taking instead of soft offers.

LIFESTYLE DESIGN IN ACTION
After I read the section on outsourcing, I thought it sounded like a novel idea but would never work for
me. However, since the rest of the book was “spot on,” I decided to try it. Rather than ship my money
overseas, I opted to keep it in the U.S. and use my niece in college, with skills on computers I can’t even
fathom, to test the theory. Turns out it has been a great experience and timesaver for me, as well as
moneymaker for her. It seems I have all of the positives of out sourcing but none of the hassles of
language and such…. Being able to mold a young mind for the better ties in well with the rest of your
book …

Hey Tim, You mentioned www.weebly.com a few months ago, and I’ve been using that to build all
my muse sites and think it’s great! Also, Facebook groups has (almost) every niche imaginable. So what
I have found success in doing is: (1) Finding a niche group that would buy my muse, (2) sending a
message to each admin telling them how my muse will help their group members. Then politely asking
them to put a blurb in the “Recent News” section of the group. This makes it more trustworthy than a
wall post, and it stays up there (free advertising) until the admin removes it. One hundred times better
than a wall post. In one case, the admin purchased my muse, posted my note for me on the groups’
“Recent News” section, then e-mailed the entire group telling them they have to check out my site.

HOW TO ESCAPE THE OFFICE

—ST. JEAN–BAPTISTE–MARIE VIANNEY, Catholic saint, “Curé d’Ars”
PALO ALTO , CALIFORNIA
“We’re not going to expense the phone.”
“I’m not asking you to.”
Silence. Then a nod, a laugh, and a crooked smile of resignation.
“OK, then—it’s fine.”
And that was that, lickity-split. Forty-four-year old Dave Camarillo, lifelong employee, had cracked
the code and started his second life.
He hadn’t been fired; he hadn’t been yelled at. His boss seemed to be handling the whole situation
quite well. Granted, Dave delivered the goods on the job, and it wasn’t like he was doing naked snow
angels in client meetings, but still—he had just spent 30 days in China without telling anyone.
“It wasn’t half as hard as I thought it would be.”
Dave works among more than 10,000 employees at Hewlett- Packard (HP), and—against all odds—he
actually likes it. He has no desire to start his own company and has spent the last seven years doing tech
support for customers in 45 states and 22 countries. Six months ago, however, he had a small problem.
She measured 5′2″ and weighed 110 pounds.
Was he, like most men, afraid of commitment, unwilling to stop running around the house in Spider-
Man underoos, or inseparable from the last refuge of any self-respecting man, the PlayStation? No, he
was past all that. In fact, Dave was locked and loaded, ready to pop the big question, but he was short on
vacation days and his girlfriend lived out of town. Waaaaay out of town—5,913 miles out of town.
He had met her on a client visit to Shenzhen, China, and it was now time to meet the parents, logistics
be damned.
Dave had only recently begun to take tech calls at home, and, well, isn’t home where the heart is? One
plane ticket and one T-Mobile GSM tri-band phone later, he was somewhere over the Pacific en route to
his first seven-day experiment. Twelve time zones hence, he proposed, she accepted, and no one was the
wiser stateside.
The second field trip was a 30-day tour of Chinese family and food (pig face, anyone?), ending with
Shumei Wu becoming Shumei Camarillo. Back in Palo Alto, HP continued its quest for world
domination, neither knowing nor caring where Dave was. He had his calls forwarded to his newly
begotten wife’s cell phone and all was right in the world.
Now back in the U.S. after hoping for the best and preparing for the worst, Dave had earned his Eagle
Scout mobility badge. The future looks flexible, indeed. He is going to start by spending two months in
China every summer and then move to Australia and Europe to make up for lost time, all with the full
support of his boss.
The key to cutting the leash was simple—he asked for forgiveness instead of permission.
“I didn’t travel for 30 years of my life—so why not?”
THAT’S PRECISELY THE question everyone should be asking—why the hell not?
From Caste to Castaway
The old rich, the upper class of yore with castles and ascots and irritating little lapdogs, are
characterized as being well-established in one place. The Schwarzes of Nantucket and the McDonnells
of Charlottesville. Blech. Summers in the Hamptons is sooooo 1990s.
The guard is changing. Being bound to one place will be the new defining feature of middle class. The
New Rich are defined by a more elusive power than simple cash—unrestricted mobility. This jet-setting
is not limited to start-up owners or freelancers. Employees can pull it off, too. 58
Not only can they pull it off, but more and more companies want them to pull it off. BestBuy, the
consumer electronics giant, is now sending thousands of employees home from their HQ in Minnesota
and claims not only lowered costs, but also a 10–20% increase in results. The new mantra is this: Work
wherever and whenever you want, but get your work done.
In Japan, a three-piece zombie who joins the 9–5 grind each morning is called a sarari-man
—salaryman—and, in the last few years, a new verb has emerged: datsu-sara suru, to escape (datsu) the
salaryman (sara) lifestyle.
It’s your turn to learn the datsu-sara dance. 59
Trading Bosses for Beer: An Oktoberfest Case Study
To create the proper leverage to be unshackled, we’ll do two things: demonstrate the business benefit
of remote working and make it too expensive or excruciating to refuse a request for it.
Remember Sherwood?
His French shirts are beginning to move and he is itching to ditch the U.S. for a global walkabout. He
has more than enough cash now but needs to escape constant supervision in the office before he can
implement all the timesaving tools from Elimination and travel.
He is a mechanical engineer and is producing twice as many designs in half the time since erasing
90% of his time-wasters and interruptions. This quantum leap in performance has been noticed by his
supervisors and his value to the company has increased, making it more expensive to lose him. More
value means more leverage for negotiations. Sherwood has been sure to hold back some of his
productivity and efficiency so that he can highlight a sudden jump in both during a remote work trial
period.
Since eliminating most of his meetings and in-person discussions, he has naturally moved about 80%
of all communication with his boss and colleagues to e-mail and the remaining 20% to phone. Not only
this, but he has used tips from chapter 7, “Interrupting Interruption and the Art of Refusal,” to cut
unimportant and repetitive e-mail volume in half. This will make the move to remote less noticeable, if at
all noticeable, from a managerial standpoint. Sherwood is running at full speed with less and less
supervision.
Sherwood implements his escape in five steps, beginning on July 12 during the slow business season
and lasting two months, ending with a trip to Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany, for two weeks as a final
test before bigger and bolder vagabonding plans.
Step 1: Increase Investment
First, he speaks with his boss on July 12 about additional training that might be available to employees.
He proposes having the company pay for a four-week industrial design class to help him better interface
with clients, being sure to mention the benefit to the boss and business (i.e., he’ll decrease
intradepartmental back-and-forth and increase both client results and billable time). Sherwood wants the
company to invest as much as possible in him so that the loss is greater if he quits.
Step 2: Prove Increased Output Offsite
Second, he calls in sick the next Tuesday and Wednesday, July 18 and 19, to showcase his remote
working productivity. 60 He decides to call in sick between Tuesday and Thursday for two reasons: It
looks less like a lie for a three-day weekend and it also enables him to see how well he functions in
social isolation without the imminent reprieve of the weekend. He ensures that he doubles his work
output on both days, leaves an e-mail trail of some sort for his boss to notice, and keeps quantifiable
records of what he accomplished for reference during later negotiations. Since he uses expensive CAD
software that is only licensed on his office desktop, Sherwood installs a free trial of GoToMyPC remote
access software so that he can pilot his office computer from home.
Step 3: Prepare the Quantifiable Business Benefit
Third, Sherwood creates a bullet-point list of how much more he achieved outside the office with
explanations. He realizes that he needs to present remote working as a good business decision and not a
personal perk. The quantifiable end result was three more designs per day than his usual average and
three total hours of additional billable client time. For explanations, he identifies removal of commute
and fewer distractions from office noise.
Step 4: Propose a Revocable Trial Period
Fourth, fresh off completing the comfort challenges from previous chapters, Sherwood confidently
proposes an innocent one-day-per-week remote work trial period for two weeks. He plans a script in
advance but does not make it a PowerPoint presentation or otherwise give it the appearance of something
serious or irreversible. 61
Sherwood knocks on his boss’s office door around 3 P.M. on a relatively relaxed Thursday, July 27,
the week after his absence, and his script looks like the following. Stock phrases are underlined and
footnotes explain negotiating points.
Sherwood: Hi, Bill. Do you have a quick second?
Bill: Sure. What’s up?
Sherwood: I just wanted to bounce an idea off of you that’s been on my mind. Two minutes should be
plenty.
Bill: OK. Shoot.
Sherwood: Last week, as you know, I was sick. Long story short, I decided to work at home despite
feeling terrible. So here’s the funny part. I thought I would get nothing done, but ended up finishing three
more designs than usual on both days. Plus, I put in three more billable hours than usual without the
commute, office noise, distractions, etc. OK, so here’s where I’m going. Just as a trial, I’d like to
propose working from home Mondays and Tuesdays for just two weeks. You can veto it whenever you
want, and I’ll come in if we need to do meetings, but I’d like to try it for just two weeks and review the
results. I’m 100% confident that I’ll get twice as much done. Does that seem reasonable?
Bill: Hmm … What if we need to share client designs?
Sherwood: There’s a program called GoToMyPC that I used to access the office computer when I was
sick. I can view everything remotely, and I’ll have my cell phone on me 24/7. Sooooo … What do you
think? Test it out starting next Monday and see how much more I get done? 62
Bill: Ummm … OK, fine. But it’s just a test. I have a meeting in five and have to run, but let’s talk
soon.
Sherwood: Great. Thanks for the time. I’ll keep you posted on it all. I’m sure you’ll be pleasantly
surprised.
Sherwood didn’t expect to get two days per week approved. He asked for two so that, in the case his
boss refused, he could ask for just one as a fallback position (bracketing). Why didn’t Sherwood go for
five days remote per week? Two reasons. First, it’s a lot for management to accept off the bat. We need
to ask for an inch and turn it into a foot without setting off panic alarms. Second, it is a good idea to
hone your remote-working abilities—rehearse a bit—before shooting for the big time, as it decreases the
likelihood of crises and screwups that will get remote rights revoked.
Step 5: Expand Remote Time
Sherwood ensures that his days outside of the office are his most productive to date, even minimally
dropping in-office production to heighten the contrast. He sets a meeting to discuss the results with his
boss on August 15 and prepares a bullet-point page detailing increased results and items completed
compared to in-office time. He suggests upping the ante to four days per week remote for a two-week
trial, fully prepared to concede to three days if need be.
Sherwood: It really turned out even better than I expected. If you look at the numbers, it makes a lot of
business sense, and I’m enjoying work a lot more now. So, here we are. I’d like to suggest, if you think it
makes sense, that I try four days a week for another two-week trial. I was thinking that coming in
Friday 63 would make sense to prepare for the coming week, but we could do whichever day you prefer.
Bill: Sherwood, I’m really not sure we can do that.
Sherwood: What’s your main concern? 64
Bill: It seems like you’re on your way out. I mean, are you going to quit on us? Second, what if everyone
wants to do the same?
Sherwood: Fair enough. Good points. 65 First, to be honest, I was close to quitting before, with all the
interruptions and commute and whatnot, but I’m actually feeling great now with the change in routine. 66
I’m doing more and feel relaxed for a change. Second, no one should be allowed to work remotely unless
they can show increased productivity, and I’m the perfect experiment. If they can show it, however, why
not let them do it on a trial basis? It lowers costs for the office, increases productivity, and makes
employees happier. So, what do you say? Can I test it out for two weeks and come in Fridays to take care
of the office stuff? I’ll still document everything, and you, of course, have the right to change your mind
at any point.
Bill: Man, you are an insistent one. OK, we’ll give it a shot, but don’t go blabbing about it.
Sherwood: Of course. Thanks, Bill. I appreciate the trust. Talk to you soon.
Sherwood continues to be productive at home and maintains his lower in-office performance. He
reviews the results with his boss after two weeks and continues with four remote days per week for an
additional two weeks until Tuesday, September 19, when he requests a full-time remote trial of two
weeks while he is visiting relatives out of state. 67 Sherwood’s team is in the middle of a project that
requires his expertise, and he is prepared to quit if his boss refuses. He realizes that, just as you want to
negotiate ad pricing close to deadlines, getting what you want often depends more on when you ask for it
than how you ask for it. Though he would prefer not to quit, his income from shirts is more than enough
to fund his dream-lines of Oktoberfest and beyond.
His boss acquiesces and Sherwood doesn’t have to use his threat of quitting. He goes home that
evening and buys a $524 round-trip ticket, less than one week’s shirt sales, to Munich for Oktoberfest.
Now he can implement all the time-savers possible and hack out the inessentials. Somewhere between
drinking wheat beer and dancing in lederhosen, Sherwood will get his work done in fine form, leaving
his company better off than prior to 80/20 and leaving himself all the time in the world.
But hold on a second … What if your boss still refuses? Hmm … Then they force your hand. If upper
management won’t see the light, you’ll just have to use the next chapter to fire their asses.
An Alternative: The Hourglass Approach
It can be effective to take a longer period of absence up front in what some NR have termed the
“hourglass” approach, so named because you use a long proof-of-concept up front to get a short remote
agreement and then negotiate back up to full-time out of the office. Here’s what it looks like.
1. Use a preplanned project or emergency (family issue, personal issue, relocation, home repairs,
whatever) that requires you to take one or two weeks out of the office.
2. Say that you recognize you can’t just stop working and that you would prefer to work instead of
taking vacation days.
3. Propose how you can work remotely and offer, if necessary, to take a pay cut for that period (and
that period only) if performance isn’t up to par upon returning.
4. Allow the boss to collaborate on how to do it so that he or she is invested in the process.
5. Make the two weeks “off” the most productive period you’ve ever had at work.
6. Show your boss the quantifiable results upon returning, and tell him or her that—without all the
distractions, commute, etc.—you can get twice as much done. Suggest two or three days at home
per week as a trial for two weeks.
7. Make those remote days ultraproductive.
8. Suggest only one or two days in the office per week.
9. Make those days the least productive of the week.
10. Suggest complete mobility—the boss will go for it.
Q&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS
Recently, I was asked if I was going to fire an employee who made a mistake that cost the
company $600,000. No, I replied, I just spent $600,000 training him.
—THOMAS J. WATSON, founder of IBM
Liberty means responsibility. That is why most men dread it.
—GEORGE BERNARD SHAW
While entrepreneurs have the most trouble with Automation, since they fear giving up control,
employees get stuck on Liberation because they fear taking control. Resolve to grab the reins—the rest
of your life depends on it.
The following questions and actions will help you to replace presence-based work with performancebased
freedom.
1. If you had a heart attack, and assuming your boss were sympathetic, how could you work
remotely for four weeks?
If you hit a brick wall with a task that doesn’t seem remote-compatible or if you predict resistance
from your boss, ask the following:
What are you accomplishing with this task—what is the
purpose?
If you had to find other ways to accomplish the same—if your
life depended on it—how would you do it? Remote
conferencing? Video conferencing? GoToMeeting,
GoToMyPC, DimDim.com (Mac), or related services?
Why would your boss resist remote work? What is the
immediate negative effect it would have on the company and
what could you do to prevent or minimize it?
2. Put yourself in your boss’s shoes. Based on your work history, would you trust yourself to
work outside of the office?
If you wouldn’t, reread Elimination to improve production and consider the hourglass option.
3. Practice environment-free productivity.
Attempt to work for two to three hours in a café for two Saturdays prior to proposing a remote
trial. If you exercise in a gym, attempt to exercise for those two weeks at home or otherwise
outside of the gym environment. The purpose here is to separate your activities from a single
environment and ensure that you have the discipline to work solo.
4. Quantify current productivity.
If you have applied the 80/20 Principle, set the rules of interrupting interruption, and completed
related groundwork, your performance should be at an all-time high in quantifiable terms, whether
customers served, revenue generated, pages produced, speed of accounts receivable, or otherwise.
Document this.
5. Create an opportunity to demonstrate remote work productivity before asking for it as a
policy.
This is to test your ability to work outside of an office environment and rack up some proof that
you can kick ass without constant supervision.
6. Practice the art of getting past “no” before proposing.
Go to farmers’ markets to negotiate prices, ask for free first-class upgrades, ask for compensation
if you encounter poor service in restaurants, and otherwise ask for the world and practice using the
following magic questions when people refuse to give it to you.
“What would I need to do to [desired outcome]?”
“Under what circumstances would you [desired outcome]?”
“Have you ever made an exception?”
“I’m sure you’ve made an exception before, haven’t you?”
(If no for either of the last two, ask, “Why not?” If yes, ask, “Why?”)
7. Put your employer on remote training wheels—propose Monday or Friday at home.
Consider doing this, or the following step, during a period when it would be too disruptive to fire
you, even if you were marginally less productive while remote.
If your employer refuses, it’s time to get a new boss or become an entrepreneur. The job will
never give you the requisite time freedom. If you decide to jump ship, consider letting them make
you walk the plank—quitting is often less appealing than tactfully getting fired and using
severance or unemployment to take a long vacation.
8. Extend each successful trial period until you reach full-time or your desired level of mobility.
Don’t underestimate how much your company needs you. Perform well and ask for what you want.
If you don’t get it over time, leave. It’s too big a world to spend most of life in a cubicle.
LIFESTYLE DESIGN IN ACTION
Consider trying Earth Class Mail, a service that you can reroute all your mail to, at which point they
scan and e-mail you everything that comes in, giving you the option of recycling/shredding junk, getting
a scan of the contents, or having specific items forwarded to you or someone you designate. I have not
personally used it yet (will be testing it out this month in preparation for an upcoming trip in May), but a
friend and author in Portland swears by them and knows the CEO. Seems they’ve gotten good press and
the idea seems far better than relying on friends/family who, if they’re anything like my friends/family …
will surely drop the ball at some point:-).
—NATHALIE
I also use GreenByPhone.com to process checks electronically that come in through my Earth Class
Mail account—they charge $5 a check, but I live in San Diego, my Earth Class Mail office address is in
Seattle, and I bank in Ohio. It works great!
—ANDREW
To add to your excellent list (we’ve traveled just like that for several years SWEET!), I’d like to add
my modifications as a female traveler and a new mom (16-month-old baby). Personal favorites: (1)
Athleta carries excellent, light, quick-dry clothing that hold up well to sports but still look very
fashionable. Skorts are a must for looking feminine but being fully covered for hiking and steep pyramid
steps—you know what I mean, ladies! Just a note, a slightly longer length will serve you well in a lot of
countries, as well as tankini tops and swim skirts for swimming. (2) Fresh & Go toothbrush is simple to
use. (3) Marsona sound machine for drowning out unfamiliar noises is a must (regularly use with baby at
home too so when they hear the sound they know it’s sleep time!). This has been a lifesaver for us on
many trips, and we now use it regularly at home for better sleep. No more changing hotels midtrip to
avoid noise. AND, I know we have to travel light, but with baby a lot of things are nonnegotiable. These
make for smoother sailing: (1) Peanut shell sling in black fleece—it’s more comfy than the cotton and
you can pop baby in and out wherever you are, from birth to 35 lbs. I never take mine off, it’s part of my
outfit; (2) Peapod plus portable tent—this is baby’s main bed at home and travel so baby has the same
sleep place everywhere we go, and the flaps give all travel parties privacy—great from small babies to
five-year-olds. I can still jam this onto a little wheeled carry-on and pack mine and baby’s minimal
clothing around it; (3) Go Go Kidz TravelMate (great for wheeling car seat up to the gate for gate check
or use on plane); (4) Britax Diplomat car seat is small but kids can use it from birth to approx. four years
old.
Make sure the wheeled carry-on bag you get is one size smaller than the allowed carry-on size so you
don’t get bumped to check the bag in if the plane is full. You can always nicely argue/reason/bat your
eyelashes that you will put the bag in your foot space. Also, very helpful to give baby something to sip
or munch on during take off and landing so yours isn’t the baby screaming from ear pain. Happy travels!

PRE-EMPTING THE BOSS: COMMON CONCERNS ABOUT REMOTE WORK
In the linked article, Cisco acknowledges that remote work arrangements are “here to stay” yet lists a
set of security issues. It makes sense to preemptively research solutions so that you are armed and ready
if your employer raises these concerns. http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/2008/prod_020508.html.

58. If you’re an entrepreneur, don’t skip this chapter. This introduction to remote working tools and
tactics is integral to the international pieces of the puzzle that follow.
59. This verb is used by Japanese women as well, even though female workers are referred to as
“OL”—office ladies.
60. Any reason to be home will do (cable or phone installation, home repairs, etc.) or, if you prefer
not to use a ruse, work a weekend or take two vacation days.
61. Review the Puppy Dog Close from “Income Autopilot II: Testing the Muse.”
62. Do not digress from your goal. Once you’ve addressed an objection or concern, go for the close.
63. Friday is the best day to be in the office. People are relaxed and tend to leave early.
64. Do not accept a vague refusal. Pinpointing the main concern in detail enables you to overcome it.
65. Don’t jump to the defensive after an objection. Acknowledge the validity of a boss’s concerns to
prevent an ego-driven battle of wills.
66. Note this indirect threat dressed as a confession. It will make the boss think twice about refusing
but prevents the win-lose outcome of an ultimatum.
67. This removes the boss’s ability to call you to the office. This is critical for making the first jump
overseas.
Beyond Repair
KILLING YOUR JOB
All courses of action are risky, so prudence is not in avoiding danger (it’s impossible), but
calculating risk and acting decisively. Make mistakes of ambition and not mistakes of sloth.
Develop the strength to do bold things, not the strength to suffer.
—NICCOLÒ MACHIAVELLI, The Prince
Existential Pleas and Resignations Mad Libs
BY ED MURRAY

Some jobs are simply beyond repair.
Improvements would be like adding a set of designer curtains to a jail cell: better but far from good. In
the context of this chapter, “job” will refer to both a company if you run one and a normal job if you
have one. Some recommendations are limited to one of the two but most are relevant to both. So we
begin.
I have quit three jobs and been fired from most of the rest. Getting fired, despite sometimes coming as
a surprise and leaving you scrambling to recover, is often a godsend: Someone else makes the decision
for you, and it’s impossible to sit in the wrong job for the rest of your life. Most people aren’t lucky
enough to get fired and die a slow spiritual death over 30–40 years of tolerating the mediocre.
Pride and Punishment
If you must play, decide on three things at the start: the rules of the game, the stakes, and the
quitting time.
—CHINESE PROVERB
Just because something has been a lot of work or consumed a lot of time doesn’t make it productive or
worthwhile.
Just because you are embarrassed to admit that you’re still living the consequences of bad decisions
made 5, 10, or 20 years ago shouldn’t stop you from making good decisions now. If you let pride stop
you, you will hate life 5, 10, and 20 years from now for the same reasons. I hate to be wrong and sat in a
dead-end trajectory with my own company until I was forced to change directions or face total
breakdown—I know how hard it is.
Now that we’re all on a level playing field: Pride is stupid.
Being able to quit things that don’t work is integral to being a winner. Going into a project or job
without defining when worthwhile becomes wasteful is like going into a casino without a cap on what
you will gamble: dangerous and foolish.
“But, you don’t understand my situation. It’s complicated!” But is it really? Don’t confuse the
complex with the difficult. Most situations are simple—many are just emotionally difficult to act upon.
The problem and the solution are usually obvious and simple. It’s not that you don’t know what to do. Of
course you do. You are just terrified that you might end up worse off than you are now.
I’ll tell you right now: If you’re at this point, you won’t be worse off. Revisit fear-setting and cut the
cord.
Like Pulling Off a Band-Aid: It’s Easier and Less Painful Than
You Think
The average man is a conformist, accepting miseries and disasters with the stoicism of a cow
standing in the rain.
—COLIN WILSON, British author of The Outsider; New Existentialist
There are several principal phobias that keep people on sinking ships, and there are simple rebuttals
for all of them.
1. Quitting is permanent.
Far from it. Use the Q&A questions in this chapter and chapter 3 (Fear-setting) to examine how you
could pick up your chosen career track or start another company at a later point. I have never seen an
example where a change of direction wasn’t somehow reversible.
2. I won’t be able to pay the bills.
Sure you will. First of all, the objective will be to have a new job or source of cash flow before quitting
your current job. Problem solved.
If you jump ship or get fired, it isn’t hard to eliminate most expenses temporarily and live on savings
for a brief period. From renting out your home to refinancing or selling it, there are options. There are
always options.
It might be emotionally difficult, but you won’t starve. Park your car in the garage and cancel
insurance for a few months. Carpool or take the bus until you find the next gig. Rack up some more
credit card debt and cook instead of eating out. Sell all the crap that you spent hundreds or thousands on
and never use.
Take a full inventory of your assets, cash reserves, debts, and monthly expenses. How long could you
survive with your current resources or if you sold some assets?
Go through all expenses and ask yourself, If I had to eliminate this because I needed an extra kidney,
how would I do it? Don’t be melodramatic when there is no need—few things are fatal, particularly for
smart people. If you’ve made it this far in life, losing or dropping a job will often be little more than a
few weeks of vacation (unless you want more) prior to something better.
3. Health insurance and retirement accounts disappear if I quit.
Untrue.
I was scared of both when I was eliminated from TrueSAN. I had visions of rotting teeth and working
at Wal-Mart to survive.
Upon looking at the facts and exploring options, I realized that I could have identical medical and
dental coverage—the same provider and network—for $300–500 per month. To transfer my 401(k) to
another company (I chose Fidelity Investments) was even easier: It took less than 30 minutes via phone
and cost nothing.
Covering both of these bases takes less time than getting a customer service rep on the phone to fix
your electric bill.
4. It will ruin my resume.
I love creative nonfiction.
It is not at all difficult to sweep gaps under the rug and make uncommon items the very things that get
job interviews. How? Do something interesting and make them jealous. If you quit and then sit on your
ass, I wouldn’t hire you either.
On the other hand, if you have a one-to-two-year world circumnavigation on your resume or training
with professional soccer teams in Europe to your credit, two interesting things happen upon returning to
the working world. First, you will get more interviews because you will stand out. Second, interviewers
bored in their own jobs will spend the entire meeting asking how you did it!
If there is any question of why you took a break or left your previous job, there is one answer that
cannot be countered: “I had a once-in-a-lifetime chance to do [exotic and envy-producing experience]
and couldn’t turn it down. I figured that, with [20–40] years of work to go, what’s the rush?”
The Cheesecake Factor
Would you like me to give you a formula for success? It’s quite simple, really. Double your rate of
failure.
—THOMAS J. WATSON, founder of IBM
SUMMER 1999
Even before I tasted it, I knew something wasn’t quite right. After eight hours in the refrigerator, this
cheesecake still hadn’t set at all. It swished in the gallon bowl like a viscous soup, chunks shifting and
bobbing as I tilted it under close inspection. Somewhere a mistake had been made. It could have been
any number of things:
Three 1 lb. sticks of Philly Cream Cheese
Eggs
Stevia
Unflavored gelatin
Vanilla
Sour cream
In this case, it was probably a combination of things and the lack of a few simple ingredients that
generally make cheesecake a form of cake.
I was on a no-carbohydrate diet, and I had used this recipe before. It had been so delicious that my
roommates wanted their fair share and insisted on an attempt at bulk production. Hence began the
mathematical shenanigans and problems.
Before Splenda® and other miracles of sugar imitation came on the scene, the hard core used stevia,
an herb 300 times sweeter than sugar. One drop was like 300 packets of sugar. It was a delicate tool and I
wasn’t a delicate cook. I had once made a small handful of cookies using baking soda instead of baking
powder, and that was bad enough to drive my roommates to puke on the lawn. This new masterpiece
made the cookies look like fine dining: It tasted like liquid cream cheese mixed with cold water and
about 600 packets of sugar.
I then did what any normal and rational person would do: I grabbed the largest soup ladle with a sigh
and sat down in front of the TV to face my punishment. I had wasted an entire Sunday and a boatload of
ingredients—it was time to reap what I had sown.
One hour and 20 large spoonfuls later, I hadn’t made a dent in the enormous batch of soup, but I was
down for the count. Not only could I not eat anything but soup for two days, I couldn’t bring myself to
even look at cheesecake, previously my favorite dessert, for more than four years.
Stupid? Of course. It’s about as stupid as one can get. This is a ridiculous and micro example of what
people do on a larger scale with jobs all the time: self-imposed suffering that can be avoided. Sure, I
learned a lesson and paid for the mistake. The real question is—for what?
There are two types of mistakes: mistakes of ambition and mistakes of sloth.
The first is the result of a decision to act—to do something. This type of mistake is made with
incomplete information, as it’s impossible to have all the facts beforehand. This is to be encouraged.
Fortune favors the bold.
The second is the result of a decision of sloth—to not do something—wherein we refuse to change a
bad situation out of fear despite having all the facts. This is how learning experiences become terminal
punishments, bad relationships become bad marriages, and poor job choices become lifelong prison
sentences.
“Yeah, but what if I’m in an industry where jumping around is looked down upon? I’ve been here
barely a year, and prospective employers would think…”
Would they? Test assumptions before condemning yourself to more misery. I’ve seen one determinant
of sex appeal to good employers: performance. If you are a rock star when it comes to results, it doesn’t
matter if you jump ship from a bad company after three weeks. On the other hand, if tolerating a
punishing work environment for years at a time is a prerequisite for promotion in your field, could it be
that you’re in a game not worth winning?
The consequences of bad decisions do not get better with age.
What cheesecake are you eating?
Q&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS
Only those who are asleep make no mistakes.
—INGVAR KAMPRAD, founder of IKEA, world’s largest furniture brand
Tens of thousands of people, most of them less capable than you, leave their jobs every day. It’s
neither uncommon nor fatal. Here are a few exercises to help you realize just how natural job changes
are and how simple the transition can be.
1. First, a familiar reality check: Are you more likely to find what you want in your current job or
somewhere else?
2. If you were fired from your job today, what would you do to get things under financial control?
3. Take a sick day and post your resume on the major job sites. Even if you have no immediate plans
to leave your job, post your resume on sites such as www.monster.com and www.careerbuilder.com,
using a pseudonym if you prefer. This will show you that there are options besides
your current place of work. Call headhunters if your level makes such a step appropriate, and send
a brief e-mail such as the one below to friends and non-work contacts.
Dear All,
I am considering making a career move and am interested in all opportunities that might come to
mind. Nothing is too outrageous or out of left field. [If you know what you want or don’t want on
some level, feel free to add, “I am particularly interested in …” or “I would like to avoid …”]
Please let me know if anything comes to mind!
Tim
Call in sick or take a vacation day to complete all of these exercises during a normal 9–5 workday.
This will simulate unemployment and lessen the fear factor of non-office limbo.
In the world of action and negotiation, there is one principle that governs all others: The person
who has more options has more power. Don’t wait until you need options to search for them. Take
a sneak peek at the future now and it will make both action and being assertive easier.
4. If you run or own a company, imagine that you have just been sued and must declare bankruptcy.
The company is now insolvent and you must close up shop. This is something you must legally do,
and there are no finances to entertain other options. How would you survive?

EMBRACING THE MOBILE LIFESTYLE
Before the development of tourism, travel was conceived to be like study, and its fruits were
considered to be the adornment of the mind and the formation of the judgment.

Upon Sherwood’s return from Oktoberfest, dazed from killing neurons but the happiest he’s been
in four years, the remote trial is made policy and Sherwood is inducted into the world of the New Rich.
All he needs now is an idea of how to exploit this freedom and the tools to give his finite cash nearinfinite
lifestyle output.
If you’ve gone through the previous steps, eliminating, automating, and severing the leashes that bind
you to one location, it’s time to indulge in some fantasies and explore the world.
Even if you have no ache for extended travel or think it’s impossible—whether due to marriage or
mortgage or those little things known as children—this chapter is still the next step. There are
fundamental changes I and most others put off until absence (or preparation for it) forces them. This
chapter is your final exam in muse design.
The transformation begins in a small Mexican village, in a parable that’s been shared in various forms
around the world.
Fables and Fortune Hunters
An American businessman took a vacation to a small coastal Mexican village on doctor’s orders.
Unable to sleep after an urgent phone call from the office the first morning, he walked out to the pier to
clear his head. A small boat with just one fisherman had docked, and inside the boat were several large
yellowfin tuna. The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish.
“How long did it take you to catch them?” the American asked.
“Only a little while,” the Mexican replied in surprisingly good English.
“Why don’t you stay out longer and catch more fish?” the American then asked.
“I have enough to support my family and give a few to friends,” the Mexican said as he unloaded them
into a basket.
“But … What do you do with the rest of your time?”
The Mexican looked up and smiled. “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take a siesta with
my wife, Julia, and stroll into the village each evening, where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos.
I have a full and busy life, señor.”
The American laughed and stood tall. “Sir, I’m a Harvard M.B.A. and can help you. You should spend
more time fishing, and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. In no time, you could buy several boats with
the increased haul. Eventually, you would have a fleet of fishing boats.”
He continued, “Instead of selling your catch to a middleman, you would sell directly to the consumers,
eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing, and distribution. You
would need to leave this small coastal fishing village, of course, and move to Mexico City, then to Los
Angeles, and eventually New York City, where you could run your expanding enterprise with proper
management.”
The Mexican fisherman asked, “But, señor, how long will all this take?”
To which the American replied, “15–20 years. 25 tops.”
“But what then, señor?”
The American laughed and said, “That’s the best part. When the time is right, you would announce an
IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich. You would make millions.”
“Millions, señor? Then what?”
“Then you would retire and move to a small coastal fishing village, where you would sleep late, fish a
little, play with your kids, take a siesta with your wife, and stroll to the village in the evenings where you
could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos …”
I RECENTLY HAD lunch in San Francisco with a good friend and former college roommate. He will soon
graduate from a top business school and return to investment banking. He hates coming home from the
office at midnight but explained to me that, if he works 80-hour weeks for nine years, he could become a
managing director and make a cool $3–10 million per year. Then he would be successful.
“Dude, what on earth would you do with $3–10 million per year?” I asked.
His answer? “I would take a long trip to Thailand.”
That just about sums up one of the biggest self-deceptions of our modern age: extended world travel
as the domain of the ultrarich. I’ve also heard the following:
“I’ll just work in the firm for 15 years. Then I’ll be partner and I can cut back on hours. Once I have a
million or two in the bank, I’ll put it in something safe like bonds, take $80,000 a year in interest, and
retire to sail in the Caribbean.”
“I’ll only work in consulting until I’m 35, then retire and ride a motorcycle across China.”
If your dream, the pot of gold at the end of the career rainbow, is to live large in Thailand, sail around
the Caribbean, or ride a motorcycle across China, guess what? All of them can be done for less than
$3,000. I’ve done all three. Here are just two examples of how far a little can go. 68
$250 U.S. Five days on a private Smithsonian tropical research island with three local fishermen who
caught and cooked all my food and also took me on tours of the best hidden dive spots in Panamá.
$150 U.S. Three days of chartering a private plane in Mendoza wine country in Argentina and flying
over the most beautiful vineyards around the snowcapped Andes with a personal guide.
Question: What did you spend your last $400 on? It’s two or three weekends of nonsense and
throwaway forget-the-workweek behavior in most U.S. cities. $400 is nothing for a full eight days of
life-changing experiences. But eight days isn’t what I’m recommending at all. Those were just interludes
in a much larger production. I’m proposing much, much more.
The Birth of Mini-Retirements and
the Death of Vacations
There is more to life than increasing its speed.
—MOHANDAS GANDHI
In February of 2004, I was miserable and overworked.
My travel fantasy began as a plan to visit Costa Rica in March 2004 for four weeks of Spanish and
relaxation. I needed a recharge and four weeks seemed “reasonable” by whatever made-up benchmark
you can use for such a thing.
A friend familiar with Central America dutifully pointed out that it would never work, as Costa Rica
was about to enter its rainy season. Torrential downpours weren’t the uplifting jolt I needed, so I shifted
my focus to four weeks in Spain. It’s a long trip over the Atlantic, though, and Spain was close to other
countries I’d always wanted to visit. I lost “reasonable” somewhere shortly thereafter and decided that I
deserved a full three months to explore my roots in Scandinavia after four weeks in Spain.
If there were any real-time bombs or pending disasters, they would certainly crop up in the first four
weeks, so there really wasn’t any additional risk in extending my trip to three months. Three months
would be great.
Those three months turned into 15, and I started to ask myself, “Why not take the usual 20–30-year
retirement and redistribute it throughout life instead of saving it all for the end?”
The Alternative to Binge Traveling
Thanks to the Interstate Highway System, it is now possible to travel from coast to coast
without seeing anything.
—CHARLES KURALT, CBS news reporter
If you are accustomed to working 50 weeks per year, the tendency, even after creating the mobility to
take extended trips, will be to go nuts and see 10 countries in 14 days and end up a wreck. It’s like taking
a starving dog to an all-you-can-eat buffet. It will eat itself to death.
I did this three months into my 15-month vision quest, visiting seven countries and going through at
least 20 check-ins and checkouts with a friend who had negotiated three weeks off. The trip was an
adrenaline-packed blast but like watching life on fast-forward. It was hard for us to remember what had
happened in which countries (except Amsterdam), 69 we were both sick most of the time, and we were
upset to have to leave some places simply because our pre-purchased flights made it so.
I recommend doing the exact opposite.
The alternative to binge travel—the mini-retirement—entails relocating to one place for one to six
months before going home or moving to another locale. It is the anti-vacation in the most positive sense.
Though it can be relaxing, the mini-retirement is not an escape from your life but a reexamination of it—
the creation of a blank slate. Following elimination and automation, what would you be escaping from?
Rather than seeking to see the world through photo ops between foreign-but-familiar hotels, we aim to
experience it at a speed that lets it change us.
This is also different from a sabbatical. Sabbaticals are often viewed much like retirement: as a onetime
event. Savor it now while you can. The mini-retirement is defined as recurring—it is a lifestyle. I
currently take three or four mini-retirements per year and know dozens who do the same. Sometimes
these sojourns take me around the world; oftentimes they take me around the corner—Yosemite, Tahoe,
Carmel—but to a different world psychologically, where meetings, e-mail, and phone calls don’t exist
for a set period of time.
Purging the Demons: Emotional Freedom
This is the very perfection of a man, to find out his own im perfection.
—SAINT AUGUSTINE (354 A.D.–430 A.D.)
True freedom is much more than having enough income and time to do what you want. It is quite
possible—actually the rule rather than the exception—to have financial and time freedom but still be
caught in the throes of the rat race. One cannot be free from the stresses of a speed- and size-obsessed
culture until you are free from the materialistic addictions, time-famine mind-set, and comparative
impulses that created it in the first place.
This takes time. The effect is not cumulative, and no number of two-week (also called “too weak”) 70
sightseeing trips can replace one good walkabout. 71
In the experience of those I’ve interviewed, it takes two to three months just to unplug from obsolete
routines and become aware of just how much we distract ourselves with constant motion. Can you have
a two-hour dinner with Spanish friends without getting anxious? Can you get accustomed to a small town
where all businesses take a siesta for two hours in the afternoon and then close at 4:00 P.M.? If not, you
need to ask, Why?
Learn to slow down. Get lost intentionally. Observe how you judge both yourself and those around
you. Chances are that it’s been a while. Take at least two months to disincorporate old habits and
rediscover yourself without the reminder of a looming return flight.
The Financial Realities: It Just Gets Better
The economic argument for mini-retirements is the icing on the cake. Four days in a decent hotel or a
week for two at a nice hostel costs the same as a month in a nice posh apartment. If you relocate, the
expenses abroad also begin to replace—often at much lower cost—bills you can then cancel stateside.
Here are some actual monthly figures from recent travels.
Highlights from both South America and Europe are shown side by side to prove that luxury is limited
by your creativity and familiarity with the locale, not gross currency devaluation in third-world countries.
It will be obvious that I did not survive on bread and begging—I lived like a rock star—and both
experiences could be done for less than 50% of what I spent. My goal was enjoyment and not austere
survival.

Fear Factors: Overcoming Excuses
Not to Travel
Travelling is the ruin of all happiness! There’s no looking at a building here after seeing Italy.
—FANNY BURNEY (1752–1840), English novelist
But I have a house and kids. I can’t travel!
What about health insurance? What if something happens?
Isn’t travel dangerous? What if I get kidnapped or mugged?
But I’m a woman—traveling alone would be dangerous.
Most excuses not to travel are exactly that—excuses. I’ve been there, so this isn’t a holier-than-thou
sermon. I know too well that it’s easier to live with ourselves if we cite an external reason for inaction.
I’ve since met paraplegics and the deaf, senior citizens and single mothers, home owners and the poor,
all of whom have sought and found excellent life-changing reasons for extended travel instead of
dwelling on the million small reasons against it.
Most of the concerns above are addressed in the Q&A, but one in particular requires a bit of
preemptive nerve calming.
It’s 10:00 P.M. Do You Know Where Your Children Are?
The prime fear of all parents prior to their first international trip is somehow losing a child in the shuffle.
The good news is that if you are comfortable taking your kids to New York, San Francisco,
Washington, D.C., or London, you will have even less to worry about in the starting cities I recommend
in the Q&A. There are fewer guns and violent crimes in all of them compared to most large U.S. cities.
The likelihood of problems is decreased further when travel is less airport and hotel-hopping among
strangers and more relocation to a second home: a mini-retirement.
But still, what if?
Jen Errico, a single mother who took her two children on a five-month world tour, had a more acute
fear than most, one that often woke her at 2:00 A.M. in a cold sweat: What if something happens to me?
She wanted to prime her kids for worst-case scenario but didn’t want to scare them to death, so—like
all good mothers—she made it a game: Who can best memorize the itineraries, hotel addresses, and
Mom’s phone number? She had emergency contacts in each country whose numbers were loaded into
the speed dial of her cell phone, which had global roaming. In the end, nothing happened. Now she’s
planning to move to a ski chalet in Europe and send her kids to school in multilingual France. Success
begets success.
She was most afraid in Singapore, and in retrospect, it was where she had the least reason to be
worried (she took her kids to South Africa, among other places). She was scared because it was the first
stop and she was unaccustomed to traveling with her kids. It was perception, not reality.
Robin Malinsky-Rummell, who spent a year traveling through South America with her husband and
seven-year-old son, was warned by friends and family not to visit Argentina after their devaluation riots
in 2001. She did her homework, decided that the fear was unfounded, and proceeded to have the time of
her life in Patagonia. When she told locals that she was originally from New York, their eyes widened
and jaws dropped: “I saw those buildings blow up on TV! I would never go to such a dangerous place!”
Don’t assume that places abroad are more dangerous than your hometown. Most aren’t.
Robin is convinced, as are other NR parents, that people use children as an excuse to stay in their
comfort zones. It’s an easy excuse not to do something adventurous. How to overcome the fear? Robin
recommends two things:
1. Before embarking on a long international trip with your children for the first time, take a trial run
for a few weeks.
2. For each stop, arrange a week of language classes that begin upon arrival and take advantage of
transportation from the airport if available. The school staff will often handle apartment rentals for
you, and you will be able to make friends and learn the area before setting off on your own.
But what if your concern isn’t so much losing your children but losing your mind because of your
children?
Several families interviewed for this book recommended the oldest persuasive tool known to man:
bribery. Each child is given some amount of virtual cash, 25–50 cents, for each hour of good behavior.
The same amount is subtracted from their accounts for breaking the rules. All purchases for fun—
whether souvenirs, ice cream, or otherwise—come out of their own individual accounts. No balance, no
goodies. This often requires more self-control on the part of the parents than the children.
How to Get Airfare at 50–80% Off
This is not a book on budget travel. Most of the cost-cutting recommendations found in such guides
are designed with the binge traveler in mind. For someone embarking on a mini-retirement, an extra $150
for hassle-free airfare amortized over two months is a better deal than 20 hours of manipulating frequentflier
points on an unknown airline or chasing questionable deals.
Following two weeks of research, I once bought a one-way standby ticket to Europe for $120. I
arrived at JFK brimming with enthusiasm and confidence—look at all these schmucks paying retail!—
and 90% of the “participating” airlines refused my ticket. Those that didn’t were booked for weeks solid.
I ended up staying in a hotel for two nights for a $300 tab, filing a complaint with AMEX, and
eventually calling 1–800-FLY-EUROPE from the JFK terminal in frustration. I bought a round-trip
ticket to London on Virgin Atlantic for $300 and left an hour later. The same ticket cost more than $700
a week earlier.
After 25 countries, I’ve found a few simple strategies that get you 90% of the possible savings without
wasting time or producing migraines.
1. Use credit cards with reward points for large muse-related advertising and manufacturing
expenses.
I am not spending more money to get pennies on the dollar—these costs are inevitable, so I
capitalize on them. This alone gets me a free round-trip international ticket each three months.
2. Purchase tickets far in advance (three months or more) or last minute, and aim for both departure
and return between Tues day and Thursday.
Long-term travel planning turns me off and can be expensive if plans change, so I opt for
purchasing all tickets in the last four or five days prior to target departure. The value of empty
seats is $0 as soon as the flight takes off, so true last-minute seats are cheap.
Use Orbitz (www.orbitz.com) and www.kayak.com first. Fix the departure and return dates
between Tuesday and Thursday. Then look at prices for alternative departure dates each of three
days into the past and each of three days into the future. Using the cheapest departure date, do the
same with the return dates to find the cheapest combination. Check this price against the fares on
the website of the airline itself. Then begin bidding on www.priceline.com at 50% of the better of
the two, working up in $50 increments until you get a better price or realize it’s not possible.
3. Consider buying one ticket to an international hub and then an ongoing ticket with a cheap local
airline.
If going to Europe on a tight budget, you could get three tickets. One free Southwest ticket (from
transferring AMEX points) from CA to JFK, the cheapest ticket to Heathrow in London, and then
an übercheap ticket on either Ryanair or EasyJet to a final destination. I have paid as little as $10
to go from London to Berlin or London to Spain. That is not a typo. Local airlines will often offer
seats on flights for just the cost of taxes and gasoline. To Central or South American destinations,
I’ll often look at local flights from Panama or international flights from Miami.
When More Is Less: Cutting the Clutter
Human beings have the capacity to learn to want almost any conceivable material object.
Given, then, the emergence of a modern industrial culture capable of producing almost
anything, the time is ripe for opening the storehouse of infinite need! … It is the modern
Pandora’s box, and its plagues are loose upon the world.
—JULES HENRY
To be free, to be happy and fruitful, can only be attained through sacrifice of many common
but overestimated things
—ROBERT HENRI
I know the son of one deca-millionaire, a personal friend of Bill Gates, who now manages private
investments and ranches. He has accumulated an assortment of beautiful homes over the last decade,
each with full-time cooks, servants, cleaners, and support staff. How does he feel about having a home
in each time zone? It’s a pain in the ass! He feels like he’s working for his staff, who spend more time in
his homes than he does.
Extended travel is the perfect excuse to reverse the damage of years of consuming as much as you can
afford. It’s time to get rid of clutter disguised as necessities before you drag a five-piece Samsonite set
around the world. That is hell on earth.
I’m not going to tell you to walk around in a robe and sandals scowling at people who have
televisions. I hate that kashi-crunching holier-than-thou stuff. Turning you into a possession-less scribe
is not my intention. Let’s face it, though: There are tons of things in your home and life that you don’t
use, need, or even particularly want. They just came into your life as impulsive flotsam and jetsam and
never found a good exit. Whether you’re aware of it or not, this clutter creates indecision and
distractions, consuming attention and making unfettered happiness a real chore. It is impossible to realize
how distracting all the crap is—whether porcelain dolls, sports cars, or ragged T-shirts—until you get rid
of it.
Prior to my 15-month trip, I was stressed about how to fit all of my belongings into a 14 x 10-foot
rental storage space. Then I realized a few things: I would never reread the business magazines I’d saved,
I wore the same five shirts and four pairs of pants 90% of the time, it was about time for new furniture,
and I never used the outdoor grill or lawn furniture.
Even getting rid of things I never used proved to be like a capitalist short-circuit. It was hard to toss
things I had once thought were valuable enough to spend money on. The first ten minutes of sorting
through clothing was like choosing which child of mine should live or die. I hadn’t exercised my
throwing-out muscles in some time. It was a struggle to put nice Christmas clothing I’d never worn into
the “go” pile and just as hard to separate myself from worn and ragged clothing I had for sentimental
reasons. Once I’d passed through the first few tough decisions, though, the momentum had been built and
it was a breeze. I donated all of the seldom-worn clothing to Goodwill. The furniture took less than 10
hours to offload using Craigslist, and though I was paid less than 50% of the retail prices for some and
nothing for others, who cared? I’d used and abused them for five years and would get a new set when I
landed back in the U.S. I gave the grill and lawn furniture to my friend, who lit up like a kid at
Christmas. I had made his month. It felt wonderful and I had an extra $300 in pocket change to cover at
least a few weeks of rent abroad.
I created 40% more space in my apartment and hadn’t even grazed the surface. It wasn’t the extra
physical space that I felt most. It was the extra mental space. It was as if I had 20 mental applications
running simultaneously before, and now I had just one or two. My thinking was clearer and I was much,
much happier.
I asked every vagabond interviewee in this book what their one recommendation would be for firsttime
extended travelers. The answer was unanimous: Take less with you.
The overpacking impulse is hard to resist. The solution is to set what I call a “settling fund.” Rather
than pack for all contingencies, I bring the absolute minimum and allocate $100–300 for purchasing
things after I arrive and as I travel. I no longer take toiletries or more than a week’s worth of clothing.
It’s a blast. Finding shaving cream or a dress shirt overseas can produce an adventure in and of itself.
Pack as if you were coming back in one week. Here are the bare essentials, listed in order of
importance:
1. One week of clothing appropriate to the season, including one semiformal shirt and pair of pants or
skirt for customs. Think T-shirts, one pair of shorts, and a multipurpose pair of jeans.
2. Backup photocopies or scanned copies of all important documents: health insurance, passport/visa,
credit cards, debit cards, etc.
3. Debit cards, credit cards, and $200 worth of small bills in local currency (traveler’s checks are not
accepted in most places and are a hassle)
4. Small cable bike lock for securing luggage while in transit or in hostels; a small padlock for
lockers if needed
5. Electronic dictionaries for target languages (book versions are too slow to be of use in
conversation) and small grammar guides or texts
6. One broad-strokes travel guide
That’s it. 73 To laptop or not to laptop? Unless you are a writer, I vote no. It’s far too cumbersome and
distracting. Using GoToMyPC to access your home computer from Internet cafés encourages the habit
we want to develop: making the best use of time instead of killing it.
The Bora-Bora Dealmaker
BAFFIN ISLAND, NUNAVUT
Josh Steinitz 74 stood at the edge of the world and stared in amazement. He dug his boots into the six
feet of sea ice and the unicorns danced.
Ten narwhals—rare cousins of the beluga—came to the surface and pointed their six-foot-plus spiral
tusks toward the heavens. The pod of 3,000-pound whales then fell into the depths once again. The
narwhals are deep divers—more than 3,000 feet in some cases—so Josh had at least 20 minutes until
their reappearance.
It seemed appropriate that he was with the narwhals. Their name came from Old Norse and referred to
their mottled white and blue skin.
Náhvalr—corpse man.
He smiled as he had done often in the last few years. Josh himself was a dead man walking.
One year after graduating from college, Josh found out that he had oral squamous carcinoma—cancer.
He had plans to be a management consultant. He had plans to be lots of things. Suddenly none of it
mattered. Less than half of those who suffered from this particular type of cancer survived. 75 The reaper
didn’t discriminate and came without warning.
It became clear that the biggest risk in life wasn’t making mistakes but regret: missing out on things.
He could never go back and recapture years spent doing something he disliked.
Two years later and cancer-free, Josh set off on an indefinite global walkabout, covering expenses as a
freelance writer. He later became the cofounder of a website that provides customized itineraries to
would-be vagabonds. His executive status didn’t lessen his mobile addiction. He was as comfortable
cutting deals from the over-water bungalows of Bora-Bora as he was in the log cabins of the Swiss Alps.
He once took a call from a client while at Camp Muir on Mt. Rainier. The client needed to confirm
some sales numbers and asked Josh about all the wind in the background. Josh’s answer: “I’m standing
at 10,000 feet on a glacier and this afternoon the wind is whipping us down the mountain.” The client
said he’d let Josh get back to what he was doing.
Another client called Josh while he was leaving a Balinese temple and heard the gongs in the
background. The client asked Josh if he was in church. Josh wasn’t quite sure what to say. All that came
out was, “Yes?”
Back among the narwhals, Josh had a few minutes before heading to base camp to avoid polar bears.
Twenty-four-hour daylight meant that he had much to share with his friends back in the land of cubicles.
He sat down on the ice and produced his satellite phone and laptop from a waterproof bag. He began his
e-mail in the usual way:
“I know you’re all sick of seeing me have so much fun, but guess where I am?”
Q&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS
It is fatal to know too much at the outcome: boredom comes as quickly to the traveler who
knows his route as to the novelist who is overcertain of his plot.
—PAUL THEROUX, To the Ends of the Earth
If this is your first time considering a commitment to the mobile lifestyle and long-term adventuring, I
envy you! Making the jump and entering the new worlds that await is like upgrading your role in life
from passenger to pilot.
The bulk of this Q&A will focus on the precise steps that you should take—and the countdown
timeline you can use—when preparing for your first mini-retirement. Most steps can be eliminated or
condensed once you get one trip under your belt. Some of the steps are one-time events, after which
subsequent mini-retirements will require a maximum of two to three weeks of preparation. It now takes
me three afternoons.
Grab a pencil and paper—this will be fun.
1. Take an asset and cash-flow snapshot.
Set two sheets of paper on a table. Use one to record all assets and corresponding values, including bank
accounts, retirement accounts, stocks, bonds, home, and so forth. On the second, draw a line down the
middle and write down all incoming cash flow (salary, muse income, investment income, etc.) and
outgoing expenses (mortgage, rent, car payments, etc.). What can you eliminate that is either seldom used
or that creates stress or distraction without adding a lot of value?
2. Fear-set a one-year mini-retirement in a dream location in Europe.
Use the questions from chapter 3 to evaluate your worst-case-scenario fears and evaluate the real
potential consequences. Except in rare cases, most will be avoidable and the rest will be reversible.
3. Choose a location for your actual mini-retirement. Where to start?
This is the big question. There are two options that I advocate:
1. Choose a starting point and then wander until you find your second home. This is what I did with a
one-way ticket to London, vagabonding throughout Europe until I fell in love with Berlin, where I
remained for three months.
2. Scout a region and then settle in your favorite spot. This is what I did with a tour of Central and
South America, where I spent one to four weeks in each of several cities, after which I returned to
my favorite—Buenos Aires—for six months.
It is possible to take a mini-retirement in your own country, but the transformative effect is hampered if
you are surrounded by people who carry the same socially reinforced baggage.
I recommend choosing an overseas location that will seem foreign but that isn’t dangerous. I box, race
motorcycles, and do all sorts of macho things, but I draw the line at favelas, 76 civilians with machine
guns, pedestrians with machetes, and social strife. Cheap is good, but bullet holes are bad. Check the
U.S. Department of State for travel warnings before booking tickets (http:// travel.state.gov).
Here are just a few of my favorite starting points. Feel free to choose other locations. The most
lifestyle for the dollar is underlined: Argentina (Buenos Aires, Córdoba), China (Shanghai, Hong Kong,
Taipei), Japan (Tokyo, Osaka), England (London), Ireland (Galway), Thailand (Bangkok, Chiang Mai),
Germany (Berlin, Munich), Norway (Oslo), Australia (Sydney), New Zealand (Queenstown), Italy
(Rome, Milan, Florence), Spain (Madrid, Valencia, Sevilla), and Holland (Amsterdam). In all of these
places, it is possible to live well while spending little. I spend less in Tokyo than in California because I
know it well. Hip, recently gentrified artist areas, not unlike the Brooklyn of 10 years ago, can be found
in almost all cities. The one place I can’t seem to find a decent lunch for less than $20 U.S.? London.
Here are a few exotic places I don’t recommend for vagabonding virgins, though veterans can make
them all work: all countries in Africa, the Middle East, or Central and South America (excepting Costa
Rica and Argentina). Mexico City and Mexican border areas are also a bit too kidnap-happy to make it
onto my favorites list.
4. Prepare for your trip. Here’s the countdown.
Three months out—Eliminate
Get used to minimalism before the departure. Here are the questions to ask and act upon, even if you
never plan to leave:
What is the 20% of my belongings that I use 80% of the time? Eliminate the other 80% in clothing,
magazines, books, and all else. Be ruthless—you can always repurchase things you can’t live without.
Which belongings create stress in my life? This could relate to maintenance costs (money and energy),
insurance, monthly expenses, time consumption, or simple distraction. Eliminate, eliminate, eliminate. If
you sell even a few expensive items, it could finance a good portion of your mini-retirement. Don’t rule
out the car and home. It’s always possible to purchase either upon your return, often losing no money in
the process.
Check current health insurance coverage for extended overseas travel. Get the wheels in motion to
rent, swap, or sell your home—renting out is most recommended by serial vagabonds—or end your
apartment lease and move all belongings into storage.
In all cases where doubts crop up, ask yourself, “If I had a gun to my head and had to do it, how
would I do it?” It’s not as hard as you think.
Two months out—Automate
After eliminating the excess, contact companies (including suppliers) that bill you regularly and set up
autopayment with credit cards that have reward points. Telling them that you will be traveling the world
for a year often persuades them to accept credit cards rather than chase you around the planet like
Carmen Sandiego.
For the credit card companies themselves and others that refuse, arrange automatic debit from your
checking account. Set up online banking and bill payment. Set up all companies that won’t take credit
cards or automatic debit as online payees. Set these scheduled checks for $15–20 more than expected
when dealing with utilities and other variable expenses. This will cover miscellaneous fees, prevent timeconsuming
billing problems, and accrue as a credit. Cancel paper bank and credit card statement
delivery. Get bank-issued credit cards for all checking accounts—generally one for business and one for
personal—and set the cash advances to $0 to minimize abuse potential. Leave these cards at home, as
they are just for emergency overdraft protection.
Give a trusted member of your family and/or your accountant power of attorney, 77 which gives that
person authority to sign documents (tax filings and checks, for example) in your name. Nothing screws
up foreign fun faster than having to sign original documents when faxes are unacceptable.
One month out—
Speak to the manager of your local post office and have all mail forwarded to a friend, family member,
or personal assistant, 78 who will be paid $100–200 per month to e-mail you brief descriptions of all
nonjunk mail each Monday.
Get all required and recommended immunizations and vaccinations for your target region. Check the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (www.cdc.gov/travel/). Note that proof of immunizations is
sometimes required to pass through foreign customs.
Set up a trial account with GoToMyPC or similar remote-access software and take a dry run to ensure
that there are no technological glitches. 79
If resellers (or distributors) still send you checks—the fulfillment house should handle customer
checks at this point—do one of three things: give the resellers direct bank deposit information (ideal),
have the fulfillment house handle these checks (second choice), or have the resellers pay via PayPal or
mail checks to one of the people you are trusting with power of attorney (far third). In the last case, give
the person with power of attorney deposit slips so he or she can sign or stamp and mail in the checks. It
is convenient to become a member of a large bank (Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Washington Mutual,
Citibank, etc.) with branches near the person assisting you so that they can drop off the deposits while
running other errands. No need to move all accounts to this bank if you don’t want to; just open a single
new account that is used solely for these deposits.
Two weeks out—
Scan all identification, health insurance, and credit/debit cards into a computer from which you can print
multiple copies, several to be left with family members and several to be taken with you in separate
bags. E-mail the scanned file to yourself so that you can access it while abroad if you lose the paper
copies.
If you are an entrepreneur, downgrade your cell phone to the cheapest plan and set up a voicemail
greeting that states, “I am currently overseas on business. Please do not leave a voicemail, as I will not
be checking it while gone. Please send me an e-mail at __@__.com if the matter is important. Thank you
for your understanding.” Then set up e-mail autoresponders that indicate responses could take up to
seven days (or whatever you decide for frequency) due to international business travel.
If you are an employee, consider getting a quad-band or GSM-compatible cell phone so that the boss
can contact you. Get a BlackBerry only if your boss will be checking to see if you are working via e-
mail. Be sure to disable the dead giveaway “Sent from a BlackBerry” signature on outgoing e-mail!
Other options include using a SkypeIn account that forwards to your foreign cell phone (my preference)
or a Vonage IP box that allows you to receive landline calls anywhere in the world via a phone number
that begins with your home area code.
Find an apartment for your ultimate mini-retirement destination or reserve a hostel or hotel at your
starting point for three to four days. Reserving an apartment before you arrive is riskier and will be much
more expensive than using the latter three to four days to find an apartment. I recommend hostels for the
starting point if possible—not for cost considerations but because the staff and fellow travelers are more
knowledgeable and helpful with relocations.
Get foreign medical evacuation insurance if needed for peace of mind. This tends to be redundant if
you are in a first-world country and can buy local insurance to augment your own, which I do, and it is
useless if you are a 10-hour flight from civilization. I had evacuation insurance in Panama, as it’s a 2-
hour flight from Miami, but I didn’t bother elsewhere. Don’t freak out about this; it’s just as true if
you’re in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the U.S.
One week out—
Decide on a schedule for routine batched tasks such as e-mail, online banking, etc. to eliminate excuses
for senseless pseudo-work procrasterbating. I suggest Monday mornings for checking e-mail and online
banking. The first and third Mondays of the month can be used for checking credit cards and making
other online payments such as affiliates. These promises to yourself will be the hardest to keep, so make
a commitment now and expect serious withdrawal cravings.
Save important documents—including the scan of your identification, insurance, and credit/debit cards
—to a small handheld storage device that plugs into a computer USB port.
Move all things out of your home or apartment into storage, pack a single small backpack and carryon
bag for the adventure, and move in briefly with a family member or friend.
Two days out—
Put remaining automobiles into storage or a friend’s garage. Put fuel stabilizer like Sta-Bil® in the gas
tanks, disconnect the negative leads from batteries to prevent drain, and put the vehicles on jack stands to
prevent tire and shock damage. Cancel all auto insurance except for theft coverage.
Upon arrival (assuming you have not booked an apartment in advance)—
First morning and afternoon after check-in Take a hop-on-hop-off bus tour of the city followed by a
bike tour of potential apartment neighborhoods.
First late afternoon or evening Purchase an unlocked 80 cell phone with a SIM card that can be
recharged with simple prepaid cards. E-mail apartment owners or brokers on Craigslist.com and online
versions of local newspapers for viewings over the next two days.
Second and third days Find and book an apartment for one month. Don’t commit to more than one
month until you’ve slept there. I once prepaid two months only to find that the busiest bus stop
downtown was on the other side of my bedroom wall.
Move-in day Get settled and purchase local health insurance. Ask hostel owners and other locals what
insurance they use. Resolve not to buy souvenirs or other take-home items until two weeks prior to
departure.
One week later Eliminate all the extra crap you brought but won’t use often. Either give it to someone
who needs it more, mail it back to the U.S., or throw it out.

GridSkipper: The Urban Travel Guide ( www.gridskipper.com )
For those who love Blade Runner-like settings and exploring the cool nooks and crannies of cities
worldwide, this is the site. It is one of Forbes’s Top 13 Travel sites and is “high-falootin’ and low-brow
all in the same breath” (Frommer’s). Translation: Much of the content is not G-rated. If four-letter words

Discussion forum for global travelers with threads separated by region.
Family Travel Forum ( www.familytravelforum.com )
A comprehensive forum on, you guessed it, family travel. Want to sell your kids for top dollar in the
Eastern Bloc? Or save a few dollars and cremate Grannie in Thailand? Then this isn’t the site. But if you
have kids and are planning a big trip, this is the place.

Mini-Retirement Planning and Preparation—Fundamentals
Round-the-World FAQ (includes travel insurance) ( www.perpetualtravel.com/rtw )
This FAQ is a lifesaver. Originally written by Marc Brosius, it has been added to by newsgroup
participants for years and now covers nuts and bolts from financial planning to return culture shock and
all in between. How long can you afford to be away? Do you need travel insurance? Leave of absence or
resignation? This is an around-the-world almanac.
Removing Clutter: 1–800-GOT-JUNK ( www.1800gotjunk.com ), Freecycle ( www.freecycle.org
), and Craigslist ( www.craigslist.org )
I used Craigslist’s “Free” category to get rid of four years of accumulated possessions in less than three
hours on a Saturday evening. There were some for-sale items that I also cleared out at 30–40% of
original retail. I then hauled off the last remaining items using the überfast 1–800-GOT-JUNK paid
service. Freecycle is comparable to Craigslist for giving away, and getting, things for free when you’re
short on time. Get unattached and you’ll make it a habit. I purge every 6–9 months, often including
donations to Goodwill (www.goodwill.org), which can do pickups for free with advanced notice.
One-Bag: The Art and Science of Packing Light ( www.onebag.com )
One of PC magazine’s “Top 100 [Can’t Live Without] Sites.” Pack light and experience lightness of
being.
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (www.cdc.gov/travel)
Recommended vaccinations and health planning for every nation in the world. Certain countries require
proof of inoculations to pass through customs. Get the shots well ahead of time, as some take weeks to
order.
Tax Planning (www.irs.gov/publications/p54/index.html)
More good news. Even if you permanently relocate to another country, you will have to pay U.S. taxes as
long as you have a U.S. passport! Not to fret—there are some creative legal sidesteps, such as form
2555-EZ, which can provide up to an $85,700 income exemption if you spend at least 330 days of a
consecutive 365 days off U.S. soil. This means you have 35 days in a given 12-month period to spend in
the U.S. as you like, but no more. That’s part of the reason my 2004 trip extended to 15 months. Get a
good accountant and let them do the detail work to keep yourself out of trouble.
U.S.-Sponsored Overseas Schools (www.state.gov/m/a/os)
If the idea of pulling your children out of school for a year or two isn’t appealing, stick them in one of
more than 190 elementary and secondary schools sponsored by the U.S. Department of State in 135
countries. Kids love home work.
Homeschooling 101 and Quickstart Guide (http://bit.ly/homeschooling101)
This subsection of http://homeschooling.about.com/provides a step-by-step process for considering
homeschooling options that can be applied to education during extended travel. Children can often return
to traditional public or private schools ahead of their classmates.
Home Education Magazine (www.homeedmag.com) Rich collection of resources for homeschoolers,
traveling families, and unschoolers. Links include curriculum, virtual support groups, legal resources,
and archives. Good reasons to learn the law: Some U.S. states offer up to $1,600 of funding per year for
qualified homeschooling expenditures, as it saves the state money to not educate your child in the public
school system.
Universal Currency Converter ( www.xe.com )
Before you get caught up in the excitement and forget that five British pounds does not equal five U.S.
dollars, use this to translate local costs into numbers you understand. Try not to have too many “Those
coins are each worth four dollars?” moments.
Universal Plug Adapter ( www.franzus.com )
Carrying bulky cables and connectors is irritating—get a Travel Smart all-in-one adapter with surge
protection. The size of a pack of cards folded in half, it is the only adapter that I’ve used everywhere
without problems. Note that it is an adapter (helps you plug things in), but it is not a transformer. If the
foreign wall outlet has twice as much voltage as in the U.S., your gadgets will self-destruct. Yet another
reason to purchase necessities abroad instead of taking them all with you.
World Electric Guide ( www.kropla.com )
Figure out outlets, voltage, mobile phones, international dialing codes, and all sorts of things related to
electric mismatching worldwide.
Cheap and Round-the-World Airfare
Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), Kayak (www.kayak.com), and Sidestep (www.sidestep.com)
Search 400+ airlines worldwide for each service. Orbitz is my starting point for pricing comparisons,
after which I check both Kayak and Sidestep. Sidestep has proven most effective when searching for
flights that start and end outside of the U.S.
TravelZoo Top 20 ( http://top20.travelzoo.com /)
Moscow for $129 one-way? These last-minute weekly travel specials might be the push you need to pull
the trigger.
Priceline ( www.priceline.com )
Start bidding at 50% of the lowest Orbitz fare and move up in $50 increments.
CFares ( www.cfares.com )
Consolidator fares with free and low-cost memberships. I found a round-trip ticket from California to
Japan for $500.
1–800-FLY-EUROPE ( www.1800flyeurope.com )
I used this to get the $300 roundtrip from JFK to London that left two hours later.

search service with more than 12,000 listings in more than 85 countries. E-mail directly owners of
potential homes, put your own home/apartment on the site, and have unlimited access to view listings for

Paid Housing—from Arrival to the Long Haul
Otalo ( www.otalo.com )
Otalo is a search engine for vacation rentals that searches across the Internet’s many different vacation
rentals sites and 200,000+ homes. Otalo is like a Kayak.com for vacation rentals. The site scours a
variety of other rental search sites and aggregates the results in one easy-to-use search tool.
Hostels.com ( www.hostels.com )
This site isn’t just for youth hostels. I found a nice hotel in downtown Tokyo for $20 per night and have
used this site for similar housing in eight countries. Think location and reviews (see HotelChatter next)
instead of amenities. Four-star hotels are for binge travelers; this site can offer a real local flavor before
you find an apartment or other longer-term housing.
HotelChatter ( www.hotelchatter.com )
Get the real scoop on this daily web journal with detailed and honest reviews of housing worldwide.
Updated several times daily, this site offers the stories of frustrated guests and those who have found
hidden gems. Online booking is available.
Craigslist ( www.craigslist.org )
Besides local weekly magazines with housing listings, such as Bild or Zitty (no joke) in Berlin, I have
found Craigslist to be the single best starting point for long-term overseas furnished apartments. As of
this writing, there are more than 50 countries represented. That said, prices will be 30–70% less in the
local magazines—if you have a tight budget, get a hostel employee or other local to help you make a few
calls and strike a deal. Ask the local helper not to mention you’re a foreigner until pricing is agreed
upon.
Interhome International ( www.interhome.com )
Based in Zurich, more than 20,000 homes for rent in Europe.
Rentvillas.com ( www.rentvillas.com )
Provides unique renting experiences—from cottages and farmhouses to castles—throughout Europe,
including France, Italy, Greece, Spain, and Portugal.
Computer Remote Access and Backup Tools
GoToMyPC ( www.gotomypc.com )
This software facilitates quick and easy remote access to your computer’s files, programs, e-mail, and
network. It can be used from any web browser or wireless device and works in real time. I have used
GoToMyPC religiously for more than five years to access my U.S.-based computers from countries and
islands worldwide. This gives me the freedom to leave all computers at home.
WebExPCNow ( http://pcnow.webex.com )
WebEx, the leader in corporate remote access, now offers software that does most of what GoToMyPC
offers, including cut and paste between remote computers, local printing from remote computers, file
transfers, and more.
DropBox (www.getdropbox.com) and SugarSync
(www.sugarsync.com); then JungleDisk (www.jungledisk.com) and Mozy (www.mozy.com) Both
DropBox and SugarSync perform backups and synching of files between multiple computers (home and
travel computers, for example). JungleDisk and Mozy—I use the latter—have fewer features and are
more specifically designed for automatic backups to their online storage.
Free and Low-Cost Internet (IP) Telephones
Skype ( www.skype.com )
Skype is my default for all phone calls. It allows you to call landlines and mobile phones across the globe
for an average of 2–5 cents per minute, or connect with other Skype users worldwide for free. For about
40 euros per year, you can get a U.S. number with your home area code and receive calls that forward to
a foreign cell phone. This makes your travel invisible. Lounge on the beach in Rio and answer calls to
your “office” in California. Nice. Skype Chat, which comes with the service, is also perfect for sharing
sensitive log-in and password information with others, as it’s encrypted.
Vonage (www.vonage.com) and Ooma (www.ooma.com)
Vonage offers a small adapter for a monthly fee that connects your broadband modem to a normal
phone. Take it on your travels and set it up in your apartment to receive calls to a U.S. number. Ooma
has no monthly fees and doesn’t require a landline, but it offers similar hardware you can connect to
broadband for a local U.S. number anywhere in the world.
VoIPBuster (www.voipbuster.com) and RebTel (www.rebtel.com)
Both VoIPBuster and RebTel can provide “alias” numbers. Enter a friend’s overseas number on their
sites, and both will give you a local number in your area code that will forward to your friend.
VoIPBuster also acts as a cheaper Skype with free calls to more than 20 countries.
International Multi-Band and GSM-Compatible Phones
My World Phone ( www.myworldphone.com )
I’m partial to Nokia phones. Ensure whichever phone you purchase is “unlocked”—that the SIM card
can be swapped out in different countries with different providers.
World Electronics USA ( www.worldelectronicsusa.com )
Good explanation of which GSM frequencies and “bands” function in which countries, which will
determine which phone you purchase for travel (and perhaps home).
Tools for Off-the-Beaten Path
Satellite Phones ( www.satphonestore.com )
If you will be in the mountains of Nepal or on a remote island and want the peace of mind (or headache)
of having a phone nearby, these phones work via satellite instead of towers. Iridium has been
recommended for widest reception (pole to pole), with GlobalStar in second place (three continents).
Rent or purchase.
Pocket-size Solar Panels ( www.solio.com )
Satellite phones and other small electronics are of little use (skipping stones, perhaps?) if their batteries
die. Solio is about the size of two packs of cards and fans out into small solar panels. I was surprised to
find that it charged my cell phone in less than 15 minutes—more than twice as fast as a wall outlet.
Adapters are available for almost anything.

68. The dollar figures in this chapter are all from a period immediately following President Bush’s

70. Coined by Joel Stein of the LA Times.
71. By all means, go ahead and take a post-office celebratory trip and go nuts for a few weeks. I know
I did. Rock on. Ibiza and glow sticks here I come. Have some absinthe and drink lots of water.
Following that, sit down and plan an introspective mini-retirement.
72. Muses are low maintenance but often expensive in one or both of two tactical areas:
manufacturing and advertising. Shop for providers of both that are willing to accept credit cards as
payment, and negotiate this up front if necessary by saying, “Rather than trying to negotiate you down
on pricing, I just ask that you accept payment by credit card. If you can do that, we’ll choose you over
Competitor X.” This is yet another example of a “firm offer,” and not a question, that puts you in a
stronger negotiating position. For a detailed explanation of how I multiply points for travel using
concepts like “piggybacking” and “recycling,” search for both terms on www.fourhourblog.com.

77. This is a serious step and should not be taken with those you do not trust. In this case, it helps
because your accountant can then sign tax documents or checks in your name instead of consuming
hours and days of your time with faxes, scanners, and expensive international FedEx’ing of
documents.
78. There are also services like www.earthclassmail.com, which will receive, scan, and e-mail all of
your non-junk mail to you as PDFs.
79. This would be used if you leave your computer at home or in someone else’s home while
traveling. This step can be skipped if you bring your computer, but that is like a recovering heroin
addict bringing a bag of opium to rehab. Don’t tempt yourself to kill time instead of rediscovering it.
80. “Unlocked” means that it is recharged with prepaid cards instead of being on a monthly payment
plan with a single carrier such as O2 or Vodafone. This also means that the same phone can be used
with carriers in other countries (assuming the frequency is the same) with a simple switch of the SIM
memory card for $10–30 U.S. in most cases. Some U.S.-compatible quad-band phones can use SIM
cards.
Filling the Void
ADDING LIFE AFTER SUBTRACTING WORK
To be engrossed by something outside ourselves is a powerful antidote for the rational mind, the
mind that so frequently has its head up its own ass.
—ANNE LAMOTT, Bird by Bird
There is not enough time to do all the nothing we want to do.
—BILL WATTERSON, creator of the Calvin and Hobbes cartoon strip
KING’S CROSS , LONDON
I stumbled into the deli across the cobblestone street and ordered a prosciutto sandwich. It was 10:33
A.M. now, the fifth time I’d checked the time, and the twentieth time I’d asked myself, “What the &%$#
am I going to do today?”
The best answer I had come up with so far was: get a sandwich.
Thirty minutes earlier, I had woken up without an alarm clock for the first time in four years, fresh off
arriving from JFK the night before. I had soooo been looking forward to it: awakening to musical
birdsong outside, sitting up in bed with a smile, smelling the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, and
stretching out overhead like a cat in the shade of a Spanish villa. Magnificent. It turned out more like
this: bolt upright as if blasted with a foghorn, grab clock, curse, jump out of bed in underwear to check
e-mail, remember that I was forbidden to do so, curse again, look for my host and former classmate,
realize that he was off to work like the rest of the world, and proceed to have a panic attack.
I spent the rest of the day in a haze, wandering from museum to botanical garden to museum as if on
rinse and repeat, avoiding Internet cafés with some vague sense of guilt. I needed a to-do list to feel
productive and so put down things like “eat dinner.”
This was going to be a lot harder than I had thought.
Postpartum Depression: It’s Normal
Man is so made that he can only find relaxation from one kind of labor by taking up another.
—ANATOLE FRANCE, author of The Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard
I’ve Got More Money and Time Than I Ever Dreamed Possible … Why Am I Depressed?
It’s a good question with a good answer. Just be glad you’re figuring this out now and not at the end of
life! The retired and ultrarich are often unfulfilled and neurotic for the same reason: too much idle time.
But wait a second … Isn’t more time what we’re after? Isn’t that what this book is all about? No, not
at all. Too much free time is no more than fertilizer for self-doubt and assorted mental tail-chasing.
Subtracting the bad does not create the good. It leaves a vacuum. Decreasing income-driven work isn’t
the end goal. Living more—and becoming more—is.
In the beginning, the external fantasies will be enough, and there is nothing wrong with this. I cannot
overemphasize the importance of this period. Go nuts and live your dreams. This is not superficial or
selfish. It is critical to stop repressing yourself and get out of the postponement habit.
Let’s suppose you decide to dip your toe in dreams like relocating to the Caribbean for island-hopping
or taking a safari in the Serengeti. It will be wonderful and unforgettable, and you should do it. There
will come a time, however—be it three weeks or three years later—when you won’t be able to drink
another piña colada or photograph another damn red-assed baboon. Self-criticism and existential panic
attacks start around this time.
But This Is What I Always Wanted! How Can I Be Bored?!
Don’t freak out and fuel the fire. This is normal among all high-performers who downshift after working
hard for a long time. The smarter and more goal-oriented you are, the tougher these growing pains will
be. Learning to replace the perception of time famine with appreciation of time abundance is like going
from triple espressos to decaf.
But there’s more! Retirees get depressed for a second reason, and you will too: social isolation.
Offices are good for some things: free bad coffee and complaining thereof, gossip and commiserating,
stupid video clips via e-mail with even stupider comments, and meetings that accomplish nothing but kill
a few hours with a few laughs. The job itself might be a dead end, but it’s the web of human interactions
—the social environment—that keeps us there. Once liberated, this automatic tribal unit disappears,
which makes the voices in your head louder.
Don’t be afraid of the existential or social challenges. Freedom is like a new sport. In the beginning,
the sheer newness of it is exciting enough to keep things interesting at all times. Once you have learned
the basics, though, it becomes clear that to be even a half-decent player requires some serious practice.
Don’t fret. The greatest rewards are to come, and you’re 10 feet from the finish line.
Frustrations and Doubts: You’re Not Alone
People say that what we are seeking is a meaning for life. I don’t think this is what we’re really
seeking. I think what we’re seeking is an experience of being alive.
—JOSEPH CAMPBELL, The Power of Myth
Once you eliminate the 9–5 and the rubber hits the road, it’s not all roses and white-sand bliss,
though much of it can be. Without the distraction of deadlines and co-workers, the big questions (such as
“What does it all mean?”) become harder to fend off for a later time. In a sea of infinite options,
decisions also become harder—What the hell should I do with my life? It’s like senior year in college all
over again.
Like all innovators ahead of the curve, you will have frightening moments of doubt. Once past the kidin-a-candy-store
phase, the comparative impulse will creep in. The rest of the world will continue with
its 9–5 grind, and you’ll begin to question your decision to step off the treadmill. Common doubts and
self-flagellation include the following:
1. Am I really doing this to be more free and lead a better life, or am I just lazy?
2. Did I quit the rat race because it’s bad, or just because I couldn’t hack it? Did I just cop out?
3. Is this as good as it gets? Perhaps I was better off when I was following orders and ignorant of the
possibilities. It was easier at least.
4. Am I really successful or just kidding myself?
5. Have I lowered my standards to make myself a winner? Are my friends, who are now making
twice as much as three years ago, really on the right track?
6. Why am I not happy? I can do anything and I’m still not happy. Do I even deserve it?
Most of this can be overcome as soon as we recognize it for what it is: outdated comparisons using the
more-is-better and money-as-success mind-sets that got us into trouble to begin with. Even so, there is a
more profound observation to be made.
These doubts invade the mind when nothing else fills it. Think of a time when you felt 100% alive and
undistracted—in the zone. Chances are that it was when you were completely focused in the moment on
something external: someone or something else. Sports and sex are two great examples. Lacking an
external focus, the mind turns inward on itself and creates problems to solve, even if the problems are
undefined or unimportant. If you find a focus, an ambitious goal that seems impossible and forces you to
grow, 81 these doubts disappear.
In the process of searching for a new focus, it is almost inevitable that the “big” questions will creep
in. There is pressure from pseudo-philosophers everywhere to cast aside the impertinent and answer the
eternal. Two popular examples are “What is the meaning of life?” and “What is the point of it all?”
There are many more, ranging from the introspective to the ontological, but I have one answer for
almost all of them—I don’t answer them at all.
I’m no nihilist. In fact, I’ve spent more than a decade investigating the mind and concept of meaning,
a quest that has taken me from the neuroscience laboratories of top universities to the halls of religious
institutions worldwide. The conclusion after it all is surprising.
I am 100% convinced that most big questions we feel compelled to face—handed down through
centuries of overthinking and mistranslation—use terms so undefined as to make attempting to answer
them a complete waste of time. 82 This isn’t depressing. It’s liberating.
Consider the question of questions: What is the meaning of life?
If pressed, I have but one response: It is the characteristic state or condition of a living organism. “But
that’s just a definition,” the questioner will retort, “that’s not what I mean at all.” What do you mean,
then? Until the question is clear—each term in it defined—there is no point in answering it. The
“meaning” of “life” question is unanswerable without further elaboration.
Before spending time on a stress-inducing question, big or otherwise, ensure that the answer is “yes”
to the following two questions:
1. Have I decided on a single meaning for each term in this question?
2. Can an answer to this question be acted upon to improve things?
“What is the meaning of life?” fails the first and thus the second. Questions about things beyond your
sphere of influence like “What if the train is late tomorrow?” fail the second and should thus be ignored.
These are not worthwhile questions. If you can’t define it or act upon it, forget it. If you take just this
point from this book, it will put you in the top 1% of performers in the world and keep most
philosophical distress out of your life.
Sharpening your logical and practical mental toolbox is not being an atheist or unspiritual. It’s not
being crass and it’s not being superficial. It’s being smart and putting your effort where it can make the
biggest difference for yourself and others.
The Point of It All: Drumroll, Please
What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a
worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task.
—VIKTOR E. FRANKL, Holocaust survivor; author of Man’s Search for Meaning
I believe that life exists to be enjoyed and that the most important thing is to feel good about yourself.
Each person will have his or her own vehicles for both, and those vehicles will change over time. For
some, the answer will be working with orphans, and for others, it will be composing music. I have a
personal answer to both—to love, be loved, and never stop learning—but I don’t expect that to be
universal.
Some criticize a focus on self-love and enjoyment as selfish or hedonistic, but it’s neither. Enjoying
life and helping others—or feeling good about yourself and increasing the greater good—are no more
mutually exclusive than being agnostic and leading a moral life. One does not preclude the other. Let’s
assume we agree on this. It still leaves the question, “What can I do with my time to enjoy life and feel
good about myself?”
I can’t offer a single answer that will fit all people, but, based on the dozens of fulfilled NR I’ve
interviewed, there are two components that are fundamental: continual learning and service.
Learning Unlimited: Sharpening the Saw
Americans who travel abroad for the first time are often shocked to discover that, despite all the
progress that has been made in the last 30 years, many foreign people still speak in foreign
languages.
—DAVE BARRY
To live is to learn. I see no other option. This is why I’ve felt compelled to quit or be fired from jobs
within the first six months or so. The learning curve flattens out and I get bored.
Though you can upgrade your brain domestically, traveling and relocating provides unique conditions
that make progress much faster. The different surroundings act as a counterpoint and mirror for your own
prejudices, making weaknesses that much easier to fix. I rarely travel somewhere without deciding first
how I’ll obsess on a specific skill. Here are a few examples:
Connemara, Ireland: Gaelic Irish, Irish flute, and hurling, the
fastest field sport in the world (imagine a mix of lacrosse and
rugby played with axe handles)
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: Brazilian Portuguese and Brazilian jujitsu
Berlin, Germany: German and locking (a form of upright breakdancing)
I tend to focus on language acquisition and one kinesthetic skill, sometimes finding the latter after
landing overseas. The most successful serial vagabonds tend to blend the mental and the physical. Notice
that I often transport a skill I practice domestically—martial arts—to other countries where they are also
practiced. Instant social life and camaraderie. It need not be a competitive sport—it could be hiking,
chess, or almost anything that keeps your nose out of a textbook and you out of your apartment. Sports
just happen to be excellent for avoiding foreign-language stage fright and developing lasting friendships
while still sounding like Tarzan.
Language learning deserves special mention. It is, bar none, the best thing you can do to hone clear
thinking.
Quite aside from the fact that it is impossible to understand a culture without understanding its
language, acquiring a new language makes you aware of your own language: your own thoughts. The
benefits of becoming fluent in a foreign tongue are as underestimated as the difficulty is overestimated.
Thousands of theoretical linguists will disagree, but I know from research and personal experimentation
with more than a dozen languages that (1) adults can learn languages much faster than children 83 when
constant 9–5 work is removed and that (2) it is possible to become conversationally fluent in any
language in six months or less. At four hours per day, six months can be whittled down to less than three
months. It is beyond the scope of this book to explain applied linguistics and the 80/20 of language
learning, but resources and complete how-to guides can be found under “language” at
www.fourhourblog.com. I learned six languages after failing Spanish in high school, and you can do the
same with the right tools.
Gain a language and you gain a second lens through which to question and understand the world.
Cursing at people when you go home is fun, too.
Don’t miss the chance to double your life experience.
Service for the Right Reasons: To Save the Whales, or Kill Them
and Feed the Children?
Morality is simply the attitude we adopt toward people we personally dislike.
—OSCAR WILDE
One would expect me to mention service in this chapter, and here it is. Like all before it, the twist is
a bit different. Service to me is simple: doing something that improves life besides your own. This is not
the same as philanthropy. Philanthropy is the altruistic concern for the well-being of mankind—human
life. Human life has long been focused on the exclusion of the environment and the rest of the food
chain, hence our current race to imminent extinction. Serves us right. The world does not exist solely for
the betterment and multiplication of mankind.
Before I start chaining myself to trees and saving the dart frogs, though, I should take my own advice:
Do not become a cause snob.
How can you help starving children in Africa when there are starving children in Los Angeles? How
can you save the whales when homeless people are freezing to death? How does doing volunteer
research on coral destruction help those people who need help now?
Children, please. Everything out there needs help, so don’t get baited into “my cause can beat up your
cause” arguments with no right answer. There are no qualitative or quantitative comparisons that make
sense. The truth is this: Those thousands of lives you save could contribute to a famine that kills millions,
or that one bush in Bolivia that you protect could hold the cure for cancer. The downstream effects are
unknown. Do your best and hope for the best. If you’re improving the world—however you define that—
consider your job well done.
Service isn’t limited to saving lives or the environment either. It can also improve life. If you are a
musician and put a smile on the faces of thousands or millions, I view that as service. If you are a mentor
and change the life of one child for the better, the world has been improved. Improving the quality of life
in the world is in no fashion inferior to adding more lives.
Service is an attitude.
Find the cause or vehicle that interests you most and make no apologies.
Q&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS
Adults are always asking kids what they want to be when they grow up because they are
looking for ideas.
—PAULA POUNDSTONE
The miracle is not to walk on water. The miracle is to walk on the green earth, dwelling deeply
in the present moment and feeling truly alive.
—THICH NHAT HANH
But I can’t just travel, learn languages, or fight for one cause for the rest of my life! Of course you
can’t. That’s not my suggestion at all. These are just good “life hubs”—starting points that lead to
opportunities and experiences that otherwise wouldn’t be found.
There is no right answer to the question “What should I do with my life?” Forget “should” altogether.
The next step—and that’s all it is—is pursuing something, it matters little what, that seems fun or
rewarding. Don’t be in a rush to jump into a full-time long-term commitment. Take time to find
something that calls to you, not just the first acceptable form of surrogate work. That calling will, in turn,
lead you to something else.
Here is a good sequence for getting started that dozens of NR have used with success.
1. Revisit ground zero: Do nothing.
Before we can escape the goblins of the mind, we need to face them. Principal among them is speed
addiction. It is hard to recalibrate your internal clock without taking a break from constant
overstimulation. Travel and the impulse to see a million things can exacerbate this.
Slowing down doesn’t mean accomplishing less; it means cutting out counterproductive distractions
and the perception of being rushed. Consider attending a short silence retreat of 3–7 days during which
all media and speaking is prohibited.
Learn to turn down the static of the mind so you can appreciate more before doing more:
The Art of Living Foundation (Course II)—International—( www.artofliving.org )
Spirit Rock Meditation Center in California ( http://www.spiritrock.org )
Kripalu Center for Yoga and Health in Massachusetts ( http://www.kripalu.org )
Sky Lake Lodge in New York ( http://www.sky-lake.org )
2. Make an anonymous donation to the service organization of your choice.
This helps to get the juices flowing and disassociate feeling good about service with getting credit for it.
It feels even better when it’s pure. Here are some good sites to get started:
Charity Navigator (www.charitynavigator.org)
This independent service ranks more than 5,000 charities using criteria you select. Create a personalized
page of favorites and compare them side by side, all free of charge.
Firstgiving (www.firstgiving.com)
Firstgiving.com allows you to create an online fund-raising page. Donations can be made through your
personal URL. I have used Firstgiving in coordination with a nonprofit called Room to Read to build
schools in both Nepal and Vietnam, with more countries pending: www.firstgiving.com/timferriss and
www.firstgiving.com/timferriss2. If you specifically want to help animals, for example, you can click on
a related link and access websites for hundreds of different animal charities, and then decide which one
you want to donate to. The UK version of the website is http://www.justgiving.com.
Network for Good (www.networkforgood.org)
Visitors to this website will find links to charities in need of donations as well as opportunities to do
volunteer work. They can also set up an automated credit card donation online.
3. Take a learning mini-retirement in combination with local volunteering.
Take a mini-retirement—six months or more if possible—to focus on learning and serving. The longer
duration will permit a language focus, which in turn enables more meaningful interaction and
contribution through volunteering.
For the duration of this trip, note self-criticisms and negative self-talk in a journal. Whenever upset or
anxious, ask “why” at least three times and put the answers down on paper. Describing these doubts in
writing reduces their impact twofold. First, it’s often the ambiguous nature of self-doubt that hurts most.
Defining and exploring it in writing—just as with forcing colleagues to e-mail—demands clarity of
thought, after which most concerns are found to be baseless. Second, recording these concerns seems to
somehow remove them from your head.
But where to go and what to do? There is no one right answer to either. Use the following questions
and resources to brainstorm:
What makes you most angry about the state of the world?
What are you most afraid of for the next generation, whether you have children or not?
What makes you happiest in your life? How can you help others have the same?
There is no need to limit yourself to one location. Remember Robin, who traveled through South
America for a year with her husband and seven-year-old son? The three of them spent one to two
months doing volunteer work in each location, including building wheelchairs in Banos, Ecuador,
rehabilitating exotic animals in the Bolivian rain forest, and shepherding leather-back sea turtles in
Suriname.
How about doing archaeological excavation in Jordan or tsunami relief on the islands of Thailand?
These are just two of the dozens of foreign relocation and volunteering case studies in each issue of
Verge Magazine (www.vergemagazine.com). Reader-tested resources include:

4. Revisit and reset dreamlines.
Following the mini-retirement, revisit the dreamlines set in Definition and reset them as needed. The
following questions will help:
What are you good at?
What could you be the best at?
What makes you happy?
What excites you?
What makes you feel accomplished and good about yourself?
What are you most proud of having accomplished in your life? Can you repeat this or further develop
it?
What do you enjoy sharing or experiencing with other people?
5. Based on the outcomes of steps 1–4, consider testing new part- or full-time vocations.
Full-time work isn’t bad if it’s what you’d rather be doing. This is where we distinguish “work” from a
“vocation.”
If you have created a muse or cut your hours down to next to nothing, consider testing a part-time or
full-time vocation: a true calling or dream occupation. This is what I did with this book. I can now tell
people I’m a writer rather than giving them the two-hour drug dealer explanation. What did you dream of
being when you were a kid? Perhaps it’s time to sign up for Space Camp or intern as an assistant to a
marine biologist.
Recapturing the excitement of childhood isn’t impossible. In fact, it’s required. There are no more
chains—or excuses—to hold you back.
81. Abraham Maslow, the American psychologist famous for proposing “Mas-low’s Hierarchy of
Needs,” would term this goal a “peak experience.”
82. There is a place for koans and rhetorical meditative questions, but these tools are optional and
outside the scope of this book. Most questions without answers are just poorly worded.

Language Acquisition (Basic Books, 1995).
The Top 13 New Rich Mistakes
If you don’t make mistakes, you’re not working on hard enough problems. And that’s a big
mistake.
—FRANK WILCZEK, 2004 Nobel Prize winner in physics
Ho imparato che niente e impossibile, e anche che quasi niente e facile … (I’ve learned that
nothing is impossible, and that almost nothing is easy …)
—ARTICOLO 31 (Italian rap group), “Un Urlo”
Mistake are the name of the game in lifestyle design. It requires fighting impulse after impulse
from the old world of retirement-based life deferral. Here are the slipups you will make. Don’t get
frustrated. It’s all part of the process.
1. Losing sight of dreams and falling into work for work’s sake (W4W) Please reread the
introduction and next chapter of this book whenever you feel yourself falling into this trap. Everyone
does it, but many get stuck and never get out.
2. Micromanaging and e-mailing to fill time Set the responsibilities, problem scenarios and rules, and
limits of autonomous decision-making—then stop, for the sanity of everyone involved.
3. Handling problems your outsourcers or co-workers can handle
4. Helping outsourcers or co-workers with the same problem more than once, or with noncrisis
problems Give them if-then rules for solving all but the largest problems. Give them the freedom to act
without your input, set the limits in writing, and then emphasize in writing that you will not respond to
help with problems that are covered by these rules. In my particular case, all outsourcers have at their
discretion the ability to fix any problem that will cost less than $400. At the end of each month or
quarter, depending on the outsourcer, I review how their decisions have affected profit and adjust the
rules accordingly, often adding new rules based on their good decisions and creative solutions.
5. Chasing customers, particularly unqualified or international prospects, when you have sufficient
cash flow to finance your nonfinancial pursuits
6. Answering e-mail that will not result in a sale or that can be answered by a FAQ or autoresponder
For a good example of an auto-responder that directs people to the appropriate information
and outsourcers, e-mailinfo@fourhourworkweek.com.
7. Working where you live, sleep, or should relax Separate your environments—designate a single
space for work and solely work—or you will never be able to escape it. 84
8. Not performing a thorough 80/20 analysis every two to four weeks for your business and
personal life
9. Striving for endless perfection rather than great or simply good enough, whether in your
personal or professional life Recognize that this is often just another W4W excuse. Most endeavors are
like learning to speak a foreign language: to be correct 95% of the time requires six months of
concentrated effort, whereas to be correct 98% of the time requires 20–30 years. Focus on great for a few
things and good enough for the rest. Perfection is a good ideal and direction to have, but recognize it for
what it is: an impossible destination.
10. Blowing minutiae and small problems out of proportion as an excuse to work
11. Making non-time-sensitive issues urgent in order to justify work How many times do I have to
say it? Focus on life outside of your bank accounts, as scary as that void can be in the initial stages. If
you cannot find meaning in your life, it is your responsibility as a human being to create it, whether that
is fulfilling dreams or finding work that gives you purpose and self-worth—ideally a combination of
both.
12. Viewing one product, job, or project as the end-all and be-all of your existence Life is too short
to waste, but it is also too long to be a pessimist or nihilist. Whatever you’re doing now is just a
stepping-stone to the next project or adventure. Any rut you get into is one you can get yourself out of.
Doubts are no more than a signal for action of some type. When in doubt or overwhelmed, take a break
and 80/20 both business and personal activities and relationships.
13. Ignoring the social rewards of life Surround yourself with smiling, positive people who have
absolutely nothing to do with work. Create your muses alone if you must, but do not live your life alone.
Happiness shared in the form of friendships and love is happiness multiplied.
84. To avoid the living room and coffee shop as offices, consider using a social “co-working” space
on occasion: http://coworking.pbwiki.com.
The Last Chapter
AN E-MAIL YOU NEED TO READ
There is nothing the busy man is less busied with than living; there is nothing harder to learn.
—SENECA
For the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: “If today
were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?” And whenever
the answer has been “No” for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something …
almost everything—all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure—
these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.
Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you
have something to lose.
—STEVE JOBS, college dropout and CEO of Apple Computer, Stanford University
Commencement, 2005 85
If you’re confused about life, you’re not alone. There are almost seven billion of us. This isn’t a
problem, of course, once you realize that life is neither a problem to be solved nor a game to be won.
If you are too intent on making the pieces of a nonexistent puzzle fit, you miss out on all the real fun.
The heaviness of success-chasing can be replaced with a serendipitous lightness when you recognize that
the only rules and limits are those we set for ourselves.
So be bold and don’t worry about what people think. They don’t do it that often anyway.
Two years ago, I was forwarded the following poem—originally written by child psychologist David
L. Weatherford—by a close friend. He quit his own deferred-life plan after reading it, and I hope you
will do the same. Here it is.
Have you ever watched kids
On a merry-go-round?
Or listened to the rain
Slapping on the ground?
Ever followed a butterfly’s erratic flight?
Or gazed at the sun into the fading night?
You better slow down.
Don’t dance so fast.
Time is short.
The music won’t last.
Do you run through each day
On the fly?
SLOW DANCE
When you ask: How are you?
Do you hear the reply?
When the day is done,
do you lie in your bed
With the next hundred chores
Running through your head?
You’d better slow down.
Don’t dance so fast.
Time is short.
The music won’t last.
Ever told your child,
We’ll do it tomorrow?
And in your haste,
Not see his sorrow?
Ever lost touch,
Let a good friendship die
Cause you never had time
To call and say, “Hi”?
You’d better slow down.
Don’t dance so fast.
Time is short.
The music won’t last.
When you run so fast to get somewhere
You miss half the fun of getting there.
When you worry and hurry through your day,
It is like an unopened gift thrown away.
Life is not a race.
Do take it slower.
Hear the music
Before the song is over.

THE BEST OF THE BLOG
The Art of Letting Bad Things Happen
[AFTER 3 WEEKS OFF OF THE BLOG]
Long time no see! I just landed back in California from a long overdue mini-retirement through
London, Scotland, Sardinia, the Slovak Republic, Austria, Amsterdam, and Japan. Some unpleasant
surprises awaited me when I checked in on the evil e-mail inbox. Why? I let them happen.
I always do.
Here are just a few of the goodies that awaited me this time:
One of our fulfillment companies had been shut down due to the
CEO’s death, causing a 20%+ loss in monthly orders and
requiring an emergency shift of all web design and order
processing
Missed radio and magazine appearances and upset would-be
interviewers
More than a dozen lost joint-venture partnership opportunities
It’s not that I go out of my way to irritate people—not at all—but I recognize one critical fact:
Oftentimes, in order to do the big things, you have to let the small bad things happen. This is a skill we
want to cultivate.
What did I get in exchange for temporarily putting on blinders and taking a few glancing blows?
I followed the Rugby World Cup in Europe and watched the New
Zealand All Blacks live, a dream I’ve had for the last five years.
I shot every gun I’ve ever dreamed of firing since brainwashing
myself with Commando . Bless the Slovak Republic and their
paramilitaries.
I filmed a television series pilot in Japan, a lifelong dream and the
most fun I’ve had in months, if not years.
I met with my Japanese publisher, Seishisha, and had media
interviews in Tokyo, where the 4HWW is now #1 in several of
the largest chains.
I took a complete 10-day media fast and felt like I’d had a twoyear
vacation from computers.
I attended the Tokyo International Film Festival and hung out with
one of my heroes, the producer of the Planet Earth television
series.
Once you realize that you can turn off the noise without the world ending, you’re liberated in a way
that few people ever know.
Just remember: If you don’t have attention, you don’t have time. Did I have time to check e-mail and
voicemail? Sure. It might take 10 minutes. Did I have the attention to risk fishing for crises in those 10
minutes? Not at all.
As tempting as it is to “just check e-mail for one minute,” I didn’t do it. I know from experience that
any problem found in the inbox will linger in the brain for hours or days after you shut down the
computer, rendering “free time” useless with preoccupation. It’s the worst of states, where you
experience neither relaxation nor productivity. Be focused on work or focused on something else, never
in-between.
Time without attention is worthless, so value attention over time.
Here are a few questions that can help you pop on the productivity blinders and put things in
perspective. Even when you’re not traveling the world, develop the habit of letting small bad things
happen. If you don’t, you’ll never find time for the life-changing big things, whether important tasks or
true peak experiences. If you do force the time but puncture it with distractions, you won’t have the
attention to appreciate it.
What is the one goal, if completed, that could change everything?
What is the most urgent thing right now that you feel you “must”
or “should” do?
Can you let the urgent “fail”—even for a day—to get to the next
milestone for your potential life-changing tasks?
What’s been on your to-do list the longest? Start it first thing in
the morning and don’t allow interruptions or lunch until you
finish.
Will “bad” things happen? Small problems will crop up, yes. A few people will complain and quickly
get over it. BUT, the bigger picture items you complete will let you see these for what they are—minutiae
and repairable hiccups.
Make this trade a habit. Let the small bad things happen and make the big good things happen. —
OCTOBER 25, 2007
Things I’ve Loved and Learned in 2008
2008 was one of the most exciting years of my life. I did more dealmaking and met more people than
in the last five years combined. This produced many surprise insights about business and human nature,
especially as I uncovered dozens of my own false assumptions.
Here are some of the things I learned and loved in 2008.
Favorite reads of 2008: Zorba the Greek and Seneca: Letters from a Stoic. These are two of the most
readable books of practical philosophies I’ve ever had the fortune to encounter. If you have to choose
one, get Zorba, but Lucius Seneca will take you further. Both are fast reads of 2–3 evenings.
Don’t accept large or costly favors from strangers. This karmic debt will come back to haunt you. If
you can’t pass it up, immediately return to karmic neutrality with a gift of your choosing. Repay it before
they set the terms for you. Exceptions: über-successful mentors who are making introductions and not
laboring on your behalf.
You don’t have to recoup losses the same way you lose them. I own a home in San Jose but moved
almost 12 months ago. It’s been empty since, and I’m paying a large mortgage each month. The best
part? I don’t care. But this wasn’t always the case. For many months, I felt demoralized as others
pressured me to rent it, emphasizing how I was just flushing money away otherwise. Then I realized:
You don’t have to make money back the same way you lose it. If you lose $1,000 at the blackjack table,
should you try and recoup it there? Of course not. I don’t want to deal with renters, even with a property
management company. The solution: Leave the house alone, use it on occasion, and just create incoming
revenue elsewhere that would cover the cost of the mortgage through consulting, publishing, etc.
One of the most universal causes of self-doubt and depression: trying to impress people you don’t
like. Stressing to impress is fine, but do it for the right people—those you want to emulate.
Slow meals = life. From Daniel Gilbert of Harvard to Martin Seligman of Princeton, the “happiness”
(self-reported well-being) researchers seem to agree on one thing: Mealtime with friends and loved ones
is a direct predictor of well-being. Have at least one 2-to-3-hour dinner and/or drinks per week—yes, 2–
3 hours—with those who make you smile and feel good. I find the afterglow effect to be greatest and
longest with groups of five or more. Two times that are conducive to this: Thursday dinners or afterdinner
drinks and Sunday brunches.
Adversity doesn’t build character; it reveals it.
Related: Money doesn’t change you; it reveals who you are when you no longer have to be nice.
It doesn’t matter how many people don’t get it. What matters is how many people do. If you have a
strong informed opinion, don’t keep it to yourself. Try to help people and make the world a better place.
If you strive to do anything remotely interesting, just expect a small percentage of the population to
always find a way to take it personally. F*ck ’em. There are no statues erected to critics.
Related: You’re never as bad as they say you are. My agent used to send me every blog or media hit
for The 4-Hour Workweek. Eight weeks after publication, I asked him to only forward me positive
mentions in major media or factual inaccuracies I needed to respond to. An important correlate: You’re
never as good as they say you are, either. It’s not helpful to get a big head or get depressed. The former
makes you careless and the latter makes you lethargic. I wanted to have untainted optimism but remain
hungry. Speaking of hungry …
Eat a high-protein breakfast within 30 minutes of waking and go for a 10-to-20-minute walk
outside afterward, ideally bouncing a handball or tennis ball. This one habit is better than a handful
of Prozac in the morning. (Suggested reading: The 3-Minute Slow-Carb Breakfast, How to “Peel”
Hardboiled Eggs Without Peeling on www.fourhourblog.com.) I dislike losing money about 50x more
than I like making it. Why 50X? Logging time as an experiment, I concluded that I often spend at least
50 x more time to prevent a hypothetical unit of $100 from being lost vs. earned. The hysterical part is
that, even after becoming aware of this bias, it’s hard to prevent the latter response. Therefore, I
manipulate the environmental causes of poor responses instead of depending on error-prone selfdiscipline.
I should not invest in public stocks where I cannot influence outcomes. Once realizing that almost no
one can predict risk tolerance and response to losses, I moved all of my investments into fixed-income
and cashlike instruments in July 2008 for this reason, setting aside 10% of pretax income for angel
investments where I can contribute significant UI/design, PR, and corporate partnership help. (Suggested

A good question to revisit whenever overwhelmed: Are you having a breakdown or a
breakthrough?
Rehearse poverty regularly—restrict even moderate expenses for 1–2 weeks and give away 20%+
of minimally used clothing—so you can think big and take “risks” without fear (Seneca).
A mindset of scarcity (which breeds jealousy and unethical behavior) is due to a disdain for those things
easily obtained (Seneca).
A small cup of black Kenyan AA coffee with cinnamon on top, no milk or sweeteners.
It’s usually better to keep old resolutions than to make new ones.
To bring in a wonderful 2009, I’d like to quote an e-mail I received from a mentor of more than a
decade:
While many are wringing their hands, I recall the 1970s when we were suffering from an oil shock
causing long lines at gas stations, rationing, and 55 MPH speed limits on federal highways, a recession,
very little venture capital ($50 million per year into VC firms), and what President Jimmy Carter
(wearing a sweater while addressing the nation on TV because he had turned down the heat in the White
House) called a “malaise.” It was during those times that two kids without any real college education,
Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, started companies that did pretty well. Opportunities abound in bad times as
well as good times. In fact, the opportunities are often greater when the conventional wisdom is that
everything is going into the toilet.
Well… we’re nearing the end of another great year, and despite what we read about the outlook for
2009, we can look forward to a New Year filled with opportunities as well as stimulating challenges.
Happy New Year, everyone.
How to Travel the World with 10 Pounds or Less
Hauling a five-piece Samsonite set around the planet is hell on earth. I watched a friend do this up
and down dozens of subway and hotel staircases in Europe for three weeks, and—while I laughed a lot,
especially when he resorted to just dragging or throwing his bags down stairs—I’d like to save you the
breakdown. Trip enjoyment is inversely proportionate to the amount of crap (read: distractions) you bring
with you.
Practice in 30-plus countries has taught me that minimalist packing can be an art.
I returned from Costa Rica last Wednesday and have since landed in Maui, where I’ll stay for one
week. What did I pack and why? (See the companion video at www.fourhourblog.com. 86 )
I practice what I’ll label the BIT method of travel: Buy It There.
If you pack for every possible contingency—better bring the hiking books in case we go hiking, better
bring an umbrella in case it rains, better bring dress shoes and slacks in case we go to a nice restaurant,
etc.—carrying a mule-worthy load is inevitable. I’ve learned to instead allocate $50–200 per trip to a
“settling fund,” which I use to buy needed items once they’re 100% needed. This includes cumbersome
and hassle items like umbrellas and bottles of sunscreen that love to explode. Also, never buy if you can
borrow. If you’re going on a bird-watching trip in Costa Rica, you don’t need to bring binoculars—
someone else will have them.
Here’s the Maui list.
1 featherweight Marmot Ion jacket (3 oz.!)
1 breathable Coolibar long-sleeve shirt to prevent sunburn. This
saved me in Panama.
1 pair of polyester pants. Polyester is light, wrinkle-resistant, and
dries quickly. Disco dancers and flashpackers dig it.
1 Kensington laptop lock, also used to secure all bags to stationary
objects
1 single Under Armour sock, used to store sunglasses
2 nylon tanktops
1 large MSR quick-dry microfiber towel, absorbs up to seven
times its weight in water
1 Ziploc bag containing toothbrush, travel toothpaste, and
disposable razor
1 Fly Clear biometric travel card ( www.flyclear.com ), 87 which
cuts down my airport wait time about 95%
2 pairs of ExOfficio lightweight underwear. Their tagline is “17
countries. 6 weeks. And one pair of underwear.” I think I’ll opt
for two, considering they weigh about as much as a handful of
Kleenex. One other nice side effect of their weight: They’re much
more comfortable than normal cotton underwear.
2 pairs of shorts/swimsuits
2 books: Lonely Planet Hawaii and The Entrepreneurial
Imperative . (The latter comes highly recommended. Check it
out.)
1 sleeping mask and earplugs
1 pair of Reef sandals. Best to get a pair with removable straps
that go around the heel.
1 Canon PowerShot SD300 digital camera with extra 2GB SD
memory card. God, I love this camera more than words can
describe. It is the best designed piece of electronics I have ever
owned. I now use it not only for all of my photos and videos, but
also as a replacement for my scanner. I’m considering testing the
newer and cheaper SD1000.
1 coffee-harvesting hat to prevent my pale skin from burning off
1 Kiva keychain expandable duffel bag
1 Chapstick, 1 Mag-Lite Solitaire flashlight, and 1 roll of athletic
tape. The last is a lifesaver. It’s as useful as duct tape for repairing
objects but gentle enough to use on injuries, which I am fond of
inflicting on myself.
1 Lewis and Clark flex lock (for luggage, lockers, zippers, or
whatever I need to lock down/shut together). Standard minipadlocks
are often too cumbersome to thread through holes on
lockers, etc.
1 Radio Shack kitchen timer, which I’ve been using to wake up for
about four years. The problem with using a cell phone alarm to
wake up is simple: The phone often needs to be on, and even if
you use vibrate, people can call and wake you up before you want
to wake up. The second benefit to using a kitchen timer is that
you know exactly how much sleep you are—or aren’t—getting,
and you can experiment with things like caffeine power naps of
different durations … but that’s another post;)

The Choice-Minimal Lifestyle: 6 Formulas for More Output and
Less Overwhelm
I was stressed out… over dog cartoons.
It was 9:47 P.M. at Barnes and Noble on a recent Saturday night, and I had 13 minutes to find a
suitable exchange for The New Yorker Dog Cartoons, $22 of expensive paper. Bestsellers? Staff
recommends? New arrivals or classics? I’d already been there 30 minutes.
Beginning to feel overwhelmed with a ridiculous errand I’d expected to take five minutes, I stumbled
across the psychology section. One tome jumped out at me as all too appropriate—The Paradox of
Choice: Why More Is Less. It wasn’t the first time I’d seen or read Barry Schwartz’s 2004 classic, but it
seemed like a good time to revisit the principles, among them, that:
The more options you consider, the more buyer’s regret you’ll
have.
The more options you encounter, the less fulfilling your ultimate
outcome will be.
This raises a difficult question: Is it better to have the best outcome but be less satisfied, or have an
acceptable outcome and be satisfied?
For example, would you rather deliberate for months and get the 1 of 20 houses that’s the best
investment but second-guess yourself until you sell it five years later, or would you rather get a house
that is 80% of the investment potential of the former (still to be sold at a profit) but never second-guess
it?
Tough call.
Schwartz also recommends making nonreturnable purchases. I decided to keep the stupid pooch
cartoons. Why? Because it’s not just about being satisfied, it’s about being practical.
Income is renewable, but some other resources—like attention—are not. I’ve talked before about
attention as a currency and how it determines the value of time.
For example: Is your weekend really free if you find a crisis in the inbox Saturday morning that you
can’t address until Monday morning?
Even if the inbox scan lasts 30 seconds, the preoccupation and forward projection for the subsequent
48 hours effectively deletes that experience from your life. You had time but you didn’t have attention,
so the time had no practical value.
The choice-minimal lifestyle becomes an attractive tool when we consider two truths.
1. Considering options costs attention that then can’t be spent on action or present-state
awareness.
2. Attention is necessary for not only productivity but appreciation.
Therefore:
Too many choices = less or no productivity
Too many choices = less or no appreciation
Too many choices = sense of overwhelm
What to do? There are six basic rules or formulas that can be used:
1. Set rules for yourself so you can automate as much decision making as possible [see the rules I
use to outsource my e-mail to Canada, included at the end of this section, as an example of this].
2. Don’t provoke deliberation before you can take action.
One simple example: Don’t scan the inbox on Friday evening or over the weekend if you might
encounter work problems that can’t be addressed until Monday.
3. Don’t postpone decisions just to avoid uncomfortable conversations.
If an acquaintance asks you if you want to come to their house for dinner next week, and you know you
won’t, don’t say, “I’m not sure. I’ll let you know next week.” Instead, use something soft but conclusive
like, “Next week? I’m pretty sure I have another commitment on Thursday, but thank you for the invite.
Just so I don’t leave you hanging, let’s assume I can’t make it, but can I let you know if that changes?”
Decision made. Move on.
4. Learn to make nonfatal or reversible decisions as quickly as possible.
Set time limits (I won’t consider options for more than 20 minutes), option limits (I’ll consider no more
than three options), or finance thresholds (Example: If it costs less than $100 [or the potential damage is
less than $100], I’ll let a virtual assistant make the judgment call).
I wrote most of this post after landing at the monster that is ATL airport in Atlanta. I could have
considered half a dozen types of ground transportation in 15 minutes and saved 30–40%, but I grabbed a
taxi instead. To use illustrative numbers: I didn’t want to sacrifice 10 attention units of my remaining 50
of 100 total potential units, since those 10 units couldn’t then be spent on this article. I had about eight
hours before bedtime due to time zone differences—plenty of time—but scarce usable attention after an
all-nighter of fun and the cross-country flight. Fast decisions preserve usable attention for what
matters.
5. Don’t strive for variation—and thus increase option consideration—when it’s not needed.
Routine enables innovation where it’s most valuable.
In working with athletes, for example, it’s clear that those who maintain the lowest bodyfat percentage
eat the same foods over and over with little variation. I’ve eaten the same “slow-carb” breakfast and
lunch for nearly two years, 88 putting variation only into meals that I focus on for enjoyment: dinner and
all meals on Saturdays. This same routine-variation distinction can be found in exercise vs. recreation.
For fat loss and muscle gain (even as much as 34 pounds in four weeks), I’ve followed the same time—
minimal exercise protocol with occasional experiments since 1996. For recreation, however, where the
focus is enjoyment and not efficacy, I tend to try something new each weekend, whether climbing at
Mission Cliffs in San Francisco or mountain biking from tasting to tasting in Napa.
Don’t confuse what should be results-driven with routine (e.g., exercise) with something enjoymentdriven
that benefits from variation (e.g., recreation).
6. Regret is past-tense decision making. Eliminate complaining to minimize regret.
Condition yourself to notice complaints and stop making them with a simple program like the “21-day
no-complaint experiment” made famous by Will Bowen, where you wear a single bracelet and move it
from one wrist to the other each time you complain. The goal is 21 days without complaining and you
reset to 0 each time you slip up. This increased awareness helps prevent useless past-tense deliberation
and negative emotions that improve nothing but deplete your attention.
DECISION-MAKING ISN’T to be avoided—that’s not the problem. Look at a good CEO or top corporate
performer and you’ll see a high volume of decisions.
It’s deliberation—the time we vacillate over and consider each decision—that’s the attention
consumer. Total deliberation time, not the number of decisions, determines your attention bank
account balance (or debt).
Let’s assume you pay 10% over time by following the above rules but cut your average “decision
cycle” time by an average of 40% (10 minutes reduced to 6 minutes, for example). Not only will you
have much more time and attention to spend on revenue-generating activities, but you’ll get greater
enjoyment from what you have and experience. Consider that 10% additional cost as an investment and
part of your “ideal lifestyle tax,” but not as a loss.
Embrace the choice-minimal lifestyle. It’s a subtle and under-exploited philosophical tool that
produces dramatic increases in both output and satisfaction, all with less overwhelm.
Make testing a few of the principles the first of many fast and reversible decisions. —FEBRUARY 6,

The Not-to-Do List: 9 Habits to Stop Now
“Not-to-do” lists are often more effective than to-do lists for upgrading performance.
The reason is simple: What you don’t do determines what you can do.
Here are nine stressful and common habits that entrepreneurs and office workers should strive to
eliminate. The bullets are followed by more detailed descriptions. Focus on one or two at a time, just as
you would with high-priority to-do items.
1. Do not answer calls from unrecognized phone numbers.
Feel free to surprise others, but don’t be surprised. It just results in unwanted interruption or poor
negotiating positions. Let it go to voicemail, and consider using a service like GrandCentral (you can
listen to people leaving voicemail or receive them as text messages) or Phonetag.com (receive voicemails
as e-mail).
2. Do not e-mail first thing in the morning or last thing at night.
The former scrambles your priorities and plans for the day, and the latter just gives you insomnia. E-mail
can wait until 10 A.M., after you’ve completed at least one of your critical to-do items.
3. Do not agree to meetings or calls with no clear agenda or end time.
If the desired outcome is defined clearly with a stated objective and agenda listing topics/questions to
cover, no meeting or call should last more than 30 minutes. Request them in advance so you “can best
prepare and make good use of the time together.”
4. Do not let people ramble.
Forget “How’s it going?” when someone calls you. Stick with “What’s up?” or “I’m in the middle of
getting something out, but what’s going on?” A big part of GTD (Getting Things Done) is GTP—Getting
To the Point.
5. Do not check e-mail constantly—“batch” and check at set times only.
I belabor this point enough. Get off the cocaine pellet dispenser and focus on execution of your top todo’s
instead of responding to manufactured emergencies. Set up a strategic autoresponder and check
twice or thrice daily.
6. Do not over-communicate with low-profit, high-maintenance customers.
There is no sure path to success, but the surest path to failure is trying to please everyone. Do an 80/20
analysis of your customer base in two ways—which 20% are producing 80%+ of my profit, and which
20% are consuming 80%+ of my time? Then put the loudest and least productive on autopilot by citing a
change in company policies. Send them an e-mail with new rules as bullet points: number of permissible
phone calls, e-mail response time, minimum orders, etc. Offer to point them to another provider if they
aren’t able to adopt the new policies.
7. Do not work more to fix overwhelmingness—prioritize.
If you don’t prioritize, everything seems urgent and important. If you define the single most important
task for each day, almost nothing seems urgent or important. Oftentimes, it’s just a matter of letting little
bad things happen (return a phone call late and apologize, pay a small late fee, lose an unreasonable
customer, etc.) to get the big important things done. The answer to overwhelmingness is not spinning
more plates—or doing more—it’s defining the few things that can really fundamentally change your
business and life.
8. Do not carry a cell phone or Crackberry 24/7.
Take at least one day off of digital leashes per week. Turn them off or, better still, leave them in the
garage or in the car. I do this on at least Saturday, and I recommend you leave the phone at home if you
go out for dinner. So what if you return a phone call an hour later or the next morning? As one reader
put it to a miffed co-worker who worked 24/7 and expected the same: “I’m not the president of the U.S.
No one should need me at 8 P.M. at night. OK, you didn’t get a hold of me. But what bad happened?”
The answer? Nothing.
9. Do not expect work to fill a void that non-work relationships and activities should.
Work is not all of life. Your co-workers shouldn’t be your only friends. Schedule life and defend it just
as you would an important business meeting. Never tell yourself “I’ll just get it done this weekend.”
Review Parkinson’s Law and force yourself to cram within tight hours so your per-hour productivity
doesn’t fall through the floor. Focus, get the critical few done, and get out. E-mailing all weekend is no
way to spend the little time you have on this planet.
It’s hip to focus on getting things done, but it’s only possible once we remove the constant static and
distraction. If you have trouble deciding what to do, just focus on not doing. Different means, same
end. —AUGUST 16, 2007
The Margin Manifesto: 11 Tenets for Reaching (or Doubling)
Profitability in 3 Months
Profitability often requires better rules and speed, not more time. The financial goal of a start-up
should be simple: profit in the least time with the least effort. Not more customers, not more revenue, not
more offices or more employees. More profit.
Based on my interviews with high-performing (using profit-per-employee metrics) CEOs in more than
a dozen countries, here are the 11 basic tenets of the “Margin Manifesto” … a return-to-basics call that
gives permission to do the uncommon to achieve the uncommon: consistent profitability, or doubling of
it, in three months or less.
I review the following principles whenever facing operational overwhelmingness or
declining/stagnating profits. Hope you find them useful.
1. Niche Is the New Big—The Lavish Dwarf Entertainment Rule
Several years ago, an investment banker was jailed for trade violations. He was caught partly due to his
lavish parties on yachts, often featuring hired dwarves. The owner of the dwarf rental company, Danny
Black, was quoted in the Wall Street Journal as saying “Some people are just into lavish dwarf
entertainment.” Niche is the new big. But here’s the secret: It’s possible to niche market and mass sell.
iPod commercials don’t feature dancing 50-year-olds, they feature hip and fit 20- and 30-somethings, but
everyone and his grandmother wants to feel youthful and hip, so they strap on Nanos and call themselves
Apple converts. Who you portray in your marketing isn’t necessarily the only demographic who buys
your product—it’s often the demographic that most people want to identify with or belong to. The target
isn’t the market. No one aspires to be the bland average, so don’t water down messaging to appeal to
everyone—it will end up appealing to no one.
2. Revisit Drucker—What Gets Measured Gets Managed
Measure compulsively, for as Peter Drucker stated, What gets measured gets managed. Useful metrics to
track, besides the usual operational stats, include CPO (“Cost-Per-Order,” which includes advertising,
fulfillment and expected returns, charge-backs, and bad debt), ad allowable (the maximum you can spend
on an advertisement and expect to break even), MER (media efficiency ratio), and projected lifetime
value (LV) given return rates and reorder percent. Consider applying direct response advertising metrics
to your business.
3. Pricing Before Product—Plan Distribution First
Is your pricing scalable? Many companies will sell direct-to-consumer by necessity in early stages, only
to realize that their margins can’t accommodate resellers and distributors when they come knocking. If
you have a 40% profit margin and a distributor needs a 70% discount to sell into wholesale accounts,
you’re forever limited to direct-to-consumer … unless you increase your pricing and margins. It’s best to
do this beforehand if possible—otherwise, you’ll need to launch new or “premium” products—so plan
distribution before setting pricing. Test assumptions and find hidden costs by interviewing those who
have done it: Will you need to pay for co-op advertising, offer rebates for bulk purchases, or pay for
shelf space or featured placement? I know one former CEO of a national brand who had to sell his
company to one of the world’s largest soft drink manufacturers before he could access front-of-store
shelving in top retailers. Test your assumptions and do your homework before setting pricing.
4. Less Is More—Limiting Distribution to Increase Profit
Is more distribution automatically better? No. Uncontrolled distribution leads to all manner of headache
and profit-bleeding, most often related to rogue discounters. Reseller A lowers pricing to compete with
online discounter B, and the price cutting continues until neither is making sufficient profit on the
product and both stop reordering. This requires you to launch a new product, as price erosion is almost
always irreversible. Avoid this scenario and consider partnering with one or two key distributors instead,
using that exclusivity to negotiate better terms: less discounting, prepayment, preferred placement and
marketing support, etc. From iPods to Rolex and Estée Lauder, sustainable high-profit brands usually
begin with controlled distribution. Remember, more customers isn’t the goal; more profit is.
5. Net-Zero—Create Demand vs. Offering Terms
Focus on creating end-user demand so you can dictate terms. Often one trade publication advertisment,
bought at discount remnant rates, will be enough to provide this leverage. Outside of science and law,
most “rules” are just common practice. Just because everyone in your industry offers terms doesn’t mean
you have to, and offering terms is the most consistent ingredient in start-up failure. Cite start-up
economics and the ever-so-useful “company policy” as reasons for prepayment and apologize, but don’t
make exceptions. Net-30 becomes net-60, which becomes net-120. Time is the most expensive asset a
start-up has, and chasing delinquent accounts will prevent you from generating more sales. If customers
are asking for your product, resellers and distributors will need to buy it. It’s that simple. Put funds and
time into strategic marketing and PR to tip the scales in your favor.
6. Repetition Is Usually Redundant—Good Advertising Works the First Time
Use direct response advertising (call-to-action to a phone number or website) that is uniquely trackable
—fully accountable advertising—instead of image advertising, unless others are pre-purchasing to offset
the cost (e.g., “If you prepurchase 288 units, we’ll feature your store/URL/phone exclusively in a fullpage
ad in…”). Don’t listen to advertising salespeople who tell you that 3, 7, or 27 exposures are needed
before someone will act on an advertisement. Well-designed and well-targeted advertising works the first
time. If something works partially well (e.g., high response with low percentage conversion to sales, low
response with high conversion, etc.), indicating that a strong ROI might be possible with small changes,
tweak one controlled variable and microtest once more. Cancel anything that cannot be justified with a
trackable ROI.
7. Limit Downside to Ensure Upside—Sacrifice Margin for Safety
Don’t manufacture product in large quantities to increase margin unless your product and marketing are
tested and ready for rollout without changes. If a limited number of prototypes cost $10 per piece to
manufacture and sell for $11 each, that’s fine for the initial testing period, and essential for limiting
downside. Sacrifice margin temporarily for the testing phase, if need be, and avoid potentially fatal
upfront overcommitments.
8. Negotiate Late—Make Others Negotiate Against Themselves
Never make a first offer when purchasing. Flinch after the first offer (“$3,000!” followed by pure silence,
which uncomfortable salespeople fill by dropping the price once), let people negotiate against themselves
(“Is that really the best you can offer?” elicits at least one additional drop in price), then “bracket.” If
they end up at $2,000 and you want to pay $1,500, offer $1,250. They’ll counter with approximately
$1,750, to which you respond: “I’ll tell you what—let’s just split the difference. I’ll overnight FedEx you
a check, and we can call it a day.” The end result? Exactly what you wanted: $1,500.
9. Hyperactivity vs. Productivity—80/20 and Pareto’s Law
Being busy is not the same as being productive. Forget about the start-up overwork ethic that people
wear as a badge of honor—get analytical. The 80/20 principle, also known as Pareto’s Law, dictates that
80% of your desired outcomes are the result of 20% of your activities or inputs. Once per week, stop
putting out fires for an afternoon and run the numbers to ensure you’re placing effort in high-yield areas:
What 20% of customers/products/ regions are producing 80% of the profit? What are the factors that
could account for this? Invest in duplicating your few strong areas instead of fixing all of your
weaknesses.
10. The Customer Is Not Always Right—“Fire” High-Maintenance Customers
Not all customers are created equal. Apply the 80/20 principle to time consumption: What 20% of people
are consuming 80% of your time? Put high-maintenance, low-profit customers on autopilot—process
orders but don’t pursue them or check up on them—and “fire” high-maintenance, high-profit customers
by sending a memo detailing how a change in business model requires a few new policies: how often and
how to communicate, standardized pricing and order process, etc. Indicate that, for those clients whose
needs are incompatible with these new policies, you are happy to introduce other providers. “But what if
my largest customer consumes all of my time?” Recognize that (1) without time, you cannot scale your
company (and, oftentimes, life) beyond that customer, and (2) people, even good people, will
unknowingly abuse your time to the extent that you let them. Set good rules for all involved to minimize
back-and-forth and meaningless communication.
11. Deadlines Over Details—Test Reliability Before Capability
Skills are overrated. Perfect products delivered past deadline kill companies faster than decent products
delivered on time. Test someone’s ability to deliver on a specific and tight deadline before hiring them
based on a dazzling portfolio. Products can be fixed as long as you have cash flow, and bugs are
forgiven, but missing deadlines is often fatal. Calvin Coolidge once said that nothing is more common
than unsuccessful men with talent; I would add that the second most common is smart people who think
their IQ or resume justifies delivering late. —JUNE 24, 2008
The Holy Grail: How to Outsource the Inbox and Never Check E-
mail Again
What if you never had to check e-mail again? If you could hire someone else to spend countless
hours in your inbox instead of you?
This isn’t pure fantasy. For the last 12 months, I’ve experimented with removing myself from the
inbox entirely by training other people to behave like me. Not to imitate me, but to think like me.
Here’s the upshot: I get more than 1,000 e-mails a day from various accounts. 89 Rather than spending
6–8 hours per day checking e-mail, which I used to do, I can skip reading e-mail altogether for days or
even weeks at a time … all within 4–10 minutes a night.
Let me explain the basics, followed by tips and exact templates for outsourcing your own inbox.
1. I have multiple e-mail addresses for specific types of e-mail (blog readers vs. media vs.
friends/family, etc.). tim@ … is the default I give to new acquaintances, which goes to my assistant.
2. 99% of e-mail falls into predetermined categories of inquiries with set questions or responses (my
“rules” document is at the bottom of this post—feel free to steal, adapt, and use). My assistant(s) checks
and clears the inbox at 11 A.M. and 3 P.M. pst.
3. For the 1% of e-mail that might require my input for next actions, I have a once-daily phone call of
4–10 minutes at 4 P.M. pst with my assistant.
4. If I’m busy or traveling abroad, my assistant leaves the action items in numerical order on my
voicemail, which I can respond to in a bullet-point e-mail. These days, I actually prefer the voice-mail
option and find that it forces my assistant to be more prepared and more concise.
Each night (or early the next morning), I’ll listen to my assistant’s voicemail via Skype and
simultaneously write out the next actions (1. Bob: Tell him that … 2. Jose in Peru: Ask him for … 3.
Speaking in NC: Confirm …, etc.) in a Skype chat or quick e-mail. How long does the new system take?
4–10 minutes instead of 6–8 hours of filtering and repetitive responses.
If you only have one e-mail account, I recommend using a desktop program like Outlook or Mail
instead of a web-based program like Gmail for a simple reason: If you see new items in your inbox,
you’ll check them. Like they say in AA: If you don’t want to slip, don’t go where it’s slippery. This is
why I have a private personal account that I use for sending e-mail to my assistant and communicating
with friends. It’s almost always empty.
E-mail is the last thing people let go of. Fortune 500 CEOs, best-selling authors, celebrities—I know
dozens of top performers who delegate everything but e-mail, which they latch onto as something only
they can do. “No one can check my e-mail for me” is the unquestioned assumption, or “I answer every
e-mail I receive” is the unquestioned bragging right that keeps them in front of a computer for 8–12
hours at a stretch. It’s not fun, and it keeps them from higher-impact or more rewarding activities.
Get over yourself. I had to. Checking e-mail isn’t some amazing skill that you alone possess.
In fact, checking e-mail is like everything else: a process.
How you evaluate and handle (delete vs. archive vs. forward vs. respond) e-mail is just a series of
questions you ask yourself, whether consciously or subconsciously. I have a document called “Tim
Ferriss Processing Rules,” to which my assistants add rules when I send them a note via e-mail with
“ADD TO RULES” in the subject. Over the course of a week or two with a virtual assistant (VA), you
will end up with an externalized set of rules that reflect how your brain processes e-mail. It often shows
you how haphazard your processing is. I’ve included my “rules” here to save you some time. A few tips:
1. Setting appointments and meetings takes a lot of time. Have your assistant set things up for you in
Google Calendar. I input my own items via my Palm Z22 or iCal, then use Spanning Sync and Missing
Sync for Palm OS to sync everything. On my überlight Sony VAIO, which I still use for travel, I use
CompanionLink for Google Calendar. I suggest batching meetings or calls in one or two set days, with
15 minutes between appointments. Scattering them throughout the week at odd times just interrupts
everything else. (Update 2009: The Palm Z22 has been discarded, and I now use a 13-inch MacBook and
BusySync to synchronize iCal with Google Calendar.)
2. If you jump in your assistant’s inbox and answer anything, BCC them so they are aware that you
handled it.
3. Expect small problems. Life is full of compromises, and it’s necessary to let small bad things happen
if you want to get huge good things done. There is no escape. Prevent all problems and get nothing done,
or accept an allowable level of small problems and focus on the big things.
Ready to jump in and test the holy grail? Here are the steps.
1. Determine exactly which accounts you will use and how you want them to respond to (or just
categorize or purge) e-mail for you.
2. Find a virtual assistant.
3. Test for reliability before skill set. Have the top three candidates do something on tight deadline (24
hours) before hiring them and letting them in your inbox.
4. Use a probationary period of 2–4 weeks to test the waters and work out the problems. Again: There
will be problems. It will take a good 3–8 weeks to get to real smooth sailing.
5. Design your ideal lifestyle and find something to do other than let your brain fester in the inbox. Fill
the void.

Deadlines are extremely important. Be Aware of them, and Be
Punctual!
If Tim says “Call me back,” CALL HIM BACK, do not send an e-
mail. This is an important point, as Tim does not always have e-
mail access because he is traveling a lot.
Even if it is late in the evening, he is up late, if he does not want to
answer his phone, he will not. But PLEASE call him back when
he asks you to. He much prefers a phone call to an e-mail.
Purchase and read The Elements of Style regarding proper
grammar and punctuation. We are dealing with high-profile
clients on Tim’s behalf and the proper writing techniques and
message says a lot about his team.
Become as familiar as you can with his book and his website as to
answer questions accordingly.

Question and Answer (Preferences)
1. How do you feel about joint ventures?
I’m open to them, but my brand and respectability is #1. I will not do anything with anyone who
comes off as deceptive or amateur. “Make millions while you sleep in our super-insane foreclosure
program!” on the website disqualifies someone. I cannot be associated with anyone who might be
seen as a liar or snake-oil salesman. Just ask yourself: If the CEO of a well-known company saw
this, would he lose interest in speaking with me? If so, it won’t work.
For those who pass that criteria, what have they done already? I’m not looking for first-timers,
generally, unless they have an excellent track record and reputation elsewhere.
2. Do you focus solely on profit-generating tasks?
No. I also look for prestige (Harvard, government, etc.), wide exposure, as well as building
networks with people who have world-class skills in some area.
3. How do you handle spam?
SpamArrest and Gmail. I have no problem with spam at this point.
4. What is your optimal response rate (i.e., respond to all e-mails no later than 48–72 hours after
received)?
Same day. I’m bringing you on to respond quickly.
5. Do you respond to any e-mails?
Yes, but I’ll want you to filter them first, respond to all you can, then mark the ones I should look
at with the label “TIM” in Gmail. [Note earlier in this article how I am now asking VAs to leave
to-do’s via voicemail.]
6. Do you put in any events in your calendar?
Yes, but I expect I will move more and more to having you do it.
7. Do we “manage” your items, or do you delegate? We are cool with both, but prefer to manage.:-)
I’ll try to give the list to you to take care of. I NEED confirmations that you received the task (“on
it—will be done at X P.M.” is enough) and like status updates on larger projects with milestones.
8. Who is on your team?
Me, the publishing team, and some PR folk at this point. I might have you get involved with my
other businesses later, but that’s it for now.
9. Who do we have to collaborate with on a regular basis?
See above. 90% me, then possibly my publicist(s), tech support and web staff, and my book agent.
More will come, I’m sure, but that’s it for now.
10. Who calls the shots for you?
You can decide anything under $100. Use your judgment and report the decisions.
11. Do you have “days” off (as in no business appts.)?
Let’s shoot for no appointments on Fridays, but let’s play it by ear. [Update: I now only have
appointments on Mondays and Fridays.]
12. Who has been handling your appts. up until now?
Me. I haven’t had any in-person meetings for close to four years. Things have changed with the
book:)
13. Explain to us your “optimal” work week (i.e., how long between phone calls, how many meetings
per week, travel preferences, etc.)?
I go to bed late, so try and avoid calls before 10 A.M. pst when
possible.
Try and “cluster” phone calls and meetings so that I can bang
them out at the same time, as opposed to having one at 10 A.M.
, another at 1 P.M ., and another at 4 P.M . Have them all in a row
with 15–20 minutes in between whenever possible. I’d like to
do phone calls before 1 P.M . pst when possible (so 10 A.M.-1 P.M
.). Calls should be kept to 15–30 minutes, always with a
defined end time. If someone asks to “jump on the phone”
with me, send them something like: “To make the best use of
everyone’s time, Tim likes to have a well-defined agenda
with objectives for a call before jumping on the phone. Can
you please send over some bullet points with what you’d like
to cover and decide on the call?” Something like that.
14. Do you like us to schedule personal items in with your business calendar (i.e., order your mother
flowers for Mother’s Day, etc.)? Absolutely.
15. What are “all” the e-mail addresses we respond to for you? See earlier text.
16. Do you like us to respond as “you” or something like “client support for Timothy Ferriss.”
The latter, probably something like “Executive Assistant to Tim Ferriss” below your name—I’m
open to suggestions.
17. How many times a day do you want e-mail checked?
Twice should be fine to start. Let’s aim for a minimum of at 11 A.M. and 3 P.M. in your time zone.
18. What are your working hours?
10 A.M.-6 P.M. pst, then often 11 p.m.-2 A.M. pst. [Before you cry, “What happened to the fourhour
workweek?!” realize that “work hours” here could be replaced with “active and available-byphone
hours.” I have lots of projects and do not preach idleness. I am VERY active. See the sixth
comment on this post on www.fourhourblog.com for more elaboration or reread the “Filling the
Void” chapter in this book.]
19. Do you like using IM?Not really, unless it’s a scheduled discussion. Just leave yourself logged in,
and I’ll log in if I need something. [I tend to use Skype chat these days, as it’s encrypted and I can
avoid a separate IM program.]
20. Do you prefer a phone call or an e-mail to answer a quick question?
PHONE CALL, absolutely. DO NOT e-mail me for anything urgent. I really follow my own
advice and don’t check e-mail that often.
21. What is your favorite color?
Green like cedar leaves in July.
22. Call at the end of every day (if) there is something that Tim needs to respond to in his e-mail.
23. E-books: Tell them they can download the e-bookfromwww.powells.com.
24. Label all e-mails from “Expert Click” for Tim. No need to respond or forward.
25. All Linked-In e-mails can be archived or deleted as Tim receives notification of invites as soon as
he logs into his Linked-In account.
26. For start-up inquiries in the health and wellness industry (or BrainQUICKEN start-up inquiries)
please see the templates in
Gmail titled: Congratulations and General Business Questions—BrainQUICKEN Templates.
27. For language inquiries, please see the templates in Gmail titled: Reader Question on Language
Resources—Language Templates.
28. When Tim types “dictate” in the e-mail response, this means that we can say to the recipient: As
Tim is traveling at the moment and not able to personally respond to your e-mail, I mentioned
your message while on the phone to him, and he asked me to dictate. This makes the process easier
as we do not have to change the context of the person responding.
[This is to avoid having an assistant convert my first-person “Please tell him that I …” to thirdperson
“Tim says that he …”—providing shorthand for “cut and paste” saves hours of assistant
time.]
29. If someone e-mail blasts a bunch of people and I am one of them, usually safe to ignore or delete.
Read them carefully, of course, but if it says for example “a few influential people I know” or
something like that then if someone can’t take the time to personalize for me, forget them. If Tim is
copied, of course, that’s a different story.
30. Tim’s address is XXXX. THIS E-MAIL IS NOT TO BE DISTRIBUTED OR GIVEN TO
ANYONE. If you want to copy Tim on an e-mail, please use the BCC field, so that it remains
private.
31. Mark anyone from Princeton for me to look at (TIM label). [Note: I’ve since had to modify this
due to volume.]
32. If I decline someone and they persist, give them one more reply—“Tim appreciates the persistence,
but he really can’t…” etc.—and then archive future requests. Use your judgment, of course, but
that’s the general rule. Some people don’t know when persistent turns into plain irritating.
33. Please also create a rule to respond with “scheduled” for all items I send to be put in the calendar
(when they’re put in the calendar). Missing calendar items can cause big problems, so this is a
check and balance to confirm.
34. No need to follow up with someone after a call has taken place unless Tim instructs otherwise, or
they request something from us.
35. Send all speaking requests to XXXX and ensure that he confirms receipt. (However, also see items
38 and 39).
36. Foreign language requests (i.e., purchasing rights, if the book is available in a particular language,
etc.) send to [the appropriate person at my publisher].
37. XXXX’s replacement at Random House is XXXX.
38. Inquire with Tim first before booking any speaking gigs on a specific date, as he may be traveling.
39. When booking appointments in the calendar, be sure to also ask which topics they would like to
discuss, and put them in the calendar description for Tim so he can prepare. Also be sure to ask for
a backup phone number in case they are not able to reach Tim. [I almost always have people call
me unless I am abroad, as this is another safeguard against missing appointments.]
40. Put initials in the subject line of calendar events so we know who (which virtual assistant) put the
item in the calendar.
41. Prepare inquiries for Tim before sending to him for his review, i.e., get their Alexa ranking,
possible dates of the event, a link to past events they have held, their budget, other confirmed
speakers, etc. Then send this info to Tim for his review.
42. Respond to PX Method inquiries with the following response:
Hi [name],
Thanks for your inquiry about the PX Method, however the PX Method page is designed as just
a template others can look at as a reference for testing their own product ideas.
We are not sure if or when Tim will offer the PX Method for sale, but there are no plans at this
time. We appreciate your inquiry nonetheless. Thanks!
[I get quite a few e-mails from readers who do not see the disclaimer on the PX Method mockup
page and thus attempt to order a product that isn’t ready to ship.]
43. Download eFAX viewer to view Tim’s faxes. His fax number is: XXXX.
44. Event or speaking inquiries can be responded to as such:
Thanks for your e-mail and for your invitation to Tim. In looking at the event online, I see that
the event is April X and X, 20XX in Portland, Oregon [for example]. Before I present this to Tim,
could you answer a few questions for me, so we can make a more informed decision?
Would you like Tim to be at the entire event?
How long would the keynote presentation be? Or would it be a
Q&A panel?
Do you cover travel and accommodation along with a
speaker’s fee?
What is your budget for keynote presentations?
Have any other speakers confirmed to present?
As soon as I hear back, I can speak with Tim about the possibilities of making this happen.
Thanks again!
Warmly,

Proposal to Work Remotely on a Contract Basis
This is the actual remote-work proposal reader Autumn Brookmire used successfully to move to
Argentina while retaining her job and cutting back to 5–10 hours per week of work.
AUTUMN BROOKMIRE July 2008
Background
After working for the [company name] for more than two years, I have a great loyalty to the people and
mission of this organization. I believe I have added a great deal of value to the organization in my
position as marketing coordinator. With my creative problem solving and my cost effective solutions I
have changed the way we produce and distribute our holiday cards and I’ve developed a contest to bring
in more usable photos for our marketing and publications. I would like to propose continuing to perform
the following tasks for [company name], but on a contract basis, remotely. I plan to live in Argentina for
6–12 months starting in September of 2008. My goals are to develop my fluency in the Spanish language
and immerse myself in another culture and completely foreign environment so that I develop my skills in
adaptation to new ways of thinking.
I am more than happy to discuss different ways to make this possible and I have some suggestions if
[company name] would be willing to consider them. We can test this arrangement for a few months to
see if it works for both of us, since that would make the most sense.
Role #1: Graphic Design and Print Advertising Coordinator
Responsibility:
Create timelines for print materials and coordinate with respective program teams.
Expectations:
Print materials will be completed on time.
Responsibility:
Coordinate design projects with program directors and outside graphic artists/designers.
Expectations:
Print materials designs are suitable for the audience, accurate, and appealing.
Print materials are professional quality and produced within set timelines.
Responsibility:
Maintain relationships with print vendors to minimize cost relative to time and quality in producing
program print materials.
Expectations:
Print materials are printed within the established budget, unless budget overages are specifically
approved by the Director of Marketing.
Contract Solution:
By using e-mail and web-based programs such as
*ConceptShare, I can continue to coordinate these design projects from a distance. I currently maintain
relationships with print vendors and designers at a distance so physical presence is not necessary for this
to continue. For meetings with program directors and the marketing team, I would use a free video and
phone conferencing service called *Skype. We usually meet once or twice to discuss changes to their
marketing materials and the rest of the process is continued through e-mail and ConceptShare.
Role #2: Special Marketing Project Manager
Responsibility:
Maintain a collection of updated, appropriate marketing images.
Expectations:
Images needed for marketing materials and websites are anticipated and acquired.
Contract Solution:
I am still able to complete this task remotely by doing images searches on web databases such as
*iStockphoto.com. If the experiment with the *Seminar Photo Contest fares well, I could also manage
that process via the web using Aptify, e-mail, and Skype.
Responsibility:
Identify and implement new opportunities to leverage marketing materials.
Expectations:
Ideas are researched for feasibility and effectiveness.
Chosen projects are designed and sent out within the budget and timeline.
Contract Solution:
I would utilize e-mail and Skype to communicate any new ideas and opportunities to leverage marketing
materials. I have recently proposed creating a one-page calendar of our program deadlines to distribute
to our recent seminar alumni in a fall mailing. This way students will have an easy way to remember all
of our deadlines for our programs and may potentially boost our number of applicants.
Role #3: Web-based Marketing Coordinator
Responsibility:
Contribute to online advertising efforts and track results.
Expectations:
Online efforts are increasingly cost effective.
Marketing Director is informed of web-based marketing results as requested.
Contract Solution:
I am familiar with our online advertising efforts and can continue to help with this process from a
distance. I will be able to access Facebook Ads, Google Ads, Blog Ads and aid Keri in gathering and
entering data. I have experience working with our Facebook and Google Ads and have created images
for Blog Ads in the past. Launching new Ads will be easily managed abroad.
Responsibility:
Compile collection of updated, appropriate web photos.
Expectations:
Attractive, updated photos will be available for program and marketing uses.
Contract Solution:
As stated above with the stock photo inventory, I am still able to complete this task remotely by
conducting image searches on web databases such as iStockphoto.com. The Seminar Photo Contest will
also be used as a tool to aid in this compilation of images while I am abroad.
In order to more effectively track the cost of production of our print materials, I think [company name]
would find value in transitioning to a contract basis for this position. I have really enjoyed working at
[company name] thus far and would like to continue working for this organization from a remote
location. Thank you for your consideration of this proposal.
Explanation of Software and Programs Mentioned:
*ConceptShare—www.conceptshare.com, ConceptShare allows you to set up secure online workspaces
for sharing designs, documents, and video and invite others to review, comment, and give contextual
feedback anytime and anywhere without a meeting. [Company name] has used this site for a few months
to test its usability and has also been tested on multiple computers in Argentina (thanks to my sister
testing it out for me while she was in Argentina).
*Skype—www.skype.com, Skype is a free software that allows you to talk for free via the Internet. You
can also use Skype with regular phones to make calls internationally for a low rate of about .04 cents a
minute. Skype also has video chatting capabilities and conference call capabilities for meetings. The
setup requires downloading the Skype software free) and buying a headset with microphone ($10) and
webcam ($ ranges) for each computer. I have tested this software with my sister and it works well for her
in Argentina and for me here.
*iStockphoto—www.istockphoto.com, iStockphoto is an Internet royalty-free image and design stock
photography website. This is one of the many sites I use to find photos for [company name]. We have
already used a few photos from this site for our marketing materials.
*Seminar Photo Contest—This contest was created by me and developed with Keri as an experiment to
collect more relevant and usable photos for our marketing and publication efforts. Since we have found it
to be a bit invasive to try and take the photos ourselves, we wanted to try a new approach to capture
photos for our needs. All participants of our Summer Seminars 2008 are able to submit photos they have
taken at their seminar with a chance to be rewarded with a $5 Amazon Gift Certificate for each image
we choose.

also included.
87. This company filed for Chapter 11 in June 2009.
88. For the exact breakfast, just serach “slow-carb” on www.fourhourblog.com or both “slow-carb”
and “Ferriss” on Google.
89. This has thankfully decreased to 2,000–3,000 per week as of this writing.
90. This post is, of course, available on the blog for those who would like to copy and paste the rules
for their own use.

ZEN AND THE ART OF ROCK STAR LIVING
Hi Tim,
Here’s the story. I’m a musician based in Munich, Germany. I’m running my own label and it has
been difficult to get it off the ground. While working on that, my creativity slowly decreased until I hit
rock bottom (a couple of times).
While it is still difficult to survive in the music industry I find it not hard at all now to do what I want
to do. And that’s all I do. I do what I want to do. It includes being a father, making music, composing,
taking care of business, traveling, learning languages (mostly Italian), riding my bike, etc…. It’s all in the
following paragraphs.
1. I read the book step by step for about two months from September/October 2008 (plus surfing your
blog) and just made tabula rosa with my life. (Lots of brainvomiting on paper.)
2. I started outsourcing things that bothered me most (and therefore kept hanging out in my to-do list
the longest). I outsourced:
research, most of which is music-industry related (research
outsourced saves about 2–3 hours/day)
website maintenance (social websites like Facebook, Myspace,
etc). I’m planning on doing most of my marketing through
these sites in 2009 and I’m on about 25+ sites as an artist.
My VA (getfriday.com, as recommended in your book) does all the updates and checks
the sites once a week to gather e-mail messages, comments, etc., filters them and sends me a
report once a week including all the details for me to respond to. (Saves about one to two
hours/day.)
photo retouching for my press pics is done by elance (saved five
hours of work time and about $500).
management of my mailing list for gig dates, album updates, etc.
(Saves about one hour for each mailing.)
I started testing muses (learning languages with music to sell
online). I’m still testing!
I decided to open a publishing operation online for film companies
to license music for film with just a mouse click, without having
to negotiate deals for months. It will happen in 2009 (I start
testing soon). People are generally surprised and amazed that a
person who doesn’t seem to be very corporate (I look like a
retired punk rocker, haha) outsources parts of his life and lives
like a millionaire (I guess we do although we’re far from it!).
I realized that I could do it after I got the first positive feedback from my outsource VA. I got the
results of my project posted on elance and a day later I got the results. I went, yeah baby, this is MINE!
The biggest change is, that I now have my life under control. I take care of my little daughter (20
months) half the day (second half, my wife takes care of her), I take care of business, and I take time to
do things I always wanted to do. Revenue-wise I’m pretty much the same I was before but I have a lot
more spare time and a clear head (so I guess I’ve gotten a lot richer!).
I work whenever I want (no boss) about 24–30 hours/week (including office hours and music-studio
hours) and what I do now is only what I really love to do. I’m still step-by-step optimizing efficiency to
reduce office hours (currently about 10 hours/week). My dream is to dissolve my office altogether, go
paperless, and basically only have my laptop as an office.
I eliminated all work that has gotten me down or was wearing me out (eliminated an extra workload of
about 10 hours/week). I do not take on jobs (writing/producing music) unless I really love the project. I
eliminated all complainers and haters (saves my stomach).
I just started my blog juergenreiter.com, “zen and the art of rockstarliving,” where I want to share the
changes I made to my life (mostly for musicians to see the light at the end of the tunnel).
And I recorded an album of my music and for the first time in my life did all the lyrics myself! It’s
going to be out in spring on my label ORkAaN Music+Art Productions.
I’ll be on mini-retirement in New York this year for six weeks. I’ll be in Sicily to learn Italian for
about two weeks in May. I’ll be back in Sicily to travel the island by bike for another 2–3 weeks in
September. And am planning on going to either Mexico, Central America, or Australia in the winter.
I learned to shave with a straight razor within about 30 minutes, which I wanted to do for years.
Shaving is a real exciting ritual now and a lot of fun! I will do a master course for coffee experts in April
(I’m a coffee junky!) and become a “maestro del café.” I helped my wife quit her teaching job and fulfill
her dream to run a cafe in Munich, Germany. It’s called Frau Viola and opened its doors in October
2008. It is running great! (www.frauviola.wordpress.com)
Can you measure all of that? I think it speaks for itself!
The general mindset of 4HWW has given me the calmness of being able to take time to play with my
daughter and enjoying my “free time” without getting the fear of missing out on something or wasting
my life. I’d say overall (with all the above-mentioned changes) my productivity increased at least 70%
and doubt decreased by 80%.
For those just getting started:
1. start small think big.
2. identify what excites you vs. what bores you
3. eliminate and focus on what excites you
4. stick to what excites you no matter what people say. It’s your life, live it the way you know is right
for you.
5. read 4-Hour Workweek, obviously! —J. REITER
ART LOVERS WANTED
I saw my father work himself to the bone for 20 years as a garbage-man when we immigrated from
Mexico. As I looked at my life in April 2007 in a lonely hotel room after another endless week of travel
for my employer far from my family and those I love, I realized that at 33 I was on the same path to
work myself into the ground and give up on my lifelong dream of pursuing my love of music and theater.
In life there are no accidents and that night as I was checking an e-mail from an old friend he
suggested the 4HWW. I devoured the book in a few hours and began immediately to apply the key
principles. When I told people about the book and about what I intended to do everyone said I was crazy.
I focused most of my efforts on Dream-lining, Elimination, and Liberation. As an employee I wanted to
first achieve liberation with a remote work arrangement. Despite several failed attempts I persevered
(great lesson in negotiating) and was granted the opportunity to work remotely. This changed everything.
I went from 9+ hours of work a day with weekly work-related travel to four hours a week, one week of
travel per month, and I managed to get a $10,000 raise and deliver 2x the productivity in my job from
the previous unproductive year.
As a result I now live with my once long-distance girlfriend in Seattle (my hometown). I spend my
newly found time pursuing my passion for music (I sing in a choir and write my own folk-rock music),
theater (I am performing in my first fully improvised 60-minute play this weekend), and fitness. I am
training for my second marathon now.
Most of my friends cannot believe that I can actually spend most of my time pursuing my love for the
arts and still make a full-time income on only four hours a week. The best part of this is that I have
found mentally the meaning of freedom. Reality is truly negotiable and now my reality is that I can
spend endless hours enjoying the company of my father, who waited twenty years till he retired to enjoy
the freedom that I have found less than 24 months after reading The 4-Hour Workweek.
As an immigrant I want to spread the message that to succeed in America in the 21st century we must
NOT work hard, instead we must follow the principles of the 4HWW and work smarter so that we can
truly achieve the New American Dream: Freedom to enjoy the most precious resource we have in life …
our time on this earth.

PHOTO FINISH
Hey Tim,
I wanted to tell you that your book, The 4-Hour Workweek, has been a true inspiration and lifechanging
resource for me this year!
I bought your book in November. Before then, I didn’t know what “workflow automation” was. I had
a part-time employee, but her work was actually creating more work for me. I would work until
sometimes 3 A.M., and get up at 7. I’d tell you I wanted to travel, but the truth is that it seemed
impossible to me. I didn’t have time or money.
I was listening to your audio book one day. I had been listening to each of the chapters, sometimes
over and over again. I was jogging. I stopped in my tracks. I believe I was listening about a case study
about someone who sold music files over the Internet.
I’m a photographer. Weddings mostly. I wondered how I could sell digital images over the Internet.
Then I came up with a fantastic idea for a family photography company. I stopped right there, and
reserved a website on my iPhone.
Two months later, I had a website, access to thousands of photographers across the country, and our
first sale. Even better, I am now in the family photography business, and I never have to shoot myself.
Even better +1, we are the first family photography business that doesn’t sell prints. Only digital files. It
worked! I have now adopted this for my wedding photography as well. Other photographers are so
offended, but I am making WAY more $, my costs are almost eliminated, and my time is free!
I know the above is vague, but it’s not the point. The point is that now I work better, faster, I have two
more employees, I turned off my e-mail notifications on my computer and my iPhone, despite all of what
it’s capable of, it doesn’t even ring. E-mail has been disabled. I just check it every so often to see what
calls I missed.
Today, my fiance loves me because I come home in time for dinner and I leave my laptop at work. It’s
a life I never thought I’d be able to live. In the meantime, systems are working in my place and this year
looks to be a lot better, financially, than last.
Then I decided it was time to try my first mini-retirement. The goal: ski the Swiss Alps and spend five
days in Switzerland and spend less than $1,000 total. I got a roundtrip ticket for about 500 bucks. My ski
pass for one day at Engelberg was $80. Lodging was free, thanks to your suggestion
www.couchsurfing.com, and I ate roasted chestnuts, brats, fish and chips and drank great beer all week
long. I did it!
I am forever grateful, and am excited for more mini-retirements. Here’s to living during the best years
of my life.
P.S. I leave May 11 for a month-long work vacation to Italy (I have been hired to photograph two
weddings in Siena). I plan on vacationing a LOT more than I will be working.

VIRTUAL LAW
I used to work at a large Silicon Valley law firm, but one day I woke up and decided that I wanted to
travel for a year and learn a foreign language. Six weeks later I was living in Cali, Colombia—I’d never
visited Cali before and hardly spoke a word of Spanish, but that’s what made it exciting to me. Well,
almost two years later, I still spend 95%+ of my time living and working from Cali, Colombia (I recently
bought a gorgeous apartment here that I could never afford if I lived in California). I also have a fulltime
maid/cook (well, five hours per day, five days per week), which costs me less than US $40 per
week!
I started my own virtual law practice and then joined forces with my old boss. My U.S. number rings
through to me wherever I am in the world (originally I’m from New Zealand so I travel back there a lot,
too), and all my U.S. mail is delivered to Market Street, San Francisco, and scanned so I can view it
online. If I need to mail letters, I have another service which prints the letter and sends it within the U.S.
so there are no international shipping delays.
Definitely use www.earthclassmail.com for mail receipt/scanning. They have different packages but
it’s around $20-$30/month. You can also choose one or more P.O. boxes or physical addresses. My
Market Street address is actually an earthclassmail address.
For printing small letters and mailing within the U.S. I use www.postalmethods.com. It’s a little
clunky at first but it’s fine when you get used to it. It’s very cheap since you only pay when you send (a
four-page letter works out to just over $1 including the postage).
Come visit me sometime. Colombia is nothing like what you hear about—I feel a lot safer walking
around late at night here than a lot of places in San Francisco. But don’t tell anyone, those of us living
here want to keep it a secret!

TAKING FLIGHT WITH ORNITHREADS
Tim—
My mentor gave me your book this past July and it had a tremendous impact on my life, its arrival
could not have had better timing. About the time I read it, I was a few weeks away from competing in
my first Olympic distance triathlon. I had trained for five months, felt and looked strong, but even more
important the discipline and working toward a physical goal resulted in a creativity I hadn’t felt in years.
I posted a competitive time in the event and felt so optimistic about my abilities that I signed up for a
half ironman competition.
Riding that high and following the principles of your book, I thought of dozens of ideas for
products/businesses and am on the verge of launching the first of those ideas. It is a line of apparel called
OrniThreads which will provide modern, scientific designs of birds to Gen-X and Gen-Y birders.
The reasons for focusing on this demographic are twofold:
1. For my “day job,” I work at [company name]. I have learned a lot about their
audience/membership, e.g., like the fact that there are 70 million Americans who actively bird (a
staggering statistic from the U.S. Fish & Wildlife svc). Birders are a passionate lot and their
interest only seems to grow over time—it never dies! They also tend to skew from the middle to
upper class and are educated.
2. I took an ornithology class this summer at Columbia University (where I am enrolled in a
conservation biology program) and fell in love with the illustrations in my textbooks and wanted to
surround myself with these images.
I am launching www.ornithreads.com in the next week or so and the first of my three designs are
being printed as we speak.
I have big aspirations for the company, but am just trying to get the first collection to customers and
learn as much as I can. Your book has been incredibly helpful in outlining the necessary steps I need to
take to succeed and hope that my idea has some legs (or wings) which translates into an automated
income.
If you are in NYC anytime soon—promoting your book or otherwise—I would love to meet you.
Sincerely, —BRENDA TIMM
OFF-THE-JOB TRAINING
I used concepts from the 4HWW to work remotely from August of ’08 until January of ’09. I went to
Portugal, Europe, Spain, Sweden, and Norway surfing and snowboarding my brains out. Best part about
it? I came home with three times as much money in the bank than I would have had if I continued the
normal 9 to 5. I work for [world-famous design company] as a software developer, and was able to put
the concepts to use and really change my life. I paired my iPhone + Fring (Fring is voice over IP on the
iPhone, it allows you to use one device for everything, and have a local number abroad).
I spent four months prior to departure being sure to never be at my cube, but always be just around the
corner. I made a point to ALWAYS be available on Instant Messenger, so when people would walk over
to my cube and look for me in person they would see I was somewhere else, then hop online and ask,
“Where are you?” My response was always similar, just down the hall in the cafeteria … just down the
block at the coffee shop, or at co-worker X’s desk. After two months of this a magical thing happened:
People always looked to get me via Instant Messenger and stopped dropping by my desk altogether. That
allowed me to be 6,000 miles away without anyone noticing.
Something else to consider… how time zone affects remote work environments. I noticed, while in
Norway (nine hours away), that it was the perfect amount of time. I was, in a sense, living in the future.
My day was almost over by the time my boss woke up … this allowed me to explore Norway’s fjords,
mountains, and undiscovered frigid surf spots in complete peace and without ever having to worry about
getting a call from overseas. It was perfect … If I wanted, I could explore all day, come home and have
some dinner, then ichat with my boss for 20–30 minutes and check in. The few times he needed
something urgently, he was able to give me work when he went to bed, and have it completed in the
morning when he woke up. —B. WILLIAMSON
DOCTOR’S ORDERS
Hi Tim:
Here’s my story …
My dream started about four years ago. I was in the process of taking my psychology licensing exam,
and after speaking to a friend, decided that I would reward myself with a trip to South America. We
were both exhausted from our 9-to-5 (and sometimes 6, 7, or 8 p.m.) hospital and clinic jobs.
I had traveled extensively throughout the United States and some parts of Europe, but I had never
experienced South American culture.
My trip there was absolutely fantastic and really opened my eyes to other ways of living and culture.
During my trip, I spent a lot of time speaking to expatriates about how they used their retirement funds
and pensions to live the lives of kings there. One thing was evident: Most of the expatriates who
attempted to “set up a business” to help fund their lifestyle had failed miserably. I hypothesized that
there just wasn’t enough currency (pesos) in the marketplace to really sustain a “gringo”-oriented
business.
After my trip, I told my friend that I needed to dedicate all my energies to developing a method of
receiving income from U.S. citizens while living elsewhere. VOIP had recently been introduced to the
marketplace and Internet service was improving in South America and other parts of the third world.
The business had to be based upon absolute mobility. I boiled the whole business down to two basic
functions: reliable telephone via VOIP and high-speed Internet.
At the time I had a small research consultation practice where I was helping doctoral students on the
phone and via e-mail to complete their dissertations, theses, and statistical analyses. I had a small
website that was getting traffic but I was relying on others for web and marketing services. I
subsequently learned more about search engine optimization and web marketing and eventually took
control of all web marketing and promotion of my website, http://www.ResearchConsultation.com,
allowing me to expand my business substantially.
During the next three years I conducted numerous “mobile tests” … traveling to Costa Rica, the
Dominican Republic, Venezuela, and Colombia in order to fine-tune my system of conducting business
from abroad.
I finally left my job last November, the day before Thanksgiving, vowing to never return to the
mundane 9-to-5 structure. My job had even recently instituted a “bio-metric fingerprint” identification
system where you had to “punch in and out” at the beginning and end of your hospital shift with your
fingerprint to ensure that you were working your eight hours. This was just another sign that I had to
leave.
I now live in NYC and Colombia and travel to other parts of the world throughout the year: speaking
to customers, managing my contractors (U.S. and Colombian) in order to acquire U.S. dollars while
living for a fraction of the cost abroad. I’m also developing other websites and businesses (community
forums) that will hopefully be more automated, requiring less day-to-day interaction and monitoring.
Well, that’s my story for now … today South America, tomorrow anywhere I can get a high-speed
connection (banda ancha)! My stress level has dropped significantly since leaving my old job and my
quality of life has improved enormously.
My family and friends in NYC still think I’m out of my mind, and I continue to fully agree with
them…. —JEFF B.
THE 4-HOUR FAMILY AND GLOBAL EDUCATION
Tim,
We moved to a totally digital nomadic life traveling the world as a family in 2006, so we discovered
your book and ideas after we had begun and loved it! Our life has changed totally and is more fulfilling
and much more simple. We are greener, leaner, healthier, happier, more connected.
Other people thought we were absolutely nuts when we decided to do this in 2004/5, but now many of
those same people think we are smart and psychic.
Problems finding a good school fit (despite having many award-winning excellent ones at our
disposal) was probably the most specific moment (John Taylor Gatto says it best on why schools do not
educate) that helped us to change as well as wanting more time together and forecasting the
house/economy crash coming.
I think more families will be taking mini-retirements and living slower, traveling digital nomadic lives.
If you are away for months as a family, you need to be informed about all the wonderful educational
opportunities which are actually richer than staying home (which few realize)!
There are a TON of fantastic resources like Classroom 2.0 and many innovative educators online. My
daughter just turned eight and is having a blast with her online course with John Hopkins
University/CTY and it is also a nice resource for friends. Today one can immerse deeply in one culture
and still maintain one’s home culture. This is important information for families who still fear the
outdated negatives on Third Culture Kids (TCK) based on studies from the fifties.
Maya Frost 91 has excellent information about older kids and even a new paradigm when it comes to
going to university. I think education is one of the things going through a total transition due to the
Internet, and parents need this info to make important decisions.
We have had a fantastic experience in going to a local school in Spain that has allowed my child to
immerse very deeply in her second language, culture, and literature. More info (in the book) on local
schools is needed and how to experience it as a family for months at a time.
We have used local people like a wonderful flamenco teacher for our child and we have also used
online sources like our piano teacher in Chicago who teaches our child in Spain via Skype.
E-libraries are very important (especially with a child who is a voracious reader).
Http://learninfreedom.org/languagebooks.html is an excellent resource on language education with great
books on raising a bilingual child, even if you are a monolingual!

FINANCIAL MUSING
I graduated from Stanford University and started working in investment banking in July 2006, and, in
a sick way, almost enjoyed it at first. Yes, it was a terrible lifestyle and all, but I was learning a lot and
moving up very quickly. I have (had) a type-A personality, so it appealed to me on some level.
As the year progressed, though, I realized it wasn’t sustainable and that I wanted out… but like so
many other people, I failed to take action immediately.
In May 2007, I was driving home at 3 A.M. one night after having pulled 4–5 all-nighters previously,
and crashed into a tree on the side of the road. If you’ve never crashed into an inanimate object while
asleep at the wheel, just imagine waking up five feet from the ground while bungee jumping as the cord
is about to snap to get an idea of what it feels like.
“At the ER”
That was the subject line of the e-mail I sent out the next day to my entire office. Luckily, everyone
understood and told me to take a rare three-day weekend. Luckily I survived with no major injuries, but
at that point I decided it was time for a change.
I met up with some friends for dinner a week or two later and relayed my story. One friend there (who
recently quit her job to pursue professional acting—her dream—while selling information products
online) told me about this book she recently read called The 4-Hour Workweek.
I thought it was a scam, of course, but I really hated my life and decided I needed to check it out at the
very least. I read it in one sitting. And then I read it again, just to make sure I wasn’t hallucinating.
Before ever getting into finance, I had done some work online with graphics and web design and I had a
technical background, so nothing in the book seemed outrageous to me—I just didn’t realize how easy
and accessible it all was. Also, I had lived in Japan for half a year in college and loved it—and long-term
world travel had always been one of my goals.
I sat on the ideas in your book for a while, took a quick vacation to return to Japan in October 2007,
and when I came back decided that I had to get started. My muse: sell an investment banking interview
guide. It’s a niche, high-demand subject and I knew I could make a better guide than anything else out
there. One problem: I had to stay anonymous since I was still working, and advertising with Pay-Per-
Click would be way too expensive given the high CPCs for related keywords.
In November 2007 I decided to start a blog, Mergers & Inquisitions
(http://www.mergersandinquisitions.com), about the investment banking industry and how to break in,
aimed at a mix of college students, MBAs, and working professionals. While I built my audience, I
never had the time to finish my muse—the interview guide. But I was getting tons of requests to do
consulting from my readers, so I started with resume editing and expanded into mock interviews—yes,
not very “muse-like” but I charged high rates and could make my old salary in a fraction of the time. I
did this ALL while staying completely anonymous out of necessity—because I didn’t want to get fired
without an alternative income stream. Amazingly, my services took off even though I couldn’t tell
anyone who I was.
At the same time, I decided I would not get another job in finance, and would instead leave in June
2008. So I had a very short amount of time to make everything work. Almost every single one of my
friends, roommates, and family doubted me and said it would never work. I decided they were all wrong
and I would just do it anyway—worst-case scenario, I could always reduce my expenses and move to
Thailand to teach English.
To boost my income, I completely revamped my site to sell more of my offerings, which took me
from pocket change to full-time income from part-time consulting over July-August 2008. This allowed
me to travel to Hawaii and Aruba to go snorkeling, surfing, and shark-cage-diving and visit friends in
other parts of the U.S. all while making an investment banker’s income from part-time work.
As the recession and economy worsened, my business picked up because it was counter-cyclical—
anything that helps people find jobs is in huge demand in a poor economy. I’ve since helped scores of
laid-off bankers and other financiers find work elsewhere. However, I was also starting to work a lot
more because I was effectively trading time for money … so over the fall I started to work on my
original product idea—my interview guide—and released it to great success later in 2008.
It has gone on to free up a ton of time, double my revenues, and put the majority of my income on
autopilot. If I didn’t do any further work from this point onward, I could make 2–3x my previous
monthly income simply by writing once or twice a week for my site (4–5 hours) and doing limited
consulting on the side (10 hours). So you could say I’ve increased my income almost 3x while reducing
my hours 6x-9x and making myself completely mobile.
I admit that often I do “work” more than this, but it’s all on related educational projects that I want to
work on, not anything that I have to work on. And if I don’t feel like working one week, I can reduce my
hours to the 5–15 hour range and spend my time on learning languages, sports, or traveling to exotic
destinations.
This setup allowed me to take an amazing trip to China, Singapore, Thailand, and Korea in December-
January and get in some ridiculous adventures. I’ll be moving to Asia in a few months and after that,
traveling the world indefinitely while running my business from coffee shops.
Incidentally, I met up with a lot of customers in Asia who thought this was the coolest thing ever!
Your book has changed my life and infinitely improved my lifestyle, and I just wanted to thank you
for everything.
—B. DECHESARE
WHO SAYS KIDS HOLD YOU BACK?
My first action was to think “what is the worst that can happen on a scale of 1–10” if I quit my wellpaid,
very secure government job? The power of this thought process is incredible.
I quit my job, sold my house, and went camping for three months with two kids under two and a half
and a pregnant wife (mini-retirement). We (very slowly) drove the SE coast of Australia from Sydney to
Adelaide.
With the complete clarity of mind that comes from being in a field with your family with no
immediate worries, I put into action a plan that I had been tinkering with for 12 months. I bought a
wireless Internet dongle and created an info product for electrical engineers, and wrote some software to
go with it.
Managed this by (a) going on info diet, (b) working 9 p.m.-midnight in a campsite with no other
distractions, (c) outsourcing everything that I would find difficult or time consuming (like the tricky
programming stuff and the illustrations for my book).
After about four weeks I had an automated informational website that had replaced ½ of my full-time
income—requiring > four hours per week to maintain.
The original plan was to arrive in Adelaide and get a J.O.B. But with my passive income, I decided to
simply grow my new business and am currently very close to replacing 100% of my previous income. It
feels f&*#ing brilliant.
Now we plan to travel the world slowly until the kids are ready for primary school…
Who says kids hold you back?! —FINN
WORKING REMOTELY
One month and one year ago, I read 4HWW on the recommendation of my sister’s boyfriend after I
had been talking for months about changing my life drastically and moving to Argentina to learn
Castellano. After reading the book I stopped talking about my dreams and immediately started setting
short-term and long-term goals. I bought a notebook to track my monthly goals and tasks. I did lots of
research on potential remote working situations and I started telling my close friends and family about
my new plans. Everyone that I told thought it was just an idea and I wasn’t actually going to go through
with it. They thought it was a “some day I’d like to do this” idea and that I wasn’t actually setting daily
goals to get me there. They knew that I loved my job so why would I leave it for a life of uncertainty? I
didn’t think of it that way. I wasn’t scared, I was excited at the prospect of a new way of life, a fresh
start, and even though I loved my job I also had other things I wanted to accomplish in my life. At first I
thought about teaching English to make a living down there, but deep down inside all I really wanted to
do was continue working for my current company, just doing it remotely. The book gave me the
confidence to think this was actually possible, when everyone around me thought it was impossible.
I decided to write up a proposal 92 and present it to my boss even at the advice not to do it from
everyone I knew. If my boss rejected my proposal, I had enough money saved up to live in Argentina for
at least six months to get me by until I could figure out how I wanted to make money there. I was not
giving up on my dream of living a freer, happier life with less work and more time for myself. All odds
were against me but I took a calculated risk and had faith in myself. After I handed in my proposal, I
was ready to expect the worst. Everyone around me was waiting with baited breath and words of
encouragement after I got rejected. When I left the meeting with my boss I couldn’t believe it. She
accepted and was eager to talk to me about the details. She even had a smile on her face and told me how
awesome my proposal was. No one else could believe it when I told them. After the shock wore off, I
realized that I could actually do this, and a huge weight was lifted from my shoulders. The hardest part
was over and now I could start thinking of more possibilities for my new life.
I set my goal to move to Argentina for September 2008. I arrived here on September 3 and have been
here for about six months now. I live in the capital city of Jujuy, Argentina, a small province in the
northwest of Argentina. I work about 5–10 hours a week and I find that I am much more focused now
that I am out of the office and working alone. I have a private Spanish tutor that I meet with for two
hours, five days a week. I have a handful of friends that I spend time with, practicing my Spanish. I go to
the gym three times a week and go to yoga two times a week—something I didn’t do in the States
because I didn’t have enough time. I eat healthier because I have more time to focus on what to eat. I
have more time to dream up bigger things that I want to do with my new free time. I have dreams of
owning a bar or cafe, so maybe a few years from now that will be my next endeavor.
My advice to 4HWW readers is to take from my experience. I rely heavily on the advice of my friends
and family, but sometimes you have to ignore the advice of your loved ones to really make some thing
happen. If you believe the impossible can be made possible, it will happen. —A.K. BROOKMIRE
KILLING YOUR BLACKBERRY
I’m a 37-year-old Subway franchisee owning and operating 13 stores. Been doing this for seven years.
Prior to reading 4HWW I was KING at W4W (translate: work for work’s sake)! I’d never given myself
“permission” to behave differently than I did as an employee in the past. 4HWW was absolutely
liberating for me. I literally “caught myself” and began the process of curing my addiction to W4W. I
used to always be “on” and I was never really “present” anywhere—too busy doing the “blackberry
prayer” at the dinner table instead of spending quality time with those who were present. Holidays were
just a remote office for battling the e-mail tsunami. 4HWW gave me a new paradigm and I began to
look at my business as a “product,” the (original) purpose of which was to provide me with a
disproportionate amount of income vs. time invested personally by me—to what end? To ENJOY
MYSELF and to have complete autonomy over my schedule and activities. So I got off my own back,
told myself it was OK to pursue the original purpose and here’s what I did:
Crunched my “always open” workweek into four days and 20 hours. I immediately began taking
Mondays OFF, giving me a nice three-day weekend. (Fridays are in the “CROSSHAIRS” next!) Tuesday
to Friday I work 11 A.M.-4 p.m. (20 hours per week). With the “unluxury” of time in this crunched
workweek I was forced to appraise everything through the 80/20 filter and found that 50% of the 80%
was pure crap and the other 50% of the 80% could be done by someone on my payroll. Great!
Everything I do now has to somehow either increase sales or decrease costs otherwise “it’s someone
else’s job.” You can’t be “half-pregnant,” so when I’m “on” I’m really on and when I’m “off” I’m off—
good luck trying to contact me. I still carry portable e-mail but I’ve killed “auto-sync” (the bane of
modern mankind in terms of interruption) now it’s on a Tues-Fri, 11 A.M.-4 p.m. schedule. Outside of
that window it waits.
My e-mail autoresponder eliminated 50% of my e-mail within two weeks as people sending me
meaningless crap got fed up looking at my autoresponder and stopped including me—love it! I keep a
short, compact “to-do” list and anything time-bound is in my calendar. These get my attention before
any other “inbox” does because I’ve previously decided what’s important for me to get done—the rest
can wait.
I could go on, but all in all I think this is a message that the self-employed need to hear so badly. With
no “boss” and no “clean edges” to work-life/home-life it’s so easy to fall into a W4W grind and your
business becomes a tractor beam that trails you inexorably down that path. 4HWW is the antidote!” —
ANDREW, self-employed in the UK
STAR WARS , ANYONE?
I knew my quest for the 4-Hour Workweek was working when my daughter’s kindergarten teacher
asked her the question: “What kind of work does your father do?” As the teacher re-told the story back
to me, it was my daughter’s answer that really struck a chord. “Your daughter turned and looked up at
me with the most serious look on her face and said, ‘My dad just sits around and watches Star Wars all
day.’”
It’s funny how this one simple question, and not to mention my daughter’s answer, would be the
moment of true 4HWW self-awareness for me. You see the answer my daughter gave her teacher has a
deeper meaning. I believe what she meant to say, if she could articulate it, was “My dad sort of does
whatever he wants to do.”
I read the 4HWW almost two years ago when I was on vacation at the beach with my family. I
remember it well, because I kept reading parts of the book to my wife, bothering her to no end. I am a
developer and enterprise administrator for a large financial institution in Atlanta, Georgia. Part of my job
is supporting the large complex document captures systems that I help build. Due to the importance of
these systems I am expected to be reachable 24/7/365. That is good for job security, but can be bad for
my family life. I have four beautiful children and I strive to be a true “hands-on” dad who is present in
my family’s daily lives. So armed with your book and a fresh (ocean air) perspective, I set out to put
many of the 4HWW principles into practice.
First, I worked on changing my e-mail habits. I took a hard look at my inbox and used several of the
techniques outlined in the 4HWW to eliminate all the waste and noise. I formed new habits around
batching my e-mail sessions and it didn’t take long to achieve a zero inbox using the “trusted trio” folder
method. I also applied the less is more philosophy to composing my e-mails. I went to great lengths to
ensure I am as clear and concise as possible. Only communicating exactly what is needed to the right
audience and not to the world. By eliminating all the noise and fat from my e-mail diet it became much
more clear what “actions” or “to-do’s” were important.
Meetings and conference calls were the next area of attack. I scrutinized each meeting invite and
began declining requests left and right. Most of the time I would claim I had too much going on to
attend. I started asking for the minutes of the meeting or for someone to IM me if they had a specific
question I needed to answer. When I do attend a meeting it is almost always via a conference call. Due
to conference room restrictions and geographic challenges in our company most of our meetings are
done virtually anyway.
Less wasted time meant more time to focus on work and tasks that really mattered. I felt like I was
doing less but getting more things done and with better results. The right people were starting to notice
and the perception of my ability to get the job done had never been better. I was making my management
look good, and when that happens they stop asking questions or micromanaging daily activities. I kept
proving to them I can do it without interference. Now was the time to make the push for what I really
wanted and that was to go virtual!
Going virtual was actually very easy. I had a solid foundation with my manager and others in the
chain of command. Almost all of my daily work was already remote-ready. At home, I have a great
dedicated office in our finished basement. It is situated well away from the rest of the house and is
mostly free of distractions. I have my own bathroom with shower and I even have a mini-fridge and
microwave. I dare say that my home office rivals the amenities of the top executives at my company.
Most of all, I have a wife and family that totally understand and respect the rules I set for myself to
continue this success.
At first, I worked one or two days a week from home, but it didn’t take long before I found myself
working four out of five days a week from home. When the Southeast was hit by the gas shortage and
the price of gas nationwide was cresting $4 a gallon, the company made working from home even more
accepted and official. I became an overnight model for others to follow. As people around me were in a
panic as to how to get to work when no gas could be found, I was happily working away at home just
business as usual.
At this point, things were working better than I ever expected. Using my 4HWW skills I now had
more time to be that hands-on dad I wanted to be. I became a regular up at the elementary school. I eat
lunch in the cafeteria with my girls, especially on fried chicken day! I participate in a program called
D.E.A.R. which stands for Drop Everything and Read, where a few times a month I come in and read to
each class. I drive my kids to school and I get to see them when they come home. For my entire family, I
am present in their everyday lives, and can’t put a price on that. I felt like I had achieved my goal. That
was that. So I thought…
Other things started to happen. Without conscientiously knowing it, people around me at the school or
church had a weird respect for me. I say weird because people literally mistook me as a doctor or just
some sort of self-made millionaire. I am not kidding. There is this one guy who still calls me “Doc.” I
guess the reason for this is because most people still cling to the old stereotypes of what they think it is
to be “rich.” I always seem to show up for the school functions or just special days at the school, usually
in casual attire and never obsessing over time or my Blackberry. Now I have people nominating me for
things like committee chair on the PTA, and just recently I was elected to the board of directors at our
local swim/ tennis club. The cool thing is, I actually have the time to do those things and still be
effective at work and at home. It goes without saying that new doors are open to me now. More than ever
before.
With all of this going on around me I still come back to what my daughter said to her teacher. In truth,
I am at a point where if I wanted to “sit around and watch Star Wars all day,” I certainly could. But, I
find myself filling the extra time now doing things that really mean something. Being present in the
everyday lives of my family, helping my community, or volunteering at my church. Now I have a plan to
take it to the next level and write my own book. The project I am working on is called The Virtual
Employee Handbook. It is a collection of tips and how-to’s on all the tools that are essential to the
modern virtual employee, like me. We will see how that goes. One thing I do know is that I wouldn’t
even dream of what I am doing now if it wasn’t for The 4-Hour Workweek! —W. HIGGINS

RESTRICTED READING
The Few That Matter
A hypocrite is a person who—but who isn’t?
—DON MARQUIS
I know, I know. I said not to read too much. Hence, the recommendations here are restricted to the
best of the best this book’s interviewees and I have used and named when asked, “What is the one book
that changed your life the most?”
None of them are required to do what we’ve talked about in this book. That said, consider them if you
get stuck on a particular point. The page counts are listed, and if you practice the exercises in “How to
Read 200% Faster in 10 Minutes” in Chapter 6, you should be able to read at least 2.5 pages per minute
(100 pages thus equals 40 minutes).

The Fundamental Four: Let Me Explain
The Fundamental Four are so named because they are the four books I recommended to aspiring
lifestyle designers prior to writing The 4-Hour Workweek. Still well worth reading, here is the sequence I
suggest:
The Magic of Thinking Big (192 pages)
BY DAVID SCHWARTZ
This book was first recommended to me by Stephen Key, an ultrasuccessful inventor who has made
millions licensing products to companies, including Disney, Nestlé, and Coca-Cola. It is the favorite
book of many superperformers worldwide, ranging from legendary football coaches to famous CEOs,
and has more than 100 5-star ratings on Amazon. The main message is don’t overestimate others and
underestimate yourself. I still read the first two chapters of this book whenever doubt creeps in.
How to Make Millions with Your Ideas:
An Entrepreneur’s Guide (272 pages)
BY DAN S. KENNEDY
This is a menu of options for converting ideas into millions. I read this when I was in high school and
have read it five times since. It is like steroids for your entrepreneurship cortex. The case studies, from
Domino’s Pizza to casinos and mail-order products, are outstanding, even if outdated in a few instances.
The E-Myth Revisited: Why Most Small Businesses Don’t Work and What to Do About It (288 pages)
BY MICHAEL E. GERBER
Gerber is a masterful storyteller and his classic of automation discusses how to use a franchise mind-set
to create scalable businesses that are based on rules and not outstanding employees. It is an excellent
road map—told in parable—for becoming an owner instead of constant micromanager. If you’re stuck in
your own business, this book will get you unstuck in no time.
Vagabonding: An Uncommon Guide to the Art of Long-Term World Travel (224 pages)
BY ROLF POTTS
Rolf is the man. This is the book that got me to stop making excuses and pack for an extended hiatus. It
covers bits of everything but is particularly helpful for determining your destination, adjusting to life on
the road, and re-assimilating back into ordinary life. It includes great little excerpts from famous
vagabonds, philosophers, and explorers, as well as anecdotes from ordinary travelers. This is the first of
two books (the other was Walden, below) that I took with me on my first 15-month mini-retirement.
Walden (384 pages)
Reducing Emotional and Material Baggage
BY HENRY DAVID THOREAU
This is considered by many to be the masterpiece of reflective simple living. Thoreau lived on the edge
of a small lake in rural Massachusetts for two years, building his own shelter and living alone, as an
experiment in self-reliance and minimalism. It was both a huge success and a failure, which is what
makes this book such a compelling read.
Less Is More: The Art of Voluntary Poverty—An Anthology of Ancient and Modern Voices in Praise
of Simplicity (336 pages)
EDITED BY GOLDIAN VANDENBROECK
This is a collection of bite-sized philosophies on simple living. I read it to learn how to do the most with
the least and eliminate artificial needs, not live like a monk—big difference. It incorporates actionable
principles and short stories ranging from Socrates to Benjamin Franklin and the Bhagavad Gita to
modern economists.
The Monk and the Riddle: The Education of a Silicon Valley Entrepreneur (192 pages)
BY RANDY KOMISAR
This great book was given to me by Professor Zschau as a graduation gift and introduced me to the
phrase “deferred-life plan.” Randy, a virtual CEO and partner at the legendary Kleiner Perkins, has been
described as a “combined professional mentor, minister without portfolio, in-your-face investor, troubleshooter
and door opener.” Let a true Silicon Valley wizard show you how he created his ideal life using
razor-sharp thinking and Buddhist-like philosophies. I’ve met him—he’s the real deal.
The 80/20 Principle: The Secret to Success by Achieving More with Less (288 pages)
BY RICHARD KOCH
This book explores the “nonlinear” world, discusses the mathematical and historical support for the 80/20
Principle, and offers practical applications of the same.
Muse Creation and Related Skills
Harvard Business School Case Studies www.hbsp.harvard.edu (click on “school cases”)
One of the secrets behind Harvard Business School’s teaching success is the case method—using real-life
case studies for discussion. These cases take you inside the marketing and operational plans of 24-Hour
Fitness, Southwest Airlines, Timberland, and hundreds of other companies. Few people realize that you
can purchase these case studies for less than $10 apiece instead of spending more than $100,000 to go to
Harvard (not that the latter isn’t worth it). There is a case study for every situation, problem, and
business model.
“This business has legs”: How I Used Infomercial Marketing to Create the $100,000,000 Thighmaster
Craze: An Entrepreneurial Adventure Story (206 pages)
BY PETER BIELER
This is the story of how a naïve (in the best sense of the word) Peter Bieler started from scratch—no
product, no experience, no cash—and created a $100-million merchandising empire in less than two
years. It is a mind-expanding and often hysterical case study that uses real numbers to discuss the fine
points of everything from dealing with celebrities to marketing, production, legal, and retail. Peter can
now finance the media purchases for your product: www.mediafunding.com.
Secrets of Power Negotiating: Inside Secrets from a Master Negotiator (256 pages)
BY ROGER DAWSON
This is the one negotiating book that really opened my eyes and gave me practical tools I could use
immediately. I used the audio adaptation. If you’re hungry for more, William Ury’s Getting Past No and
G. Richard Shell’s Bargaining for Advantage: Negotiation Strategies for Reasonable People are
outstanding. These are the only negotiating books you’ll ever need.
Response Magazine (www.responsemagazine.com)
This magazine is dedicated to the multibillion-dollar direct response (DR) industry, with a focus on
television, radio, and Internet marketing. How-to articles (increasing sales per call, lowering media costs,
improving fulfillment, etc.) are interspersed with case studies of successful campaigns (George Foreman
Grill, Girls Gone Wild, etc.). The best outsourcers in the business also advertise in this magazine. This is
an excellent resource at an excellent price—free.
Jordan Whitney Greensheet (www.jwgreensheet.com)
This is an insider secret of the DR world. Jordan Whitney’s weekly and monthly reports dissect the most
successful product campaigns, including offers, pricing, guarantees, and ad frequencies (indicative of
spending and, thus, profitability). The publication also maintains an up-to-date tape library from which
infomercials and spot commercials can be purchased for competitive research. Highly recommended.
Small Giants: Companies That Choose to Be Great Instead of Big (256 pages)
BY BO BURLINGHAM
Longtime Inc. magazine editor-at-large Bo Burlingham crafts a beautiful collage and analysis of
companies that focus on being the best instead of growing like cancer into huge corporations. Companies
include Clif Bar Inc., Anchor Stream Microbrewery, rock star Ani DiFranco’s Righteous Babe Records,
and a dozen more from different industries. Bigger is not better, and this book proves it.
Negotiating World Travel and Preparing for Escape
Six Months Off: How to Plan, Negotiate, and Take the Break You Need Without Burning Bridges or
Going Broke (252 pages)
BY HOPE DLUGOZIMA , JAMES SCOTT , AND DAVID SHARP
This was the first book to make me step back and say, “Holy sh*t. I can actually do this!” It steamrolls
over most fear factors related to long-term travel and offers a step-by-step guide to taking time off to
travel or pursue other goals without giving up your career. Full of case studies and useful checklists.
Verge Magazine (http://vergemagazine.com)
This magazine, formerly known as Transitions Abroad, is the central hub of alternative travel and offers
dozens of incredible options for the non-tourist. Both the print and online versions are great starting
points for brainstorming how you will spend your time overseas. How about excavating in Jordan or ecovolunteering
in the Caribbean? It’s all here.
From the website: “Each issue takes you around the world with people who are doing something
different and making a difference doing it. This is the magazine resource for those wanting to volunteer,
work, study, or adventure overseas.”

hinted at this idea in the 1950s, but the intervening decades have developed it into a fine
art. Modern machine-learning systems can find extremely effective strategies for playing
computer games—from simple arcade games to complex real-time strategy games—by
applying reinforcement-learning algorithms. Inverse reinforcement learning turns this
approach around: By observing the actions of an intelligent agent that has already
learned effective strategies, we can infer the rewards that led to the development of those
strategies.

In its simplest form, inverse reinforcement learning is something people do all the
time. It’s so common that we even do it unconsciously. When you see a co-worker go to
a vending machine filled with potato chips and candy and buy a packet of unsalted nuts,
you infer that your co-worker (1) was hungry and (2) prefers healthy food. When an
acquaintance clearly sees you and then tries to avoid encountering you, you infer that
there’s some reason they don’t want to talk to you. When an adult spends a lot of time
and money in learning to play the cello, you infer that they must really like classical
music—whereas inferring the motives of a teenage boy learning to play an electric guitar
might be more of a challenge.

Inverse reinforcement learning is a statistical problem: We have some data—the
behavior of an intelligent agent—and we want to evaluate various hypotheses about the
rewards underlying that behavior. When faced with this question, a statistician thinks
about the generative model behind the data: What data would we expect to be generated
if the intelligent agent was motivated by a particular set of rewards? Equipped with the
generative model, the statistician can then work backward: What rewards would likely
have caused the agent to behave in that particular way?

If you’re trying to make inferences about the rewards that motivate human
behavior, the generative model is really a theory of how people behave—how human
minds work. Inferences about the hidden causes behind the behavior of other people
reflect a sophisticated model of human nature that we all carry around in our heads.
When that model is accurate, we make good inferences. When it’s not, we make
mistakes. For example, a student might infer that his professor is indifferent to him if the
professor doesn’t immediately respond to his email—a consequence of the student’s
failure to realize just how many emails that professor receives.

Automated intelligent systems that will make good inferences about what people
want must have good generative models for human behavior: that is, good models of
human cognition expressed in terms that can be implemented on a computer.
Historically, the search for computational models of human cognition is intimately
intertwined with the history of artificial intelligence itself. Only a few years after Norbert
Wiener published Ze Human Use of Human Beings, Logic Theorist, the first
computational model of human cognition and also the first artificial-intelligence system,
was developed by Herbert Simon, of Carnegie Tech, and Allen Newell, of the RAND
Corporation. Logic Theorist automatically produced mathematical proofs by emulating
the strategies used by human mathematicians.

The challenge in developing computational models of human cognition is making
models that are both accurate and generalizable. An accurate model, of course, predicts
human behavior with a minimum of errors. A generalizable model can make predictions
across a wide range of circumstances, including circumstances unanticipated by its

SELF-EVALUATION

Our Compensation and Nominating Committee conducts an annual performance evaluation to determine whether the Board, its committees,
and the directors are functioning effectively. This includes survey materials as well as conversations between each director and the lead director. The
evaluation focuses on the Board’s and the committees’ contributions to Carvana and has an enhanced focus on areas in which the Board or management
believes that the Board could improve.

As part of the annual Board self-evaluation, the Board evaluates whether the current leadership structure continues to be appropriate for
Carvana and its stockholders. Our corporate governance guidelines provide the flexibility for our Board to modify our leadership structure in the future as
appropriate.

SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE.

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors, executive officers and greater-than-ten-percent stockholders to file initial reports of
ownership and reports of changes in ownership of any of our securities with the SEC and us. We believe that during the 2018 fiscal year, all of our directors,
executive officers and greater-than-ten-percent stockholders complied with the requirements of Section 1 6(a).

RISK OVERSIGHT

The Board, as a whole and through the Audit Committee, oversees our risk management program, which is designed to identify, evaluate, and
respond to our high priority risks and opportunities. The risk management program facilitates constructive dialog at the senior management and board level
to proactively realize opportunities and manage risks. Our Audit Committee is primarily responsible for overseeing our risk management processes on
behalf of the full board. Our management, including our executive officers, is primarily responsible for managing the risks associated with the operation and
business of our company and provides regular updates to the Audit Committee and annual updates to the full board on the risk management program and
reports on the identified high priority risks and opportunities.

CODE OF ETHICS AND CONDUCT

We have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics that applies to all of our employees, officers, and directors, including those officers
responsible for financial reporting. Our code of business conduct and ethics is available on our website at investors.carvana.com/corporate-
governance/governance-documents. We intend to disclose any amendments to the code or waivers of its requirements on our website.

explanation (which I’m not quite getting): “Think of cancer the same way as
you think of a terrorist group. The NSA has been able to thwart a great
number of terrorism acts by intercepting communication signals from one
terrorist to another. That same dynamic, a form of signal intelligence, of
finding a terrorist in Europe, can be used to intercept communication
between cancer sells. Cancer cells merely communicate in protean code
rather than electronic code. If you can decode what the signals are saying
you can jam those signal between terrorist calls—essentially wipe out their
cell phones. Likewise if you can decode biological signals you can jam them
too, that’s the holy grail.”

Baron who, in his Baron Fund, has $26 billion under management. Then
Josh Harris the co-founder of Apollo Global Management ($164 billion
under management) and owner of the New Jersey Devils and the
Philadelphia 76ers.

Perhaps it’s just the ultimate feminist nightmare: Men (and a few
opportunistic women) continue to come to Epstein’s because—no matter
their public bows to modern manners—they simply don’t care that he
offends every aspect of reconstructed gender and political sensibilities. In
private, it remains a man’s world—a rich man’s world.

Or, it’s a guilty pleasure. People who know Jeffrey exchange
“Jeffrey” stories. “That’s Jeffrey,” says Mort Zuckerman, the real estate
billionaire and publisher of the Daily News (ever vitriolic in its coverage of
Epstein), with a twinkle in his eye and obvious enjoyment, to tales of
Epstein escapades. It is an outréness that Epstein seems delighted to
cultivate. In his Paris apartment, 10,000 square feet on the Avenue Foch, a
neighborhood otherwise occupied by foreign potentates, there is a stuffed
baby elephant in his living room—that is, the e/ephant in the room. (Epstein
says too it’s a reminder that elephants have 23 copies of tumor suppressor
genes and humans have only 1.) The single book on his bedside table is
Lolita (he is, beyond the joke, a great Nobokov fan).

Or, in a more sophisticated view, it’s a two tier understanding of the
world. There is a media version of the world, which most of us live in and
largely accept, and are certainly influenced by. And then there are those
people who live in the media itself and therefore know that it’s mostly bunk.
If the media says it, as likely some version of the opposite is true. I might
guess too that for many of his visitors there’s an order of identification: there
but for the grace of God. Any hyper-prominent person might, at any time,

Since the trough of the global financial crisis in
March 2009, US equities have returned nearly
300%, producing one of the longest bull markets
in the post-WWII period and outperforming all
other major developed and emerging market
country equities. US equities have also exceeded
their pre-crisis peaks of October 2007 and March
2000 by 75% and 103%, respectively, on a total
return basis. This bull market has exceeded all
other bull markets but one in length and exceeded
all but three in magnitude.

US economic growth has also exceeded that of
most other recoveries in length. This recovery is the
fourth-longest recovery in the post-WWII period?
and if, as we expect, the US economy avoids a
recession in the first half of 2017, this recovery
will become the third-longest. While many critics
correctly point out that it is the slowest recovery
since WWII, it has actually created more economic
growth than some of the stronger recoveries
that lasted for shorter periods. On a cumulative
basis, this recovery ranks sixth out of the last 10
recoveries with respect to GDP growth. What this
recovery has lacked in strength, it has partially
made up for in length.

The slow but steady growth has also exceeded
that of all other major developed economies,
and US GDP per capita has increased more than
the GDP per capita of any major developed or
emerging market country.

This recovery has created over 15 million
jobs. The unemployment rate decreased from
a peak of 10.0% in October 2009 to 4.6% in
November 2016 and is now below its long-term
average of 5.8%. Even the broader U6 measure,
which adds the underemployed (such as part-
time and discouraged workers) to the number of
unemployed, has fallen from a peak of 17.1% to
9.3%, and stands below its long-term average of
10.6%. Unemployment claims are not only lower
than they were during pre-crisis troughs but also
at their lowest since 1973; they are also the lowest
on record as a percentage of the labor force (see
Exhibit 1).

As a result of more robust employment, wages
have increased as well. Wage growth, as measured
by the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank Wage Growth
Tracker (which, in our opinion, is a better gauge
of the employment backdrop than average hourly

year-old, hands and feet bound, pleading for his life in return for the release of
the founder of Hamas, whom we had arrested and jailed in 1989. “The group
from Hamas kidnapped me,” he said. “They are demanding the release of
Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and another 200 people from Israeli prison. If their
demands are not met, they will execute me on Friday at 8 pm.”

As soon as we got word he was missing, I spoke to Rabin. Since we assumed
he was being held in Gaza, I ordered a unit from Sayeret Matkal to head south
and co-ordinate efforts to locate him with the Shin Bet and the southern
command. But it gradually became clear he might be much closer to where he’d
been seized. The Shin Bet got a description of the kidnappers’ car, and found it
was a rental that had been picked up and returned in east Jerusalem. They
tracked down the man who rented it. A little before dawn the morning of
October 14, barely 12 hours before the Hamas deadline, Shin Bet established
that Wachsman was being held in a village on the road to Ramallah, north of
Jerusalem, in a house owned by a Palestinian who was living abroad.

The hostage soldier’s ordeal was made even worse by the fact his mother,
Esther, was a Holocaust survivor, born in a displaced-persons camp in Germany
at the end of the war. Rabin had been ready to approve a rescue attempt from
the outset, assuming we could locate Wachsman and come up with a plan that
might work. But as with Entebbe, he said that if we couldn’t be reasonably
confident of success, we would negotiate. Now that we knew where
Waschsman was being held, I ordered Shaul Mofaz, the commander with
responsibility for the West Bank, to prepare for a possible rescue.

Before going to brief Rabin, I arranged for another commando unit to begin
visible preparations for an operation in Gaza, in an effort to reassure Hamas we
still believed he was being held there. Assuming we could retain the element of
surprise, there were several things working in our favor. The house was
relatively isolated. It was in an area where Israel, not the incipient Palestinian
authorities, still had control. And Sayeret Matkal had expertise and experience
in this kind of mission. Still, no plan could be foolproof. I told Rabin that the
fact Hamas was holding a single hostage meant that if our assault teams were
delayed for any reason at all, the kindappers might kill him before we got in.
But I said we had to weigh the risks of not acting. We were no longer trying to
find a missing soldier. We knew where he was. We had a unit ready. Unless
Hamas relented, he was facing death within hours. In those circumstances, the

the mesh and watch fish swimming underneath.

The rest of the afternoon we spent by the pool reading magazines and
eating fruit plates. Eventually he went to his cabana to have a nap later
on. That night after dinner and my mixed cocktail of Xanax and red wine,
I asked if he’d like another massage before I went to bed. He just wanted
to stay up watching movies in Jeffrey’s theatre room. As peculiar as that
request was to me I didn’t argue it, I just hoped I hadn’t disappointed him
in any way that could make it back to Jeffrey. | showed him how to use
the remote and turn off the T.V when he was finished before going to
bed. The next morning we were both catching a flight from St. Thomas
and we had no time for anything other than breakfast and packing, which
saved me from having to be too polite as we said our good-bye’s from the
terminal in the airport, both hurriedly off in separate directions,
thankfully. I arrived back in Palm Beach, only to be told to catch another
flight the next day to N.Y.C, where Jeffrey would fix me up the money he
owed me for treating his colleague out to an entertaining weekend.

Chapter 10

I was fixed up more than what | had usually made for two days, which
was great because that car I had been saving for was finally within my
reach. I had been waiting for the freedom a car gives every teenager for a
long time, and now that I had over fifteen thousand dollars saved up I
could pretty much afford to go buy myself a nice car outright. Looking
much better than the last time I saw him Jeffrey acknowledged it. I went
to his office where he was waiting for me and he had a guest with him.
She was unusual looking to the common stereotype drop dead gorgeous
girls Jeffrey had normally introduced me to. Of Asian decent, her name
was Rena. Jeffrey had met her at an art gallery where some of her own
artwork was on display. She had a bubbly persona about her and I could
then understand why Jeffrey liked her so much, she fit into the
subservient category that he liked his girls to fall under. It was apparent
to me that they had already slept together in the short time span they had
met, as there closeness was oddly noticeable and | wondered what it was
he was offering to her in exchange for her body. I found out later from
Jeffrey that he was buying her artwork, promising her the world as an
artist, telling her he’d have her work in the all the museums in N.Y.C and
the best art exhibits. Everyone was promised something, and seemed to
be bought off in someway or another to be in his company. It was only a
matter of time that the truth would come out.

To my own amazement Rena was to be assisting me in Jeffrey’s
massage this day, not being a total knockout or anything spectacular,
looks wise that is, but for some reason he seemed intrigued enough. As
we made our way through his spectacular mansion she was in total awe at
every corner. Commenting on the present artwork and décor that we
passed in every hall, it no longer seemed so grandeur to me anymore but
hearing someone else speak about it in such excitement reminded me of
the days when all of this seemed so unforeseen.

When we got to the massage room, or “The Dungeon” as | used to put
it for it’s medieval looking appearance, we firstly out of custom all hada
steam shower, where Jeffrey expected me to walk her through a servants
duties, telling her to take his other foot and start rubbing in small circles
and stroking the arches of his foot rhythmically. Rena took the
instructions well and began to massage him too. When we all went to the
shower next and she followed in my exact lead washing his body as well.
Jeffrey absolutely loved the fact that two teenage girls were dually
pampering him. Jeffrey wanted to move to the massage bed and I had to
further begin to show her about the body, upon his accord. She mimicked
my every move up his legs and buttocks, keeping up with every stroke
until he could not contain his arousal any longer and was already
requesting us to start kissing each other, the start of the very reason we
had even met in the first place.

He blatantly stopped the massage nowhere near being complete and
turned over to announce his increased arousal in a physical abundance of
grotesqueness. Moving over to the small couch in the corner of the room
he made a space for her to lye me down on the massage table as she had
commanded him to do in such a domineering tone that he wasn’t used to
being. spoken down to with. From that very moment onwards and from
the look on his face he was yearning for her to orchestrate an hour of
deliverance upon my meek nature. He started to stroke his erect manhood
as he was being tantalized watching her take over every inch of my body
in a dominating act of seduction. I was left breathless and soar after my
first introduction into the world of S&M.

Rena considered herself a dominatrix, she loved bondage, whipping
hitting, and eventually cutting her sex partner with little sharp knives
until they subdued to her punishment in agonizing pain. She was
absolutely crazy if you were to ask me, and I couldn’t help but wonder
what got her into this in the first place. All | knew was that Jeffrey was
absurdly taking into the appeal of watching us two interact, often with her
acting as my mistress who would fondle me with an insurmountable
amount of whips and toys. Then she would love to finish off every
session by hitting me across my face with a hard blow from the back of
her hand and sneering over my curled up body showing Jeffrey her ability

Foreword and Acknowledgements
The idea of compiling an Oxford companion to the Arab–Israeli conflict was first
presented to me in 2005 by Markus Bouillon, who served for me both in my UN
capacity in Jerusalem and at the International Peace Institute (IPI) in New York. Nur
Laiq laboriously and faithfully collected most of the relevant documents and contributed
to the organization of the book and the drafting of the introduction and comments.
Fabrice Aidan, a French diplomat, who served for ten years as my special
assistant and political adviser in my different United Nations capacities played an
instrumental role for the production of this volume. He made essential substantive
inputs to the organization and compilation of the documents and the composition of
the comments, throughout the book, as well as to the introduction. David Makovsky
and Marwan Muasher deserve thanks for reviewing the book and for providing
insightful comments.
I would like also to thank my staff at the International Peace Institute (IPI), Walter
Kemp and Adam Lupel, for their editing contribution. Miklos Pinther, former chief
UN cartographer, who in 2000 oversaw the delineation of the Blue Line between Israel,
Lebanon and Syria, compiled and produced the maps in this volume. Finally, my
executive assistant, Jilla Moazami, gave invaluable administrative support. Without
these colleagues, the book would have never come to print. I am delighted that the
volume came to its conclusion on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the signing of
the Oslo Accords of 1993.
I am grateful to the Government of Norway for generous support to the International
Peace Institute’s (IPI) Middle East program over many years.
I dedicate the book to my beloved wife, Ambassador Mona Juul, my companion in
war and peace, without whom I would never have become involved in the imbroglio of
the Middle East.

TERJE RØD-LARSEN
Terje Rød-Larsen became the President of the International Peace Institute (IPI) in
2005. IPI is an independent, international not-for-profit think tank headquartered in
New York, with regional offices in Vienna and Manama. IPI is dedicated to the
prevention and settlement of conflict. The UN Secretary-General is the honorary
chair of the board of the International Peace Institute. Concurrently, Terje Rød-Larsen

Philosophy at the Universities of Bergen and Oslo, before establishing the Fafo Institute
for Applied Sciences in Oslo in 1981.
As Director of Fafo, he initiated a research project into the living conditions of
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The relationships with both Palestinians
and Israelis that he established during the period of preparing and implementing this
project led to a request by the PLO in 1992 that he help establish a secret channel for
negotiations between the PLO and the Government of Israel. Those negotiations
concluded with the Oslo Accords and the signing of the Declaration of Principles at
the White House on 13 September 1993.
In 1993, Mr Rød-Larsen was appointed Ambassador and Special Adviser for the
Middle East Peace process to the Norwegian Foreign Minister. In mid-1994, he was
appointed United Nations Under-Secretary-General, Special Coordinator for Gaza and
the West Bank. In 1996, he was appointed Norwegian Cabinet Minister for Planning
and Cooperation.
In 1999, he moved back to the UN as Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace
Process and Personal Representative of the Secretary-General to the Palestine Liberation
Organization and the Palestinian Authority at the level of Under-Secretary-
General, a post he held until December 2004. In this capacity he negotiated the Israeli
withdrawal from Southern Lebanon in 2000 and established the UN line of withdrawal,
the ‘Blue Line’.
On 14 December 2004, he was appointed by the Secretary-General as his Special
Envoy for the implementation of Security Council Resolution 1559, on Lebanon and
Syria. In this capacity he negotiated the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon in
2005. He also represented the UN Secretary-General in the cease-fire negotiations
during the 2006 war in Lebanon between Hezbollah and Israel.

The Crooked Course:
Step by Step on the Path to Peace
INTRODUCTION
As Immanuel Kant observed, “out of the crooked timber of humanity no straight thing
was ever made.” And the Middle East peace process is no exception. It runs a crooked
course. This work provides a paper trail of the meandering and rocky path of the peace
process. Relevant documents related to the Arab–Israeli conflict over the past century
(since the Sykes–Picot Agreement of 1916) are compiled in this book. It provides an
annotated and chronological overview of attempts to make peace in one of the most
difficult and protracted conflicts in the world, and it includes a full set of accompanying
maps specially made for this edition.
The sheer volume of such a work raises the critical problem of how to present the
documents in a way that facilitates their accessibility and understanding. A simple
chronological ordering would miss important connections between the documents,
which are thus better grouped by common theme. To this end, we have divided the
volume into five thematic Parts. Part I compiles documents related to the formal peace
agreements between Israel and the Palestinians, as well as those related to Israel’s
unilateral disengagement from Gaza. The documents in Part II relate to the many
informal peace proposals and ideas offered over the years that have served to contribute
to more official processes at a later date. Part III compiles the many important United
Nations documents specifically related to the question of Palestine. Part IV sets the
Israeli–Palestinian issue in a broader context, providing regional papers going back a
century, up to the latest documents. Finally, Part V compiles Israeli and Palestinian
domestic documents relevant to the quest for peace in the Middle East.
Grouping the documents by theme highlights the evolution of particular aspects of
the conflict and the peace process over time. When examined as a group, these
documents provide valuable insights on the events, conditions, and actions that have
been most important in influencing the different phases of the peace process.
For guidance, the reader will find a chronological overview of all the documents and
key events.
ON PART I: PEACE AGREEMENTS AND THE
DISENGAGEMENT FROM GAZA
Nothing about the quest for peace in the Middle East has been simple or easily attained.
Merely bringing Palestinians and Israelis together was a feat that took decades to
achieve. Despite all the efforts exerted by not only the principal parties, but also local
actors, regional neighbors, and international players, agreements between the two sides

The Crooked Course
have been scarce. This Part chronicles the rare moments when both Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators put pen to paper in an effort to resolve a conflict that has
seemed intractable.
Part I begins with the Oslo peace talks, which in 1993 produced the Declaration of
Principles (DoP) and the mutual recognition of the State of Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian
people. These two agreements formed the basis for all subsequent talks between the
parties.
In 1992, as the director of the Norwegian research institute Fafo, I initiated, together
with then member of Knesset Yossi Beilin, secret talks between him and local Palestinian
leader Faisal Husseini, at the American Colony Hotel in Jerusalem. These talks, which
were facilitated by Fafo and the Foreign Ministry of Norway, reached a dead end later that
year. The Norwegians realized that without involving the exiled and outlawed Palestinian
leadership in Tunis, nothing could be accomplished. At the time, both Israeli and
American citizens were forbidden to engage with any member of the PLO. In December
1992, I flew to Tunis to meet for the first time with PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat. In that
meeting in his villa, in the darkness of the early morning hours, he authorized the head of
Fatah’s financial wing, Ahmed Qorei (alias Abu Ala), to travel to Oslo for secret talks
facilitated by Fafo in cooperation with the Norwegian Foreign Ministry. The first meeting
took place at Borregaard Manor outside Oslo, in January 1993.
From January to May 1993, secret talks were conducted as a pre-negotiation phase,
in parallel to the Madrid process taking place in Washington. The goals of prenegotiations
in Oslo were twofold: to build trust between the Palestinian and Israeli
representatives; and to explore possible parameters of an agreement. In order to reach
the first goal, the exercise was restricted to a small group, willing to engage in secret
intense interaction over a lengthy period. Unlike the massive delegations in Washington,
the delegations in Oslo were never larger than three to five people on each side,
with continued interaction often from dawn to dusk.
In Oslo, the Palestinians were represented from day one by a delegation of the PLO,
handpicked by its chairman, Yasir Arafat. The rationale behind this unprecedented
step was that the Norwegians had discovered that the PLO was already controlling
every detail, albeit invisibly, of the bilateral and multilateral talks in Washington.
Furthermore we believed that if the PLO and Yasir Arafat were not directly involved
in the talks, they still had the ability and the will to block any agreement. Allowing
others to reach an agreement would be tantamount to political suicide by the PLO.
Therefore, it was necessary to have them at the table. Without them, no agreement
could be reached.
The pre-negotiation phase ended on 1 May 1993. The talks had reached a point
where both parties believed that the other was negotiating in good faith and that an
agreement had to take the shape of a declaration of principles. On that date, the head of
the Palestinian negotiation team, Ahmed Qorei, invited me for a walk in the hills above
Oslo. He made it clear—in the most explicit of words—that the PLO would not
continue into a final round of talks unless the Israelis “upgraded” their delegation to
high-level officials. Up to this point, the Israelis were represented by two academics
(Ron Pundak and Yair Hirschfeld) who did not hold any formal position in the

government. In the following days, I flew to Israel to convey the request to Yossi Beilin,
then Deputy Foreign Minister. Shortly afterwards, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres
dispatched the Director General of the ministry, Uri Savir, and the head of the
ministry’s legal department, Joel Singer, to Oslo. The Norwegians had, until then,
seen the secret talks in Oslo and their potential outcome only as possible inputs to the
negotiations in Washington. We were puzzled—and pleasantly surprised—to realize
that the parties now wanted to negotiate the full deal under the Oslo framework.
Indeed, in the spring of 1993 the parties started to conduct proper negotiations in
Oslo—out of the public eye—rather than through the formal process in Washington.
Within four months, the Declaration of Principles was initialed in a secret ceremony in
the Government Guest House in Oslo. This was followed by a new set of secret
negotiations in Paris, facilitated by the Norwegian team (Johan Jorgen Holst, Jan
Egeland, Mona Juul, and myself). The outcome was the mutual recognition of the
State of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, which paved the way for the
formal signing of the Oslo Accords on the White House lawn on 13 September 1993.
The Declaration of Principles was based on the approach that the easiest issues
should be resolved first, with remaining issues to be addressed later, step-by-step. A
Palestinian Authority for self-rule would be established, first gaining control over Gaza
and Jericho, and then gradually expanding into the West Bank. The details of the
expansion were to be hammered out in the so-called Oslo II Agreement, signed in
Cairo on 28 September 1995.
As unique and effective as this approach proved to be, the Oslo Accords would not
have been possible without the dramatic changes taking place within the international
system at the time. The PLO had been financially dependent on the states of the Arab
Gulf and the Communist bloc. The collapse of the Soviet Union and Arafat’s support of
Saddam Hussein during the Gulf War of 1991 resulted in the collapse of funding for the
PLO and an end to remittances to Palestinian families in Gaza and the West Bank.
Simultaneously, the first Intifada between 1987 and 1993 and the emergence of a new
local leadership in Gaza and the West Bank created a threat to the leadership of the
PLO in exile in Tunis. The organization needed desperately to regain its financial
footing, as well as its political stature. These were major incentives to move the
Organization into what was to become the Oslo process.
The Israeli leadership also had its reasons to come to the negotiating table. The rise
of satellite television channels, such as CNN, beamed live images around the world of
Israeli soldiers armed to the teeth combating stone-throwing kids in Gaza and the West
Bank. Support for the government of Israel dropped dramatically in Europe and at
home. Israelis began to feel that they were losing the moral high ground. Israeli leaders
saw that using traditional military means to combat the Intifada came at a high political
and moral cost. They too were in search of a political way out. In short, the Oslo
channel came precisely at the right time, providing a lifeline for both the Israeli and
Palestinian leaderships.
The implementation of the Declaration of Principles started in earnest in 1994, with
Yasir Arafat’s spectacular arrival in Gaza and the rapid establishment of the Palestinian
Authority. I had the pleasure of welcoming him on behalf of UN Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali, as his newly appointed Special Coordinator for the Occupied

Territories and Personal Representative to the PLO and the Palestinian Authority at
our new headquarters in Gaza city. The PLO had regained its uncontested leadership,
and the Palestinian Authority received a massive financial boost with the influx of
donor money from across the world. Israel received a moral boost as a large number of
countries formally recognized its existence and established diplomatic relations.
A hallmark of the Declaration of Principles was the establishment of a gradual
approach to resolving the conflict. Gradualism now became the keyword for describing
the peace process. By breaking the overall goal of peace into manageable sections that
could be addressed in sequence, the Oslo process allowed for progress to be made and
trust to develop on less contentious issues before tackling more controversial topics like
Jerusalem, borders, security arrangements, and refugees, which could threaten to derail
any talks.
One of the principal advantages of the step-by-step or gradualist approach was that
it enabled the parties to reach compromises through ongoing dialogue and interaction
with each other by starting with the easiest issues and leaving the hardest for last. It
allowed for an incremental change in perceptions and political positions. Although
gradualism allowed success to be achieved in a variety of areas, moving the process
forward, at each stage, depended on the parties taking the bold steps necessary to fulfill
their respective commitments. The main weakness was slow movement in implementation,
with progress falling behind agreed upon timelines. This led to periodic
disillusionment and back-sliding.
A recurrent problem was that the parties had failed to agree on a mechanism to
penalize non-compliance. This critical deficiency undermined progress. As leaders and
the political climate changed, so too did the resolve to implement.
Successful gradualism required the use of ambiguous language on the most contentious
issues: Jerusalem, borders, security, and refugees. The successive Israeli governments
and the Palestinian leadership had substantially different views on the final
status of all four of these issues. The language contained within the Oslo documents, as
well as subsequent agreements, provides room for interpretation. Either side could
claim that the text represents their interests. This allowed leaders to go home to their
respective constituents and retain popular support.
Another practice that proved effective was the use of the annexes attached to agreements
to flesh out disruptive details, or to substantially water down the impact of
certain commitments made within the body of the text. In many cases the annexes are
exhaustively long and detailed but are rarely read by the public, affording the leaders
political space to make agreements that might otherwise face public criticism.
The three Israeli Prime Ministers who were in office from 1993 to 1999—Rabin,
Peres, and Netanyahu—approached the challenges of peace through a concept of
gradualism, postponing the tricky final status issues. Barak, who took office in 1999,
was the first Israeli Prime Minister to address the final status head-on with a “totalist”
approach (read below).
While the Oslo process was based on the concept of gradualism, characterized by
bilateral negotiations—facilitated by a third party—and cumulative small steps demonstrating
good faith, Ariel Sharon eventually took a contrary approach through
“uncompromising unilateralism”. The day after he won the election in February 2001,

he invited me to meet him at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem. During the course of
the conversation, he surprisingly asked what I would do with the peace process if I were
him. I had just re-read his autobiography, Warrior, and answered: “Both as a soldier
and as a politician, you have a history of being bold, daunting, daring and making
surprise moves. In that spirit, I would suggest that you dismantle the settlements and
pull your troops completely out of Gaza.” For a minute I worried that this would anger
him, but he answered very calmly. “I cannot do it.” I asked why. He said: “Because of
the harbor.” I replied, rather perplexed: “But there is no harbor in Gaza.” He said:
“That’s not the point. They could build one if we left Gaza.” Then I realized that,
contrary to common opinion, Sharon had no ideological inhibitions about leaving
Gaza. His concerns were only about security. This gave me high hopes that he would
eventually do it. Three years of stalemate were to follow. And then in December 2003,
out of the blue, Sharon made the sweeping and stunning pronouncement that Israel
would leave Gaza and end its occupation of the Strip.
Ariel Sharon deserves praise for withdrawing from Gaza. But his unilateral move
undermined the possibility of peaceful relations between the inhabitants of the Gaza
Strip and Israel. The PLO and the Palestinian Authority were sidelined. They could not
claim credit for the move, and thus had scant motivation for supporting it. Instead,
militants in Gaza and the West Bank harvested all the benefits. The Disengagement
plan undermined those on the Palestinian side who claimed that the negotiating table
was a more efficient tool than the barrel of a gun in order to resolve the conflict.
ON PART II: PEACE PROPOSALS AND IDEAS
The formal agreements covered in Part I represent the conclusions of long and complex
diplomatic processes. Part II encompasses proposals and ideas that contributed to
breaking taboos and changing opinions that paved the way for precedent-setting
agreements.
In the late 1970s and 1980s several plans and initiatives were put forward which
maintain relevance for the future of the peace process. One idea was a comprehensive
and unified Arab approach which was first proposed in the Fahd Plan (1981), and later
refined in the Arab Peace Initiative of 2002. The latter peace proposal promoted by
then Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah al-Saud represented a unified shift in the Arab
States’ approach to Israel. Where there was once rejection, the Arab peace initiative
created the possibility of universal recognition of the State of Israel. All 57 countries of
the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) endorsed the initiative.
The aftermath of the Gulf War of 1991 opened new opportunities to address the
complex issue of peace in the Middle East. This was the backdrop for the groundbreaking
Madrid Peace Conference, convened by the United States and the Soviet Union. It
raised new hopes for peaceful resolution to the enduring conflicts of the region. The
conference created an unprecedented platform for peace talks, based on the principle of
“land for peace”. The Israelis would have to cede land to their Arab adversaries in
return for peace and security. The Madrid formula for organizing such talks followed a

two-track approach: bilateral negotiations in Washington; and the formation of several
multilateral working groups to address specific issues such as water, refugees, the
economy, etc. It is worth noting that the PLO was not accepted at the negotiating
table. Instead the Palestinians were represented by a joint delegation of Jordanian
officials and prominent Palestinians, who allegedly were not associated with the PLO.
In stark contrast to the Oslo process, the Washington talks under the Madrid formula
were public and in the constant glare of the media. This resulted in the parties
continuously posturing to win the favor of the complex power structures that they
reported to, as well as of domestic public constituencies. However, Madrid broke the
taboo of direct bilateral talks between Arabs and Israelis. Madrid failed as a process, but
succeeded as a spectacular event for creating hope, and formed a springboard for the
subsequent secret Oslo talks.
As noted in the comments on Part I, Oslo and all subsequent agreements were
embraced by the three Israeli Prime Ministers before Ehud Barak took office in 1999.
As opposed to the gradualist approach of his predecessors, Barak took the path of
totalism, i.e. aiming at solving all remaining issues in one go. Pursuant to this approach,
as he put it: “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed”. Heroically, he wanted to
resolve simultaneously all matters with Lebanon, Syria, and the Palestinians, and put a
final end to all conflicts.
Shortly after his election, I was invited to meet him at his home in the outskirts of Tel
Aviv. He described his new approach metaphorically: “In order to resolve a problem,
you need to analyze what the problem is, and define your objective. The problem at
hand is that we have an ugly dog in front of us. The objective is to beautify the dog. In
order to do so, you need to analyze why it is ugly. And then you see that it is the tail that
makes the dog ugly. Through this analysis, our task becomes easy: by chopping off the
tail we will have a beautiful dog.” And then he added sarcastically: “But I will not chop
off the tail of the dog the way you Oslo people have been doing it, painfully slice by slice
like a salami. We need to chop it off all in one go.”
In this spirit, in the summer of 2000 President Clinton brought the parties to the
presidential estate at Camp David for marathon talks behind closed doors. The attempt
failed for many reasons. First of all, a few weeks of talks did not provide ample time to
address the thorniest issues (Oslo took six months of negotiation to address the least
difficult issues). Other reasons were internal Palestinian disagreements and difficult
interpersonal relations, in addition to a “take-it-or-leave it” approach by Israel.
Although the leaders left Camp David without diplomatic feathers in their cap,
President Clinton and his team now had a clear sense of what was needed to bridge
the gap between the two parties. In late December 2000, he presented what became
known as the Clinton Parameters. They were a comprehensive set of American ideas
on how to end the conflict. However, time was not on the side of peace. With his second
term coming to an end, Clinton was unable to persuade the parties to conclude an
agreement. In addition, Likud Party leader Ariel Sharon’s visit to the Temple Mount /
Haram al-Sharif in September 2000 signaled the second Palestinian uprising. This
reduced the room for maneuver for the Palestinian negotiators.
Following the election of George W. Bush as President of the United States, and
against the backdrop of the new Intifada, Palestinian and Israeli negotiators gathered in

early 2001 in the small Egyptian seaside town of Taba. They attempted, through
bilateral talks, to capitalize on the basic ideas put forward by President Clinton. In
spite of high hopes inspired by the Taba talks, hope was dashed by Israeli intransigence,
reinforced by the violent uprising across the West Bank and Gaza, as well as internal
tensions within the Palestinian leadership.
In an attempt to revive the peace process, President George W. Bush, in a speech in
the Rose Garden in June 2002, took the bold step of publicly declaring support for an
independent Palestinian state. However, he was convinced that Chairman Arafat was
an impediment to peace, due to the continuing violence against Israelis emanating
from Gaza and the West Bank. The President made further US involvement in peace
negotiations contingent upon Arafat’s removal from power, and the implementation of
democratic reforms in the Palestinian Authority’s political structure. This was consistent
with Prime Minister Sharon’s policies. At this time, parts of the Palestinian
leadership either passively turned a blind eye to the rise of bombings in Israel, or
discreetly encouraged it. Arafat became a pariah for several essential players and was
isolated in his Muqata headquarters in Ramallah.
Under these dire circumstances, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan called for a
meeting in the conference room of his executive office at United Nations’ Headquarters
in New York with the US, Russia, and the European Union. The frustration was deep
amongst all parties. Bilateral talks did not happen. Trilateral talks did not work. In
response to the breakdown of the peace process, he suggested that the four actors
coordinate a position to restart the process. The idea was to combine the political
power of the US, Russia’s credibility amongst key Arab states, the European Union’s
financial muscle, and the UN’s legitimacy in a potent new international coalition. The
UN Secretary-General coined the phrase the “Middle East Quartet” for this informal
group. The Quartet met both at principals level and at the level of special envoys.
A novel approach to the imbroglio of Middle East peacemaking was launched:
multilateral unilateralism. The concept was launched at a Quartet Envoys’ working
dinner at the Norwegian Ambassador’s residence in Herzliya (a suburb of Tel Aviv) by
US officials William Burns and David Satterfield. The idea was for the Quartet
members to collectively produce an operational peace plan to be presented to the
parties for implementation, without prior consultation. This resulted in the Quartet
peace plan, referred to as the Road Map, which was eventually presented to the parties
as an ultimatum in 2003. In other words, a unified position was imposed by a group of
third parties upon the disputants—thus, multilateral unilateralism.
The Quartet collectively submitted the text to Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud
Abbas. The US ambassador to Israel presented it to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon,
who refused to meet with the Quartet as a whole. The Palestinian side accepted the
proposals in total while the Israeli side came up with fourteen reservations.
The Oslo Accords mapped a path towards a possible peace agreement, setting up
milestones to be passed along the way, and stipulating that the ride on this bumpy road
would take five years. It did not define the end point of the journey, because the parties
were not capable of closing the gaps between their positions at the time. The 2003
Performance-Based Road Map of the Quartet was, in many ways, the paper that
concluded the Declaration of Principles of 1993, by designating the last milestone,
the establishment of a Palestinian state.
OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 10/9/2014, SPi

The Crooked Course
However, compromises among the Quartet members led to ambiguities which gave
the parties the opportunity to make radically different interpretations of their obligations
under the plan. The Israeli side claimed that the Road Map called for security first—a
complete end of Palestinian violence—before any negotiations could start. This strategy
was called sequentialism. The Palestinian side, and the international community at large,
supported a strategy of parallelism that called for progress on both security and political
issues to happen in lock-step. The collision of the concepts of parallelism and sequentialism
made it impossible to reach the final destination envisioned in the Road Map.
With gridlock in the formal negotiating process, civil society groups tried to take the
initiative. One example of several is the Geneva Accords of December 2003 led by PLO
official Yasser Abed Rabbo and former Israeli Minister Yossi Beilin.
The stalemate in the process continued until Ehud Olmert’s election as Prime
Minister in 2006. Through intense negotiations facilitated by US Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice and her team, the parties came close to striking a deal which would
have pushed the peace process forward. However, as the end game of this phase of the
negotiations, also known as the Annapolis process, unfolded, Prime Minister Olmert
had to step down because of an indictment for alleged financial misconduct. At the
same time also, a new wave of rockets emanating from Gaza, lead to a military
operation in the Strip (Operation ‘Cast Lead’).
The scene and characters changed in early 2009 with the election of Barack Obama
as President of the United States, and Benjamin Netanyahu as Prime Minister of Israel
for a second time. Shortly after his inauguration, President Obama attempted to
resuscitate the peace process with the appointment of a new high-level special envoy,
Senator George Mitchell. An absolute freeze on settlements, including in Jerusalem,
was made a precondition for bringing the parties to the table. This turned out to be a
self-defeating proposal. For any Israeli Prime Minister, such a major move could only
be the result of, and not the pre-condition for, negotiations.
During this paralysis, the Palestinian leadership looked for alternative ways of
moving forward, and shifted their strategy from bilateralism to unilateralism through
a bid to upgrade the Palestinian status to be on a par with the Vatican at the United
Nations: that of an observer Member State in the General Assembly. This quest reached
its climax during the UN General Assembly sessions of 2011 and 2012. In a speech to
the General Assembly in September 2011, President Abbas called for admission of
Palestine as a Member State of the United Nations. It reflected the growing frustration
among the Palestinian community with the lack of progress since the end of the
Annapolis process in 2008. In December 2012, the Palestinians were granted, with a
large majority, state observer status at the UN.
ON PART III: UNITED NATIONS DOCUMENTS
ON THE QUESTION OF PALESTINE
An accurate picture of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict must include an understanding
of the role of the United Nations. Part III provides a comprehensive collection of
Resolutions and documents which have significantly shaped the context of this seemingly
intractable issue.
OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 10/9/2014, SPi
The Crooked Course
xxxvii
Many of the political battles related to the Arab–Israeli conflict have been fought in
the halls of the United Nations. On 29 November 1947, the UN General Assembly
voted Resolution 181, also known as the Partition Plan. It called for the creation of two
states—one Palestinian and one Jewish.
Other key UN Resolutions include General Assembly Resolution 194 (1948), which
calls for the return of Palestinian refugees; General Assembly Resolution 303 (1949),
which designates Jerusalem to be placed under UN jurisdiction; and, most famously,
Security Council Resolution 242 (1967), which calls on Israel to withdraw from all
territory seized during the Six Day War of 1967.
Paradoxically, some of the Resolutions are seen by both parties as supporting their
side of the argument. For example, in Resolution 242 the interpretation of the clause
calling for “withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent
conflict” has been controversially ambiguous, and the object of widely different interpretations.
The key argument relates to whether the clause requires Israel to withdraw
from all territory occupied in the 1967 war, or only from some parts of the territory
captured. While many Resolutions have had hardly any effect, they nevertheless
continue to be used as points of reference in the different attempts to resolve the
conflict.
ON PART IV: REGIONAL DOCUMENTS
The Israeli–Palestinian issue cannot be seen in isolation: it affects and has been affected
by broader regional dynamics and conflicts for a century. After years of colonial
competition, France and the United Kingdom drew lines in the sand through the
Sykes–Picot Agreement of 1916. This agreement divided the region into spheres of
influence, and eventually led to the creation of new countries. In the subsequent thirty
years, several programmatic initiatives were taken in the context of multiple anticolonial
campaigns for national self-determination and political sovereignty, including
the quest of the Jewish people for a national homeland.
The 1948 war between Arab countries and the newly founded State of Israel resulted
in the latter significantly expanding its territory beyond that allotted to it by the UN
Partition Plan. This marked the beginning of more than half a century of Israeli–Arab
tensions and conflicts. Gradually the focus moved from the legitimacy of the state of
Israel to the country’s territorial boundaries. This coincided with broadening support,
not only internationally but also in Israel, for the establishment of a Palestinian state
living peacefully, side by side, with the state of Israel, within mutually secured borders.
Obtaining the regional buy-in to peace with Israel began with the different armistice
agreements signed in the wake of the 1948 war. While these agreements ended the war,
the fighting continued to flare up as the armistice lines established were not internationally
recognized borders.
The Arab–Israeli conflict came to a new head with the Six Day War in June 1967,
when Israel conquered the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip from Egypt, the West
Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria. In the
aftermath, Arab nations unified their position against Israel with the Arab League
OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 10/9/2014, SPi

The Crooked Course
Resolution at the Khartoum Summit, which is referred to as the “Three Noes Document”
due to its clause that states: “no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no
negotiations with it”. On 6 October 1973, Syria and Egypt launched a war against Israel
that ended in a political stand-off between Israel and its Arab adversaries.
In November 1977, Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat broke Arab unity when he—
in a move which stunned the world—flew to Israel and addressed the Knesset in a bid
for a peaceful resolution of the Arab–Israeli conflict. Subsequently, in 1978, he signed
the Camp David Accords that established a separate bilateral peace agreement with
Israel.
Camp David highlighted the importance of a third-party broker. When President
Sadat and his counterpart, Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel, reached a
stalemate, US President Jimmy Carter invited the parties to his presidential estate for
trilateral discussions on 5 September 1978. Three scheduled days of negotiations
turned into thirteen days of frustrating and intense talks. Since these tripartite discussions
were unable to break the impasse, President Carter decided to work separately
with both sides. The result was an American proposal which incorporated the requirements
of both parties into a single text. After lengthy negotiations on this document,
President Carter’s shuttle diplomacy resulted in the Camp David Accords of 17
September 1978.
In 1993, PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat followed the precedent of President Sadat and
broke ranks with fellow Arab leaders by secretly and bilaterally recognizing the State of
Israel and signing the Oslo Accords. The year after, building on the agreements
between Israel and the PLO, King Hussein of Jordan followed suit by negotiating a
bilateral peace treaty with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel. This culminated in a
spectacular signing ceremony at the desert border crossing of Wadi Araba in August
1994. In the agreement, Israel acknowledged Jordan’s historical role over Muslim holy
sites in Jerusalem and agreed to recognize this role in future permanent status
negotiations with the Palestinians. The two leaders also agreed on steps such as the
opening of border crossings and economic cooperation.
In 1999, Labor Party leader Ehud Barak defeated incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu. As has been described above, the new Prime Minister broke radically
with the concept of gradualism that had been the hallmark of negotiations between
Yasir Arafat and three Israeli Prime Ministers, Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres, and
Benjamin Netanyahu, favoring a more comprehensive approach to the peace process.
For the first half of 2000, Arafat and the Palestinians were left to wait for a Syrian peace
deal that was not to come. Despite Barak offering Syrian President Hafez al-Assad 99
per cent of the Golan Heights, it still fell short of Assad’s demand for a return to the 4
June 1967 lines, and the Syria track subsequently crumbled. This put Arafat on the
spot: how could he now, in front of the Arab world, accept less for the Palestinians than
Assad had demanded for the Syrians?
The Lebanon track fared better. It began in late 1999 with a dialogue between Prime
Minister Barak and me, as the newly appointed UN Special Coordinator for the Middle
East peace process. The Prime Minister confided to me that, as a part of his comprehensive
quest for resolving all the conflicts that Israel had with its neighbors, he wanted
to end Israel’s occupation of Southern Lebanon that had started in 1978. Eventually, he
OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 10/9/2014, SPi

conceded that only the United Nations, and not Israel alone, could delineate on a map
and demarcate on the ground the line of withdrawal. Such a line had to be, to the best of
the United Nations’ knowledge, in conformity with Lebanon’s international boundaries.
On this basis, and with the consent of the parties, the UN Secretary-General could
then report to the Security Council and eventually recommend that it should confirm
that Israel had ended its occupation. This understanding led to an agreement for the
United Nations to negotiate with the Governments of Lebanon, Syria and Israel.
Through intense, difficult, and stormy tripartite negotiations over five months, the
UN Secretary-General was in May 2000 able to report to the Security Council that the
UN had reached an agreement with Israel, Syria, and Lebanon on a line of withdrawal
(the so-called Blue Line). On this basis, it was determined that Israeli troops had left all
Lebanese territory. Further, he reported that, consistent with UN requirements, Israel’s
Lebanese proxy, the South Lebanese Army (SLA), had been disarmed and disbanded.
Subsequently, the UN Security Council confirmed the end of Israel’s occupation of
Southern Lebanon in fulfillment of Security Council Resolutions 425 and 426 of 1978.
In September 2004, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1559. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan appointed me as his special envoy for its implementation. In a
nutshell the resolution called for respect for Lebanon’s sovereignty, territorial integrity,
and political independence; the disbanding and disarming of all Lebanese and non-
Lebanese militias; and the withdrawal of all foreign troops. After Israel’s full withdrawal
from Lebanon in 2000, the only remaining foreign troops were Syrian. Immediately
after the resolution was adopted, I engaged in intense negotiations with President
Assad, who until the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafic Hariri on 14
February 2005, was consistently resistant to move on the issue. On 12 March 2005, I
was airborne with a small UN team, among them Fabrice Aidan, on my way to
Damascus for a new round of talks with the President. Midway, the captain informed
me that he was requested to change course and land in Aleppo. Afterwards I was told
that the reason was to avoid the media who were waiting for the arrival of the UN team
in Damascus. I was picked up at Aleppo airport by Walid Muallem, who was then
Deputy Foreign Minister. He brought me to Assad’s villa, where a few hours of
negotiations resulted in the Aleppo understanding, which outlined Syria’s military
withdrawal from Lebanon with specific timelines. Assad honored his word, and
ended twenty-nine years of Syrian military presence in Lebanon consistent with
Resolution 1559.
What is often forgotten in the recurrent doom and gloom in the Middle East, is that
the step-by-step approach, which started with the Camp David Accords of 1978, has
for more than thirty years led to conflict resolution: peace between Israel and Egypt; the
Oslo Accords; the mutual recognition of Israel and the PLO; the establishment of the
Palestinian Authority in Gaza and the West Bank, which still functions with its
presidency, cabinet, and ministries; peace between Israel and Jordan in 1994, with
the recognition of borders and a long-lasting security cooperation; Israel’s withdrawal
from Southern Lebanon in 2000; and the subsequent Syrian military withdrawal five
years later; as well as Israel’s pull out from the Gaza Strip. All these steps would have
been difficult, if not impossible, without the previous ones.
In 2000 the attempts to put a final end to the Syrian–Israeli and the Palestinian–
Israeli conflicts both failed. This exposes the risks of a totalist approach to solving such

xl

conflicts. These heroic attempts, facilitated by President Bill Clinton and his team,
created a crisis of expectations, leading to the second Intifada and violent confrontation
between Israelis and Palestinians, with tragic loss of life on both sides. This illustrates a
fundamental dilemma in the choice between a gradualist and a totalist approach.
Totalism’s “all or nothing” approach is inherently risky. When it backfires, it easily
leads to a relapse into violence. Gradualism is less spectacular and appealing, with its
incremental and long-term approach. However, it is precisely these characteristics
which make it less risky, and more successful under some circumstances.
While totalism failed in 2000, with tragic consequences, it nevertheless broke down a
number of taboos, such as addressing explicitly the partition of Jerusalem and the issue
of Palestinian refugees.
ON PART V: ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN
DOMESTIC DOCUMENTS
Part V seeks to provide a fuller context to the quest for peace in the Middle East. All
politics are local, and the Arab–Israeli conflict typifies this axiom. The ability of
negotiators to come to conclusions is only half the story. Documents such as the
original Palestinian National Charter or Israel’s Declaration of Independence shaped
attitudes, policies, and action on both sides.
Furthermore, the Part includes important policy statements that signal revisions of
previous policies such as Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad’s vision
for a new Palestinian state. In August 2009, Fayyad introduced the “Program of the
Thirteenth Government” (the Fayyad Plan), which established a path to develop a
functional Palestinian state within a two-year time frame. The blueprint sought to
establish and improve governing institutions, end Palestinian economic dependence on
Israel, and enhance overall infrastructure. It was a move to create a de facto Palestinian
state within the existing Palestinian territory, regardless of any formal recognition of
such an entity. Fayyad sought proactive steps to “end the occupation, despite the
occupation”. He stressed it was not meant as a unilateral declaration of statehood.
Indeed, substantial developments did take place during Prime Minister Fayyad’s
tenure. In 2011, both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund made
statements that the Palestinian Authority was capable of running the economy of an
independent state, and that it was on track to developing the necessary functions of a
state.
The Middle East peace process continues to run its crooked course. There is no quick
fix. Yet, as this volume demonstrates, many brave attempts have been made to bring
peace to this troubled region.
By compiling annotated documents related to the quest for peace in the Middle East,
a useful record and reference tool are created. Our hope is also that this volume will
inspire future students, analysts, policy makers, and negotiators to learn from, and
draw on, the experiences of the past.

As we continue to move on the crooked path, no doubt, this compendium will have
to be updated in the future. Hopefully, one of those additions will be a peace agreement
that will eventually allow us all to close the book on the protracted conflicts in the

Case No.: CACE 15-000072

Edwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records

followed (see generally Docket Entry or “DE” 225-1 at 4-5), ultimately leading to a further
Court ruling in June 2013 that the Government should produce documents. DE 189. The
Government then produced about 1,500 pages of largely irrelevant materials to the victims (DE
225-1 at 5), while simultaneously submitting 14,825 pages of relevant materials under seal to the
Court. The Government claimed that these pages were “privileged” for various reasons,
attaching an abbreviated privilege log.

While these discovery issues were pending, in the summer of 2014, Edwards and Cassell,
contacted Government counsel to request their agreement to add two additional victims to the
case, including Ms. Virginia Giuffre (who was identified in court pleadings as “Jane Doe No.
3”). Edwards and Cassell sought to have her added to the case via stipulation, which would have
avoided the need to include any detailed facts about her abuse. Weeks went by and the
Government — as it had done on a similar request for a stipulation to add another victim — did not
respond to counsel’s request for a stipulation. Finally, on December 10, 2014, despite having
had four months to provide a position, the Government responded by email to counsel that it was
seeking more time, indicating that the Government understood that victims’ counsel might need
to file a motion with the court on the matter immediately. DE 291 at 3-5. Rather than file a
motion immediately, victims’ counsel waited and continued to press the Government for a
stipulation. See id. at 5. Finally, on December 23, 2014 — more than four months after the initial
request for a stipulated joinder into the case — the Government tersely indicated its objection,
without indicating any reason: “Our position is that we oppose adding new petitioners at this

stage of the litigation.” See DE 291 at 5.

Chapter 10: Speech that Conflicts with Reputational and Privacy Rights

Defamation: “He that filches from me my good name:”

Whenever a Holocaust denier or defamer of the Jews spews out his poison, I get calls and emails
demanding that I sue them for defaming the Jewish people or committing a “blood libel.” But
under our First Amendment only an individual can be defamed. There is no such thing as group
libel. In other words you can say all you want about “the Jews,” “the Democratic Party,” “the
Blacks,” “the Gays,” and “the women’”—obnoxious as these generalizations might be. An anti-
Semite is constitutionally free to spread the blood libel against the Jewish people or the Jewish
religion, so long as he is careful not to accuse a specific individual of killing Christian children for
their blood. This is not true in other countries that do have group libel laws and other rules
prohibiting racist statements. Not so under our First Amendment.

In addition to the defamatory statement being directed against a specific individual, it must also
cast him in a negative light. That used to be easier to define than it is today. For example, when a
newspaper in the segregated Deep South made a typographical error and described a white man
as a “colored gentleman,” instead of a “cultured gentleman,” that error was defamatory, since
describing a white person as colored clearly could damage his career and hurt his position.

Today, no court would consider it defamatory to mistakenly report on someone’s race. It’s a
little more complicated when it comes to sexual preference. Ifa newspaper were to characterize
a heterosexual politician as gay, that might well hurt his electoral chances, but courts would be
reluctant today to rule that being called “gay” is an insult. The same is true of other former words
of opprobrium that have lost or decreased their negative connotations over the years.

In addition to being damaging, a defamation must also be untrue. This wasn’t always the case,
and Thomas Jefferson successfully fought to limit defamations to untruthful statements about an
individual.**

If the individual defamed is a public figure, such as a politician, celebrity or anyone else who has
sought the limelight, yet another hurdle must now be overcome. Since the Supreme Court’s 1964
decision in New York Times v. Sullivan, a defamation action can be brought by a public figure
only if the false statement was made with “actual malice—that is knowledge that it was false or
with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.”

I was Justice Goldberg’s law clerk when the Supreme Court rendered that precedent-shattering
decision. Goldberg told me that he was concerned that the daunting requirements of the case
would make it open season on public figures and would lower the standards of journalistic ethics.
He himself, as a public figure, had been defamed on several occasions and it had stung him.
Nonetheless, he concurred in the decision and wrote the following stirring words about the
freedom to criticize:

“The theory of our Constitution is that every citizen may speak his mind and every
newspaper express its view on matters of public concern, and may not be barred from
speaking or publishing because those in control of government think that what is said or

What, of that $1 billion investment, was

she said, and the project had consulted with
Israeli experts. In some cases, you have
to do that, she said, alluding to the

Israelis was a necessary business decision
for a project this large and complex.

Enemy disinformation, as well as simple error, can also set us on the
wrong track. The enemy acts not just on the battlefield but also
through an ability to influence our understanding of the situation by
means of denial and deception. In this and other ways complexity
reinforces uncertainty.1 The large number of actors involved in the
Iranian situation would make it very difficult to discern clearly what
is happening once the shooting starts, and the scene would remain
very fluid as long as the fight persisted, and very likely for a good
while afterward.2

As to the meaning of war, it may hardly seem worthwhile to probe
something so self-evident, except that it is not self-evident anymore,
if it ever was. A simple definition of war is the waging of armed
conflict against an enemy, but this is too limited a concept in the 21st
century. War in our time involves simultaneous conflict in the
military, diplomatic, economic and social domains on four levels:
political, strategic, operational and tactical.3 While a war with Iran
might begin in the military domain, it would likely expand to others,
and while it might begin at the operational or tactical level it would
soon encompass strategic and political levels as well.

How these twin expansions would take place has everything to do
with context. All wars have one. Would a U.S.-Iran war break out
during a protracted diplomatic process, or in the absence or abeyance
of one? Would it happen during a period of increasing tension and
military readiness, or out of the blue, after one party thinks that the
dangers of war have subsided? Would the U.S. government assemble
a broad “coalition of the willing’, just a few close allies-in-arms at
the ready, or go it alone, even actively dissuading Israel from joining
an attack? What would the domestic political situation be in the
United States? Would there be an internal political consensus to act,
or would there be an active, acrimonious debate? Would the
American people be prepared for the aftermath of an initial attack,

have been reeled in unwittingly. Morell suggested in his book that
Snowden might not himself have fully realized “when and how he
would be used.”

It can be safely assumed that the decision made by Putin’s intel-
ligence service to allow Snowden to travel to Russia proceeded from
something other than softhearted sentiment about his welfare. After
Putin learned that there was an American in Hong Kong from the
“special services” seeking to come to Russia, he also learned from
Snowden’s own disclosure on the video released that Snowden had
taken a large number of NSA documents to Hong Kong: indeed,
some were shown on the video. After that self-outing by Snowden,
Putin had plenty of time to calculate the advantages and disadvan-
tages of allowing him to come to Moscow.

Putin could offer him not only freedom from arrest but also a
platform to express his views. The exploitation of an intelligence
defector, even after he yields his secrets, can be the final stage of
a successful intelligence operation. The CIA considered one of its
greatest coups of the Cold War its release of the espionage-acquired

© secret speech of Nikita Khrushchev to the Communist Party of the ©
Soviet Union in 1956 exposing the transgressions of the previous
regime of Joseph Stalin. Making public these deeds was meant by
the CIA to sow discord both inside the Soviet Union and to disrupt
its relations with its allies. General Alexander suggested that Putin
might similarly be “looking to capitalize on the fact that [Snowden’s]
actions are enormously disruptive and damaging to US interests.”
This potential gain, if Alexander’s assessment is correct, provided
Putin with an additional reason to have his representatives in Hong
Kong offer Snowden exfiltration.

Snowden was in no position to refuse. After the release of the
video, there was no going back to America without his facing a
determined criminal prosecution. He would have known that in
almost every prior case intelligence workers who had intentionally
released even a single classified document had gone to prison. As his
Internet postings show, he had closely followed the ordeal of Bradley
Manning, whose trial was coming to its conclusion while Snowden
was in Hong Kong. Manning had been kept in solitary confinement

is a form of cafeteria plan benefit, funded
by a voluntary salary reduction arrange-
ment with pretax dollars. The benefits are
subject to an annual maximum and an an-
nual “use-or-lose” rule. Qualified medical
expenses are those incurred by, among other
individuals, the employee and his or her
Because of DOMA,
only opposite-sex married couples could use
health FSA dollars for a spouse’s qualified

medical expenses.

opposite-sex spouse.

IMPACT. The Supreme Courts decision
to strike down DOMA presumably opens
the door to same-sex married couples be-
ing able to use FSA dollars for qualified
medical expenses of both spouses. The IRS

is expected to issue guidance.

COMMENT. A cafeteria plan may not
allow an employee to request salary re-
duction contributions for a health FSA in
excess of $2,500 for plan years beginning
after December 31, 2012.

Health Savings Accounts. A health savings
account (HSA) is a vehicle that eligible tax-
payers can use to pay for or reimburse quali-
fied medical expenses. Contributions to
an HSA are tax-deductible (employer con-
tributions are excluded from gross income)
and distributions are tax-free if used to pay
for qualified medical expenses. To be an eli-
gible taxpayer, the individual, among other
requirements, must be covered by a high-de-
ductible health plan (HDHP), not enrolled
in Medicare, not claimed as a dependent on
another taxpayer's return. Qualified medi-
cal expenses are those incurred by, among
others, the taxpayer and his or her spouse.
Because of DOMA, only opposite-sex mar-
ried couples could HSA dollars for a spouse’s
qualified medical expenses.

IMPACT. With DOMA being struck
down by the Supreme Court, same-sex
married couples will presumably be able
to use HSA dollars for qualified medical
expenses of both spouses.

COBRA/FMLA. Federal law requires that
certain employers offer continuation of health
care coverage to employees, their spouses,

CCH Tax Briefing

and families (“COBRA coverage’). Current
federal laws related to COBRA coverage do
not apply to same-sex married couples. The
DOMA definition of spouse precludes the
extension of Family and Medical Leave Act
(FMLA) leave benefits to opposite-sex part-
ners. After the Supreme Court’s decision in
Windsor, these rights presumably would now
be available to same-sex spouses.

“The IRS is expected

to provide guidance on
the timing of employee
benefit plan amendments,

including the issue of
whether benefits need to
be made retroactive or
only prospective.”

Retirement Plans. The Internal Rev-
enue Code provides extensive protections
for the spouse of an employee to share in
the employee’s retirement benefits payable
through Code Sec. 401(k) plans and other
qualified plans. These protections would
presumably now apply to the same-sex
spouse of an employee.

AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care
Act, signed into law by President Obama
in 2010, set in motion a host of changes to
the delivery of health care and health insur-
ance coverage. Some of the changes already
in place affect health savings accounts (dis-
cussed above in this Briefing). Other chang-
es are scheduled to take effect after 2013.

Individual Mandate And Penalty. Be-
ginning in 2014, the Affordable Care Act
imposes a penalty on individuals who do
not carry minimum essential health cov-
erage for one or more months, subject
to certain exceptions. Married taxpayers
who file a joint return are jointly liable

for any penalty that may be imposed
upon either spouse. The penalty does not
apply in certain cases, such as in the case
of individuals whose household incomes
are below their filing thresholds. Now
that DOMA has been struck down, same-
sex married couples presumably will be
treated in the same manner as opposite-
sex married couples for purposes of the
individual mandate and its penalty.

COMMENT. The Affordable Care Act pro-
hibits the IRS from using liens or levies to
collect any unpaid penalty. The IRS cannot
levy on the property of one spouse to satisfy
an unpaid penalty of the other spouse.

Premium Assistance Tax Credit. Beginning
in 2014, the Code Sec. 36B premium assis-
tance tax credit is scheduled to be available
to those qualified individuals and families
who are not offered minimum essential cov-
erage and as a result obtain coverage through
a health benefit exchange. The Affordable
Care Act provides for advance payment of
the credit. Taxpayers who are married at the
end of the tax year must file a joint return
Because DOMA has

been struck down, same-sex married couples

to claim the credit.

will presumably need to file a joint return to
claim the credit.

Code Sec. 45R Credit. For tax years 2010
through 2013, eligible employers may claim
a credit of 35 percent of health insurance
premiums paid (25 percent for small tax-
exempt employers). In tax years beginning
after 2013, an employer must participate in
an insurance exchange in order to claim the
credit. The credit is scheduled to increase
to 50 percent for small business employers
(35 percent for small tax-exempt employers)
after 2013 (but will terminate after 2015).
Certain family members are not treated as
employees for purposes of the credit. Un-
der DOMA, these restrictions did not apply
to same-sex married couples because their
marriages were not recognized for federal
purposes. With DOMA’s demise, a same-
sex spouse who satisfies any of these criteria
would presumably not be treated as an em-
ployee for purposes of the credit.

pander to it, why give it more visibility? This was fundamental Bannonism: stop thinking
you can somehow get along with your enemies.

As the debate went on, Priebus pushed for one of his deputies at the Republican
National Committee, Sean Spicer, a well-liked forty-five-year-old Washington political
professional with a string of posts on the Hill in the George W. Bush years as well as with
the RNC. Spicer, hesitant to take the job, kept anxiously posing the question to colleagues
in the Washington swamp: “If I do this, will I ever be able to work again?”

There were conflicting answers.

During the transition, many members of Trump’s team came to agree with Bannon that
their approach to White House press management ought to be to push it off—and the
longer the arm’s length the better. For the press, this initiative, or rumors of it, became
another sign of the incoming administration’s antipress stance and its systematic efforts to
cut off the information supply. In truth, the suggestions about moving the briefing room
away from the White House, or curtailing the briefing schedule, or limiting broadcast
windows or press pool access, were variously discussed by other incoming
administrations. In her husband’s White House, Hillary Clinton had been a proponent of
limiting press access.

It was Donald Trump who was not able to relinquish this proximity to the press and the
stage in his own house. He regularly berated Spicer for his ham-handed performances,
often giving his full attention to them. His response to Spicer’s briefings was part of his
continuing belief that nobody could work the media like he could, that somehow he had
been stuck with an F-Troop communications team that was absent charisma, magnetism,
and proper media connections.

Trump’s pressure on Spicer—a constant stream of directorial castigation and
instruction that reliably rattled the press secretary—helped turn the briefings into a can’t-
miss train wreck. Meanwhile, the real press operation had more or less devolved into a set
of competing press organizations within the White House.

There was Hope Hicks and the president, living in what other West Wingers
characterized as an alternative universe in which the mainstream media would yet
discover the charm and wisdom of Donald Trump. Where past presidents might have spent
portions of their day talking about the needs, desires, and points of leverage among
various members of Congress, the president and Hicks spent a great deal of time talking
about a fixed cast of media personalities, trying to second-guess the real agendas and weak
spots among cable anchors and producers and Times and Post reporters.

Often the focus of this otherworldly ambition was directed at Zimes reporter Maggie
Haberman. Haberman’s front-page beat at the paper, which might be called the “weirdness
of Donald Trump” beat, involved producing vivid tales of eccentricities, questionable

Their reasoning is straightforward but has generated a great deal
of controversy. Hameroff observes that anesthetics cause humans to
lose consciousness by binding to tubulin, but they do not halt all brain
function. He, therefore, concludes our conscious thinking is mediated
by tubulin, not the larger scale firing of the neurons. Penrose had been
looking for a mechanism in the brain that would explain how brains
solve non-computational problems. Together Penrose and Hameroff
propose tubulin micro tubes are quantum gravity computers that allow
us to think non-computationally and are the seat of consciousness. The
ideas are still being worked.

Penrose and Hameroff have a difficult task conveying their ideas
to the rest of the scientific community. Scientists don’t recognize a
need for something that can think non-computably, so they are highly
skeptical of a mechanism which performs that sort of thought. The
latest development on the Hameroff Penrose model comes in the work
of Travis Craddock, now of Nova Southeastern University, Florida, and
others. They have written a paper arguing signals propagate according
to quantum principles within microtubules through the excitation
of thiamin molecules along the length of the tube. They believe these
molecules are quantum, entangled in a similar manner to the mechanism
recently discovered in photosynthesis. The geometry of these molecules
is set out in a similar way to the active areas in chlorophyll and they
have a complementary problems to solve. Chlorophyll tries to maximize
energy conversion efficiency, while a microtubule tries to minimize the
use of energy while propagating signals along a nerve. You might wonder

GOP fundraiser Broidy under investigation 
for alleged effort to sell government 
influence, people familiar with probe say 
Carol D. Leonnig 
The Justice Department is investigating whether longtime Republican fundraiser Elliott 
Broidy sought to sell his influence with the Trump administration by offering to deliver U.S. 
government actions for foreign officials in exchange for tens of millions of dollars, 
according to three people familiar with the probe. 
As part of the investigation, prosecutors are scrutinizing a plan that Broidy allegedly 
developed to try to persuade the Trump government to extradite a Chinese dissident back to 
his home country, a move sought by Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to two of the 
people. 
They are also investigating claims that Broidy sought $75 million from a Malaysian business 
official if the Justice Department ended its investigation of a development fund run by the 
Malaysian government. The Malaysian probe has examined the role of the former prime 
minister in the embezzlement of billions of dollars from the fund. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031764 
A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. Christopher Clark, an attorney 
for Broidy, declined to comment. 
Broidy's alleged activities were detailed in news reports earlier this year that cited hacked 
emails. The Los Angeles-based venture capitalist, who served as top fundraiser for the 
Republican Party and President Trump, has said  that allegations against him are an effort by 
his enemies to smear him. 
Rudolph W. Giuliani, an attorney for Trump, said he had no knowledge of any request for 
records related to Broidy. The White House referred a request for comment to the 
Republican National Committee, which declined to comment. 
[Trump fundraiser Elliott Broidy sues Qatar alleging cyber smear campaign] 
In recent weeks, prosecutors with the Justice Department's public integrity section___which 
examines possible political and government corruption___have sought documents related to 
Broidy's business dealings. 
Among the information sought by investigators are details about Broidy's work on behalf of 
and interactions with the Chinese and Malaysian officials, according to two people familiar 
with the document requests. 
As part of their efforts, prosecutors have subpoenaed casino magnate Steve Wynn, the 
former RNC finance chairman and longtime Trump friend, for copies of records and 
communications related to Broidy. 
An attorney for Wynn, Reid Weingarten, declined to comment, saying only that Wynn is 
cooperating with the Justice Department. 
Steve Wynn is completely cooperating with the investigation and he certainly has no reason 
to believe that anyone acted improperly in anything he knew about or was involved in, 
Weingarten said in a statement. 
Wynn was tapped by Trump to serve as the RNC 's lead fundraiser after the election. Earlier 
this year, he stepped down from that post and from his executive role at his resort company 
after reports of sexual misconduct. Wynn has denied the allegations of inappropriate 
behavior. 
The public integrity probe is the latest legal challenge for Broidy, who helped corral big  
donors to support Trump's presidential campaign, throwing a lavish fundraiser for the then-
nominee at his Los Angeles-area home during the 2016 campaign. After the election, he was 
appointed to serve as a national deputy chairman for the RNC. 
Broidy sought to parlay his party role and connections to the White House and on Capitol 
Hill in pitches to foreign governments, according to a person with direct knowledge of his 
activities. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031765 
In April, he resigned from his RNC position in the wake of a report that he had paid a former 
Playboy model $1.6 million in exchange for her silence about a sexual affair. Trump's 
personal attorney, Michael Cohen___another RNC fundraiser___helped arrange the 
settlement, Broidy acknowledged. 
[RNC deputy finance chair steps down after admitting Trump's lawyer negotiated settlement 
between him and pregnant Playboy model] 
Cohen is under investigation by federal prosecutors in Manhattan who are examining 
whether he fraudulently obtained millions of dollars in loans and whether his efforts to 
squash negative stories about Trump during the campaign violated election law. 
Broidy's business dealings captured the attention of investigators for special counsel Robert 
S. Mueller III, who asked at least one witness about Broidy's activities, according to a 
person familiar with the matter. 
Broidy's attempts to solve high-level headaches for the Chinese and Malaysian governments 
were first reported this spring by the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, which 
cited in part a cache of hacked emails. 
Broidy has said the documents were stolen by enemies seeking to ruin his reputation. 
This whole narrative is a fabrication driven by hackers who want to undermine me, Broidy 
said in a statement to the Times. Earlier this year, he filed a lawsuit against the country of 
Qatar, alleging that it hacked his email accounts in retaliation for his allegations that Qatar 
supports terrorists. A spokesman for the Qatari government has called the suit without fact 
or merit. 
,1 
The Journal reported in March that, according to a draft contract, Broidy and his wife, Robin 
Rosenzweig, were seeking $75 million from Malaysian businessman Jho Low if federal 
prosecutors dropped their investigation into a Malaysian state investment fund. 
The Justice Department has filed civil suits claiming $4.5 billion in public money was 
misappropriated from the fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad, seeking to claim a portion 
of those assets. Last month, Malaysian authorities charged former prime minister Najib 
Razak with embezzling billions in public money from the fund. 
Clark, the Broidy attorney, told The Journal that Rosenzweig's firm had been hired to 
provide strategic advice to Low, adding that at no time did Mr. Broidy or Ms. Rosenzweig, 
or anyone acting on their behalf, discuss Mr. Low's case with President Trump, any member 
of his staff, or anyone at the U.S. Department of Justice. 
The Times reported  in April that Broidy had explored ways to force Chinese exile Guo 
Wengui to leave the United States. The billionaire businessman had fled China in 2014 as he 
was facing arrest for a range of charges, including corruption. Guo has said the allegations 
were fabricated by a government that wants to silence him. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031766 
Since his arrival in the U.S., Guo has publicly detailed allegations of corruption in the 
Chinese ruling party. 
The Times reported that Broidy drafted a plan to enlist Emirati officials to pressure the U.S. 
to turn over Guo. In his statement to the newspaper, Broidy said he never had a strategy or 
plan regarding Mr. Guo nor was there any compensation given or even discussed. 
Broidy's alleged efforts to push for Guo's extradition came after Wynn separately helped 
deliver a message from the Xi government seeking to have the dissident returned to China, 
according to a person familiar with the effort. 
Wynn, who has contacts with Chinese officials because of his business interests in Macau, 
hand-delivered a letter to Trump seeking Guo '5 deportation, The Journal reported  last year. 
A spokesman for Wynn Resorts has said that the report about Wynn's role was false. 
At the time, the president expressed interest in assisting the Chinese, but was met with 
resistance by senior law enforcement officials, according to the person. 
White House officials did not respond to requests for comment.

A. If the government fails to demonstrate prior knowledge of requested
subpoenaed documents, the act of producing those documents is testimonial.

Two Supreme Court precedents, Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391 (1976) and United
States v. Hubbell, as well as Hubbell’s progeny, United States v. Ponds, 454 F.3d 313 (D.C. Cir.
2006), inform the determination of whether a production of documents in response to a
subpoena has a testimonial character. Fisher involved IRS investigations in which the
government learned that the investigated taxpayers had given their attorneys tax returns
prepared by their accountants in the years in question. The Court highlighted that the
subpoenaed documents belonged to the accountant and not the target of the investigation, were
- prepared by the accountant, and are “the kind usually prepared by an accountant working on the
tax returns of his client.” Fisher, 425 U.S. at 411. The Court concluded that insofar as the
government was not relying on the taxpayer to prove the existence of the documents, production
of the documents was not “testimonial” because “the existence and location of the papers are a
foregone conclusion and the taxpayer adds little or nothing to the sum total of the Government's
information by conceding that he in fact has the papers.” Id.

In contrast to Fisher, a case in which investigators already knew that documents existed
and exactly where they were located, the investigators in Hubbell lacked “any prior knowledge of
either the existence or the whereabouts” of the subpoenaed materials. Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27, 44-
45. Hubbell arose out of the Whitewater investigation, in which Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr sought broad categories of information from Webster Hubbell, a target of the
investigation. The subpoena included such requests as “any and all documents reflecting,
referring, or relating to” the broad contours of the investigation, as well as “Hubbell's schedule
of activities.” Id. at 41, 47. In examining the broad requests in the subpoena, the Court
emphasized that “it [was] apparent from the text of the subpoena itself that the prosecutor
needed respondent’s assistance both to identify potential sources of information and to produce
those sources.” Id. at 41. The Court ruled that the acts required to respond to such a broad
subpoena were testimonial in nature, comparing them to “answering a series of interrogatories
asking a witness to disclose the existence and location of particular documents fitting certain
broad descriptions.” Id. at 41, 43.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit applied Hubbell and
Fisher in United States v. Ponds, framing the inquiry as concerning “an act of production that,
in its testimonial character, falls somewhere between the response to a fishing expedition
addressed in United States v. Hubbell, and the production of documents whose existence was a
‘foregone conclusion’ in Fisher v. United States.” United States v. Ponds, 454 F.3d 313, 316
(D.C. Cir. 2006). The court emphasized that “[w]Jhether an act of production is sufficiently
testimonial to implicate the Fifth Amendment . . . depends on the government’s knowledge
regarding the documents before they are produced.” Id. at 320. Significantly, the Ponds court
put the burden on the government to show that the act of production would not be testimonial,
requiring the government to show its pre-subpoena knowledge of the “existence, possession, and
authenticity of the subpoenaed documents with reasonable particularity such that the
communication inherent in the act of production can be considered a foregone conclusion.” Id.
at 324 (internal citations omitted). :

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022960.txt,"though stating what should have been perfectly obvious, “is the biggest
landowner in New Mexico.”

And then there is Epstein’s yet more structural explanation as to why
after prison and with continuing tabloid infamy he can maintain his valued
place. It comes back, not unexpectedly, to the nature or the needs of money:

“At a certain level of finance, almost everyone is allied with an
institutional interest. You are part of government, or you want to be in
government, or you are connected to a bank or other portfolio, or you have
key relationships with certain corporations or industries. Because of my
situation, I have none of that. I have no institutional bona fides which makes
me in some sense one of the few independent sources of information and
actual honest brokers. That’s the usefulness of disgrace.”

And then there is too, that he is right. Since I began working on this
piece in September, Epstein predictions about the price of oil, the Euro, and
the Danish Krone have all born out.

And something else, which perhaps also surely accounts for Epstein’s
continuing relationships with the rich and powerful.

Most everyone who is now of a certain age and certain ambition and
certain status grew up in, and found they were temperamentally suited to the
new age of wealth that started in the late 1970s. A meritocracy on steroids,
or, as Vanity Fair would baldly and ingratiatingly dub it, the new
establishment, an increasingly parallel world, a self-invented one, at further
and further remove from the ordinary one. In some sense, Epstein is just one
version, picaresque, as well as louche, of this shared story.

Epstein was born in 1953 in Coney Island. His father worked for the
city’s Parks Department. His mother was a housewife. He has a younger
brother, Mark. Epstein was distinguished by little other than his math talents.
The captain of the math team at Lafayette High school in Bensonhurst, goes
on to Cooper Union where the tuition is free. He drops out after two years
and begins taking classes at the NYU’s Courant Institute of Mathematics.
Then, without a college degree, hence by slight of hand or deft
misrepresentation, gets a job teaching math and physics at Dalton in 1974.

It’s his first exposure to the wealthy. They have, he concludes, just as
many problems as the people in Coney Island, just different ones, almost
invariably involving divorce and money. “I found it interesting as a science
experiment,” he recalled not long ago as we chatted about his life. “It did not
really involve me. I could just stand back and watch.”

Dalton fathers were attracted to him. Punch Sulzberger, the publisher
of the New York Times, and father of one of Epstein’s students (Cynthia, the

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022960
"
IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012034.txt,"While “Jane Doe #3” is unidentified in this week’s court filing, her story appears to track with
that of a woman who sued Epstein in 2009 and settled with him later that year. She apparently
granted an on-the-record interview to Britain's Daily Mail in 2011.

Some of the fascination with Epstein on the part of tabloids and glossy magazines stems from his
ties to former President Bill Clinton. In 2002, Epstein provided his 727 to Clinton for a trip to
Africa to study anti-AIDS programs. Celebrities such as Chris Tucker and Kevin Spacey came
along for the ride. The new court filing makes no mention of Clinton, Tucker or Spacey.

The federal investigation obtained manifests for Epstein’s private jet travel, but prosecutors
never charged anyone besides the investor with involvement in obtaining or using underaged
girls for sexual purposes.

The new court filing says this result is in part due to the fact that Epstein’s legal team—which
included such heavyweights as former independent counsel and solicitor general Ken Starr, trial
lawyer Roy Black, and Dershowitz—negotiated a deal that precluded the feds charging anyone
as a co-conspirator.

Lawyers for Jane Doe #3 argue in the new motion that Dershowitz put this language in the
agreement to protect himself.

However, the law professor told POLITICO he didn’t negotiate that deal and it wasn't aimed at
protecting him. “I had nothing to do with drafting the non-prosecution agreement.” he said.

Dershowitz added that the last draft of the agreement mentioned four people by name who
wouldn't be prosecuted and he was not among them. All were regular associates or assistants of
Epstein, the lawyer said, adding that the final language removed those names and simply barred
federal prosecutors in South Florida from going after any potential co-conspirators.

Epstein and his lawyers fought hard to prevent records about his plea negotiations from being
turned over to victims’ attorneys. However, U.S. District Court Judge Keith Marra ruled last year
that the victims are entitled to examine those records to prepare their case against the
government.

Epstein, Black and others appealed that decision to the Atlanta-based | lth Circuit Court of
Appeals, but it ruled in April of this year that no privilege protects plea negotiations in this sort
of dispute.

Edwards and Cassell did not respond to requests for comment for this post, including an inquiry
about their response to Dershowitz's comments. However, the pair appear to be pressing forward
with the victims’ rights lawsuit, which seeks to unravel the no-federal-prosecution deal cut for
Epstein in 2007.

UPDATE (Wednesday, 7:18 P.M): This post has been updated with further comment from

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013192.txt,"276 14 Representing Implicit Knowledge via Hypergraphs

Cognitive Equation Principle: In an intelligent system, many abstract patterns that are
present in the system at a certain time as patterns among other Schema and Concepts, will at
a near-future time be present in the system as patterns among elementary system components.

The Cognitive Equation Principle, briefly discussed in Chapter 3, basically means that Con-
cepts and Schema emergent in the system are recognized by the system and then embodied
as elementary items in the system so that patterns among them in their emergent form be-
come, with the passage of time, patterns among them in their directly-system-embodied form.
This is a natural consequence of the way intelligent systems continually recognize patterns in
themselves.

Note that derived hypergraphs may be constructed corresponding to any complex system
which demonstrates a variety of internal dynamical patterns depending on its situation. How-
ever, if a system is not intelligent, then according to the patternist philosophy evolution of its
derived hypergraph can’t necessarily be expected to follow the above principles.

14.4.1 SMEPH Principles in CogPrime

We now more explicitly elaborate the application of these ideas in the CogPrime context. As
noted above, in addition to explicit knowledge representation in terms of Nodes and Links,
CogPrime also incorporates implicit knowledge representation in the form of what are called
Maps: collections of Nodes and Links that tend to be utilized together within cognitive processes.

These Maps constitute a CogPrime system’s derived hypergraph, which will not be iden-
tical to the hypergraph it uses for explicit knowledge representation. However, an interesting
feedback loop arises here, in that the intelligence’s self-study will generally lead it to recognize
large portions of its derived hypergraph as patterns in itself, and then embody these patterns
within its concretely implemented knowledge hypergraph. This relates to the Cognitive Equa-
tion Principle defined above 3, in which an intelligent system continually recognizes patterns in
itself and embodies these patterns in its own basic structure (so that new patterns may more
easily emerge from them).

Often it happens that a particular CogPrime node will serve as the center of a map, so that
e.g. the Concept Link denoting cat will consist of a number of nodes and links roughly centered
around a ConceptNode that is linked to the WordNode cat. But this is not guaranteed and
some CogPrime maps are more diffuse than this with no particular center.

Somewhat similarly, the key SMEPH dynamics are represented explicitly in CogPrime: prob-
abilistic reasoning is carried out via explicit application of PLN on the CogPrime hypergraph,
evolutionary learning is carried out via application of the MOSES optimization algorithm, and
attention allocation is carried out via a combination of inference and evolutionary pattern min-
ing. But the SMEPH dynamics also occur implicitly in CogPrime: emergent maps are reasoned
on probabilistically as an indirect consequence of node-and-link level PLN activity; maps evolve
as a consequence of the coordinated whole of CogPrime dynamics; and attention shifts between
maps according to complex emergent dynamics.

To see the need for maps, consider that even a Node that has a particular meaning attached
to it - like the Iraq Node, say - doesn’t contain much of the meaning of Jrag in it. The meaning
of frag lies in the Links attached to this Node, and the Links attached to their Nodes - and
the other Nodes and Links not explicitly represented in the system, which will be created by

But I don't see why that should extend to ridicule. That includes astrologists. Astronomers can refute astrology, while 
recognizing that perfectly honest and deluded people may believe it and should be treated with respect, while their

dogma) are people who we should be responding to but without ridiculing them. It may be hard sometimes. For 
example, when the icon and founding father of sober non-sentimental Realism in International Affairs informs us that 
the US, unlike other countries, has a transcendental purpose, and the fact that it constantly acts in contradiction to 
its purpose doesn't matter because the facts are just abuse of history while real history is the evidence of history as 
our minds reflect it, then it's hard to avoid ridicule. But we should. There's no point ridiculing virtually the entire IR 
profession and the major journals, even though such extraordinary irrationality leads to major human disasters. 
On Davis, I frankly think that's a non-issue. If she decides she cannot do her job as the conditions of employment

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011529.txt,"One of the captured Golani soldiers was a 19-year-old named Uri Ilan, the
son of a member of the Israeli Knesset whom Ben-Gurion and the whole of the
government knew well. The soldiers’ captivity dragged on until they were
finally returned to Israel in March 1956. By then, however, Uri Ilan had hanged
himself. He managed to hide a note into his uniform. It was found when the
body was being prepared for burial. It read: Lo bagadeti. Nekamah. “J did not
betray anything. Revenge.”

Ever since the Uri Ilan mission, there had been a de facto ban on cross-
border intelligence operations by Israeli soldiers. Ben-Gurion and his military
commanders knew, of course, the importance of getting early warning of an
enemy attack. But they decided the price of possible failure was simply too
high.

Sayeret Matkal was born three years later. Avraham was still part of the unit
running low-level agents in Syria and Lebanon, but his commander reluctantly
agreed to allow him to set up his new intelligence group. His initial
“headquarters” was a sparsely furnished Tel Aviv apartment. The first people he
brought in were veterans of the Palmach’s Arab Platoon, pre-state fighters who
trained themselves to pass as Arabs and gather intelligence, or stage raids,
behind enemy lines. Next, he invited friends who had served in Unit 101 and
Company A. Finally, he enlisted a core of them to help train recruits to his new
sayeret. He hoped the involvement of these commando veterans would also give
the unit credibility inside the kirva. One of them, Micha Kapusta, had been part
of 101, as had Itzhak Gibli, who had been a teenage Palmachnik in 1948. A
third was another Company A officer named Aharon Eshel, known as Errol, in
part for his undeniably Errol Flynn-like swagger, but also an acronym of his
Hebrew name. But the crowing addition to the group had the distinction of
having led the last successful Israeli bugging mission on the Golan, in addition
to being the most respected commando in Israel, a man who Dayan would later
call the country’s greatest soldier. It was Meir Har-Zion himself.

I was part of the second group of recruits to Sayeret Matkal, in the early
summer of 1960. The unit had been given its own base barely a year earlier. Bu
it had yet to carry out a single mission, and there was no sign of that happening.
Avraham couldn’t be sure when, or if, the generals in the kirya might give him

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013186.txt,"270 13 Local, Global and Glocal Knowledge Representation

The activation of the key will generally cause the activation of the map, and the activation o
a significant percentage of the map will cause the activation of the rest of the map, including the
key. Furthermore, if the key were for some reason forgotten, then after a significant amount o
effort, the system would likely to be able to reconstitute it (perhaps with various small changes)
from the information in the map. We conjecture that this particular kind of glocal memory wil
turn out to be very powerful for AGI, due to its ability to combine the strengths of forma
logical inference with those of self-organizing attractor neural networks.

As a simple example, consider the representation of a “tower”, in the context of an artificia
agent that has built towers of blocks, and seen pictures of many other kinds of towers, and seen
some tall building that it knows are somewhat like towers but perhaps not exactly towers. I
this agent is reasonably conceptually advanced (say, at Piagetan the concrete operational level)
then its mind will contain some declarative relationships partially characterizing the concept o
“tower,” as well as its sensory and episodic examples, and its procedural knowledge about how
to build towers.

The key of the “tower” concept in the agent’s mind may consist of internal images and
episodes regarding the towers it knows best, the essential operations it knows are useful for
building towers (piling blocks atop blocks atop blocks...), and the core declarative relations
summarizing “towerness” — and the whole “tower” map then consists of a much larger number
of images, episodes, procedures and declarative relationships connected to “tower” and other
related entities. If any portion of the map is removed — even if the key is removed — then the
rest of the map can be approximately reconstituted, after some work. Some cognitive operations
are best done on the localized representation — e.g. logical reasoning. Other operations, such as
attention allocation and guidance of inference control, are best done using the globalized map
representation.

"
IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016869.txt,"more efficiently by machines. The successful creation of AGI would be the biggest event
in human history, so why is there so little serious discussion of what it might lead to?

Here again, the answer involves multiple reasons.

First, as Upton Sinclair famously quipped, “It is difficult to get a man to
understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.”!” For
example, spokesmen for tech companies or university research groups often claim there
are no risks attached to their activities even if they privately think otherwise. Sinclair’s
observation may help explain not only reactions to risks from smoking and climate
change but also why some treat technology as a new religion whose central articles of
faith are that more technology is always better and whose heretics are clueless
scaremongering Luddites.

Second, humans have a long track record of wishful thinking, flawed
extrapolation of the past, and underestimation of emerging technologies. Darwinian
evolution endowed us with powerful fear of concrete threats, not of abstract threats from
future technologies that are hard to visualize or even imagine. Consider trying to warn
people in 1930 of a future nuclear arms race, when you couldn’t show them a single
nuclear explosion video and nobody even knew how to build such weapons. Even top
scientists can underestimate uncertainty, making forecasts that are either too optimistic—
Where are those fusion reactors and flying cars?—or too pessimistic. Ernest Rutherford,
arguably the greatest nuclear physicist of his time, said in 1933—less than twenty-four
hours before Leo Szilard conceived of the nuclear chain reaction—that nuclear energy
was “moonshine.” Essentially nobody at that time saw the nuclear arms race coming.

Third, psychologists have discovered that we tend to avoid thinking of disturbing
threats when we believe there’s nothing we can do about them anyway. In this case,
however, there are many constructive things we can do, if we can get ourselves to start
thinking about the issue.

What can we do?

I’m advocating a strategy change from “Let’s rush to build technology that makes us
obsolete—what could possibly go wrong?” to “Let’s envision an inspiring future and
steer toward it.”

To motivate the effort required for steering, this strategy begins by envisioning an
enticing destination. Although Hollywood’s futures tend to be dystopian, the fact is that
AGI can help life flourish as never before. Everything I love about civilization is the
product of intelligence, so if we can amplify our own intelligence with AGI, we have the
potential to solve today’s and tomorrow’s thorniest problems, including disease, climate
change, and poverty. The more detailed we can make our shared positive visions for the
future, the more motivated we will be to work together to realize them.

What should we do in terms of steering? The twenty-three Asilomar principles
adopted in 2017 offer plenty of guidance, including these short-term goals:

(1) An arms race in lethal autonomous weapons should be avoided.

(2) The economic prosperity created by AI should be shared broadly, to benefit all
of humanity.

my conscience now.’
Riddle of phone numbers for ‘friends’ he’d never met

Revealing an extraordinary network of power and influence, extending into the fields of politics, finance

and showbusiness, Jeffrey Epstein’s ‘little black book’ showed just how important a man he had become.

Yet when The Mail on Sunday contacted the people listed in the document, which was kept online, many

said they had never met or even spoken to the disgraced financier.

And they were appalled to discover he had their contact details, often including home and mobile

telephone numbers.

Lord Palumbo, the former Arts Council chairman and godfather to the Duke of York’s eldest daughter
Beatrice, said: ‘I have never, never, met him. I am shocked I am in there. I am affronted. I don’t know him
at all.’

Never heard of him: Both Toby Young (left) and Sir Richard Branson, were surprised to

find themselves listed in a contacts books owned by Jeffrey Epstein

Dame Gail Ronson, a charity fundraiser and wife of the multi-millionaire British developer Gerald
Ronson, said: ‘I’ve never, ever, met him. I swear, you’ve completely gobsmacked me. It’s really distressing,
horrible.

‘T lead a very private life so to find out you’re on this list, it’s very unsavoury.’
Her shock was echoed by the celebrity milliner Philip Treacy.
‘This sounds crazy, I’m amazed,’ he said.

‘Tm a hatmaker, I’ve never met Jeffrey Epstein and never had any reason to. I make hats. Does he look

like the kind of person who would wear a hat? Bizarre.’

The ‘book’ also had numbers for the JCB tycoon Sir Anthony Bamford, but a spokesman insisted: “There

doesn’t appear to be any connection. Sir Anthony doesn’t know Jeffrey Epstein.’

Frogs Eyes are Very Sensitive

The processing power of the eye is staggering. The human retina has
about 120 million rods and 7 million cones, giving it an average resolution
of 10,000 by 10,000 pixels. Each rod is sensitive to individual photons
but we register light consciously only if we see around 5-7 photons. It
is thought frogs can react to single photons because of the chemistry of
their eyes and the fact they are cold-blooded, but this is not proven.

Some animals, including some frogs and my cat, have a tapetum
lucidum. This is a reflective backing to the eye that allows each photon
two chances to react with a rod, once on the way in and, if that fails,
once on the way out. This is why you can see the eyes of some animals if
you shine a light into the forest on a dark night. Cones are less sensitive
than rods but give us color perception. In the human eye, there are three
types of cone: a red, a green and a blue, giving us trichromatic vision.
We see colors because light stimulates more than one types of cell and
we infer the color in between. A fourth type of cone is present in some
species such as birds, reptiles, and fish. This gives them tetra-chromic
vision, allowing them to see into the ultraviolet range. It is speculated
some humans might have this ability but so far none has come forward.
Some animals lack the ability to see certain colors. Most dogs can't see
red, This gives cats a big advantage!

Many people wonder if we all see the same color as each other. Is
your red the same as mine? The brain’s perception of color is complex.
Although the color red is absolute and can be detected by a calibrated
sensor, our perception of color is relative. We perceive them in the context

1. You’ve said that the women pressing suits against Mr. Epstein have lied repeatedly, and in
no way shape or form were they victims. They were at his place freely and voluntarily. And one
of them showed Epstein a fake ID. What do you have to say now that Mr. Epstein has
admitted in his federal plea bargain that he did conspire to entice minors to engage in
prostitution? Accepting that these women came voluntarily, isn’t Mr Epstein still guilty of
statutory rape?

2. Brad Edwards, an attorney who represents three of the women, recently served a
Subpoena to Testify at a Deposition on Epstein’s former girlfriend, Ghislaine
Maxwell. The Subpoena asks that Maxwell produce “a list of all girls” that visited
Jeffrey Epstein’s homes in Palm Beach and Manhattan, or flew on his

planes. Edwards said in an interview that Maxwell was “second-in-command of
Epstein’s criminal enterprise.” He added, “She was on Epstein's plane, transporting girls
for the purpose of having sex with other people. She kept a computer database of hundreds of
girls and oversaw the schedule of girls who came to Epstein's homes.”

3. A suit filed last May by “Jane Doe 102” against Epstein alleges that, after recruiting her as a 15-
year-old girl to give Epstein massages, Maxwell and Epstein took part in “sexually assaulting,
battering, exploiting, and abusing Plaintiff.”

4. The same suit alleges that Epstein “lured” the girl “every day for next two weeks” to his
house. The suit claims that she eventually became a “sex slave” to Epstein, traveling with him
around the world. “In all of these locations, she was required to engage in sex acts with him and
other women - including other minors.”

5. Did Jane Doe 102 — who now lives in Australia — go on the 2002 trip where
President Clinton flew on Mr. Epstein’s Boeing 727?
6. “Most of these acts of abuse occurred during a time when defendant [Jane Doe 102] knew

that the plaintiff was approximately 15, 16 and 17 years old and, after years of daily sexual
exploitation continued into her adulthood ... until she fled at age 19,

7. When Maxwell and Epstein celebrated Jane Doe 102’s 16th birthday with her, Epstein joked that
he would have to “trade her in” because she was getting too old for him.
8. Not only was Jane Doe 102 required to satisfy Epstein's every sexual whim, but she also was

exploited by Epstein's adult male peers. They included “royalty, politicians, academicians,
businessmen and others in various locations around the world.”

9. The Palm Beach Post and lawyers representing Epstein’s alleged victims have called his federal
non-prosecution agreement a “secret,” backroom, sweetheart” deal, noting that none of his
alleged victims was consulted. Several critics have claimed Epstein “bought” the agreement, using
politically-connected lawyers. Would he like to comment?

ISSUES AT STAKE

In December 2012, the Supreme Court an-
nounced that it would take up two cases re-
lated to same-sex couples: Windsor, which
arose out of an estate tax dispute between a
surviving partner/spouse and the IRS; and
Hollingsworth v. Perry (CA-9, Feb. 7, 2012),
which addressed whether the equal protec-
tion clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to
the Constitution prohibits California from
defining marriage as the union of a man and
woman. The Supreme Court heard oral ar-
guments in both cases in March 2013.

IRS Denies Estate Tax Marital Deduction.
In Windsor, a long-time same-sex couple
married in Canada in 2007. They had previ-
ously registered as domestic partners in New
York City, where they made their home. One
spouse died in 2009. Because of DOMA, the
survivor did not qualify for the unlimited
marital deduction under the Internal Revenue
Code and as a result, the executor of the estate
paid $363,000 in federal estate tax that was
not otherwise due. The survivor as executor
and sole beneficiary filed a refund claim under
Code Sec. 2056(a) (under which property of
a surviving spouse generally passes free of fed-
eral estate tax). The IRS determined that the
survivor was not a spouse under Section 3 of
DOMA and, therefore, not a surviving spouse
under Code Sec. 2056(a). A federal district
court found that Section 3 of DOMA violated
the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment because there was no rational
basis to support it. The Second Circuit Court
of Appeals affirmed the lower’s court decision,
finding that homosexuals are a protected class
and that Section 3 of DOMA was not sub-
stantially related to an important government
interest and violated Equal Protection.

SUPREME COURT'S
HOLDINGS

Writing for the majority in Windsor, Justice
Kennedy found that DOMA had departed

CCH Tax Briefing

from the long standing tradition and his-
tory of reliance on state law to define mar-
riage. The State of New York had recognized
the validity of same-sex marriages, which
resulted in a status that “is a far-reaching
legal acknowledgment of the intimate rela-
tionship between two people, a relationship
deemed by the State worthy of dignity in the
community equal with all other marriages,”
Kennedy wrote. He reasoned that DOMA
sought to injure this class of persons whom
New York sought to protect, and by doing so
violated basic due process and equal protec-
tion principles applicable to the federal gov-
ernment and was therefore unconstitutional.

“The decision opens the
door for same-sex couples
to enjoy many tax-related

benefits previously
available only to opposite-
sex couples.”

DOMA’s operation in practice, Kennedy
continued, was to treat same-sex marriages as
second-class marriages for purposes of federal
law “by imposing a system-wide enactment
with no identified connection to any particu-
lar area of federal law.” DOMAs principal
purpose was to impose inequality, not for
other reasons such as governmental efficien-
cy, Kennedy held. Therefore, the majority
found DOMA invalid for lack of a legitimate
government purpose that could overcome
the burden on those within the class whose
personhood and dignity New York had

sought to protect through its marriage laws.

COMMENT: The majority opinion
listed numerous ways in which DOMA
infringed upon the dignity of same-sex
couples. Among these is financial harm
caused by DOMA to children of same-sex
couples by raising the cost of health care
for families by taxing health benefits pro-
vided by employers to their workers’ same-
sex spouses. Another example, Kennedy
wrote, is that DOMA denies or reduces

benefits allowed to families upon the loss
of a spouse and parent, benefits that are
an integral part of family security.

COMMENT: Justice Kennedy qualified
the majoritys ruling at the end of the de-
cision, stating that its applicability was
“confined to those lawful marriages,”
meaning those recognized by the states
that currently allow same-sex marriag-
es. Kennedy observed that Section 2 of
DOMA, which allows States to refuse to
recognize same-sex marriages performed
under the laws of other States, had not
been challenged in Windsor and contin-
ues to be the law. On June 26, House
Democrats introduced legislation to re-

peal Section 2 of DOMA.

California’s Proposition 8. On the same day
the Supreme Court announced its decision in
Windsor, the Justices ruled, 5-4 (but with a dif
ferent mix of Justices for and against), to send
Hollingsworth back to the California courts
rather than to directly decide on the constitu-
tionality of Californias ban on same-sex mar-
riage. There, the Supreme Court held that the
petitioners did not have the standing to chal-
lenge the lower court’s decision throwing out
Proposition 8, which denied same-sex couples
the right to marry in California. This decision
paves the way for same-sex marriage to begin
again in California sometime in late July.

FEDERAL TAX
CONSEQUENCES

Under federal income tax rules, same-sex
married couples can now presumably enjoy
benefits that had been unavailable to them
because of DOMA. On the other hand, cer-
tain strategic advantages previously enjoyed
by same-sex married couples who filed as
single individuals under the federal tax laws,
have now likewise ended.

COMMENT. Aside from the fact that it
was a federal tax refund claim in Wind-
sor that triggered the litigation that found
itself before the U.S. Supreme Court, the
opinion focused on Constitutional rights
and privileges, without any technical

Fortunately, it is possible to condition yourself to discomfort and overcome it. ve trained myself to
propose solutions instead of ask for them, to elicit desired responses instead of react, and to be assertive
without burning bridges. To have an uncommon lifestyle, you need to develop the uncommon habit of
making decisions, both for yourself and for others.

From this chapter forward, I'll take you through progressively more uncomfortable exercises, simple
and small. Some of the exercises will appear deceptively easy and even irrelevant (such as the next) until
you try them. Look at it as a game and expect some butterflies and sweat—that’s the whole point. For
most of these exercises, the duration is two days. Mark the exercise of the day on your calendar so you
don’t forget, and don’t attempt more than one Comfort Challenge at a time.

Remember: There is a direct correlation between an increased sphere of comfort and getting what you
want.

Here we go.

Learn to Eye Gaze (2 days)

My friend Michael Ellsberg invented a singles event called Eye Gazing. It is similar to speed dating but
different in one fundamental respect—no speaking is permitted. It involves gazing into the eyes of each
partner for three minutes at a time. If you go to such an event, it becomes clear how uncomfortable most
people are doing this. For the next two days, practice gazing into the eyes of others—whether people you
pass on the street or conversational partners—until they break contact. Hints:

1. Focus on one eye and be sure to blink occasionally so you don’t look like a psychopath or get your
ass kicked.

2. In conversation, maintain eye contact when you are speaking. It’s easy to do while listening.

3. Practice with people bigger or more confident than yourself. If a passerby asks you what the hell
you’re staring at, just smile and respond, “Sorry about that. I thought you were an old friend of
mine.”

Step IT:
E is for Elimination

One does not accumulate but eliminate .
It is not daily increase but daily
decrease. The height of cultivation
always runs to simplicity .

The Rise of the NSA

There are many things we do in intelligence that, if revealed,
would have the potential for all kinds of blowback.

—JAMES CLAPPER, director of national intelligence, 2013

[ THE GAME OF NATIONS, which often is not visible to public
scrutiny, the great prize is state secrets that reveal the hidden
weaknesses of a nation’s potential adversaries. The most impor-
tant of these in peacetime is communication intercepts. It was just
such state secrets that Edward Snowden took from the NSA in the
spring of 2013. Before that breach, America’s paramount advantage
in this subterranean competition was its undisputed dominance in
the business of obtaining and deciphering the communications of
other nations. The NSA was the instrument by which the United
States both protected its own secret communications and stole the
secrets of foreign nations. The NSA, however, has an Achilles’s heel:
It is dependent on civilian computer technicians who do not neces-
sarily share its values to operate its complex system. Because of this
dependence, it was not able in 2013, as it turned out, to protect its
crucial sources and methods.

Snowden exposed this vulnerability when he walked away with
the aforementioned descriptions of the gaps in America’s coverage

instead of eight, and spend the rest of the time reading kung-fu magazines and practicing karate kicks
outside. I am fired in a record three days, left with the parting comment, “Maybe someday you'll
understand the value of hard work.” It seems I still don’t.

1993 I volunteer for a one-year exchange program in Japan, where people work themselves to death—
a phenomenon called karooshi—and are said to want to be Shinto when born, Christian when married,
and Buddhist when they die. I conclude that most people are really confused about life. One evening,
intending to ask my host mother to wake me the next morning (okosu), I ask her to violently rape me
(okasu). She is very confused.

1996 I manage to slip undetected into Princeton, despite SAT scores 40% lower than the average and
my high school admissions counselor telling me to be more “realistic.” I conclude ’m just not good at
reality. I major in neuroscience and then switch to East Asian studies to avoid putting printer jacks on cat
heads.

1997 Millionaire time! I create an audiobook called How I Beat the Ivy League, use all my money
from three summer jobs to manufacture 500 tapes, and proceed to sell exactly none. I will allow my
mother to throw them out only in 2006, just nine years of denial later. Such is the joy of baseless
overconfidence.

1998 After four shot-putters kick a friend’s head in, I quit bouncing, the highest-paying job on
campus, and develop a speed-reading seminar. I plaster campus with hundreds of god-awful neon green
flyers that read, “triple your reading speed in 3 hours!” and prototypical Princeton students proceed to
write “bullsh*t” on every single one. I sell 32 spots at $50 each for the 3-hour event, and $533 per hour
convinces me that finding a market before designing a product is smarter than the reverse. Two months
later, I’m bored to tears of speed-reading and close up shop. I hate services and need a product to ship.

Fall 1998 A huge thesis dispute and the acute fear of becoming an investment banker drive me to
commit academic suicide and inform the registrar that I am quitting school until further notice. My dad is
convinced that ll never go back, and I’m convinced that my life is over. My mom thinks it’s no big deal
and that there is no need to be a drama queen.

Spring 1999 In three months, I accept and quit jobs as a curriculum designer at Berlitz, the world’s
largest publisher of foreign-language materials, and as an analyst at a three-person political asylum
research firm. Naturally, I then fly to Taiwan to create a gym chain out of thin air and get shut down by
Triads, Chinese mafia. I return to the U.S. defeated and decide to learn kickboxing, winning the national
championship four weeks later with the ugliest and most unorthodox style ever witnessed.

Fall 2000 Confidence restored and thesis completely undone, I return to Princeton. My life does not
end, and it seems the yearlong delay has worked out in my favor. Twenty-somethings now have David
Koresh-—like abilities. My friend sells a company for $450 million, and I decide to head west to sunny
California to make my billions. Despite the hottest job market in the history of the world, I manage to go
jobless until three months after graduation, when I pull out my trump card and send one start-up CEO 32
consecutive e-mails. He finally gives in and puts me in sales.

Spring 2001 TrueSAN Networks has gone from a 15-person nobody to the “number one privately
held data storage company” (how is that measured?) with 150 employees (what are they all doing?). I am
ordered by a newly appointed sales director to “start with A” in the phone book and dial for dollars. I ask
him in the most tactful way possible why we are doing it like retards. He says, “Because I say so.” Nota
good start.

Fall 2001 After a year of 12-hour days, I find out that I’m the second-lowest-paid person in the
company aside from the receptionist. I resort to aggressively surfing the web full-time. One afternoon,
having run out of obscene video clips to forward, I investigate how hard it would be to start a sports
nutrition company. Turns out that you can outsource everything from manufacturing to ad design. Two
weeks and $5,000 of credit card debt later, I have my first batch in production and a live website. Good

REPEAL AND REPLACE

few days after the election, Steve Bannon told the president-elect—in what Katie

Walsh would characterize with a raised eyebrow as more “Breitbart shenanigans”—
that they had the votes to replace Paul Ryan as Speaker of the House with Mark Meadows,
the head of the Tea Party-inspired Freedom Caucus and an early Trump supporter.
(Meadows’s wife had a particular place of regard in the Trump camp for continuing a
campaign swing across the Bible Belt over Billy Bush weekend.)

Nearly as much as winning the presidency itself, removing Ryan—indeed, humiliating
him—was an ultimate expression of what Bannon sought to accomplish and of the mind-
meld of Bannonism and Trumpism. From the beginning, the Breitbart campaign against
Paul Ryan was a central part of its campaign for Donald Trump. Its embrace of Trump,
and Bannon’s personal enlistment in the campaign fourteen months after it began, was in
part because Trump, throwing political sense to the wind, was willing to lead the charge
against Ryan and the GOP godfathers. Still, there was a difference between the way
Breitbart viewed Ryan and the way Trump viewed him.

For Breitbart, the House rebellion and transformation that had driven the former
Speaker, John Boehner, from office, and which, plausibly, was set to remake the House
into the center of the new radical Republicanism had been halted by Ryan’s election as
Speaker. Mitt Romney’s running mate, and a figure who had merged a conservative fiscal
wonkishness—he had been the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and,
as well, chairman of the House Budget Committee—with an old-fashioned idea of
unassailable Republican rectitude, Ryan was the official last, best hope of the Republican
Party. (Bannon, typically, had turned this trope into an official Trumpist talking point:
“Ryan was created in a petri dish at the Heritage Foundation.”’) If the Republican Party
had been moved further right by the Tea Party rebellion, Ryan was part of the ballast that
would prevent it from moving further, or at least at a vastly slower pace. In this he
represented an adult, older-brother steadiness in contrast to the Tea Party’s ADD-hyper
immaturity—and a stoic, almost martyrlike resistance to the Trump movement.

Where the Republican establishment had promoted Ryan into this figure of not only

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011501.txt,"“No reason to be afraid,” our metapelet kept telling me. That only made me
more scared. Yet within a few hours, everything was quiet again, and never
again did the shellfire get near to us. A few weeks later, I heard the only gunfire
inside the kibbutz itself. It came from the top of our water tower. The man on
guard duty thought he saw movement on the road outside. But it turned out to
be nothing.

It wasn’t until well into 1949 that formal agreements were signed and
“armistice line” borders drawn with the Arab states. By the measure that
mattered most — survival — Israel had won and the Arab attackers had lost.
Jordan did end up in control of the West Bank, as well as the eastern half of a
divided city of Jerusalem, including the walled Old City and the site of the
ancient Jewish temple. The new Israel remained, at least geographically,
vulnerable. It was just 11 miles wide around Tel Aviv and even narrower,
barely half that, near Mishmar Hasharon. Egyptian-held Gaza was seven miles
from the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon and just 40 from the outskirts of Tel
AVIV.

Israel did secure control of the entire Galilee, up to the pre-war borders with
Lebanon and Syria, and of the Negev Desert in the south. The territory of our
new state was about a third larger than the area proposed under the UN partition
plan rejected by the Arabs. Yet the victory came at a heavy price: more than
6,000 dead, one per cent of the Jewish population of Palestine at the time. It was
as if America had lost two million in the Vietnam War. One-third of the Israeli
dead were Holocaust survivors.

The Arabs paid a heavy price too, and not just the roughly 7,000 people who
lost their lives. Nearly 700,000 Palestinian Arabs had fled — or, in some cases,
been forced to flee — towns and villages in what was now Israel. The full extent
and circumstances of the Arabs’ flight became known to us at Mishmar
Hasharon only later. But it did not take long to notice the change around us.
Wadi Khawaret was physically still there, but all of the villagers were gone. As
far as I could discover, none had been killed. They left with a first wave of
refugees in April 1948, and eventually ended up near Tulkarem on the West
Bank. After the war, the Israeli government divided up their farmland among
nearby kibbutzim including Mishmar Hasharon.

The absence of our former neighbors in Wadi Khawaret seemed to me at the
time simply a part of the war. From the moment the violence started, I
understood there would be suffering on both sides. When we sent our care
packages to Giora Ros in Jerusalem, I remember trying to imagine what “living

on the verge of producing a nuclear weapon or acquiring the
“breakout capacity” to make one, but never, despite the dire warning
of Israeli leaders dating back to the 1990s, doing either, preferring to
dwell in the Islamic Republic’s favored zones: ambivalence and
inertia. As one awaits this tortuous Godot, one might recall a forecast
of a bomb by 1999 (Shimon Peres) or 2004 (Ehud Barak), or Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s talk of “a messianic apocalyptic cult
controlling atomic bombs,” or my friend Jeffrey Goldberg’s allusion
in The Atlantic last year to a “consensus” that there is “a better than
50 percent chance that Israel will launch a strike by next July.” That
would be next month.

It might also be worth recalling that Meir Dagan, the former head of
Israel’s Mossad spy agency, declared last month that attacking Iran
would be “a stupid idea.” He suggested his main worry was not Iran
itself but Netanyahu’s susceptibility to “dangerous adventure.”
Dagan’s concerns have surfaced as Seymour Hersh concludes in a
New Yorker article this month that, as he put it in one interview,
“There’s just no serious evidence inside that Iran is actually doing
anything to make a nuclear weapon.”

His reporting reveals that the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate
(N.I.E.) of 2007 — which concluded “with high confidence” that Iran
had halted a nuclear-weapons program in 2003 — still pertains in the
classified N.I.E. of 2011. As a retired senior intelligence official put
it to Hersh, there’s nothing “substantially new” that “leads to a
bomb.”

In other words, Iran, epicenter of inefficiency, unable to produce a
kilowatt of electricity through its Bushehr nuclear reactor despite
decades of effort, is still doing its old brinkmanship number.
Remember, Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, is the guardian of the
revolution. That is a conservative business. Breakout, let alone a
bomb, is a bridge too far if the Islamic Republic is what you’ve

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016841.txt,"In analog computing, complexity resides in network topology, not in code.
Information is processed as continuous functions of values such as voltage and relative
pulse frequency rather than by logical operations on discrete strings of bits. Digital
computing, intolerant of error or ambiguity, depends upon error correction at every step
along the way. Analog computing tolerates errors, allowing you to live with them.

Nature uses digital coding for the storage, replication, and recombination of
sequences of nucleotides, but relies on analog computing, running on nervous systems,
for intelligence and control. The genetic system in every living cell is a stored-program
computer. Brains aren’t.

Digital computers execute transformations between two species of bits: bits
representing differences in space and bits representing differences in time. The
transformations between these two forms of information, sequence and structure, are
governed by the computer’s programming, and as long as computers require human
programmers, we retain control.

Analog computers also mediate transformations between two forms of
information: structure in space and behavior in time. There is no code and no
programming. Somehow—and we don’t fully understand how—Nature evolved analog
computers known as nervous systems, which embody information absorbed from the
world. They learn. One of the things they learn is control. They learn to control their
own behavior, and they learn to control their environment to the extent that they can.

Computer science has a long history—going back to before there even was
computer science—of implementing neural networks, but for the most part these have
been simulations of neural networks by digital computers, not neural networks as evolved
in the wild by Nature herself. This is starting to change: from the bottom up, as the
threefold drivers of drone warfare, autonomous vehicles, and cell phones push the
development of neuromorphic microprocessors that implement actual neural networks,
rather than simulations of neural networks, directly in silicon (and other potential
substrates); and from the top down, as our largest and most successful enterprises
increasingly turn to analog computation in their infiltration and control of the world.

While we argue about the intelligence of digital computers, analog computing 1s
quietly supervening upon the digital, in the same way that analog components like
vacuum tubes were repurposed to build digital computers in the aftermath of World War
II. Individually deterministic finite-state processors, running finite codes, are forming
large-scale, nondeterministic, non-finite-state metazoan organisms running wild in the
real world. The resulting hybrid analog/digital systems treat streams of bits collectively,
the way the flow of electrons is treated in a vacuum tube, rather than individually, as bits
are treated by the discrete-state devices generating the flow. Bits are the new electrons.
Analog is back, and its nature is to assume control.

Governing everything from the flow of goods to the flow of traffic to the flow of
ideas, these systems operate statistically, as pulse-frequency coded information is
processed in a neuron or a brain. The emergence of intelligence gets the attention of
Homo sapiens, but what we should be worried about is the emergence of control.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026844.txt,"no contradiction. Indeed, China is now experiencing its own cultural
renaissance, fueled by its new affluence.

The duality of the Chinese story is reflected in the West's schizophrenic
response to it. The Nixon administration eagerly sought better relations with
China under Mao, and when Deng Xiaoping doubled down by opening up
the country, the West applauded the change. The United States generously
accepted Chinese products into its markets, allowed massive trade
surpluses, welcomed China into the World Trade Organization in 2001, and
kept global sea-lanes open so that China could trade freely. All of this
enabled China to emerge as the world's number one trading power by 2013.
The United States also generously allowed more than a million Chinese
students to study in its universities.

Yet the rise of China has also led to deep fears. China continues to be run by
a communist party that has no desire to embrace liberal democracy. China
has displayed a belligerent side in some of its dealings with Japan and some
members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations over territorial
disputes in the East China and South China Seas. The possibility of an
aggressive, militaristic China cannot be ruled out.

But we have come a vast distance since the days when Mao openly talked
about the possibility of winning a nuclear war, and Chinese history suggests
that Beijing will ultimately prefer to join, rather than replace or reject, the
current rules-based order that the West has created. As the world's number
one trading power, China has the most to lose from a breakdown of the
global economic system. Historically, moreover, what the Chinese have
feared most is luan (chaos). This might lead to heavy-handed efforts to
preserve order domestically, but it should lead Beijing to support a rules-
based order at the global level as well. Undoubtedly, as China grows more
powerful, it will become more assertive. This has happened. But since China
needs a few more decades of peace to complete its modernization, it has
strong reasons to restrain itself militarily and avoid a conflict.

Chinese society will never become a replica of Western society. China's own
culture is too rich to be absorbed into any other cultural universe. Yet a
modernizing China will feature overlapping aspirations in many areas, as,
for example, with the rapid spread of Western classical music. In 2008, 36
million Chinese children were studying the piano (six times the number of
U.S. children doing so), and another 50 million were studying the violin.
Some Chinese cities can fill the halls of 15 opera houses in one evening.

A modern China with thriving Western classical orchestras and Western-
style universities provides a powerful demonstration of the fusion of
civilizations. Western statesmen should allow this dynamic to gain
momentum while remaining patient on other areas of change, such as in the
political realm. China's development will not necessarily be linear, but in the
long run, it should continue in a positive direction.

coordinated murder ops:

sources and methods - money and other pleasureful compensations given to those willing to
participate in and/or coordinate violence against me and my loved ones to include children leading
only to now their enabled targeting and the absorbing of whatever may be their networks - well, you
see below (and this only the very tip of the iceberg) how many people they've been able to engulf
and what advances have been made by the quite elaborate criminal class employing these tactics;
and one also begins to better understand the events surrounding Justice Scalia's passing and what's
to come for the 35 guests in Scalia's private party. As for Scalia’s passing, it was decidedly
suspicious as noted by William Ritchie: (The Washington Post prints) “As a former homicide
commander, | am stunned that no autopsy was ordered for Justice Scalia,” William O. Ritchie, former
head of criminal investigations for D.C. police, wrote in a post on Facebook on Sunday... Ritchie also
raised questions about the marshals’ actions: “How can the Marshal say, without a thorough post
mortem, that he was not injected with an illegal substance that would simulate a heart attack... Did
the US Marshal check for petechial hemorrhage in his eyes or under his lips that would have
suggested suffocation? Did the US Marshal smell his breath for any unusual odor that might suggest
poisoning? My gut tells me there is something fishy going on in Texas.”

As for SAIC, the following also pertains:

(| write) If you first see SAIC as what's called a systems integrator (author Tim Shorrock's phrase),
and also the formerly married Bud and Sue Horton and their two grown sons Matthew Horton and
Ben Lanier as aids of an implementation, you can better see the bigger picture:

(1) Sue Horton left IBM in early 2007-ish for an executive position at Tetra Tech which soon entered
into joint venture with SAIC (Sue's employer prior to IBM, btw) on an enormous (billion dollar) 2011
Hillary Clinton State Department award (http://Awww.prnewswire.com/.../saic-tetra-tech-joint-venture-
a...);

(2) that Bud Horton left IBM in early 2009-ish for an executive position at Accenture which soon
thereafter entered into joint venture with SAIC spin-off Leidos, and Cerner, on an enormous (billion
dollar) 2015 DoD award (http://www.healthcareitnews.com/.../dod-names-ehr-contract-wi...);

(3) that the Sue Horton contract was used to grow and fortify the Afghan heroin trade (as well as
corrupt law enforcement) although the stated intention was of course the opposite... ([SAIC and
Tetra Tech's] joint venture, Integrated Justice Systems International, LLC (lJSI), has been awarded a
contract to provide worldwide civilian police and criminal justice assistance to the U.S. Department of
State's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL)... [specifically} to
provide INL with program management, criminal justice, and life and mission support to countries
emerging from conflict or otherwise facing instability challenges. Under this new contract, IJSI will
provide technical assistance, training, logistics and infrastructure services to support the Department
of State's efforts to strengthen criminal justice systems in select partner countries.)... yet, just

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016855.txt,"inadequate for describing the mechanisms underlying biological systems, and so he
missed out on how similar mechanisms might eventually be embodied in technological
computational systems—as now they have been. Today’s dominant technologies were
developed in the world of Turing and von Neumann, rather than the world of Wiener.

In the first industrial revolution, energy from a steam engine or a water wheel was
used by human workers to replace their own energy. Instead of being a source of energy
for physical work, people became modulators of how a large source of energy was used.
But because steam engines and water wheels had to be large to be an efficient use of
capital, and because in the 18th century the only technology for spatial distribution of
energy was mechanical and worked only at very short range, many workers needed to be
crowded around the source of energy. Wiener correctly argues that the ability to transmit
energy as electricity caused a second industrial revolution. Now the source of energy
could be distant from where it was used, and from the beginning of the 20th century,
manufacturing could be much more dispersed as electrical-distribution grids were built.

Wiener then argues that a further new technology, that of the nascent
computational machines of his time, will provide yet another revolution. The machines
he talks about seem to be both analog and (perhaps) digital in nature; and he points out, in
The Human Use of Human Beings, that since they will be able to make decisions, both
blue-collar and white-collar workers may be reduced to being mere cogs in a much bigger
machine. He fears that humans might use and abuse one another through organizational
structures that this capability will encourage. We have certainly seen this play out in the
last sixty years, and that disruption 1s far from over.

However, his physics-based view of computation protected him from realizing
just how bad things might get. He saw machines’ ability to communicate as providing a
new and more inhuman way of exerting command and control. He missed that within a
few decades computation systems would become more like biological systems, and it
seems, from his descriptions in chapter 10 of his own work on modeling some aspects of
biology, that he woefully underappreciated the many orders of magnitude of further
complexity of biology over physics. We are in a much more complex situation today
than he foresaw, and I am worried that it is much more pernicious than even his worst
imagined fears.

In the 1960s, computation became firmly based on the foundations set out by
Turing and von Neumann, and it was digital computation, based on the idea of finite
alphabets which they both used. An arbitrarily long sequence, or string, formed by
characters from a finite alphabet, can be encoded as a unique integer. As with Turing
Machines themselves, the formalism for computation became that of computing an
integer-valued function of a single integer-valued input.

Turing and von Neumann both died in the 1950s and at that time this is how they
saw computation. Neither foresaw the exponential increase in computing capability that
Moore’s Law would bring—nor how pervasive computing machinery would become.
Nor did they foresee two developments in our modeling of computation, each of which
poses a great threat to human society.

The first is rooted in the abstractions they adopted. In the fifty-year, Moore’s
Law-fueled race to produce software that could exploit the doubling of computer
capability every two years, the typical care and certification of engineering disciplines
was thrown by the wayside. Software engineering was fast and prone to failures. This

fashionable, is wearing a T-shirt that says “Yes, | Am a Model.” There, a

something that I was naturally good at.

Still, the closest thing to real military activity remained my excurions with
Ido and Moshe. Our ammunition trunks were stowed under our beds. But the
final piece of our arsenal fell into place in May 1958. For the tenth anniversary
of Israel, there was a national exhibition celebrating the achievements of the
state. I paid a first visit on my own. I was curious to see what was on show. But
as I walked through, I couldn’t help noticing the lack of security. Two days
later, I returned with Ido and Moshe. There was a stand devoted to the Israeli
military industry. We already had a supply of ammunition for an Uzi
submachine gun, courtesy of our raid on the Alexandroni Brigade. Now, when
the guy in charge of the stand was chatting with other visitors, we came away
with an Uzi.

It was then the trouble began. Along with Ido, Moshe and the other older
boys, I now lived in a larger dormitory under the cursory gaze of an older
metapelet. She was doing routine cleaning when she decided to dust around the
boxes under our beds. She’d never given them much thought. But when she
tried to move one of them, she was amazed by its weight. She got one her sons-
in-law to help. I think the box he pried open first was Moshe’s. But within a few
minutes he’d opened Ido’s and mine as well. Inside each were hundreds of
bullets and the machine-gun belts. Inside mine was our prized Uzi. It would not
exactly have taken the KGB to work out the rest. The kibbutz leaders ordered an
inquiry. Ido was summoned first, and attempted a brief show of defiance.
“What’s the big deal,” he asked. “It’s just stuff we collected. Why should you
care?” But separately questioning Moshe, then Ido again, the inquisitors worked
out every detail. The fact that the ammunition had come from the Alexandroni
Brigade, the reservists sent to defend us, was bad enough. But the Uzi had been
stolen from the National Exhibition. That was even worse. It was left to the core
of young men in their late 20s and 30s to figure out how to punish us. Everyone
agreed we could not be reported to the police. That would risk a scandal for the
kibbutz. They decided to beat some sense into the offenders, in front of all the
rest of the teenagers in the dormitory.

I wasn’t there. One afternoon each week, I now boarded a bus into Tel Aviv
for my piano lesson. But when I returned after sundown, I sensed immediately
something was wrong. Yigal was waiting at the bus stop outside the kibbutz. He
told me that what I had done was terrible. Not just because it involved weapons,
but because it was a breach of trust. Did you really steal ammunition from the

to cooperate with secular parties and show respect for pluralism. Instead, it
is sending muddled messages. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Hamadi

cabinet and new elections. Unfortunately, hard-line party members quickly

Tunisia’s revolution, which has overcome past crises, can overcome this

The Washington Post

Iraq’s return to bloodshed

Kimberly Kagan and Frederick W. Kagan

February 8, 2013 -- Eighteen days of protests in Egypt in 2011 electrified
the world. But more than twice that many days of protest in Irag have
gone almost unnoticed in the United States. Iraqi army troops killed five
Sunni protesters in Fallujah on Jan. 25, after a month of anti-government
protests in Anbar, Nineveh and Salahuddin provinces and elsewhere for
which thousands turned out. Al-Qaeda in Iraq and Iranian-backed Shiite
militias are re-mobilizing. Iraq teeters on the brink of renewed insurgency
and, potentially, civil war.

This crisis matters for America. U.S. vital interests that have been
undermined over the past year include preventing Iraq from becoming a
haven for al-Qaeda and destabilizing the region by becoming a security
vacuum or a dictatorship that inflames sectarian civil war; containing
Iranian influence in the region; and ensuring the free flow of oil to the
global market.

While tensions have risen over the past two years, the triggers for recent
eruptions are clear. Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, a Shiite, had the

communications intelligence allowed the CIA (and other U.S. intelli-
gence services) to test and verify the reports of their human sources
in foreign countries. Moreover, because of the immense amount of
foreign data that the NSA vacuumed in through its global sensors,
it provided the CIA with an effective means for discovering new
targets in adversary nations.

By the first decade of this century, the NSA’s surreptitious efforts
to render the Internet transparent to U.S. intelligence had earned it
a new set of enemies. They were the previously mentioned hacktiv-
ists who were attempting to shield the activities of Internet users
from the intrusions of government surveillance. They employed
both encryption and Tor software to defeat that surveillance. But the
NSA did not conceal that it was intent on countering any attempt to
interfere with its surveillance of the Internet. It built back doors into
encryption and worked to unravel the Tor scrambling of IP addresses.
It made leading hacktivists targets. Brian Hale, the spokesman for
the director of national intelligence, disclosed that the United States
routinely intercepted the cyber signatures of parties suspected of

© hacking into U.S. government networks. ®

Following the 9/11 attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade
Center, the surveillance of the Internet became an integral part of
the Bush administration’s war on terrorism. In October 2001, Con-
gress expanded the NSA’s mandate by passing the USA Patriot Act.
As I described earlier, Section 215 of the act directly authorized
the NSA, with the approval of the FISA court, to collect and store
domestic telephone billing records. The idea was to better coordinate
domestic and foreign intelligence about al-Qaeda and other jihad-
ist groups. This put the NSA directly in the anti-terrorist business.
It also necessitated the NSA vastly increasing its coverage of the
Internet.

The mantra in government in this post-9/11 intelligence world
became “connect the dots.” Congress through this act essentially
demolished the wall between domestic and foreign intelligence
when any NSA activity related to foreign-directed terrorism. It fur-
ther made the NSA a partner with the FBI in tracking phone calls

L, lifestyle design for you? Chances are good that it is. Here are some of the most common doubts

and fears that people have before taking the leap and joining the New Rich:
Do I have to quit or hate my job? Do I have to be a risk-taker?

No on all three counts. From using Jedi mind tricks to disappear from the office to designing
businesses that finance your lifestyle, there are paths for every comfort level. How does a Fortune 500
employee explore the hidden jewels of China for a month and use technology to cover his tracks’? How
do you create a hands-off business that generates $80K per month with no management? It’s all here.

Do I have to be a single twenty-something?

Not at all. This book is for anyone who is sick of the deferred-life plan and wants to live life large
instead of postpone it. Case studies range from a Lamborghini-driving 21-year-old to a single mother
who traveled the world for five months with her two children. If you’re sick of the standard menu of
options and prepared to enter a world of infinite options, this book is for you.

Do I have to travel? I just want more time.

No. It’s just one option. The objective is to create freedom of time and place and use both however
you want.

Do I need to be born rich?

No. My parents have never made more than $50,000 per year combined, and I’ve worked since age 14.
I’m no Rockefeller and you needn’t be either.

Do I need to be an Ivy League graduate?

Nope. Most of the role models in this book didn’t go to the Harvards of the world, and some are
dropouts. Top academic institutions are wonderful, but there are unrecognized benefits to not coming out
of one. Grads from top schools are funneled into high-income 80-hour-per-week jobs, and 15-30 years
of soul-crushing work has been accepted as the default path. How do I know? I’ve been there and seen
the destruction. This book reverses it.

Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.

creative, and diabolical the moves turned out to be, but you shouldn’t be surprised that
your enemies would try to hurt you. This was check, but far from checkmate, and you had
to continue to play the game, knowing that it would be a very long one. The only way to
win the game, Bannon argued, was with a disciplined strategy.

But the president, prodded here by his family, was an obsessive and not a strategist. In
his mind, this was not a problem to address, this was a person to focus on: Comey. Trump
eschewed abstractions and, ad hominem, zeroed in on his opponent. Comey had been a
difficult puzzle for Trump: Comey had declined to have the FBI pursue charges against
Clinton for her email dodge. Then, in October, Comey had single-handedly boosted
Trump’s fortunes with the letter reopening the Clinton email investigation.

In their personal interactions, Trump had found Comey to be a stiff—he had no banter,
no game. But Trump, who invariably thought people found him irresistible, believed that
Comey admired his banter and game. When pressed, by Bannon and others, to fire Comey
as one of his early acts—an idea opposed by Kushner, and thus another bullet on Bannon’s
list of bad recommendations by Kushner—the president said, “Don’t worry, I’ve got him.”
That is, he had no doubt that he could woo and flatter the FBI director into positive feeling
for him, if not outright submission.

Some seducers are preternaturally sensitive to the signals of those they try to seduce;
others indiscriminately attempt to seduce, and, by the law of averages, often succeed (this
latter group of men might now be regarded as harassers). That was Trump’s approach to
women—pleased when he scored, unconcerned when he didn’t (and, often, despite the
evidence, believing that he had). And so it was with Director Comey.

In their several meetings since he took office—when Comey received a presidential
hug on January 22; at their dinner on January 27, during which Comey was asked to stay
on as FBI director; at their Valentine’s Day chat after emptying the office of everybody
else, including Sessions, Comey’s titular boss—Trump was confident that he had laid on
the moves. The president was all but certain that Comey, understanding that he, Trump,
had his back (1.e., had let him keep his job), would have Trump’s back, too.

But now this testimony. It made no sense. What did make sense to Trump was that
Comey wanted it to be about him. He was a media whore—this Trump understood. All
right, then, he, too, could play it this way.

Indeed, health care, a no-fun issue—suddenly becoming much less fun, if, as seemed
increasingly possible, Ryan couldn’t deliver—palled before the clarity of Comey, and the
fury, enmity, and bitterness Trump, and Trump’s relatives, now bore him.

Comey was the larger-than-life problem. Taking Comey down was the obvious
solution. Getting Comey became the mission.

In Keystone Cops fashion, the White House enlisted House Intelligence Committee

| thought there was a connection between Tarek and myself, | do believe one concern was operation of Boeing with
flight crew. | Know its his problem not ours, but may help make the sale happen,,.

| wrote this email for your review, if you think its worth sending, please critique, and let me know,. thank you:

Mr. Tarek El Sayed,
| hope this email finds you well, and believe worth communicating my thoughts to you.

| was surprised to hear that you decided against the purchase of our Super Boeing 727. | personally thought it was a great match for
your business needs in Qatar. If for any reason your decision was based on crew issues and charter needs in the Middle East, I'd like
to share some information that might prove beneficial to making you reconsider this purchase.

The pilot candidates | have lined up for your interview along with the possibility of David Rodgers joining your flight department
were as follows:

(at no time did | disclose location or persons to the following pilot candidates to protect your privacy.)

Robert Breslin, who is the former Chief Pilot of Mr. Donald Trump, Mr. Breslin flew the Boeing 727 and Boeing 757 owned by Mr
Trump. Mr Breslin is a fine man of 40 years of age estimate, with extensive VIP Boeing operations.

James Bartakowski, who has extensive flying experience in the Middle east, Africa and Europe régime. Mr. Bartakowski has also
been involved in charter operations in Africa and Middle East and has contacted me on several recent occasions with charters for
our Boeing 727, James has indicated there is the possibility of 40 - 60 hours per month charter operations for larger transport
category aircraft in your area. | believe there is a growing need for charter in the business community in Qatar and neighboring
countries.

Bruce Jafahri, who is a current Boeing 727 captain who lived in Doha for two years, and familiar with international operations of
Boeing 727 aircraft. Mr. Jafahri currently lives in California and ready for a new opportunity. Bruce is current in the Boeing 727 and
also flew Captain on the Boeing 747. Well qualified individual and personable.

Mr. El Sayed, as you have seen during our demo flight, our Boeing 727 is in impeccable condition, quite cabin and will provide many
years of charter and business flights your company. | believe the large business jet future in Qatar is growing and you will be leading
its path, and your initial investment in this purchase will not come close with other aircraft options on the market as you may have
seen already.

We are currently completing the C2C check on the Boeing, and as we have done in the past, assure you it will be a fine aircraft
when it leaves Flight Star Maintenance repair facility.

Sincerely,

Lawrance Visoski

Chief Pilot, JEGE Inc.

Tonja--
The National ENQUIRER is preparing to publish a story that Bill Clinton used a private orgy jet to travel to 
Brunei for an extraordinary dinner with a royal accused of duping American women into white slavery. 
The ENQUIRER will report that Bill was accompanied by the 727's owner, billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, 
when he landed in the tiny South-East Asian country on May 25, 2002. His entourage also included two 
women who allegedly worked as madams for Epstein, luring teenaged girls into sex trysts with the tycoon 
and his powerful and famous friends. 
According to The ENQUIRER's investigation, Bill spent the day playing golf at a seven-star hotel -- and then was 
invited to dine with Brunei's sultan, Hassanal Bolkiah .....who was charged with holding a deeply-religious 
Christian beauty queen as a human chattel. Far from being embarrassed by the ruler's tawdry 
reputation, moreover, records for Bill's nonprofit foundation reveal that Brunei made a donation towards his 
Clinton Presidential Library that year of between $1. million and $5 million.

battalion commander was asking us for permission to open fire.

“Do not open fire,” I was saying as Yanoush arrived. “I repeat: do not open
fire.” When Yanoush asked me what was going on, I told him the lead unit had
reported unknown vehicles with missiles and wanted to know whether it could
attack. “Tell them yes,” Yanoush said. I looked first at him, then at Mitzna. “We
can’t,” I said. “It’s dark. The situation is confused. We don’t know whose
missiles these are. It doesn’t make sense they’d be Syrian, just sitting there,
pointed north. At least give it a few minutes.” I think Yanoush would have
grabbed the microphone and told the unit to fire had not Amram been there as
well. Together, we convinced him to hold off. I ordered the brigade commander
to get one of the battalion’s APC crews to go out on foot and get as near as
possible to the missiles. It was nearly 15 minutes later when they returned. They
said they’d never seen this kind of missile vehicle, but that the soldiers manning
them seemed to be speaking Hebrew. It turned out to be a new ground-to-
ground missile, not yet formally in service, which had been sent into Lebanon
without our knowledge by the northern command.

While that trouble was averted, much worse lay ahead. Yanoush asked to be
brought up to date on our progress in taking control of the area around the
Tovlano Triangle. We briefed him on the situation as we understood it: that
Rifkind had reported the triangle was clear, but that the second brigade had still
not reached it. Yanoush tried to radio the divisional commanders. When he
couldn’t raise them, he ordered the brigade and battalion commanders to pick
up their pace and move forward.

With Yanoush back and the advance resumed, I tried to grab at least a few
hours’ sleep. But around 3:45 am, a junior officer shook me awake. When I
rejoined Yanoush and Amram, they told me the lead battalion was now in deep
trouble. It was led by Ira Ephron, one of Dan Shomron’s best company
commanders during the 1973 war. For reasons I’ve never been able to establish,
Ira’s orders were not to take the hills south of the triangle as we’d planned, but
to go through it to a point two miles or so north. Minutes after crossing the
triangle, his tanks came under heavy fire. Hoping to escape, he kept going, only
to find himself surrounded by a Syrian armored force. They were trapped near a
village called Sultan Yacoub, nearly three miles north of Tovlano. Since it was
early June, it would be light soon, and his predicament could only get worse.

At dawn, he reported he was under heavy artillery, anti-tank missile, RPG
and close-range rifle fire. The only realistic hope was to retreat. We were unable

using computer algebra programs such as Maple or for data processing available as

computational modules in MatLab.

One of the techniques for the computation of hy involves determining the
logarithm of the asymptotic growth rate of the major diagonal (“trace”) in the
transition matrix symbolically encoding the trajectory which would therefore count
the “self visitations” of each indexed boxes as the dynamics proceed. This involves
setting up a transition incidence matrix, each box scored for a disallowed, 0, or
allowed, 1, transitions and the matrix is exponentiated t times with the logarithm of
the asymptotic growth rate of the sum of the diagonal values serving as a (leading
eigenvalue) estimate of hr. More technical considerations involving the Frobenius-
Perron theorem guaranteeing the existence of such an logarithmic index of new
information generation rates, even in random matrices (Seneta, 1981), will not be

discussed here.

We have found that computing hz in this way is empirically useful for difficult
to obtain or only transiently stationary brain data series. Even with relatively short
samples lengths, if one is willing to make the pragmatic assumption of “temporary
stationarity” or “things as they are right now will, for the sake of argument, go on
forever’ (perhaps the best we can do with intrinsically transient brain phenomena)
then this “freeze framed” representation of reality yields an asymptotic measure on
relatively short sample lengths since they are computationally infinite. A similar
approach to hy, requires repeatedly exponentiating a Markoff matrix constructed
from relatively short samples and generates the probabilistic (eigenvector) “dual” of
hr. hy computed in this way serves as a useful quantity, hy called by some the
Kolmogorov entropy in comparisons of control and experimental conditions of the
same sample lengths. Systematic decreases in hw (“Kolmogorov entropy”) have
been shown to accompany increasing “depth” of sleep using standard sleep staging
techniques (Gallez and Babloyantz, 1991) and increases in hy were associated with
both positive and negative emotional states induced by movies (Aftanas et al,
1997).

missed out on how similar mechanisms might eventually be embodied in technological
computational systems—as now they have been. Today’s dominant technologies were
developed in the world of Turing and von Neumann, rather than the world of Wiener.

In the first industrial revolution, energy from a steam engine or a water wheel was
used by human workers to replace their own energy. Instead of being a source of energy
for physical work, people became modulators of how a large source of energy was used.
But because steam engines and water wheels had to be large to be an efficient use of
capital, and because in the 18th century the only technology for spatial distribution of
energy was mechanical and worked only at very short range, many workers needed to be
crowded around the source of energy. Wiener correctly argues that the ability to transmit
energy as electricity caused a second industrial revolution. Now the source of energy
could be distant from where it was used, and from the beginning of the 20th century,
manufacturing could be much more dispersed as electrical-distribution grids were built.

Wiener then argues that a further new technology, that of the nascent
computational machines of his time, will provide yet another revolution. The machines
he talks about seem to be both analog and (perhaps) digital in nature; and he points out, in
The Human Use of Human Beings, that since they will be able to make decisions, both
blue-collar and white-collar workers may be reduced to being mere cogs in a much bigger
machine. He fears that humans might use and abuse one another through organizational
structures that this capability will encourage. We have certainly seen this play out in the
last sixty years, and that disruption 1s far from over.

However, his physics-based view of computation protected him from realizing
just how bad things might get. He saw machines’ ability to communicate as providing a
new and more inhuman way of exerting command and control. He missed that within a
few decades computation systems would become more like biological systems, and it
seems, from his descriptions in chapter 10 of his own work on modeling some aspects of
biology, that he woefully underappreciated the many orders of magnitude of further
complexity of biology over physics. We are in a much more complex situation today
than he foresaw, and I am worried that it is much more pernicious than even his worst
imagined fears.

In the 1960s, computation became firmly based on the foundations set out by
Turing and von Neumann, and it was digital computation, based on the idea of finite
alphabets which they both used. An arbitrarily long sequence, or string, formed by
characters from a finite alphabet, can be encoded as a unique integer. As with Turing
Machines themselves, the formalism for computation became that of computing an
integer-valued function of a single integer-valued input.

Turing and von Neumann both died in the 1950s and at that time this is how they
saw computation. Neither foresaw the exponential increase in computing capability that
Moore’s Law would bring—nor how pervasive computing machinery would become.
Nor did they foresee two developments in our modeling of computation, each of which
poses a great threat to human society.

The first is rooted in the abstractions they adopted. In the fifty-year, Moore’s
Law-fueled race to produce software that could exploit the doubling of computer
capability every two years, the typical care and certification of engineering disciplines
was thrown by the wayside. Software engineering was fast and prone to failures. This

The Aeroloft is located in the area
above the main deck and aft of the

and is built by Greenpoint. The
center is licensed by Boeing to do the
necessary modifications and installation.
It will receive EASA certification
this year and adds 393 additional sq

SKYTHEATER TAKES MOVIES TO THE MAX
Earlier this year, a flying theater rolled up
to the Signature FBO on Teterboro Airport’s
south side in the form of a Global Express
XRS equipped with an entertainment system
called SkyTheater. With it came SkyTheater
founder Gregg Launer, 52, a friendly bear of a
man who tries for modesty but whose enthusiasm
spills close to hubris when he describes
the custom-built entertainment package as
being to the average movie experience what
Sofia Vergara is to simply being female. Launer
is something of a likeable version of Steven
Jobs. His knowledge in the world of sound is
such that he frequently stops and searches his
vocabulary for language that the average listener
will understand. And frequently failing,
he will offer an apology and start over. In his
own circle, he is often described by clients as
a genius. To lesser human beings, his thoughts
seem to run like a pinball through the random
light and sound of an arcade game, with a purpose
difficult to recognize.
“I’m a true audiophile, and what I’m
building is a sensory experience that will so
completely absorb my clients that it becomes
reality and they lose themselves in the world
that the director or cameraman or composer
SkyTheater founder Gregg
Launer put nearly 1,000
movies into a Global
Express Avod.
created,” he explains. “I
build every system as if it
were going into my own
airplane. I want to impress
even myself, and I’m my
own worst critic.”
His earliest memories
are of music and theater
and lying awake in
bed and listening to legendary
DJ Cousin Brucie
lay down a cascade of rock and roll on New
York’s powerhouse WABC. Even decades
later, one of his favorite toys at home is a
Rock-Ola Jukebox. “When you listen to Dean
Martin, or Elvis, or Chuck Berry on a jukebox,
you’re hearing rock and roll the way it was
made to be heard,” he avows.
And he recalls a summer when his parents
took him on vacation to the Deauville Beach
Resort in Miami Beach, where The Supremes
were performing. “They were in the room
across the hall from us, and Mary Wilson and
Flo Ballard shared a cabana next to ours. I was
too young to attend the show, but the resort
manager had mercy on me, took me by the
hand and put me in the front row.”
By the age of 18, Launer held a first-class
radiotelephone license from the FCC and by 19
was an audio engineer producing music tracks
at NBC in Miami. And along the way, he also
indulged what he describes as his alternative
passion of flying, picking up his private license
and going on to become a flight instructor.
At the age of 32, he and wife, Blanche,
formed a company that two years later became
PHOTOS: KIRBY J. HARRISON
SkyTheater. And as if life had determined to
create a movie script for him, Launer’s first customer
and later friend was Alexander Zuyev,
the pilot who defected in spectacular manner
from the former Soviet Union in 1989, at
the same time delivering a MiG-29 into western
hands. “He loved America and would have
the most incredible Fourth of July parties. But
instead of beer and burgers, he would serve
vodka and caviar. It was his belief in me that
helped launch SkyTheater.”
Getting Off the Ground
Launer’s first theater in the sky was for businessman
and entrepreneur Wayne Huizenga
of Blockbuster and the airplane was a BAC
1-11. Then came a Boeing 727-200 and Launer
was off and running.
It was a time when digital technology
was in its infancy and the reliability was still
in question. So Launer devised a way for all
the soundtracks to play through a single system
(either 7.1 or 5.1 surround sound), with
19-inch touchscreen, video monitor/controllers
throughout the cabin and two 43-inch
plasma monitors. “Ten years later,” claims
Launer, “that airplane was still state of the art.”
In the late 1990s some of those working for
producer/director George Lucas’ Skywalker
Ranch happened to listen to the SkyTheater
system Launer had installed in the 727. He was
immediately recruited and spent the next two
years–off and on–there, working and learning.
Launer remembers being “incredibly fortunate”
to be part of a group that was “setting
the standards that still exemplify visual film
and movie soundtracks today.”
In the meantime, Launer had formed a Sky-
Theater partnership in Fort Lauderdale with
friend and fellow traveler Andrew Guenther,
who owns Advanced Audio Design, a hometheater
firm in Sarasota, Fla.
“He handles a lot of the equipment and
designs the electronics that make everything
work. Andrew does a guy’s home theater, and
if the guy owns an airplane, SkyTheater does
the cabin entertainment,” says Launer.
Guenther’s talent and influence is such,
claims Launer, “that high-end audiovisual electronics
manufacturers will often come to him
for his input before introducing some new
technology at a major trade show.”
Among Guenther’s home theater customers
are movie actor John Travolta, basketball
coach Pat Riley, singer Gloria Estefan “and
more who prefer not to be named,” he says.
Though focused on two different theater
markets, Guenther and Launer are involved
together in a music project designed to
“recruit and produce live venues for musicians

Goodrich Near Completion
Last year, United Technologies
agreed to the acquisition of Goodrich
in a deal that called for UT to shell out
$16.5 billion cash and assume $1.9
billion in assumed debt. The acquisition
by UT was to be finalized by the end of
last month.
The acquisition would bring to UT
Goodrich’s rapidly growing interiors

business jet cabin components.
Leather and Lace

Edelman Leather has introduced a new
Leather & Lace line, inspired by the work

Edelman’s artists describe the results
of this new line on its Cavallini hair-on

appropriate for the Leather & Lace
designs include Napoli and Royal Suede.
Metrica Aviation Makes
Move at Nuremberg Airport
Maintenance, repair and overhaul
specialist Aero-Dienst, in the process
of increasing its usable space at
Germany’s Nuremberg Airport with
another hangar, has added 27,000 sq
ft and considerable refurbishment
expertise through a partnership with
Metrica Aviation Interior.
“We are now able to offer an
operator interior repair and refurbishment
simultaneous with other
maintenance, all under one roof,” said
Aero-Dienst managing director Martin
Bauer. The two companies began
working together in January this year
and Metrica has already completed
several refurbishments.
Metrica is an established business, a
subsidiary of Qatar’s Ghanim bin Saad al
Saad and Sons Group Holdings.

Eichten said Pats did a nine-year
maintenance check on a BBJ last year
and included a major refurbishment
at the same time. The center has also
sent out “quite a number of bids” on
BBJs due for the 12-year maintenance
check, and all include “substantial
refurbishment work.”
King Aerospace is looking toward
the bizliner business for a boost. “We’re
in discussions now with international
customers for executive conversions
and even a green airplane completion,”
said Jerry King. “And they’re all
widebodies.”

upgrades since they entered service some
12 years ago, and the cabin electronics are
practically antique.
Edinger said Comlux America, part
of The Comlux Group in Switzerland, is
“really starting to roll.”
He told AIN the first green airplane
has been delivered–an ACJ319–and it
came in 1,000 pounds below the completion
allowance weight. It also tested with
an average cabin noise level of 48 dB(SIL),
“about what you might expect in a suburban
living room, and it was under the
projected noise level by 3 dB(SIL).”
Currently undergoing refurbishment
is a Boeing 757 and a pair of Airbus
ACJs. In the second quarter this year,
a BBJ to be outfitted for Hyundai was
scheduled to roll into the Comlux hangar.
Comlux America is approved by
both Airbus and Boeing for interior
outfitting. “We want to focus on BBJs
and ACJs and do this segment well and
on time,” said The Comlux Group president
Richard Gaona.

in unique multi-channel surround-sound, as
well as to promote them to the film and television
industries for soundtrack recordings.”
In 2007, “an executive closely associated
with the Internet industry came to Launer
with his new Global Express XRS, and made it
clear that what he wanted was far beyond anything
off-the-shelf.” In 2008 the airplane was
delivered with a complete and custom-built
SkyTheater that includes:
• 1080p high-bandwidth wiring throughout
• monitors and speakers
• audiovisual on-demand (Avod) with a library
of more than 1,000 movies.
• a SkyTheater app to allow passengers to
use personal iPhones and iPads to control all
aspects of the entertainment system.
• a customized touch-screen control package.
“The owner can also customize the sound
balance in the cabin by simply going through
the field until he finds a ‘flavor’ he likes,”
explains Launer. “In this particular airplane,”
says Launer, “SkyTheater is pre-tuned for the
owner’s personal tastes to reproduce audio
identical to what he would hear in the Hollywood
Bowl or Lincoln Center or some other
popular venue.”
Totally Absorbed in the Moment
Putting SkyTheater through its paces on
the Global, Launer selects surround sound and
asks visitors to walk through the entire cabin,
to sit anywhere they like, even lie on the floor
and note any change in the audio. His grin
broadens as not one individual professes to
detect a difference.
Launer goes on to select Star Wars Episode
VI: Return of the Jedi, picking the scene of the
chase on Ewok speeder bikes through the forest
of Endor. “Now listen closely,” he advises.
As the action roars across the screen, it is perfectly
paced by the sound in that reality, “and
if I hadn’t told you to listen, you would have
been totally absorbed by the experience without
realizing why.
“What I aim for is not only a perfect audio
system, but one that is perfectly synchronized
with the film,” he says.
But is it high-definition? Launer expresses
mock surprise at the question. Then he admits
that not everything in the Global’s film bank
is HD; however, he also points out that with
the technology to tune the system properly,
even a pre-digital recording will be rendered
in sufficient high definition as to be almost
unrecognizable as anything else. And he also

explains that simply having a Blu-ray player or
Avod and an HD monitor does not ensure an
HD experience. “You have to have the bandwidth
to carry the signal that will allow 1080p
between the origin and the final destination.”
While the system in the Global Express
XRS is now almost four years old, and
SkyTheater has since done several more airplanes,
including Donald Trump’s recently
completed Boeing 757, the entertainment
package in the XRS remains, he claims,
“years ahead of anything else.”
Warren Justice, chief pilot on the Global,
chuckles when he remembers his first meeting
with Launer, “a big guy dressed like a biker and
wearing a black beret. But he knew what he
was talking about and no one in this company
has regretted listening,” Justice continues.
“I’ve never heard anything like what he put
into this airplane. Even after it was installed,
he insisted on going with us on a flight test to
tune the sound for cruise at 41,000 feet. He
personally programmed the individual controls.
It was so well thought out that the owner
went right into it on the first day and didn’t
need a single lesson.”
Since installation, the airplane has been all
over the world and not a single component of
the entertainment system has needed to be
changed, said Justice. However, he adds, on
several occasions, when the airplane was passing
through Florida with a stop-over, Launer
has insisted on coming out to see if the system
was still properly tuned.
The system is not inexpensive, allows Justice.
Just a little north of a million dollars. But
he adds, “If this is what you want, you’ll definitely
get what you pay for. I don’t know how
we could have done any better.”
Theo Kalomirakis, president of Theo Kalomirakis
Theaters of Brooklyn, N.Y., is one of
the foremost designers of home theaters in
the world and has consistently turned down
requests to do an in-flight theater. “I have
been skeptical of the ability of anyone to control
sound in such an environment,” he told
AIN. “What Gregg designed and built on that
Global Express is the first serious system I’ve
heard. Gregg has tamed the beast.”
But it isn’t just a matter of being good
at what you do, says Launer. “It’s a matter
of passion, and of loving what you do. Think of
SkyTheater as a personal transporter [a la Star
Trek]. You step into it in New York City and you
step out of it in Los Angeles, and everything in
between was just a moment in time.” –K.J.H.
Iacobucci Shines at EBACE
Iacobucci HF appeared at EBACE with
a new espresso maker for the business
jet galley and a galley cart that doesn’t
look out of place on a large private jet.
The 28V espresso machine does not
work with the usual boiler but with
patented heat exchangers to ensure
instant and continuous operation without
waiting for the water to reheat
after each use. In addition, the heat
exchanger makes for a much lighter
machine, and its “open system” allows
the use of all easy-serve espresso pods.
The serving cart, created by
DesignworksUSA, features attachable
“skins” or even transparent windows to
allow passengers to see available items. For
use in a private jet, the top surface can be
modified for a more formal appearance.
“We brought the style, fit and finish
that customers expect to find in premium
environments at home to enhance
their on-board experience,” said Laurenz
Schaffer, president of BMW Group
DesignworksUSA.
An espresso maker and an executive galley cart

AirGlide Coatings Cut Fuel Burn
Aviation marketing consultancy Action
Aviation has signed an exclusive distribution
agreement with AirGlide, a UK
company that claims that its new Aviation
Shield nano-technology coating can
result in fuel-burn savings of about 4
percent through a drag reduction of up
to 40 percent.
According to Action Aviation’s website,
an ACJ318 on a two-hour flight
might burn 9,500 pounds of fuel. With
the AirGlide coating, the same aircraft
would burn 200 pounds less fuel over
that same route.
Other advantages include reducing the
carbon footprint, reducing cleaning and
maintenance costs and greater protection
against corrosion and erosion. It
also means, the company claims, that
the exterior paint will last longer.
AkzoNobel Wins
Airbus Approval
AkzoNobel Aerospace Coatings of the
Netherlands has received approval of its
Aerobase base coat and Aviox UVR clearcoat
system from Airbus as an option.
The system allows selective removal
of only the base coat/clear coat in
preparation for repainting, leaving
the original primer intact and thereby
saving the aircraft owner time and
money, according to the Amsterdambased
company.
Further, AkzoNobel said the system
“was developed in line with one of Airbus’s
key objectives to produce aircraft
that are friendlier to the environment
and more eco-efficient.” The base coat/
clear coat system is ready for use in
series production.

in 1966, a position he cleverly exploited after Syria’s defeat by Israel
in the Six-Day War of 1967, after which it was alleged that the
regime had had secret dealings with the Jewish state. A “palace coup”
inside the leadership brought Assad to power as president in 1970.
Thereafter the power of the state was firmly concentrated in Alawi
hands. Of the officers commanding the 47th Syrian Tank Brigade,
which was responsible for suppressing the Muslim Brotherhood’s
rebellion in the city of Hama in 1982 at a cost of some 20,000 lives,
70 percent are reported to have been Alawis. When Hafez al-Assad
died in June 2000, the constitutional niceties were rapidly dispensed
with to ensure the succession of his son Bashar, who had studied
ophthalmology in England. Fearful that Hafez’s exiled younger
brother Rifaat al-Assad, who had commanded the Hama operation,
would try to take over, a hastily convened session of the People’s
Assembly voted to lower the minimum age for a president from forty
to thirty-four, the exact age of Bashar al-Assad.

In the welter of violence now accompanying the regime’s determined
efforts to suppress the demonstrations, its achievements should not be
forgotten or ignored. While its massacre in Hama was horrendous and
it has an abysmal record on human rights, engaging in torture and
severe political repression, it had a good, even excellent one when it
came to protecting the pluralism of the religious culture that is one of
Syria’s most enduring and attractive qualities. Some of these virtues
are captured in Brooke Allen’s engaging account of her travels in
Syria, The Other Side of the Mirror, where she meets ordinary people
from different backgrounds and rejoices in the natural friendliness of
Syria’s people and the extraordinary richness of its past. Instead of
the Soviet-style grayness she expected to find from accounts in the
US media, she discovers a sophisticated cosmopolitan society where
life is being lived in many different styles and varieties, “totally
unselfconsciously, just as it has been for thousands of years.”

Dear Jeffrey, 
Larry has told me that you and a friend would like to contribute to my project (hallelujah and thank you a 
million times, Jeffrey) and that I ought to write up a proposal asking for 500,000. This is wonderful. If this 
comes to pass, the best way for that money to come, I think, is as a gift to Poetry in America, an initiative at 
EdLabs at Harvard University. This will give me discretion over its disbursement to HarvardX and WGBH, 
but this will be absolutely be a Harvard gift that will count as Campaign success and from which Harvard 
will take some (but not as much)overhead. . So far the best finance people I've met are at EdLabs and they are 
happy to manage these funds for me. There are other ways to give me this money that leave Harvard out, but 
my understanding is that your friend would like this to be a Harvard gift. 
Here's a draft of what I'd like to do with that money. 
I'd like 500,000 to do post-production and distribution of a whole historical period of American poetry 
(1914-1945 is what I'm thinking—Modernism) and including three episodes of tv. 
The raw materials for that period include interviews with Bill Clinton (including footage not yet used by 
WGBH), Peter Gallison, Walter Isaacson, Lena Dunham, Woody Allen (whose lawyers didn't like our release 
a while ago, but we're hoping will soften over time), Harrison Ford (still a maybe), Robert Polito, Sarah Kay, 
Al Filreis, Rafael Campo, Susan Howe, kids from Nantucket High School, kids from Brookline High 
School, Alfre Woodard, Jane Pickering, Jay Parini, Ray Dalio, Leon Wieseltier, Richard Dawkins and others; 
and footage shot in Harlem, Greenwich Village, midtown, Chicago, London (if I have the money to hire a 
crew there; don't now ), at museums including the Fogg, Harvard Museum of Natural History, Frost's house in 
Ripton Vermont and more. 
This allows the donor to give to a big Harvard Campaign priority, Teaching and Learning , by supporting 
Poetry in America, allowing me to produce the crucial segment of the online course with the highest (TV 
quality) production values and so also supplying higher quality video to WGBH as a way also to cut their 
costs. 
Currently, HarvardX skimps (on lighting, for instance--see the Bill Clinton interview) and while WGBH 
ladles money raised by others into everything. I have been pounding away at my friends at WGBH and I 
know that WGBH producer will work with HarvardX if they can give him footage of the right quality. . That 
is, we'll use HarvardX as the backlot for WGBH so as to squeeze three episodes out for 250. 
This proposal does not include experiments in schools or the curricular development into courses for teachers 
that you've seen in other (million dollar ) proposals. But the courses for teachers can't happen before the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028884 
footage is developed, and these courses will have as their centerpiece the WGBH episodes, and so this 
funding will make all the rest possible. 
I can polish this narrative and or edit it, if there are things you think I have wrong. 
And I can attach a draft budget based on real Harvard numbers (what my Harvard video editor, producer, 
media manager cost) as well as a draft WGBH budget I'll now go an negotiate with them. Or we can do that at 
a second stage. 
Let me know what you think? And when are we reading Whitman together. Why don't we set a date for Feb 
when Poetry in America 3: Whitman is running online and we could screen a little video and then have a 
discussion around your table with you and some friends?

So, there's no privilege log entry.

There's no production of these documents. And
there is clearly a very significant discovery
violation if, in fact, such documents exist.

MR. SIMPSON: I'm not going to debate it
here, Mr. Scarola, but your assertions are not
accurate.

MR. SCAROLA: Allright. There also was a
subpoena duces teeum that was responded to
tomorrow -- I'm sorry, yesterday. Can you tell
us whether the documents that are now being
described are included in response to the
subpoena duces tecum on the flash drive that
you provided to us?

Of course, the AI significance of learning tasks like this all depends on what kind of feedback
the system is given, and how complex its environment is. It would be relatively simple to make
an AI system do things like this in a trivial and highly specialized way, but that is not the intent

Dear Partner, 
I hope this letter finds you well — please see the below updates on the Park Mansion:

for the units. Please see the attached plans. The team is finishing interviews with General 
Contractors (GCs) and has come down to the final five GCs that will be allowed to bid on the 
project. 
Additionally included are visuals for the sidewalk shed and a rendering for the website. 
Please fell free to contact me if you have any questions at

The Upper East Side's last

It's a tale (practically) as old as time. When New York City real estate thrives, home 
builders and buyers seek to colonize neighborhoods previously deemed undesirable. 
The Financial District was once the exclusive domain of nine-to-fivers; these days, 
every other office building is a condominium. Along the Hudson River, midtown 
Manhattan used to be an industrial no-man's-land of warehouses and strip clubs. 
No more — residential projects abound. And now the Upper East Side neighborhood 
dubbed Yorkville, which stretches from about 72nd to 96th streets east of Third 
Avenue, is ready for its turn.

Area al 
detail 
The area, defined by its dearth of all-glass towers and 
plethora of tree-lined streets, has long been a favorite 
for blue-bloods looking to live near prep schools and 
the FDR Drive — for weekend getaways out East, of 
course. 
But as both land and condo prices hit record highs, it's 
QueensI attracting a fresh wave of interest. More than a dozen 
new buildings are on the way, and with them a crop of 
buyers who see Yorkville as a place where apartments 
are a relative bargain. 
Yes, until the Second Avenue subway comes online in 
approach the East River. But the Q extension's 
imminent completion — coupled with a new Whole Foods and easy access to parks, 
museums, hospitals and other family-friendly perks — all mean people want in on a 
neighborhood in the throes of a transformation from nice 'n' quiet to construction-
induced, decibel-busting busy. 
Extell Development sure wants a piece of the action, shelling out $100 million for a 
Gristede's grocery store on 86th Street near First Avenue. (The property giant already 
owns at least four tenement buildings in the vicinity, and reports say it's cobbled 
together enough land to build something big.) Extell has also filed plans for two 
smaller projects on 92nd Street and Second Avenue, plus, it's already begun the 
foundation of a 30-story building at the corner of 95th and Third Avenue, just a block 
south of the boundary with East Harlem. Called The Kent, sales of 83 luxe two- to five-
bedroom residences in a handsome brick structure will hit the market in the fourth 
quarter. Talk about flooding the zone!

Note that The Kent, set for completion in the fall of 2017, is replacing a row of walk-up 
tenements that used to dominate their block. Similarly, Icon Realty spent less than $50 
million for a comparable row on Second Avenue in the 80s, which it is demolishing

with the goal of putting up a chic high-rise on the site. It's markedly cheaper than 
Extell's deal, in part because Icon started assembling properties in 2007. (Icon is 
working on a second high-rise as well as a shorter rental building in the same neck of 
the woods.) 
Just look to other data and the same trend emerges. In 2010, Yorkville's median sale 
price was $663,500, according to real estate listings site StreetEasy. Compare that to 
the first seven months of this year — it's 14 percent higher, at $757,500. But remember, 
the sub-market remains cheaper relative to the Upper East Side at large, which boasts 
a year-to-date median of $1.15 million.

Despite the building boom, some low-rises remain, housing institutions, such as 
German butcher Schaller & Weber and beer garden Heidelberg, that are vestiges of 
centuries past when Yorkville was an immigrant enclave.

Let's hope they can hang on: Even more small buildings were razed to make way for 
star architecture firm SHoP (of Barclays Center fame) to design a tower of 83 condos 
with Anbau Enterprises at the corner of 89th Street and First Avenue. The building, 
dubbed Citizen360 because its height will afford many residents an all-around view of

the neighborhood, will have 6,000 square feet of amenity space that ranges from music 
rehearsal and art rooms to a gym and children's play area. Apartments go on sale this 
fall, with pricing in the $1.3 million to over-$12 million ballpark.

The site was highly undervalued because it was so far 
east, and there were no good transportation links, and 
people just weren't interested or willing to go there. 
But we saw opportunity, says Barbara van Beuren, 
Anbau's managing director. I think the absolute prices 
are manageable. This is not a building full of $10 
million apartments. Still, it points to a future far more 
expensive than the current data shows. 
Just one block from 113-year-old Jewish bakery 
Glaser's, which churns out delicious black-and-white 
cookies, Citizen360's shimmery facade will rise 410 feet 
above street level. But trumping them all will be DDG's 
under-construction goliath on 180 E. 88th St. At 521 
feet, it will be the tallest structure on the Upper East 
Side north of 72nd Street. Its 48 apartments with 16-
foot ceilings and custom lobby artwork launch sales this 
fall, with two-beds starting from $3.4 million, three-
beds from $4.5 million and four-beds from $7 million. 
It's not all about living among the clouds, though. 
Michael D'Alessio, president of Michael Paul 
Enterprises, oversaw the overhaul of two smallish 
rental buildings east of Third Avenue into boutique luxury projects. They were prime 
locations for condominiums catering to families, says D'Alessio of the projects, 225 E. 
81st St. (a.k.a The Justin) and 554 E. 82nd St., which have nine apartments between 
them. They are three or four bedroom units, with big living and dining areas with 
fireplaces, and they all have outdoor space. Six have been snatched up, with asks 
ranging from $2.25 million for a two-bedroom to $5.99 million for a four-bedroom.

Meanwhile, another rental-to-condo conversion — Carnegie Park — attracted first-
time buyer Elizabeth Dean, who realized Yorkville offered more bang for her buck after 
house-hunting in lower Manhattan. 
Originally, I wasn't going to go north of 86th Street. I didn't know what was above 
there, says Dean, 29, who works in finance, paid $1,184 per square foot for her one-

bedroom and loves the restaurants, bars and grocery stores that dot the area

In July, StreetEasy reports Yorkville's median 
price per square foot was $1,098, up 5.1 
percent from the year prior and a whopping 
29.8 percent from the month prior. The Upper 
East Side as a whole, of course, boasts a 
higher median: $1,694 per square foot in July. 
It'll actually be a great investment, Dean 
says. Downtown is extremely pricey, and I 
think there's a lot more upside to the Upper 
East Side. 
Part of Carnegie Park's makeover includes a 
slate of plush amenities designed by classicist 
Robert A.M. Stern, the architect behind 
famously ritzy buildings like 15 Central Park West. (The pool, the roof deck and the in-
house mini-Equinox gym lured Dean.) Available apartments range from a $955,000 
one-bedroom to a $7.15 million penthouse. 
You'll be able to drive up to 20 East End in style via its porte-cochere and motor court. (The latter is depicted in 
the rendering.) 
Photo: Hayes Davidson 
Stern is also working on a ground-up project at 20 East End Avenue that could pass as 
a setback-laden prewar, with old-school details like a porte-cochere, which allows 
residents to enter in a vehicle via an archway from the street and drive right up to the 
lobby door in a circular motor court. One of these hasn't been a part of any newly 
constructed building since the 1930s! About half of its 43 condos, spread across 18 
stories, are in contract from $4.49 million to $14.25 million. 
Still, three-fourths of New York City residents are renters, and the Upper East Side's 
new crop of construction has something for them, too. Related has topped out on a 36-
story tower at 205 E. 92nd St., where a playground used to sit. The uber-fancy 
development will have a massive two-story Equinox gym and a private school for kids 
with language-based learning disabilities on its lower floors. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 022438

The apartments above, set for completion and leasing in the spring of 2016, will have 
layouts that skew in favor of three- and four-bedrooms. There will be thermostats 
programmable remotely on all the A/C units, and motorized shades in some of the 
units, says Bryan Cho, executive vice president at Related Companies. From the 
marble bathrooms to the highly designed public spaces and the amenities, it's what's 
usually in condominiums. 
On the rental market sooner is The Rose Modern, a 20-story, 82-unit tower currently 
finishing up construction on York Avenue. The leasing office will open the first week of 
October offering competitive rents for a luxury building, according to Bond New 
York's Douglas Wagner, with move-ins slated for November and December.

Want to buy now, and move in immediately? The building most ahead of the curve is 
The Charles. Previously stalled after 2008's downturn, the 32-story condo at 1355 First 
Ave. got redesigned to emphasize large full-floor apartments before breaking ground 
in 2012. And it's paid off. There are four units left out of 27 total, which started at 
$5.97 million. A recent sale of the top six floors to two unidentified relatives for a total 
of $59 million made headlines. That price? On First Avenue? 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 022439

garage, 302 E. 96th St. will become 
a 21-story luxury condo.

The preconceived idea of what was considered prime and where you would build 
luxury has completely changed, says Jason Karadus of Town, who is director of sales 
for the Charles along with Ginger Brokaw. A lot of people in the industry smirked at 
the pricing — about $2,500 per square foot ... Now it's not so risky, which is why you're 
seeing companies like Extell building up what's left to be developed up there. 
Every developable parcel seems to be getting snatched 
up. Just take a three-story garage on 302 East 96th 
Street, which developer Wonder Works bought in March 
for $24 million. On the northernmost border with 
Harlem, the developer plans to put up a 21-story, 48-
unit affordable luxury condo building — basically 
right on the approach to the FDR. (Don't worry, the 
facade will have extra soundproofing.) 
The Second Avenue subway station for 96th street, 
which will be one of the first ones opened, is just 200 
feet away, says Eric Brody, Wonder Works' managing 
partner, who adds that brokers are recommending 
asking prices of $1,500 to $2,300 per square foot when 
units go on sale next year. The buyer is anyone who 
can't afford to be in all these downtown neighborhoods, 
but still wants to live in the city and have incredibly 
close access to a train. 
Public transit of the future is why Andrew Ellis bought 
a fixer-upper on 95th Street and Second Avenue in 
2013. The 31-year-old consultant paid a mere $430 per 
square foot for a one-bedroom garden-level duplex. 
Then came a massive year-long renovation that updated the windows and kitchen 
appliances. He also completely redid the backyard, adding a rear deck and koi pond. In 
Yorkville, Ellis discovered a neighborhood feel that was a far cry from the raucous 
scrum of Murray Hill, where he had been renting. 
I had sort of grown out of that, says Ellis, who is no longer alone in his move uptown. 
My high school friends and some college friends are migrating to the Upper East Side. 
One is two doors down, literally, and two others are a few blocks away. Having that 
subway there eventually is really what did it for me. This place can only go up. 
Andrew Ellis stands in his Yorkville backyard, which he completely redid, adding a deck (so that the outdoor 
space was accessible from the upstairs living room of the duplex) and a koi pond.

OF COUNSEL
THOMAS E. McHUGH

Mr. John Roth

Senior Associate Deputy Attorney General
Office of the Deputy Attorney General
United States Department of Justice

950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20530

Dear Mr. Roth:

I write to offer my reaction to the May 15, 2008 correspondence from the United States
Department of Justice Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (“CEOS”) regarding the federal
investigation of Jeffrey Epstein by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of

Florida (“(USAO”).’ I will refrain from recounting Mr. Epstein’s arguments in detail here, but,
rather, will highlight salient points responsive to the CEOS letter.

In particular, I write from a background well familiar with child exploitation cases and
victim/witness issues. As the CEOS letter points out (CEOS letter at p. 3), I was a member of
CEOS. In fact, I served as a federal prosecutor for twelve years; five years as an Assistant United
States Attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia, and seven years at CEOS. I began
working as a trial attorney for CEOS in 1999, and was promoted to Deputy Chief for Litigation in
2002, and ultimately to Principal Deputy Chief for the Section in 2004,

As those who have worked with me know, [have a history of working diligently on behalf of
victims of crime. While at the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of West
Virginia, I was a part of the prosecution team that prosecuted the first case in the country under the
federal Violence Against Women Act. United States v. Bailey, 112 F.3d 758 (4 Cir.), cert denied,
522 U.S. 896 (1997). The case went to trial and the defendant was sentenced to life in prison. I also
spearheaded the domestic violence and federal criminal child support prosecution efforts for that
office, prosecuting some of the first cases in the country under the federal Child Support Recovery

Then, Alicia told the cop, Epstein groped her buttocks against
her will while acting as though he was evaluating her body. Alicia
had stopped Epstein, and left the room, but couldn't get over the
incident.

At the top of his crime report, the officer wrote “Sexual
Battery.” But Epstein was never charged in the incident. “The
Santa Monica Police Department discounted every one of [Alicia’s]
allegations of improper conduct by Jeffrey Epstein and they took
no action on this 1997 complaint,” Epstein’s West Palm Beach
attorney, Jack Goldberger, told the Palm Beach Post in 2010.

“The cops said it'd be my word against his,” Alicia told the
paper. “And since he had a lot of money, I let it go. I hadn't
thought much about it since, until I saw his picture online. And
now, I want everybody to know how much of a creep he’s always
been.”

disputed city of Kirkuk. The Iraqi army was moving troops to the
area. Shooting could have broken out were it not for the presence of
the U.S. army in the middle.

Peshmerga leaders won't talk directly to their Iraqi counterparts--they
need a trusted third party in the room. What will happen next year if
another such crisis erupts when U.S. troops are gone?

The U.S. Embassy has an ambitious plan to deploy some 1,000
diplomats backed by 16,000 contractors to maintain a presence there
and at several consulates around the country. But even if they pull
this off--a feat of logistics that would be unprecedented for the State
Department--there will be no replacement for the peacekeeping
function that is performed by our troops.

Contractors may be successful in training Iraqi forces but I have my
doubts about whether they will be up to the magnitude of the task.
Iraq has no fighter aircraft and no air-control system. It has only some
70 tanks and no artillery. Its army has almost no experience in
combined-arms warfare, having devoted the last eight years, for
understandable reasons, to counterinsurgency operations.

In other words, Iraq is almost defenseless. That makes it easy prey for
Iran, its historic rival. This doesn't mean that an Iranian invasion is
likely. Yet Iranian bullying and influence-peddling is going on all the
time, and if Iraq can't defend its borders, Tehran will have an extra
element of coercive leverage.

Under these circumstances, leaving Iraq entirely would be an act of
folly. We are still in Kosovo, South Korea and other post-conflict
zones that are far more stable. We need to be in Iraq too.

We don't need to keep 50,000 troops there, but a continuing presence
of 20,000 military personnel, as argued by military analysts Frederick
and Kimberly Kagan, would seem to be the minimum necessary to
ensure Iraq's continued progress. It would also make possible an Iraqi-
American alliance that could become one of the linchpins of security

Memorandum.

The day to day business of the General Partner will be generally be conducted by its directors, although
certain matters require the approval of its shareholders pursuant to the Companies Law and the General
Partner's Articles of Association. Under Cayman Islands law, a director of a Cayman Islands company is
obliged to comply with a number of duties, breach of which may, in certain circumstances, result in
personal liability on the part of the director. However, provided a director complies with the fiduciary
duties and the requisite duties of care, diligence and skill, the fact that a decision turns out to be wrong,
not beneficial, or causes loss, will not of itself necessarily establish personal liability.

As a general rule, in the absence of a contractual arrangement to the contrary, the liability of a
shareholder of a Cayman Islands exempted company which has been incorporated with limited liability is
limited to the amount from time to time unpaid in respect of the par value of, together with the share
premium payable on, the shares he holds; the company having a separate legal personality from that of
its shareholders, and being separately liable for its own debts due to third parties, However, although
there is no decided Cayman Islands authority on the issue, English common law authority (which would
be regarded as persuasive, though technically not binding, in the courts of the Cayman Islands), supports
the proposition that it in exceptional circumstances it is conceivable that the principle of the separate legal
personality of a company could be ignored and the court will “pierce the corporate veil.” Examples might
be a company acting as the agent or nominee of its shareholder, incorporation for an illegal or improper
purpose, using a company or group of companies as a means of perpetrating a fraud, or using the
separate personality of a company to circumvent a pre-existing obligation of its proprietor.

14.3. Classes of Units; Capital Contributions

Assuming that 1,000,000 Units are sold to Investors by March 31, 2007, and that the accrued dividends
on the preferred limited partner units are paid in cash, approximately 2,530,000 Units will be outstanding.
The Investors will own approximately 40% of KUE in the form of Common LP Units and approximately
40% of the General Partner in the form of Class A Shares.

The General Partner will be the sole general partner of KUE and will hold approximately 1,000 General
Partner Units (“GP Units’) in KUE, representing approximately 0.04% ownership in KUE.

The economic interest in KUE represenied by the Common LP Units and the GP Units will be reduced by
the Profits Participation LP Units as described below under Distributions.

Assuming that 1,000,000 Units are sold to Investors by March 31, 2007, and that the accrued dividends
on the preferred limited partner units are paid in cash, KUE LLC, controlled by the Principals, will hold
approximately 1,530,000 Common LP Units representing approximately 60% ownership in KUE and
1,530,000 Class A Shares. The Common LP Units owned by KUE LLC will not be transferable, except (i)
to the Principals; (ii) to affiliates of the Principals and/or (iii) to family members and/or charitable
organizations in connection with the Principals’ estate planning, unless combined with the corresponding
percentage of Class A Shares to form Units and transferred in the form of Units in accordance with the
Limited Partnership Agreement.

Knowledge Universe Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“KUH LLC”) conirolled by the
Principals, will hold 900 Class B ordinary shares of the General Partner (the “Class B Shares). The
Class B Shares held by the Principals and their affiliates will not be transferable, except to (i) the
Principals; {ii) to the affiliates of the Principals; and/or (iii) to family members and/or charitable
organizations in connection with the Principals’ estate planning. The Class B Shares will automatically
convert to Class A Shares if the Principals’ aggregate direct and indirect economic interest in KUE is less
than 15% of the outstanding Partnership Units (as defined below) of KUE.

joined the state’s elite investigative unit, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, where he
quickly earned agent-of-the-year honors — and a meeting with the governor — for helping dismantle
a terrorist financing network that stretched from Florida to the Middle East - and that terrorism is very
much a well-protected U.S. industry (see below).

But Brunel's reputation did not prevent Jeffrey Epstein from
getting involved in his business.

According to a summary judgment court filing by Bradley
Edwards, a victims’ lawyer defending against a lawsuit by Jeffrey
Epstein alleging fabrication of sexual assault cases against him,
Epstein had provided support for Brunel’s agency, which changed
its name, in 2005, from Karin to MC2—as in E = mc.

As a scout for MC2, Brunel traveled the world in search of
undiscovered talent, favoring Scandinavia, Israel, central Europe,
the former Soviet republics, and South America, setting up mod-
eling competitions and negotiating with other international mod-
eling agents and agencies.

But according to the court filing, in which Edwards detailed
the information he had gathered in support of victims, Epstein
and Brunel had used the agency to bring underage girls from for-
eign countries into the United States by promising them model-
ing contracts. These girls were then housed in condominiums
belonging to Epstein. “Epstein and Brunel would then obtain a
visa for these girls,” the document states, “then charge the
underage girls rent, presumably to live as underage prostitutes in
the condos.”

“I strongly deny having participated, neither directly nor

_ indirectly, in the actions Mr. Jeffrey Epstein is being accused of,”
1 Brunel would say. “I strongly deny having committed any illicit
q act or any wrongdoing in the course of my work as a scouter or
 model agencies manager. I have exercised with the utmost ethi-
; cal standard for almost forty years.”

that the show be banned. Radicals now have the upper hand in slowly
ending Turkey’s centuries-old drinking culture.

Or take the AKP’s new Kurdish policy. In an effort to expand its base
among Kurds before parliamentary elections next June, the party has
emphasized Islam as a common denominator between Kurds and
Turks, in order to undermine the secular Kurdish nationalist party.
The plan may well help the AKP win the elections. However, it will
also invite competition from religious radicals, such as the Kurdish
Hezbollah — a violent Sunni group not linked to the Lebanese Shiite
group of the same name. Kurdish Hezbollah boasts a wide grassroots
network in southeast Turkey.

Recently, Kurdish Hezbollah’s leadership, which had been
imprisoned since a crackdown in the late 1990s, was released due to a
legal loophole. The AKP’s emphasis on Islam may mean it helps
replace the secular-nationalist Kurdish movement with a religious-
nationalist one. Don’t be surprised if Kurdish Hezbollah begins
suggesting that neither the AKP nor Diyanet are “Muslim enough” to
represent Kurds.

Turkey’s shift is bad news for the United States and Europe. The
potential radicalization of the Turkish population is a pressing
concern, given that Turkey recently eliminated visa restrictions for
citizens of a number of Muslim countries — including Iran, Syria,
Jordan and Libya. The move will facilitate cross-fertilization among
radical groups in Turkey. Washington should start making
contingency plans now to deal with radicals who will challenge the
AKP’s cooperation with the United States, particularly in
Afghanistan.

Turkey’s emboldened radicals will also take issue with Ankara’s

Does Anything Matter?

Peter Singer

2011-06-13 — Can moral judgments be true or false? Or is ethics, at
bottom, a purely subjective matter, for individuals to choose, or
perhaps relative to the culture of the society in which one lives? We
might have just found out the answer.

Among philosophers, the view that moral judgments state objective
truths has been out of fashion since the 1930’s, when logical
positivists asserted that, because there seems to be no way of
verifying the truth of moral judgments, they cannot be anything other
than expressions of our feelings or attitudes. So, for example, when
we Say, “You ought not to hit that child,” all we are really doing is
expressing our disapproval of your hitting the child, or encouraging
you to stop hitting the child. There is no truth to the matter of
whether or not it is wrong for you to hit the child.

Although this view of ethics has often been challenged, many of the
objections have come from religious thinkers who appealed to God’s
commands. Such arguments have limited appeal in the largely secular
world of Western philosophy. Other defenses of objective truth in
ethics made no appeal to religion, but could make little headway
against the prevailing philosophical mood.

Last month, however, saw a major philosophical event: the
publication of Derek Parfit’s long-awaited book On What Matters.
Until now, Parfit, who is Emeritus Fellow of All Souls College,
Oxford, had written only one book, Reasons and Persons, which
appeared in 1984, to great acclaim. Parfit’s entirely secular
arguments, and the comprehensive way in which he tackles

At about the same time, another radical client fired me because he heard that I was a “Zionist”
and he could have nothing to do with anyone associated with such a “fascist” cause.

Father Daniel Berrigan, a lapsed Catholic priest who had become the darling of the hard left as the
result of his anti- Vietnam War activities, began to call both the United States and Israel “criminal”
entities.'°' Chomsky notoriously defended the ruthless Cambodian dictator Pol Pot against
charges of genocide, insisting that western media reports of millions of murders were typical
exaggerations of horrors regularly but falsely attributed to Communist regimes. The National
Lawyers’ Guild, which had become the legal arm of the hard left, dismissed all accusations against
Communist regimes as “red baiting.” They also became the legal arm of anti-Israel extremists,
including terrorists. They did not support these clients on grounds of human rights or civil
liberties principles, but rather because they agreed with their politics. In 197 __, I broke with the
National Lawyers Guild, with which I had worked closely when it had been a neutral human rights
organizations. In a widely read article in The American Lawyer, I told the sad story of the
transformation of the NLG from a genuine human rights organization into an advocate for some
of the worst human wrongs on the planet. This transformation presents in a microcosm the larger
account of the hyacking of the human rights label and agenda by the hard left.

The National Lawyers Guild was established in 1937 as an antidote to the American Bar
Association, which was then fighting the New Deal, excluding black lawyers from membership,
and opposing the labor movement. The original guild was an amalgam of Roosevelt liberals, CIO
labor leaders, black civil rights lawyers, and radicals of assorted affiliations and persuasions. It
strongly supported Israel’s struggle for independence and opposed the arms embargo against the
Jewish state. Its membership over the years has included such distinguished lawyers as Thurgood
Marshall, Arthur Goldberg, Ferdinand Pecora, Paul O’Dwyer, Louis Boudin, and William Hastie.
During its early years, splits developed between the anti-Communist liberals and the radicals. But
the guild survived and accomplished much good on the domestic front, including an excellent
record of providing legal assistance to the civil-rights, labor and anti-war movements. In the late
1960s and early 1970s, at the height of the antiwar movement, the guild began to be taken over by
younger, more militant lawyers from the New Left. As George Conk, an admiring guild historian
and a former editor of the monthly Guild Notes, describes it: “At the Boulder [Colorado]
convention in 1971, the young veterans of the antiwar movement found they had the guild in their
own hands, and many older members withdrew from active membership.” Law students and
other “legal workers” were also admitted, thus strengthening the hold of the young radicals but
reducing the percentage of actual lawyers in the guild to less than half. The guild no longer
considered itself an alternative bar association but rather the prime organizer of “radical legal
people” and the legal arm of the American radical Left.
While all this was happening at home, the radical Left was beginning its campaign against
Israel. In a highly publicized speech delivered on October 19, 1973—a speech that many
people see as the original declaration of war by the radical American Left against
Israel—the Reverend Daniel Berrigan described Israel as “a criminal Jewish community”
that has committed “crimes against humanity,” has “created slaves” and has espoused a
“racist ideology” reminiscent of the Nazis, aimed at proving its “racial superiority to the
people it has crushed.” Berrigan also chastised the “Jewish people,” whom he described

take-it-or-leave-it deal by the U.S. on the 
nuclear issue is the wrong strategy  
Ray Takeyh 
February 14, 2013 -- On Feb. 26, the United States and Iran will once 
more resume their diplomatic ritual, in the so-called six-party talks, over 
Iran's disputed nuclear program. As the two perennial adversaries eye one 
another, there are competing paradigms about how to deal with Tehran. 
An emerging school of thought suggests that the best means of testing 
Iran is to offer it a final nuclear agreement that presumably promises 
measurable relief from sanctions for significant Iranian concessions. Iran's 
failure to grasp such an offer would then conclusively demonstrate to both 
domestic and international audiences that the cause of the impasse is not 
American belligerence but Iranian truculence. 
But this approach fails to recognize that an arms-control process is 
necessarily an incremental one, nor does it offer a practical substitute to 
the existing step-by-step diplomacy. 
Iran's nuclear program encompasses a vast complex of enrichment 
facilities, centrifuge construction plants, uranium extraction companies 
and thousands of scientists working in university and government 
laboratories. Iran is enriching uranium at both 5% and 20% levels, 
experimenting with high-velocity centrifuges and seemingly in the process 
of constructing additional enrichment facilities. 
Such a multilayered, multifaceted program can be dealt with only on a 
piecemeal basis, as the technical details and rules for inspections are too 
complex to be addressed in a single agreement. 
Moreover, should the United States offer Iran a final deal, Tehran still has 
a right to contest and negotiate its provisions and offer counterproposals. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028648 
The international community is unlikely to concede to either more 
sanctions or the use of force until Iran's objections are taken into full 
consideration. As such, a grand deal that is supposed to provoke a moment 
of clarity is likely to be enmeshed in the existing, protracted arms-control 
process. 
Another complication is the advent of public opinion and critical 
constituencies in Iran devoted to the perpetuation of the program. The 
growing public sentiment is that Iran has a right to acquire a nuclear 
capability. As the program matures, it is becoming a source of pride for a 
citizenry accustomed to the revolution's setbacks and failures. 
Also emerging is a bureaucratic and scientific establishment with its own 
parochial considerations for sustaining the nuclear investment. A clerical 
leadership that is dealing with a restive population and empowered 
security services cannot easily dispense with its nuclear trump card. 
All this suggests that the best means of addressing Iran's nuclear challenge 
is to mitigate its most dangerous dimensions. The focus should remain on 
Iran's high-grade enrichment and its underground nuclear facility nestled 
in mountains outside Qom. Tehran seems to have conceived an ingenious 
path to nuclear advancement, one that involves increasing the size and 
sophistication of its civilian atomic apparatus to the point where it can 
quickly surge into a bomb. While staying within the rules of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency's inspection process, Iran is 
essentially expanding its capabilities while shielding them under the 
veneer of legality. Given the fact that much of civilian nuclear technology 
can easily be misappropriated for military purposes, Iran can construct an 
elaborate nuclear infrastructure while remaining within IAEA guidelines. 
The diplomatic challenge is to derail this path to a nuclear weapon by 
imposing significant restraints on its program. And this can still be done 
through a process that proceeds incrementally and sequentially. 
U.S. officials would be wise to get out of the crisis mode and put some 
time back on the clock. The Iran issue always seems urgent, and yet 
somehow there is always time to deal with it. Washington should 
acknowledge the obvious, namely, that given Iran's gradualist approach, it 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028649 
is still years from completing an efficient enrichment infrastructure, 
constructing a nuclear arsenal and developing a reliable means of delivery. 
By agreeing to a compressed timeline, the U.S. only narrows its options 
and makes a solution even more elusive. 
As the United States again contemplates its Iran conundrum, it should 
eschew calls for a take-it-or-leave-it deal. The history of Iran's 
confrontation with the international community suggests that keeping it a 
crisis situation benefits the Islamic Republic. Ironically, it is the Western 
powers that have generated alarmist conditions. And then to escape the 
predicament of their own making, they offer Iran more concessions and 
further incentives. 
To avoid a repeat of that outcome, it would be prudent to have a sense of 
proportionality and appreciate that, in the end, time works best for the 
United States and not the economically beleaguered theocracy.

Whether it's North Korea or Iran, sanctions  
won't work

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028650 
North Korea has  set off a third nuclear test explosion. It has done so in 
defiance of the UN, America, Japan and even, reportedly, its sponsor, 
China. It has said to hell with everyone, in a brutal comment on western 
economic sanctions. 
The UN security council met yesterday and Washington threatened 
significant consequences — code nowadays for tighter sanctions. Every 
shred of evidence suggests that these will not achieve the declared goal. 
They will merely add to the impoverishment of North Korea's people by 
its own government. Sanctions are the most counter-productive tool 
known to diplomacy. Yet we keep imposing them. Why? 
Sanctions assume that all countries react to external pressure as might a 
capitalist democracy. They assume a misguided regime will change its 
mind and put financial advantage above its definition of national interest. 
Smart sanctions (really dumb sanctions) further assume the rich can be 
punished without punishing the poor, and that all dictators' wives want to 
fly abroad and shop at Harrods. They assume that trade guides political 
action and political action trumps dictatorship. 
Economic sanctions are hugely popular to western politicians, not because 
of their effect but because of their cause: the desire to stand on an 
international stage and being seen to do something. They are the least-
cost first resort of the laptop bombardiers of global intervention. They 
sound punitive and aggressive without inflicting any hardship on the 
imposer. 
After North Korea the other target in the sanctions frame is Iran. 
Everything at present suggests that ever-tighter sanctions have done 
nothing to curb Iran's nuclear programme. Indeed, by inducing paranoia, 
probably the reverse. Sanctions have certainly bitten, to the glee of their 
advocates. They have brought inflation and a collapse in the currency, the 
rial. They have harmed ordinary people and solidified sentiment against 
the west and the great Satan of the US. Assassination and cyber-
weapons have wiped out a few scientists and scrambled a few computers. 
What sanctions have not done is weakened the power of the ayatollahs or 
their private army, the Revolutionary Guards. Both seem as secure as ever, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028651 
while (relatively) moderate civilian politicians are reduced to feuding and 
arresting each others' children. Iran's nuclear programme appears to 
proceed independent even of the organs of its own state. 
A spoof article in the Economist last year portrayed Iran's supreme leader, 
Ayatollah Khamenei, ruminating on western nations' obsessive posturing 
towards his country. He mused that these were unstable, unreliable places, 
dangerous though probably not all mad. But since it was hard to be sure, I 
would feel a lot safer if we already had that bomb. Similar insecurity 
drove sanctioned Cuba to accept Russian missiles in the 1960s, and 
sanctioned Iraq and Libya to pretend to build weapons of mass destruction 
in the 1990s. 
Sanctions never stop bad things happening. Rather they entrench dictators, 
build up siege economies and debilitate the urban middle class from which 
opposition to dictatorship grows. As Khamenei said in a speech a year  
ago, sanctions were painful ... but make us more self-reliant. Indeed, for 
a regime to be sanctioned is to receive an elixir: witness Castro, Gaddafi, 
the ayatollahs and the ruling cliques of Burma, Afghanistan and North 
Korea. That sanctioned regimes sometimes come to an end is not proof 
that sanctions work, rather that they take a long time and usually require 
war to work. 
This is a rarely researched topic because sanctions are diplomatic ideology 
rather than science. A debate in 1998 in International Security magazine  
saw the Chicago academic, Robert Pape, barely challenged in his view 
that only around five of the 115 cases of sanctions imposed since the war 
could claim any plausible efficacy. Most merely inflicted significant 
human costs on the populations of target states, including on innocent 
civilians who have little influence on their government's behaviour. They 
are a ready invitation to war. 
When I was reporting on South Africa in the 1980s I became convinced 
that sanctions were aiding import substitution and benefiting the Afrikaner 
economy, probably giving apartheid an extra decade of life. They likewise 
prolonged Ian Smith's regime in Rhodesia. Sanctions made Libya's 
Gaddafi so rich he could spoon money into the London School of 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028652 
Economics. They made Saddam Hussein one of the 10 wealthiest people 
in the world. Besides, sanctions create sanctions-busting which, like drugs, 
is a global criminal industry born entirely of the idiocy of western 
diplomacy. 
A year ago the  Foreign Office defended yet another round of sanctions  
against Tehran on the grounds they would hasten Iran's economic 
collapse and deepen rifts within the regime, in the hope that saner voices 
will deem the price of pursuing nuclear weapons too high. Economies 
don't collapse, any more than poverty changes governments. Even Greece, 
now the most sanctioned nation in Europe, has not collapsed. Places just 
get poorer. As for saner voices, they go into exile, hiding or prison. 
That's where sanctions send them. 
Iran is a proud nation of 80 million mostly Muslim people, one of many 
Asian and African states struggling between theocracy and democracy, 
tradition and modernity. These are agonising struggles among and within 
peoples, to which the west has contributed nothing but hostility and 
belligerence. Under the cloak of counter-terror, it has been as crass as it 
was during the Crusades. Of course no one wants to see nuclear weapons 
spread. Russia tried to stop China getting them. China tried to stop North 
Korea. The west tried to stop India and Pakistan, while hypocritically 
tolerating Israel and the replenished arsenals of France and Britain. No 
pressure made the slightest difference to anyone. 
If Iran really wants a nuclear weapon, it will get one — the more so when it 
is threatened with dire retribution if it does. That is how such states react 
to pressure. Ever since the dodgy election of 2009, threats and sanctions 
have not weakened the regime's determination to proceed, but rather 
weakened opposition to it. If ever there was a country unlikely to respond 
to diplomatic bullying, it is Iran. If ever there was a country that might 
respond to constructive engagement, to commercial, governmental and 
cultural intercourse, it is also Iran. Why the west should want to make it 
another North Korea passes comprehension.

The Washington Institute 
Year of Decision: U.S. Policy toward Iran in  
2013 
James F. Jeffrey and Thomas Pickering  
February 12, 2013 -- On February 7, 2013, James F. Jeffrey and Thomas 
Pickering addressed a Policy Forum at The Washington Institute. 
Ambassador Jeffrey, a former assistant to the president and deputy 
national security advisor, is author of the new Institute study Moving to  
Decision: U.S. Policy toward Iran. Ambassador Pickering served in 
numerous key posts at home and abroad over a five-decade career, 
including undersecretary of state for political affairs. The following is a 
rapporteur's summary of their remarks. 
JAMES F. JEFFREY 
The move to decision on Iran is the most pressing and dangerous issue on 
the U.S. and international agenda in 2013. The year ahead will largely 
define the longstanding struggle between Washington and Tehran, and the 
considerable stakes involved make it absolutely crucial that a swift and 
decisive resolution be achieved. Regardless of the outcome of the nuclear 
issue, however, Iran will continue to present a long-term challenge to the 
United States because of clashing ideologies, conflicting foreign policy 
goals, and Iran's claim to regional hegemony. 
There are four likely outcomes to the nuclear issue: a unilateral Iranian 
decision to halt or dramatically slow its progress toward a nuclear weapon; 
a negotiated outcome, whether through the P5+1 (i.e., the five permanent 
members of the UN Security Council plus Germany) or bilateral 
negotiations; a military strike, as threatened by President Obama and 
Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu, and an explicit or implicit 
shift to containment, indicating that Washington would be prepared to 
coexist with a nuclear-armed Iran. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028654 
The most effective resolution would be a negotiated outcome -- to achieve 
it, Washington will need to take preliminary steps on several fronts. A 
serious compromise needs to be put on the table, including an offer to 
suspend crippling oil sanctions in return for specific, verifiable Iranian 
steps to eliminate any nuclear breakout capabilities. Equally significant is 
establishing a credible military threat, given that Tehran has been willing 
to endure increasing economic pressure in order to continue its nuclear 
program. The regime is unlikely to concede anything during negotiations 
if it does not believe that Washington will actually follow through on such 
threats. Although specific public redlines are often unpalatable, the Obama 
administration must clarify internally when it would take military steps, 
and these intentions must be made clear to the Iranians. 
In the same vein, the military option requires a credible negotiating 
complement, as seen in the early 1990s with Iraq. To legitimize military 
action against Saddam Hussein's regime, Washington had to prove that all 
other options had been exhausted. Similarly, the only way to set the 
predicate for military action against Iran is to show the regime and the 
international community that everything has been tried, and that 
Washington has left Tehran with a way out. Failure to do so would 
undermine the legitimacy of any strikes. 
It is also important to understand that curtailing Iran's nuclear progress 
will not by itself alter the regime's regional agenda -- nuclear ambitions 
are but an extension of Tehran's wider aspirations toward hegemony in the 
Middle East. Unfortunately, none of the longer-term proposals for 
addressing that issue seem feasible at the moment (e.g., regime change by 
internal or external means; a shift in Tehran's views on the Supreme 
Leader and succession; a grand deal between Washington, Iran, and the 
international community). 
One lesson to be learned from past interactions with Tehran (or lack 
thereof) is that when the United States proactively opposes Iranian 
aggression in the Middle East, the regime relents, but when Washington 
offers a more passive response, Iranian aggression increases. With respect 
to Syria, for example, it cannot be assumed that Bashar al-Assad will fall 
at all, let alone quickly, without active U.S. engagement. If the Assad 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028655 
regime does in fact survive, Iran would become increasingly emboldened, 
with potentially disastrous consequences for the United States and its 
allies and interests in the Middle East. 
Denuding U.S. forces in the region to enable a pivot to Asia is also risky. 
Nowhere else in the world is America more likely to deploy forces than in 
the Persian Gulf in opposition to Iran, and nowhere else is it of utmost 
importance that any potential confrontation be won decisively in the next 
five to ten years than with the Islamic Republic. 
Going forward, Washington must discriminate between Iranian behaviors 
it considers unacceptable -- such as support for terrorism, hegemonic 
ambitions, and progress toward nuclear weapons -- and those it can 
tolerate. U.S. officials could open the door for negotiations by making 
clear to Tehran that they do not seek regime change; the first step in that 
regard would be to let Iran know that Washington respects it as a nation-
state and not a transnational revolutionary movement. 
Finally, disorganization within the U.S. government and a go it alone 
mentality have accounted for many of Washington's internal difficulties in 
responding to the Iranian challenge. To alleviate this problem, all cabinet-
level officials must be in constant and complete coordination, devoid of 
routine bureaucratic obstacles. In addition, the appointment of a senior 
subcabinet official whose sole responsibility is Iran (or, alternatively, a 
small group of officials in constant coordination) could allow the 
administration to reorganize bureaucratically in preparation for this year of 
decision. 
THOMAS PICKERING 
Discussions of containment policy typically imply accepting the Islamic 
Republic as an inevitable nuclear power and using deterrence to deal with 
a nuclear-armed Iran. Yet such an outcome would be disastrous for U.S. 
nonproliferation policy, which is based on the notion that fewer nuclear 
states means less chance of miscalculated use. If Iran attains a nuclear 
weapon, other regional powers would likely follow suit -- clearly an 
undesirable outcome for the international community. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028656 
At the other end of the spectrum, using military means in the short term to 
guarantee prevention would entail a vast use of force -- essentially an 
unofficial, semipermanent occupation of Iran. This is not a viable path, 
particularly since other diplomatic possibilities have not yet been 
exhausted. 
Similarly, sanctions, while effective, are not sufficient by themselves. 
They must be intertwined with negotiations -- as Washington and its allies 
increase the pressure, cohesive and meaningful talks with equivalent 
concessions should follow suit. Some have argued that negotiations should 
expand to a big for big format, but decades of mistrust between the 
United States and Iran make smaller deals more practical. Such an 
approach would have to focus on ending Iran's most problematic 
enrichment activity: processing uranium to the 20 percent threshold, which 
makes the leap to weapons-grade material much easier. Instead, the regime 
could limit itself to 5 percent enrichment, and under strict supervision by 
the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
The intelligence community widely believes that although Iran has not yet 
decided to make a nuclear weapon, it is still moving to acquire all the 
necessary capabilities in case it chooses that path. Accordingly, 
Washington will need to obtain a concrete Iranian commitment to convert 
its stocks of readily upgradeable gaseous uranium into metallic fuel 
elements, which pose significantly less of a threat. A serious inspection 
system would need to be implemented in order to monitor these 
requirements. In return, the Iranians would expect the lifting of nuclear-
related sanctions. They would also likely ask for acknowledgement that 
they have the right to continue their civil enrichment program, whether for 
supposed use in cancer treatment or to safeguard against a potential 
Russian decision to cease fueling the Bushehr reactor. 
Thus far, President Obama has been frustrated at the lack of progress in 
response to his openness toward the Iranian regime, and his new cabinet 
has an obligation to help him solidify a negotiating position that improves 
the situation. If the Iranians continue to reject U.S. positions that 
seemingly respond to some of their demands, then the administration 
should begin applying other pressures. These steps should be taken sooner 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028657 
rather than later so that the parties can move toward a mutually acceptable 
conclusion. 
Washington must also keep in mind that Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei 
has the last word on all matters in Iran, and that negotiations will go only 
as far as he allows them to go. In years past, he issued a fatwa condemning 
nuclear weapons -- Washington could take advantage of this fact by 
drafting a UN Security Council resolution endorsing the fatwa. This could 
be a small step toward boosting Khamenei's international profile while 
simultaneously pressuring Iran to follow its own religious decree. 
To be sure, regime change remains an attractive alternative on paper, and 
some in Washington view it as an insurance policy. Historically, however, 
regime change has not been a successful option for the United States, and 
internal attempts at toppling Iran's leadership have thus far been crushed 
by Stalinesque suppression, including the 2009 uprising. Despite such 
failures and Washington's limited influence in Iranian domestic affairs, 
U.S. policy should be to demonstratively support popular democratic 
movements.

TIME 
Spy Fail: Why Iran Is Losing Its Covert War  
with Israel  
Karl Vick 
Feb. 13, 2013 -- Slumped in a Nairobi courtroom, suit coats rumpled and 
reading glasses dangling from librarian chains, the defendants made a poor 
showing for the notorious Quds Force of the elite Iranian Revolutionary 
Guard Corps. Ahmad Abolafathi Mohammed and Sayed Mansour Mousa 
had been caught red-handed and middle-aged. And if the latter did them a 
certain credit — blandly forgettable always having been a good look for a 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028658 
secret agent — the prisoners still had to explain why they had hidden 15 
kg of the military explosive RDX under bushes on a Mombasa golf 
course. 
Created to advance Iran's interests clandestinely overseas, the Quds Force 
has lately provided mostly embarrassment, stumbling in Azerbaijan, 
Georgia, India, Kenya and most spectacularly in Thailand, where before 
accidentally blowing up their Bangkok safe house, Iran's secret agents  
were photographed in the sex-tourism mecca of Pattaya, one arm around a 
hookah, the other around a hooker. In its ongoing shadow war with Israel, 
the Iranian side's lone success was the July 18 bombing of a Bulgarian 
bus carrying Israeli tourists — though European investigators last week 
officially attributed that attack to Iran's Lebanese proxy, Hizballah. That 
leaves the Islamic Republic itself with a failure rate hovering near 100% 
abroad and an operational tempo — nine overseas plots uncovered in nine 
months — that carries a whiff of desperation. A Tehran government long 
branded by U.S. officials as the globe's leading exporter of terrorism may 
be cornering the market on haplessness. 
Within Iran's own borders, however, the story is different. Twice in the 
past two years Iranian intelligence has cracked espionage rings working 
with Israel's Mossad, Western intelligence officials tell TIME. In both 
cases, the arrests were the furthest thing from secret: announced at a news 
conference, each was later followed up by televised confessions broadcast 
on Iranian state television in prime time. Given Iran's history of trumped-
up confessions, skepticism is more than justified. But the arrests appear to 
be solid. One intelligence official said the captured Iranians provided 
support and logistics to the Mossad operatives who carried out the 
assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists. 
At least four scientists were killed on Tehran's streets from 2010 to 2012, 
when, as TIME has reported, Israel ratcheted back on covert operations 
inside Iran. Officially, Israel has remained silent on the killings, though 
government officials will coyly say they welcome the deaths. The Jewish 
state maintains the same ambiguous posture on other setbacks to Iran's 
nuclear program widely — and correctly, Western intelligence officials 
say — attributed to Mossad, from the Stuxnet computer virus, to 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028659 
mysterious explosions like the massive blast at a missile base, which 
destroyed ballistic missiles that could reach Israel. 
The covert onslaught dovetails with Israel's history of reaching over the 
horizon to disarm perceived threats at a distance. To keep advanced arms 
from reaching Hamas and Hizballah, Israel in the past year sent warplanes 
to bomb convoys and arms depots in Sudan and Syria, respectively, 
without apparent retribution. In the case of Iran, however, experts say the 
audacity of Israel's covert campaign stirred Tehran to revive an espionage 
effort that lay largely fallow since 9/11. The Spy vs. Spy contest that 
ensued would prove woefully one-sided, even in the third-world countries 
where Iran chose to strike, hoping to avoid heightened security awareness 
in the developed world. In the end, its only success came inside Iran, 
where the secret police operate without inhibition. 
The shadow war may have started on Jan. 15, 2007, the day Ardeshir 
Hosseinpour passed away. Hosseinpour was a specialist in 
electromagnetics at the Nuclear Technology Center in the city of Isfahan, 
Iran, but his death might have escaped notice had Iran's government not 
kept it under wraps for almost a week, finally attributing it to fumes from 
a faulty heater. An online report by the American private intelligence firm 
Stratfor suggested another cause — radioactive poisoning — and hinted 
that Mossad's Caesarea section was back in business. Caesarea, named for 
an Israeli beach town that dates back to Roman times, is the operations 
branch of Israel's secret service, most notoriously responsible for the 
assassinations of some two dozen Palestinians (and an innocent waiter) 
after the 1972 Munich Olympics. Assassinations are carried out by a very 
small unit dubbed Kidon, the Hebrew word for tip of the spear. Kidon 
operates at a remove from the legions of Mossad employees working in 
less lethal fields. 
It would have been a unit called Hatzomet, or The Junction, that 
recruited Majid Fashi, a handsome young Iranian who dropped out of high 
school to pursue a career in kickboxing. By the account he gave on Iranian 
state television early in 2011, Fashi presented himself at the Israeli 
consulate in Istanbul in 2007 and was vetted for a solid year before being 
shown any trust. Two years later, on Jan. 12, 2010, he would place a bomb 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028660 
on a motorbike parked on the sidewalk outside the Tehran home of 
Masoud Alimohammadi, the nuclear physicist was killed when it was 
detonated by remote control. 
In the broadcast, Fashi accurately described the Mossad campus north of 
Tel Aviv. He said he had been given a laptop equipped with a second 
operating system and used it to communicate through online drop boxes. 
He was impressed by his handlers' thoroughness. At one point Fashi 
described studying a scale model of Alimohammadi's street. It was an 
exact copy of the real one, Fashi said. The tree next it, the street curb, 
the bridge. In a later broadcast, he was seated across from 
Alimohammadi's widow, who glared at him as he bowed his head and 
wept. Mossad officials were pissed off and shocked seeing their agent 
on television, the intelligence official said. 
Fashi was executed in May 2012. About the same time, Iran's intelligence 
minister announced the arrest of 14 more Iranians, eight men and six 
women dubbed members of the Terror Club in the subsequent  prime-
time broadcast of that name. Filmed in shadow, and rich in atmospherics, 
the Aug. 5 program recreated Alimohammadi's death and four subsequent 
attacks: they started with the Nov. 29, 2010 nearly simultaneous attempts 
on Majid Shariari and Fereydoun Abbasi, nuclear scientists driving to 
work when magnetic sticky bombs were attached to the side of their cars 
from passing motorcycles. Abbasi managed to escape before it detonated, 
saving his wife as well. Shariari was killed — a significant setback for the 
Iranian nuclear program where he was the top scientist, according to a 
Western intelligence official. 
The confessed agents offered absorbing detail — they were aboard a Bajaj 
Pulsar, wearing helmets, when the magnet bomb stuck on the right front 
panel of Shariari's car exploded. The riders scrambled into the trail car 
assigned to follow the target and disappeared into the traffic of the Imam 
Ali Autobahn. Already gone was the car assigned to cut off and slow the 
car carrying the scientist. They claimed to have rehearsed on a practice 
track inside Israel. None of the details could be confirmed, but an 
intelligence official acknowledged: Another network was taken. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028661 
The third scientist, Dariush Rezaeinejad was shot on July 23, 2011 after 
picking up his child at a day care; his wife described hearing shots whiz by 
as she chased the assailants. The most recent assassination was the Jan. 11, 
2012 death of Mustafa Ahmadi-Roshan, an expert on uranium enrichment, 
also by a magnet bomb slapped on his car during his morning commute. 
By then, Iran was trying to strike back. The task of avenging the scientists 
fell to the sprawling Quds Force's own covert-operations division, known 
as Unit 400. It took a shotgun approach, targeting Israeli diplomatic 
missions in a variety of countries, mostly in the developing world where 
the global antiterrorism mesh is not so fine. Exposed in Baku, Tbilisi, 
Johannesburg, Mombasa and Bangkok, the failures mounted at a pace that 
was itself one of the problems. In the world of espionage, a quality covert 
operation can take years to pull together. Yet in the 15 months from May 
2011 to July 2012, the Quds Force and Hizballah attempted 20 attacks, by 
the count of Matthew Levitt, a former State Department counterterrorism 
official. Hizballah and the Quds Force traded speed for tradecraft and 
reaped what they sowed, Levitt writes in a January report for the 
Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Quds Force planners were 
stretched thin by the rapid tempo of their new attack plan, and were forced 
to throw together random teams of operatives who had not trained 
together. 
The decline in quality was so striking it initially inspired disbelief Recall 
the preposterous-sounding plot weaving together a former used-car 
salesman, Mexico's Zetas drug gang and a bank transfer from a 
Revolutionary Guard account to assassinate Saudi Arabia's ambassador — 
by bombing a Washington restaurant? A year on it looks like the new 
normal. In Bangkok last month, an Iranian agent entered a courtroom in a 
wheelchair, having accidentally blown his legs off while fleeing police. A 
January alert issued by Turkish intelligence was light on specifics but 
quite certain the Quds operatives would be staying in five-star hotels. 
There's a number of reasons that Iranian intelligence has suffered, says 
Meir Javedanfar, an Iranian-born analyst who lectures at the 
Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya, Israel. No. 1, he says, is the 2009 
uprisings in Iran. The street protests over a fraudulent election 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028662 
undermined the perceived legitimacy of the state among people who once 
would work for it, including in its secret services. People less and less see 
it as a nationalist endeavor and more as a Khamenei-related project to 
strengthen himself, Javedanfar says, referring to Iran's Supreme Leader 
Ayatullah Ali Khamenei, who by some published accounts personally 
authorizes all overseas attacks. 
Hard-liners further aggravated the situation by purging competent 
reformists from both the secret services and from Iran's embassies — 
crucial to a force expected to work undetected abroad. Basically the Quds 
Force doesn't cooperate with the Foreign Ministry, and the Foreign 
Ministry isn't what it used to be either, says Javedanfar. Under President 
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, 42% of ministry employees have only high 
school degrees. The regime is a bigger threat to itself than Israel, he 
says.

Is the US Ready To Be Number Two?  
Kishore Mahbubani 
11 February 2013 -- SINGAPORE: Long before anyone did, former US 
president Bill Clinton saw that America would have to prepare for the time 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028663 
when it would no longer be the number one power in the world. In his 
2003 Yale University address on Global Challenges, he said: 
If you believe that maintaining power and control and absolute freedom of 
movement and sovereignty is important to your country's future, there's 
nothing inconsistent in that [the US continuing to behaving unilaterally]. 
[The US is] the biggest, most powerful country in the world now. . . . But 
if you believe that we should be trying to create a world with rules and 
partnerships and habits of behavior that we would like to live in when 
we're no longer the military political economic superpower in the world, 
then you wouldn't do that. It just depends on what you believe. 
Long before 2003, Clinton wanted to begin preparing Americans for this 
new world. Clinton believed [...] what we had in the wake of the cold 
war was a multilateral moment — an opportunity to shape the world 
through our active leadership of the institutions Clinton admired and 
[Charles] Krauthammer disdained, writes Strobe Talbott, former deputy 
secretary of state in his book The Great Experiment: The Story of Ancient 
Empires, Modern States, and the Quest for a Global Nation. But Clinton 
kept that belief largely to himself while he was in office.... political 
instincts told him it would be inviting trouble to suggest that the sun 
would someday set on American preeminence. Sadly, few Americans 
have heeded Clinton's wisdom. Few dare to mention that America could 
well be number two. I discovered this when I chaired a panel on the 
future of American power at the 2012 World Economic Forum in Davos. 
After citing projections that America would have the second largest 
economy in just a few years, I asked the American panelists — two 
senators, a congresswoman and a former deputy national security advisor 
— whether Americans are ready to become number two. To my shock, 
none could acknowledge publically this possibility. 
America may well become number two faster than anyone has anticipated. 
According to the most recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) 
projections, China will have larger share of global GDP than the United

America becomes number two, we will still have a better world. In many 
ways, the world is converging to American values and standards, as I 
explain in The Great Convergence. The global middle class is booming, 
interstate war is waning, and never before have people traveled and 
communicated across the world so easily. These changes are creating 
common values and norms across the world. Education and scientific 
reasoning, for example, are enabling people the world over to speak with a 
common language. However, while humanity is well on its way to 
combating absolute poverty and interstate warfare, other problems are 
surfacing. Preventing and curtailing transnational issues like climate 
change, human and drug trafficking, and financial crises require 
cooperation among nation states, yet this is not happening. A simple 
analogy illustrates this. Before the era of modern globalization, 
humankind was like a flotilla of more than 100 separate boats in their 
separate countries. The world needed a set of rules then to ensure that the 
many boats did not collide and facilitate their cooperation on the high seas 
if they chose to do so. The 1945 rules-based order strived to do this, and 
despite some obvious failures, it succeeded in producing a relatively stable 
global order for more than 50 years. Today, the 7 billion people who 
inhabit planet earth no longer live in more than 100 separate boats. 
Instead, they live in 193 separate cabins on the same boat. But this boat 
has a problem. It has 193 captains and crews, each claiming exclusive 
responsibility for one cabin. No captain or crew cares for the boat as a 
whole. The world is now sailing into increasingly turbulent waters with no 
captain or crew at the helm. The Great Convergence echoes the themes 
of Clinton's 2003 Yale speech. It's in the interest of all — particularly great 
powers — to strengthen institutions of global governance so that we're not 
sailing blindly into choppy waters without a captain. The National 
Intelligence Council recently projected that in 2030 Asia would overtake 
the Western world economically, technologically and militarily. When 
China becomes a world superpower in a matter of decades, the United 
States and Europe will want to ensure that China plays by the rules. 
But in order to make international organizations like the United Nations, 
the IMF and the World Bank more credible and effective, they must 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028665 
undergo serious reform. It is manifestly absurd that the West makes up 12 
percent of the world's population but takes up 60 percent of UN Security 
Council permanent seats. It's nonsensical that the head of the IMF is 
always a European and the head of the World Bank is always an American 
as the West's share of global GDP diminishes every year. This 
concentration of clout in the hands of a relative few has grave implications 
for these institutions' effectiveness and independence, making them 
instruments of the West. No other organization, not even huge global 
NGOs like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation or the Clinton 
Foundation, has the scope and legitimacy that the UN currently enjoys. 
For example, the United States for years has been trying to pressure China 
to take a more proactive role in fighting climate change. Predictably, 
China has resisted these pressures because they saw them as a clever yet 
transparent American ruse to curtail Chinese economic growth. Only when 
the United Nations Development Programme raised the issue with China 
did the Chinese government take heed, as the UNDP is seen as a neutral 
party in China. The UN and its many agencies may soon lose invaluable 
credibility if the West insists on monopolizing its power over these 
institutions. 
Any reform of the UN should take into account three principles: 
democracy, recognition of power balances and the rule of law. Institutions 
of global governance can be made more democratic by ensuring that their 
leadership accurately reflects the composition of world's population. At 
the same time, we must also take into account geopolitical relationships 
among emerging and middle powers. Finally, the rule of law is essential to 
the mediation and resolution of thorny international issues and to 
governing the conduct of states on the international stage so as to prevent 
escalation of conflict. 
In this rapidly changing world, it's a mistake to allow institutions of global 
governance to stay as they are. The 1945 rules-based order is no longer 
appropriate for 21st century circumstances. Global leaders must better 
prepare us for the challenges to come and equip our international 
organizations to deal with them. Leaders must find the courage to continue 
advocating for stronger multilateral cooperation. It is time for our captains

and crews to emerge from their cabins and start steering the boat.

Pyongyang's Nuclear Logic  
Jennifer Lind, Keir A. Lieber, and Daryl G. Press 
February 14, 2013 -- In his State of the Union address, U.S. President 
Barack Obama described North Korea's recent nuclear test as a 
provocation that required a firm response. The intended audience for that 
provocation, though, is up for debate. Some commentators have posited 
that the test was a signal aimed at China, designed to demonstrate North 
Korea's independence from its great-power patron. Others think that Kim 
Jong-un was sending a message to the newly elected president of South 
Korea, Park Geun-hye. Still other North Korea experts have suggested that 
the test was actually meant for domestic consumption, to lift the sagging 
morale of a deprived public or for the regime to curry favor with the 
military. The intended North Korean signal is being analyzed and debated 
by U.S. government officials, who hold views across the spectrum. 
A much simpler explanation exists. Pyongyang tested a nuclear device for 
the same reason it has been testing long-range missile designs: to see what 
works. In truth, the effort was less a signal than an attempt to master the 
technical capabilities that are vital to its nuclear deterrent. 
This rationale should come as no surprise to those steeped in Cold War 
history. Between 1945 and 1992, the United States conducted 1,054 
nuclear tests and fired an untold number of missiles. If the goal had merely 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028667 
been to show the Soviets that the United States meant business, testing 
nearly twice a month throughout the entire Cold War would have been 
overkill. In fact, Operation Sandstone -- a series of three tests at Enewetak 
Atoll in 1948 -- was not intended to warn off the Soviets as tensions rose 
over Berlin. Nor was the series of 48 underground tests launched in the 
summer of 1964 designed to impress the newly installed premier, Leonid 
Brezhnev. And the United States would not have conducted a dozen 
atomic blasts at its Nevada test site in the first half of 1977 -- including the 
Cove, Dofino, Marsilly, Bulkhead, Crewline, Forefoot, Carnelian, Strake, 
Flotost, Gruyere, Scantling, and Scupper detonations -- just because new 
President Jimmy Carter was vulnerable to right-wing criticism. 
The United States did what it did because it needed its ultimate deterrent 
to actually work, and because the technical requirements of the nuclear 
mission continually changed. The ruins of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were 
evidence enough that the United States could destroy cities, but deterring 
the Soviet Union was a far greater challenge. If the Soviets had invaded 
Western Europe, for example, U.S. bombers would have had to penetrate 
alerted Soviet air defenses, identify Soviet ground forces and industrial 
centers, and attack them. Accordingly, U.S. bombers had to be highly 
maneuverable and able to carry multiple weapons, so the bombs 
themselves had to be lighter and smaller than the ones the United States 
used against Japan. The Soviets put another wrinkle in Washington's plans 
when they began to deploy large numbers of their own nuclear weapons. 
The United States needed to find a way to potentially destroy the Soviet 
arsenal on the ground. Eliminating those targets -- numerous and often 
hardened -- required even greater numbers of bombs, even lighter designs, 
and more accurate delivery systems. So the United States updated its 
designs and tested. And tested. And tested again. 
Like the United States during the Cold War, North Korea has apparently 
decided that nuclear weapons are central to its national security strategy. 
With few friends, its conventional military forces outgunned, an economy 
in tatters, and facing off against a superpower prone to deposing 
dictatorships across the globe, the Kim regime set about building an 
operational nuclear arsenal. And just as NATO planned to thwart a Soviet 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028668 
invasion by striking targets in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, North 
Korea presumably plans to defend itself, should war erupt on the 
peninsula, by threatening U.S. regional allies and targets in the United 
States. 
North Korea's mission requires small, lightweight warheads, and missiles 
that work -- and the only way to know that they work is to test them. So 
far, the weapons have proved unspectacular. The country's first nuclear 
test, conducted in 2006, was an embarrassment. Pyongyang had told the 
Chinese that the device would generate four kilotons of explosive power, 
but it ended up producing less than one. The second test in 2009 fared 
slightly better, producing between one and eight kilotons, although it is 
not known what size of a blast the North Koreans had sought. Moreover, 
Pyongyang has much more work to do before it can boast weapons that 
will actually fit on its missiles (which have been, themselves, a series of 
humiliating failures). 
Observers in the West who presume that North Korea's behavior must be 
about signaling should remember NATO and the United States' own 
experience during the Cold War. The United States understood then that 
the ability to conduct nuclear operations was the very foundation of a 
credible deterrence strategy. Today, a sound strategy for dealing with 
North Korea should not ascribe ulterior motives to acts that the United 
States once considered rational and routine. 
The view that nuclear weapons are merely political instruments -- suitable 
for sending signals, but not waging wars -- is now so common in 
Washington, London, and Berlin that it is hard to find anyone who 
disagrees. Yet those comforting assumptions are not shared by leaders 
everywhere. Beyond North Korea, Russia is cutting down its arsenal, 
modernizing the nuclear forces it plans to keep, and increasing its reliance 
on nuclear weapons in national defense strategy. China is slowly 
expanding its own arsenal, while substantially improving its weapons. 
And Iran seems so committed to going nuclear that it has been ready to 
endure crippling sanctions and risk foreign attack. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028669 
It is unfortunate that U.S. policymakers are so convinced of nuclear 
obsolescence that they have difficulty understanding the motivations of 
potential adversaries. It would be tragic, however, if their questionable 
assumptions prevent them from recognizing the deterrence problems that 
lie ahead and the grave difficulties that will be posed by adversaries, such 
as North Korea, that still cling to nuclear weapons.

The Depths of Malaise in Palestine  
Daniel DePetris 
February 12, 2013 -- When talking about peace in Israel-Palestine, it is 
easy to narrow the conversation to the leaders who are responsible for 
making it. Over the past few years, there have been numerous profiles in 
newspapers and profiles in magazines attempting to document the two 
men who are supposed to make the effort—Israeli Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud 
Abbas. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028670 
Delving into the lives and minds of world leaders is an undoubtedly 
helpful, exciting, and informative way to find answers, but a conflict as 
multifaceted and complicated as the Israeli-Palestinian dispute cannot be 
fully explained without taking into account the opinions of the ordinary 
people who live the reality every single day. Millions of Israelis and 
Palestinians on both sides of the green line have had their voices drowned 
out by the very politicians, lawmakers, and personalities who purport to 
represent them. 
The result is a host of unanswered questions. What does the average 
Israeli or Palestinian think about the chances for a lasting and 
comprehensive peace agreement? What types of concessions need to be 
given for a deal to be struck? Do Israelis have the political courage to 
sacrifice on settlements and Jerusalem so the conflict can finally be 
resolved? Can the Palestinians negotiate in good faith? 
Luckily, polling organizations in Israel and Palestine have spent years 
trying to answer these very questions, often working together and sharing 
their resources during the hunt. 
Two of the latest polls, one from the Jerusalem Media and 
Communications Center (JMCC) and the other from the Palestinian Center 
for Policy and Survey Research (PCPSR), are particularly telling. Unlike 
other surveys that confirm what most in the international community 
already think, the results of these polls are unprecedented, revealing a 
stark and disturbing malaise in the Palestinian territories. 
The message is clear: frustration with the conflict is at a high point, the 
two-state solution is steadily losing credibility in the eyes of the people, 
and ordinary citizens in the Holy Land are starting to wonder whether a 
settlement can be achieved without another round of bloodshed. 
Oslo Fatigue 
When asked by the PSPSR whether Mahmoud Abbas's policy of peace 
talks or armed resistance by Hamas is the best way to achieve a 
Palestinian state, an alarming 60 percent of Palestinians surveyed threw in 
their lot with armed resistance (compared to 28 percent who favored 
negotiations). With the eight-day Israel-Hamas war having ended with a 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028671 
ceasefire that many view as a victory for the Islamist group, Hamas Prime 
Minister Ismail Haniyeh finds his popularity having soared. Forty-eight 
percent of Palestinians say that they would rather pick Haniyeh as 
Palestine's next president instead of Abbas, who has struggled to secure 
the freedom of movement and self-determination that so many 
Palestinians once expected from his government. 
The JMCC issued similar findings. By far the most disturbing figure in the 
poll is the exponential rise in support among the Palestinian public for 
armed operations against Israel-50.9 percent now view attacking Israeli 
positions in the current climate as a credible way to express their 
grievances and pressure the Israeli government to compromise. This is a 
20-percent increase from the previous year. 
The numbers can perhaps best be summarized by Ali Najjar, an 18-year-
old Palestinian who lives in a refugee camp. In my view, he said, what 
was taken by force will only be returned by force. Twenty years after 
Oslo, we haven't gained one inch of Palestine. 
Many young Palestinians agree. Indeed, the words summarize the how 
dire the situation has become for an entire generation of Palestinians, most 
of whom are too young to remember the signing of the Oslo Accords in 
1993. Most have not seen any benefit from peace agreements or 
negotiations, and all of them have grown tired of the settlement 
construction in the West Bank, the killing of Palestinian civilians, and the 
internal fighting among Palestinian politicians that never seems to 
dissipate. 
The Corrosive Status Quo 
One cannot blame Palestinian civilians for feeling this way. The previous 
year was a terrible one for Abbas and his government. Settlement tenders 
and approvals in the West Bank rose to such an extent that the anti-
settlement organization Peace Now named 2012 the year of the  
settlement, with the Ministry of Defense authorizing an additional 6,000 
housing units and Netanyahu pushing for the construction of 11,000  
homes in the month of December alone. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028672 
The lack of economic support from donor nations and the restrictions that 
impede the Palestinian economy from functioning at anywhere near its full 
potential have also made for a deadly cocktail for Abbas' Palestinian 
Authority. Combined with the occasional holding of Palestinian tax 
revenue by the Israelis, the PA is finding it incredibly difficult to pay the 
tens of thousands of employees on its payroll. 
The recent Israeli parliamentary elections perhaps best illustrate where the 
Palestinian issue is today: at the bottom of the barrel. Israeli politicians 
chose to focus their campaigning on social and economic issues, from the 
price of housing and cost of living to whether religious students should be 
drafted into the Israeli military like everyone else. The only Israeli 
candidate who spoke about the need to reengage the Palestinians in peace 
talks was the former foreign minister Tzipi Livni, whose party failed to 
reach double-digits in the incoming parliament. 
The overall message is depressingly familiar to Palestinians: creating a 
Palestinian state in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem is 
simply not on the list of priorities for Israel at the current time. And the 
Palestinian Authority is proving itself to be an increasingly fragile 
governing body without the constant generosity of foreign countries; it's 
an institution that cannot adequately care for its people, let alone its 
employees who go months without pay. The average Palestinian is losing 
hope that peace is possible in his or her lifetime. Palestinian leaders may 
speak of ending the occupation, but for those who live under it, the 
occupation is so ingrained that escaping it has become a violation of the 
normal. 
Some may take the more militant attitudes of Palestinians as confirmation 
that Israel does not have a partner for peace. Yet those attitudes can also 
be viewed differently: without a renewed effort at peacemaking, however 
frustrating and difficult it will be, the conflict will reach a nadir where 
searching for a peace partner will be irrelevant.

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010958.txt,"I found a solution that seemed to make sense then. It was the exact opposite of what
I think now. If maintenance consumption were recovered in pay and work products,
as I now think human depreciation but not maintenance consumption is, then
human depreciation instead of maintenance consumption could be exhausted in
taste satisfaction! That seemed less macabre to me then. I looked for ways in which
human depreciation, hardly the biological end in itself, could somehow be its
measure. It was not unreasonable, I thought, to interpret human depreciation in
aging as the cost of survival. The old gag says that aging is not so bad when you
think about the alternative. Age-wage profiles could be explained, I thought then, as
recovery of maintenance consumption rather than of human depreciation in pay.
And I had those precedents from the 18 century. I knew that Francois Quesnay
and the physiocrats, in Adam Smith's time, had argued too that consumption could
be recovered in earnings. Mill could be interpreted that way, in his definition of
“productive consumption”, as could Piero Sraffa in a paper from 1960. | thought I

was on the right track.

What brought me to my senses was the thought experiment about a boss and her
secretary I mentioned earlier. Picture them together at the beginning of the last year
of human capital for each. The boss earns ten times as much. Human capital for each
is one year’s pay, or even less in the unlikely case that invested consumption
continues to the end, less one year’s discount. If pay measured work, rate of return
(work/human capital) would be something over 100% per year for each. It would
be even more in the unlikely case that some work remains unrealized (self-invested)
until the end. Yet their time preferences measured by return to their other
investments, say securities, is less than a tenth as much. This already states pretty

clearly that pay covers more than work.

In case there was doubt, go on to the beginning of the last day. Age-wage profiles
show that pay for each is about what it was a year before. Rate of return to each is
now a little over 100% per day. At the beginning of the last second, it is a little over

100% per second. At the end of the last second it is infinite. Yet the securities in their

Nusayris, after their eponymous founder Ibn Nusayr, who lived in
Iraq during the ninth century. Taking refuge in the mountains above
the port of Latakia, on the coastal strip between modern Lebanon and
Turkey, they evolved a highly secretive syncretistic theology
containing an amalgam of Neoplatonic, Gnostic, Christian, Muslim,
and Zoroastrian elements. Their leading theologian, Abdullah al-
Khasibi, who died in 957, proclaimed the divinity of Ali, the Prophet
Muhammad’s cousin and son-in-law, whom other Shiites revere but
do not worship. Like many Shiites influenced by ancient Gnostic
teachings that predate Islam, they believe that the way to salvation
and knowledge lies through a succession of divine emanations.
Acknowledging a line of prophets or avatars beginning with Adam
and culminating in Christ and Muhammad, they include several
figures from classical antiquity in their list, such as Socrates, Plato,
Galen, and some of the pre-Islamic Persian masters.

Nusayrism could be described as a folk religion that absorbed many
of the spiritual and intellectual currents of late antiquity and early
Islam, packaged into a body of teachings that placed its followers
beyond the boundaries of orthodoxy. Mainstream Muslims, both
Sunni and Shia, regarded them as ghulta, “exaggerators.” Like other
sectarian groups they protected their tradition by a strategy known as
taqiyya—the right to hide one’s true beliefs from outsiders in order to
avoid persecution. Taqiyya makes a perfect qualification for
membership in the mukhabarat—the ubiquitous intelligence/security
apparatus that has dominated Syria’s government for more than four
decades.

Secrecy was also observed by means of a complex system of
initiation, in which insiders recognized each other by using special
phrases or passwords and neophytes underwent a form of spiritual
marriage with the naqibs, or spiritual guides. At this ceremony three
superior dignitaries represent a kind of holy trinity of the figures who

Where analysis is concerned:

e PLN inference, acting on declarative knowledge, is used for estimating the probability of
the implication in the cognitive schematic, given fixed C, P and G. Episodic knowledge
is also used in this regard, via enabling estimation of the probability via simple similarity
matching against past experience. Simulation is also used: multiple simulations may be run,
and statistics may be captured therefrom.

— Example: To estimate the degree to which asking Bob for food (the procedure P is “asking
for food”, the context C is “being with Bob”) will achieve the goal G of getting food, the
virtual dog may study its memory to see what happened on previous occasions where it
or other dogs asked Bob for food or other things, and then integrate the evidence from
these occasions.

e Procedural knowledge, mapped into declarative knowledge and then acted on by PLN in-
ference, can be useful for estimating the probability of the implication C A P > G, in cases
where the probability of C A P, — G is known for some P, related to P.

— Example: knowledge of the internal similarity between the procedure of asking for food
and the procedure of asking for toys, allows the virtual dog to reason that if asking Bob
for toys has been successful, maybe asking Bob for food will be successful too.

e Inference, acting on declarative or sensory knowledge, can be useful for estimating the
probability of the implication C A P > G, in cases where the probability of C; A P > G is
known for some C} related to C.

— Example: if Bob and Jim have a lot of features in common, and Bob often responds
positively when asked for food, then maybe Jim will too.

e Inference can be used similarly for estimating the probability of the implication CA P > G,
in cases where the probability of C A P > G, is known for some G, related to G. Concept
creation can be useful indirectly in calculating these probability estimates, via providing
new concepts that can be used to make useful inference trails more compact and hence
easier to construct.

— Example: The dog may reason that because Jack likes to play, and Jack and Jill are both
children, maybe Jill likes to play too. It can carry out this reasoning only if its concept
creation process has invented the concept of “child” via analysis of observed data.

In these examples we have focused on cases where two terms in the cognitive schematic are
fixed and the third must be filled in; but just as often, the situation is that only one of the
terms is fixed. For instance, if we fix G, sometimes the best approach will be to collectively
learn C' and P. This requires either a procedure learning method that works interactively with a
declarative-knowledge-focused concept learning or reasoning method; or a declarative learning
method that works interactively with a procedure learning method. That is, it requires the sort
of cognitive synergy built into the CogPrime design.

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022252.txt,"Newscom Hedge fund mogul and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who went free this week, lived ina
depraved world of thrice-daily massages, pornographic artwork, and hush money—that’s only
now being revealed. Conchita Sarnoff reports on the sordid details in part two of her exclusive
exposé. Also:
¢ Nude images of young girls were scattered around the house and the bathroom soap was shaped
like sex organs
¢ Staff trolled for fresh recruits to make sure Epstein had two or three massage appointments each
day
¢ The house manager has been sentenced to a longer prison term than Epstein—for trying to sell
notes regarding massage appointments
¢ Epstein gave $1 million to his friend Jean Luc Brunel when he was starting the modeling agency
MC2
¢ According to a former bookkeeper, young girls were brought to the U.S. by MC2—often from
Eastern Europe—then traveled on Epstein’s private jets
Jeffrey Epstein’s loyal friends say that his prosecution was unduly harsh, rather than outrageously
lenient. They insist that his sexual habits, although obsessive and unusual, were mostly legal and
essentially harmless. As the police records attest, the girls brought to El Brillo Way were routinely told
they could “say no” at any time during a massage as Epstein escalated contact in a step-by-step assault
that was remarkably similar in every victim’s statement: First she would be asked to remove her shirt,
then her pants. He would attempt to fondle her buttocks and breasts as he masturbated, then bring out a
large vibrator. There was sometimes digital penetration, and the more willing girls were lured into full-
blown sexual relations with both Epstein and Nadia Marcinkova, who was referred to in press accounts
and police reports as Epstein’s live-in “sex slave.”

A former bookkeeper in the Miami office, who also arranged visas for girls traveling to the U.S.,

confirmed that MC2 girls became frequent guests on Epstein’s private jets.

It’s true that some underage girls may have lied about their age, and some came to the house voluntarily
several times—although, according to Florida statutes, none of that has any bearing on the criminality of
the contact, particularly if the girl was 16 or younger. But what is particularly disturbing about this
case—judging by arrangements at the Palm Beach house—is that Epstein, a billionaire hedge-fund
manager, organized his life around this sexual compulsion in an open and methodical way that suggests
he felt he was beyond the law.
* Conchita Sarnoff: Epstein Faces Sex Traffic Probe
¢ Billionaire Pedophile Goes Free
According to police who executed a search warrant, the house was decorated with large, framed photos
of nude young girls, and similar images were found stashed in an armoire and on the computers seized at
the house (although police found only bare cables where other computers had been). Some bathrooms
were stocked with soap in the shape of sex organs, and various sex toys, such as a “twin torpedo”
vibrator and creams and lubricants available at erotic specialty shops, were stowed near the massage
tables set up in several rooms upstairs.
Epstein also enlisted his staff in the predatory activity, and four—Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley
Groff, and Marcinkova—figured in the FBI investigation. The Non Prosecution Agreement stipulated
that they would not be charged. According to police reports and sworn statements in the civil suits, all
four women, among their other duties, worked to ensure that an appointment book for twice- or thrice-
daily “massages” was stocked with fresh recruits. Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late
Czechoslovakian-born press baron Robert Maxwell, who was for many years Epstein’s live-in partner,
also recruited young girls.
Since his 13-month sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor, Epstein has settled more than a
dozen lawsuits brought by underage girls. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last week, days
before a scheduled trial; each received well over $1 million—an amount that will hardly dent Epstein’s

CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS DURING
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS?

APPLYING THE CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS
ACT BEFORE CRIMINAL CHARGES ARE
FILED

PAUL G. CASSELL*
NATHANAEL J. MITCHELL**&
BRADLEY J. EDWARDS***

This Article addresses whether crime victims should have rights during
criminal investigations, using the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA) as the
focal point for our discussion. This is a critical issue, as many criminal
cases may never proceed to formal charging. If crime victims have no
rights during criminal investigations, then many crime victims will never
have any rights at all.

The issue of whether crime victims have rights in the criminal justice
process recently came to a head when the Justice Department released a
memorandum contending that the CVRA does not extend crime victims any
rights until prosecutors choose to file formal criminal charges. This led the
CVRA’s Senate cosponsor, then-Senator Jon Kyl, to fire off an angry letter
to the Justice Department attacking its position. In our Article, we side
with the Act’s cosponsor. We believe that, properly understood, the CVRA
does extend crime victims’ rights during criminal investigations.

Our Article proceeds in four parts. First, it highlights the importance
of applying the Act before the formal filing of charges by illustrating how
dozens of victims in a notorious federal sex abuse case were deprived of the

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016266.txt,"those trade-offs: you give up a little versatility, a little humanity, and get a crowd-
pleasing show). Watson is not good company, in spite of misleading ads from IBM that
suggest a general conversational ability, and turning Watson into a plausibly
multidimensional agent would be like turning a hand calculator into Watson. Watson
could be a useful core faculty for such an agent, but more like a cerebellum or an
amygdala than a mind—at best, a special-purpose subsystem that could play a big
supporting role, but not remotely up to the task of framing purposes and plans and
building insightfully on its conversational experiences.

Why would we want to create a thinking, creative agent out of Watson? Perhaps
Turing’s brilliant idea of an operational test has lured us into a trap: the quest to create at
least the illusion of a real person behind the screen, bridging the “uncanny valley.” The
danger, here, is that ever since Turing posed his challenge—which was, after all, a
challenge to fool the judges—AI creators have attempted to paper over the valley with
cutesy humanoid touches, Disneyfication effects that will enchant and disarm the
uninitiated. Weizenbaum’s ELIZA was the pioneer example of such superficial illusion-
making, and it was his dismay at the ease with which his laughably simple and shallow
program could persuade people they were having a serious heart-to-heart conversation
that first sent him on his mission.

He was right to be worried. If there is one thing we have learned from the
restricted Turing Test competitions for the Loebner Prize, it is that even very intelligent
people who aren’t tuned in to the possibilities and shortcuts of computer programming
are readily taken in by simple tricks. The attitudes of people in AI toward these methods
of dissembling at the “user interface” have ranged from contempt to celebration, with a
general appreciation that the tricks are not deep but can be potent. One shift in attitude
that would be very welcome is a candid acknowledgment that humanoid embellishments
are false advertising—something to condemn, not applaud.

How could that be accomplished? Once we recognize that people are starting to
make life-or-death decisions largely on the basis of “advice” from AI systems whose
inner operations are unfathomable in practice, we can see a good reason why those who
in any way encourage people to put more trust in these systems than they warrant should
be held morally and legally accountable. AI systems are very powerful tools—so
powerful that even experts will have good reason not to trust their own judgment over the
“Judgments” delivered by their tools. But then, if these tool users are going to benefit,
financially or otherwise, from driving these tools through ferra incognita, they need to
make sure they know how to do this responsibly, with maximum control and justification.
Licensing and bonding operators, just as we license pharmacists (and crane operators!)
and other specialists whose errors and misjudgments can have dire consequences, can,
with pressure from insurance companies and other underwriters, oblige creators of AI
systems to go to extraordinary lengths to search for and reveal weaknesses and gaps in
their products, and to train those entitled to operate them.

One can imagine a sort of inverted Turing Test in which the judge is on trial; until
he or she can spot the weaknesses, the overstepped boundaries, the gaps in a system, no
license to operate will be issued. The mental training required to achieve certification as
a judge will be demanding. The urge to adopt the intentional stance, our normal tactic
whenever we encounter what seems to be an intelligent agent, is almost overpoweringly
strong. Indeed, the capacity to resist the allure of treating an apparent person as a person

Steve jobs said that everyday he woke up , and asked himself , if he knew he was going to die tomorow ,
would he do the same thing that he had planned for the day- he wanted to check that he was doing things

going to do. . he also did not believe in LONG term plans. I dont think either one of us will figure out
what we want to do long term so my thinking is that we should try to have fun everyday, and welcome
serendipity.

I think another trust and estate lawyer should be brought in to deal with the issues of how not to allow
your family to get screwed by your partners on death. Alan, for years told me that paul weiss had drawn

Do you put in any events in your calendar?
Yes, but I expect I will move more and more to having you do it.
Do we “manage” your items, or do you delegate? We are cool with both, but prefer to manage.:-)

I'll try to give the list to you to take care of. I NEED confirmations that you received the task (“on

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029218 
As nearly two dozen Secret Service agents and members of the military were 
punished or fired following a 2012 prostitution scandal in Colombia, Obama 
administration officials repeatedly denied that anyone from the White House was 
involved. 
But new details drawn from government documents and interviews show that senior 
White House aides were given information at the time suggesting that a prostitute was 
an overnight guest in the hotel room of a presidential advance-team member — yet 
that information was never thoroughly investigated or publicly acknowledged.

was a nervous period,” Snowden recalled. Although he bravely told
The Guardian “there was no risk” that the information he carried
had been compromised by other parties in Hong Kong, that claim
was, at best, wishful thinking on his part.

By this time, he had registered at the hotel under his true name
and provided his credit card; he was in contact with three high-
profile journalists, two well-known hacktivists, and, as he suggested
to Gellman, a foreign diplomatic mission.

The mission’s interest would likely be piqued when the news-
paper published its first story on June 6. Greenwald then went on
TV in Hong Kong, revealing to every interested intelligence service
that a defector from the NSA was in Hong Kong providing secret
documents.

Poitras released the famous video showing Snowden and secret
NSA documents three days later. At this point, Snowden shone
brightly as a beacon to NSA secrets to every player in the intelli-
gence game, even if they did not know the extent of the damage he
could inflict on American intelligence.

© Snowden fogged over his travel plans to the media by telling ©
reporters that he intended to remain in Hong Kong and fight extra-
dition, but certainly the Russian officials whom he contacted became
aware that he had other plans, having relayed his request to go to
Russia to their superiors in Moscow. And, unlike the media, any
sophisticated intelligence service was well aware of his movements.
In Hong Kong, cell phones emit their GPS location every three sec-
onds; even if Snowden disabled his own phone, lawyers and helpers
could be tracked with ease.

China’s president, Xi Jinping, who was meeting President Obama
for the first time in Rancho Mirage, California, on June 8, would
have been keenly interested in the unfolding Snowden affair. Obama
had publicly called Xi to task for Chinese cyber espionage, and now
that charge was undermined by Snowden’s accusation that the
United States was engaged in massive cyber espionage. U.S. intel-
ligence verified that China instituted a full-court press of Snowden
in Hong Kong immediately after the release of the video. From
that moment on, any communication or movement Snowden made

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026410.txt,"Gorillas can crawl after 2 months, and build their own nests after 2.5 years. They leave their mothers at 3-4
years. Human children are pretty much useless during the first 10-12 years, but during each phase, their
brains have the opportunity to encounter many times as much training data as a gorilla brain. Humans are
literally smarter on every level, and because the abilities of the higher levels depend on those of the lower
levels, they can perform abstractions that mature gorillas will never learn, no matter how much we try to
train them.

The second set of mechanisms is in the motivational system. Motivation tells the brain what to pay attention
to, by giving reward and punishment. If a brain does not get much reward for solving puzzles, the individual
will find mathematics very boring and won't learn much of it. Ifa brain gets lots of rewards for discovering
other people's intentions, it will learn a lot of social cognition.

Language might be the result of three things that are different in humans:

- extended training periods per layer (after the respective layer is done, it is difficult to learn a new set of
phonemes or the first language)

- more layers

- different internal rewards. Perhaps the reward for learning grammatical structure is the same that makes us
like music. Our brains may enjoy learning compositional regular structure, and they enjoy making
themselves understood, and everything else is something the universal cortical learning figures out on its
own.

This is a hypothesis that is shared by a growing number of people these days. In humans, it is reflected for
instance by the fact that races with faster motor development have lower IQ. (In individuals of the same
group, slower development often indicates defects, of course.)

Another support comes from machine learning: we find that the same learning functions can learn visual
and auditory pattern recognition, and even end-to-end-learning. Google has built automatic image
recognition into their current photo app:
http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/07/01/google-mistakenly-tags-black-people-as-gorillas-showing-limits-of-

algorithms/

The state of the art in research can do better than that: it can begin to Imagine things. I.e. when the
experimenter asks the system to dream what a certain object looks like, the system can produce a
somewhat compelling image, which indicates that it is indeed learning visual structure. This stuff is
something nobody could do a few months ago:
http://www.creativeai.net/posts/Mv4WG6rdzAerZF7ch/synthesizing-preferred-inputs-via-deep-generator-
networks

A machine learning program that can learn how to play an Atari game without any human supervision or
hand-crafted engineering (the feat that gave DeepMind 500M from Google) now just takes about 130 lines
of Python code.

These models do not have interesting motivational systems, and a relatively simple architecture. They
currently seem to mimic some of the stuff that goes on in the first few layers of the cortex. They learn object
features, visual styles, lighting and rotation in 3d, and simple action policies. Almost everything else is
missing. But there is a lot of enthusiasm that the field might be on the right track, and that we can learn
motor simulations and intuitive physics soon. (The majority of the people in AI do not work on this,
however. They try to improve the performance for the current benchmarks.)

Noam's criticism of machine translation mostly applies to the Latent Semantic Analysis models that Google

and others have been using for many years. These models map linguistic symbols to concepts, and relate
concepts to each other, but they do not relate the concepts to proper mental representations of what

then in place — the Jones lawsuit and the Kenneth Starr investigation. These legal proceedings
escalated the stakes by turning a private sexual encounter into the subject of sworn testimony and
investigation by an independent counsel.

It is unlikely that Bill Clinton confided the truth of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky to any
of his lawyers. He couldn’t, because his principle lawyer was representing both him and his wife.
Thus if he didn’t want his wife to find out about Lewinsky, he could not tell his lawyer about her.
It is likely that his lawyers suspected the possibility that there was some truth to the rumors that
something untoward had occurred between Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky. After all, Clinton
did tell his lawyers — and did testify -- that he engaged in adulterous sex with Gennifer Flowers,
despite his previous public denial. Moreover his reputation was well known. Any lawyer worth
his salt should have based decisions regarding the president’s testimony on the assumption that he
may well have engaged in a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. A good lawyer should also
have assumed that a twenty two year old intern who had engaged in a sexual relationship with the
President would talk about it.

His lawyer in the Paula Jones case, Robert Bennett, was on notice that the president was going to
be asked about Lewinsky. If he had conducted any kind of investigation to determine the nature
of their relationship he would surely have uncovered the widespread concern around the White
House over Monica Lewinsky’s unusual access to the President. He would also have learned of
the dozens of logged meetings between the President and a young government employee. This
should have put Bennett on notice to probe more deeply. At the very least he should have
interviewed Lewinsky, confronted her with the concerns, and asked her direct questions. He
should also have interviewed those White House officials who had expressed concern. Yet on the
basis of little more than an assurance from the President, he allowed an affidavit to be submitted
by Lewinsky denying any sexual relationship. Putting aside the ethical issues arising from relying
on an affidavit that he was on notice might well be false, and having his client testify to facts that
he had to suspect might be false, it is difficult to understand the tactical considerations that led the
president’s lawyers to allow him to testify about his sex life.

It is not as if Bennett had not been cautioned about the risks of having the President testify about
his sex life at the Jones deposition. On May 27, 1997, six months before President Clinton
testified at a deposition in the Paula Jones lawsuit, I was a guest expert on “The Geraldo Rivera
Show.” I made the following observation and offered the following advice:

This case never should have gotten this far. It should have been
settled early when he could have settled it easily. He must settle the
case. . .

Remember, depositions are very broad in latitude. He could be
asked questions about adultery. He could be asked questions about
his prior sexual life. There are no relevancy objections that are
generally sustained to depositions. . . .

quoted by Newsweek as saying that as Clinton continuing to define sex more and more narrowly, she begins to
think of herself as a virgin!

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028074.txt,"Chapter Fourteen

It began with an accident. On Tuesday, December 8, 1987, an Israeli tank
transporter crashed into a minibus carrying Palestinians from the Jabalya
refugee camp near the main crossing from Gaza into Israel. Four passengers
were killed.

By the time of the funerals the next day, a rumor had spread, no less
incendiary for being absurd, that the crash had been deliberate — retaliation for
the fatal stabbing of an Israeli man a few days earlier. Crowds of Palestinians
leaving the burials began shouting “Death to Israel!” They hurled rocks and
bottles at Israeli security patrols, and blocked streets with burning tires. By the
next day, the violence started spreading to the West Bank, and then to parts of
east Jerusalem. The headline-writers moved from the word “disturbances” to
“unrest” and finally to the Palesitnians’ own name for the most serious outbreak
of violence since 1967: the “intifada”. The uprising.

At least for the first week or two, we assumed its ferocity and scale would
subside. Our immediate aim was to contain it, and limit the human cost on both
sides. Yet when Dan and I began visiting units on the front line of this new
conflict, we realized that if it kept escalating, we’d have to find new tools and
strategies to bring it under control. We were in charge of an army trained to
equip and fight enemy soldiers. Now, we were asking teenage recruits to
operate as riot police against stone-throwing mobs. Before long, it wasn’t just
stones, or even bottles. In one incident in Gaza, a young soldier was surrounded
by a crowd of Palestinians and stabbed. He opened fire, wounding two of the
attackers. Yitzhik Mordechai, now the head of the southern command, told
reporters that his troops were under “strict orders to open fire only if their lives
are under threat.” That was true. But I couldn’t help wondering how long the
other part of his statement would hold: that we remained “in control of the
situation.”

We did fee/ in control for the first few days. Defense Minister Rabin was
away in Washington on an official visit. When his office asked us whether he
should fly back, we said there was no need. But on his return, we quickly agreed
that, as a first priority, we needed to find an alternative to live ammunition in
quelling the attacks. Otherwise, we’d be left with two equally bad options:
either simply stand aside, in order to avoid killing or injuring demonstrators; or
intervene with the inevitable casualties. But one of our most important early
discussions was about the broader aspects of the violence. The meeting, held

Yeah... lets put that one right over there with the mythical Obama impeachment.What is more likely is that
NAMBLA now has a new champion and this might become part of the kickstart to force Americans to tolerate

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021773.txt,"police released a thick report on the 13-month investigation after the indictment was
unsealed in late July.

The police started investigating Mr. Epstein in March 2005, almost immediately after
they were contacted by the stepmother of the 14-year-old, who, according to the report,
was in a special school for students with disciplinary problems.

The girl, the report said, told the police that an older friend had “offered her an
opportunity to make money” and had driven her to Mr. Epstein’s house one Sunday. The
friend, identified by the police as Haley Robson, a local community college student, told
the girl to say she was 18 if Mr. Epstein asked, the report said.

The girl told the police that Mr. Epstein’s assistant had led her upstairs to a room with a
massage table and that Mr. Epstein had come in and told her to remove her clothes. She
said Mr. Epstein had masturbated as she massaged him, had pressed a vibrator against her
underwear and had given her $300 afterward.

In October, the police interviewed Ms. Robson, then 19, who told them Mr. Epstein had
routinely paid her to bring teenage girls to his home. The police then interviewed a total
of 5 alleged victims and 17 witnesses, many of whom told similar stories about what they
had observed or participated in at Mr. Epstein’s home. According to the report, at least
one said Mr. Epstein had engaged in intercourse with her.

Mr. Lefcourt, his lawyer, said one girl who told the police of having had sex with Mr.
Epstein as a minor had lied about both the sex and her age and had not shown up for
grand jury questioning. He also said Mr. Epstein had passed a lie-detector test clearing
him of any sexual involvement with under-age girls.

A spokeswoman for the Palm Beach police said that early this year, the police went to
Mr. Krischer, the state attorney, intending to apply for warrants to arrest Mr. Epstein.
Instead, she said, they were told that Mr. Krischer would convene a grand jury to
examine the evidence and decide what charges, if any, to bring.

Around that time, the police report said, Mr. Dershowitz met with prosecutors to share
information about the accusers, including statements they had posted on MySpace.com,
the social networking site, concerning use of drugs and alcohol. According to the report,
Mr. Krischer’s office then decided to delay the grand jury session for several months.
The Palm Beach police grew frustrated, the report said, and on May 1 the department
asked prosecutors to approve warrants to arrest Mr. Epstein.

Chief Reiter also wrote Mr. Krischer questioning “the unusual course that your office’s
handling of this matter has taken” and suggesting that Mr. Krischer disqualify himself.
Chief Reiter refused several requests to be interviewed, and his spokeswoman would not
say explicitly why he had urged the prosecutor to step aside.

Mike Edmondson, a spokesman for Mr. Krischer, said the state attorney’s office
sometimes sent noncapital cases to grand juries when there were questions about witness
credibility. Mr. Krischer does not recommend a particular charge in such cases, Mr.
Edmondson said, but gives the grand jury a list of possible charges.

Bruce J. Winick, a law professor at the University of Miami, said that while prosecutors
in Florida rarely referred noncapital cases to grand juries, they sometimes did so with

sensitive cases to be extra-cautious.

While these premeditated and carefully organized killing sprees were taking place, the United
Nations fiddled on about the imperfections of the United States, Israel and other western
democracies. The real victims of this inversion have not been the western democracies that have
been the focus of the U.N. condemnations. The real victims have been those willfully ignored by
the U.N., which has used its focus on Israel and other democracies as an excuse—a cover—for its
malignant inaction against horrible human wrongs committed by the tyrannical regimes that
control much of the UN agenda and give themselves exculpatory immunity from any UN
condemnations or intervention. “Never again” has been turned into “again and again and again.”
The label of “human rights” has been used to promote human wrongs. Our heroes—Eleanor
Roosevelt, Rene Cassin, Albert Schweitzer—should be turning over in their graves, as the shields
they constructed to protect the helpless from oppression and genocide have been beaten into
swords to be used by the oppressors and genocidal killers.

I refuse to allow these human rights pretenders to hijack and invert the honorable agenda of
neutral and universal human rights. I will keep struggling until my dying day to return human
rights to its proper place in the international community.

a singular, unifying force that might suffice to break the military's
power, or at least to force the military to shift its Israeli policy.
Hamas in conflict with Israel as the United Nations votes for a
Palestinian state also places Fatah on the political defensive among
the Palestinians. Fatah cooperation with Israel while Gaza is at war
would undermine Fatah, possibly pushing Fatah to align with Hamas.
Having the U.N. vote take place while Gaza is at war, a vote possibly
accompanied by General Assembly condemnation of Israel, could
redefine the region.

Last week's attack on the Eilat road should be understood in this
context. Some are hypothesizing that new Islamist groups forming in
the Sinai or Palestinian groups in Gaza operating outside Hamas'
control carried out the attack. But while such organizations might
formally be separate from Hamas, I find it difficult to believe that
Hamas, with an excellent intelligence service inside Gaza and among
the Islamist groups in the Sinai, would not at least have known these
groups’ broad intentions and would not have been in a position to
stop them. Just as Fatah created Black September in the 1970s, a
group that appeared separate from Fatah but was in fact covertly part
of it, the strategy of creating new organizations to take the blame for
conflicts is an old tactic both for the Palestinians and throughout the
world.

Hamas' ideal attack would offer it plausible deniability - allowing it
to argue it did not even know an attack was imminent, much less
carry it out - and trigger an Israeli attack on Gaza. Such a scenario
casts Israel as the aggressor and Hamas as the victim, permitting
Hamas to frame the war to maximum effect in Egypt and among the
Palestinians, as well as in the wider Islamic world and in Europe.

revolution began in 1871. The marginalists, mentioned in the forward, swapped the
telescope for the microscope. They left aside the grand teleologies of Smith and
Ricardo and Mill and Marx to refocus on the mechanics of choice. Reasons for tastes
or choices were treated as irrelevant. By 1900 or so, the marginalists had given us
microeconomics much as we know it today. A century would pass before

bioeconomics took form in response to Hamilton’s rule.

Summary

That gives the outline. It is a layman’s view of what a proper economist might not
have attempted. Fools rush in. I will cite sources in economics and biology not to
pretend that I am an authority, but to give real ones a chance to check. My case rests
on the charts and tables. Mill might have been astonished to find that the kind of

growth he described is the only kind to appear in the record.

What makes my book different, aside from my lack of credentials, is the surprises
and the unusual degree of abstraction leading to them. Not many writers try to
follow a chain of inference as far without the comforting touch of the stone and
wood and rope. If Becker had been as venturesome, he might well have solved the
age-wage problem in 1964. I see no other path. Economics is all inside. It is tastes
expressed in choices. Capital is foreseen satisfactions discounted by whatever our
taste for impatience is. Most of it is human capital leaving little market record

beyond its rental cost in pay. Logic is about all we have left.

But the story cannot end in thin air. Few would pay the nuisance cost of so much
abstraction without prospect of surprising and testable prediction. I will try to
deliver that. Mill’s idea is a surprise to politicians, if less so to economists, and could
hardly be tested more thoroughly and successfully. When new ideas are thought up,
Mother Nature says “Shazam” and embodies them at no cost beyond the
depreciation plowback we needed anyway. The data could not be more supportive if

Mill and I had invented them. Even my proposed solution to the age-wage problem,

concreteness, but of course the architecture is intended to be extended more broadly. In the
hierarchy corresponding to an arm, for example, the lowest level would contain control patterns
corresponding to individual joints, the next level up to groupings of joints (like fingers), the
next level up to larger parts of the arm (hand, elbow). The different hierarchies corresponding
to different body parts cross-link, enabling coordination among body parts; and they also con-
nect at multiple levels to perception hierarchies, enabling sensorimotor coordination. Finally
there is a module for motor planning, which links tightly with all the motor hierarchies, and
also overlaps with the more cognitive, inferential planning activities of the mind, in a manner
that is modeled different ways by different theorists. Albus [AMO1] has elaborated this kind of
hierarchy quite elaborately.

The reward hierarchy in Figure 5.6 provides reinforcement to actions at various levels on
the hierarchy, and includes dynamics for propagating information about reinforcement up and
down the hierarchy.

LANGUAGE SUBSYSTEM

PERCEPTUAL HIERARCHY : ) | MOTOR HIERARCHY

Fig. 5.7: Architecture for Language Processing

Figure 5.7 deals with language, treating it as a special case of coupled perception and action.
The traditional architecture of a computational language comprehension system is a pipeline
[JMO09] [Goel0d], which is equivalent to a hierarchy with the lowest-level linguistic features (e.g.
sounds, words) at the bottom, and the highest level features (semantic abstractions) at the top,
and syntactic features in the middle. Feedback connections enable semantic and cognitive mod-
ulation of lower-level linguistic processing. Similarly, language generation is commonly modeled
hierarchically, with the top levels being the ideas needing verbalization, and the bottom level
corresponding to the actual sentence produced. In generation the primary flow is top-down,
with bottom-up flow providing modulation of abstract concepts by linguistic surface forms.

So, that’s it — an integrative architecture diagram for human-like general intelligence, split
among seven different pictures, formed by judiciously merging together architecture diagrams
produced via a number of cognitive theorists with different, overlapping foci and research
paradigms.

Is anything critical left out of the diagram? A quick perusal of the table of contents of
cognitive psychology textbooks suggests to me that if anything major is left out, it’s also
unknown to current cognitive psychology. However, one could certainly make an argument for
explicit inclusion of certain other aspects of intelligence, that in the integrative diagram are

Good news! 
I'm under the impression that checks will be exceptional (they are more cumbersome to handle), and we will 
use mostly wires. 
Considering the time difference, my heavy travel and my own propension to do things at night and on week-
ends I would much prefer having an internet code and be able to organize everything online when I need to. 
When I use Interaudi (my US bank), they can do that, store the recurring beneficiaries, and do wires in 
multiple currencies, but I am not familiar with DB. 
Of course, you could also have the same access and help me when needed. 
Also, your point about bookkeeping is mitigated by the fact that, in any case, I will also need to have 
someone keeping track of the receipts and inventory, before shipping proofs to you. In any case there will be 
need for some work on my side before final filing is done. 
On the other hand, if there is a checks and balances control issue, there could be a cap to my wiring powers 
(like the 10 K we discussed), that would be absolutely fine for me if this is the intent. 
Please do let me know.

friendly (Arianna, Cali have had dinner or stayed home). 
The idea is absolutely to have an impact on the ecosystem and to make a difference by supporting great 
artists when they need it. 
Galleries references are important, because galleries allow artist to reach a broader audience. We would go 
directly to the source. 
This is why it's important for me to go to LA or Berlin (or elsewhere) because those artists are not rich yet, 
they dont travel so much. They belong to a scene, and it does make a big difference to them if you connect

and all work are invested, for modeling purposes, until schooling ends at full-time
job entry. I model this transition at age 20. Pay, realized work, human depreciation

at essentially zero.

Self-invested work continues as an important but diminishing share of work until
late in careers, just as in Ben-Porath. | differ from him mildly in that I model all adult
consumption as pure consumption. Ben-Porath allows adult invested consumption
without assuming it. | regard it as real but negligible. Age-wage profiles are

explained by self-invested work and depreciation theory alone.

I model this self-invested work as subliminal accumulation of job experience. My
reason is personal observation. What I have seen in plants and offices is people
working full time on the job. We don’t take time off to learn. Experience simply
arrives, much as free growth does. | think that my view on this contradicts Ben-
Porath’s marginally. He seems to allow some such allocation of time to help explain

age-wage profiles.

Next comes retirement. | model this as just shown. Later I will expand this model to
include acquisition and disposal of physical capital too. The combined model will

give most of the math and mechanics of next generation theory.

Risk Theory

For practical purposes, economic risk is usually measured as expected standard
deviation in rate of return. Safer assets vary less from their return norms. Short-
term treasuries are thought safest because they combine fixed nominal return with
fast liquidity in case inflation threatens. The market overall bids safer expected
outputs up and riskier ones down. Since asset value is the denominator in rate of

return, and output the numerator, the effect is make risker assets higher in return.

Here's something simple we all can do today... 
Diana Chapman Walsh was president of Wellesley College 8 years ago. She recently emailed her former colleagues the 
following idea: 
Listen Up! The Republicans need to get the message from the majority of Americans that we value and need the benefits 
of Obamacare. Here's how we do that. 
On January 23rd, everyone who feels that way (our numbers are legion) sends a note to Donald Trump with a simple 
message: 
Don't make America sick again. Improve Obamacare. Don't repeal it. 
One envelope for every ACA supporter in your household...even if they are under 18 years old. 
Just that simple message. Put it in an envelope, and put a stamp on it. 
On January 23rd, mail it to: 
Pres. Donald Trump 
1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, 
Washington, DC 20500 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026659 
Can you imagine the picture of 53 MILLION letters arriving at the White House by January 26th? It will be a mountain. 
That image might help deter the Republicans from killing the most substantial improvement to American healthcare since 
the discovery of Penicillin. 
Do it today! Drop it into a mailbox near you on Monday, January 23rd. 
Please send this email to 20 (or more) of your friends, neighbors ann fellow Americans. Ask them to do the same. 
This also helps out the US Postal Service, with about $20 Million of stamp sales. 
Don't send emails to Trump...they don't photograph well. 
I attached a document with the text so you can just print it and put it in the envelope

or becomes a “publicly traded partnership” within two years of the acquisition by it of a U.S. corporation.
A “publicly traded partnership” is any partnership (i) interests in which are traded on an established
securities market, or (if) interests in which are readily tradabie on a secondary market (or the substantial
equivalent thereof). KUE believes that it is not currently a publicly traded partnership and does not intend
to become a publicly traded partnership within two years of this offering or the acquisition of KLC and 412,
AS a result, KUE does not believe the anti-inversion legislation or any regulations promulgated within the
scope of the legislation’s regulatory authority should apply to KUE although no assurance can be given in
this regard or with respect to any new acquisitions of or investment in U.S. corporations. In addition, KUE
does not believe that any other Code provision subjecting non-U.S. corporations to U.S. federal income
tax should apply to KUE or its subsidiaries, although no assurance can be given in this regards. The
promulgation of contrary regulations or a successful challenge of either of these positions by the Internal
Revenue Service could materially reduce a holder's after-tax return and, thus, could result in a substantial
reduction of the value of the Units.

The remainder of this section assumes that KUE will be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income
tax purposes.

18.2.2 United States Federal Income Taxation of Partners

U.S. Persons

Allocation of Purchase Price. You will be treated as purchasing a Unit consisting of two components, one
Common LP Unit and one GP Share. Your purchase price for each Unit will be allocated between one
Common LP Unit and one GP Share in proportion to their relative fair market values at the time of your
purchase, and this allocation will establish your initial tax basis in both your ownership interest in the
Common LP Unit and your GP Share. We will treat the fair market value of each Common LP Share at
$999 and the fair market value of each GP Share as $1.

Flow-Through of Taxable Income. KUE will not pay any U.S. federal income tax. Instead, each Partner
will be required to report on its income tax return its allocable share (as determined pursuant fo the
Limited Partnership Agreement) of KUE's income, gains, losses, and deductions without regard to
whether corresponding cash distributions are made. The Limited Partnership Agreement authorizes the
General Partner to override the allocation provisions of the Limited Partnership Agreement and allocate
income, gains, losses and deductions of KUE to the Partners in a manner that achieves the desired
economic arrangement of KUE, which is to return each Pariner's capital contribution and then for all
Partners (including the holder of Profits Participation LP Units) to share in the profits of KUE in proportion
to the number of Units held by them.

The IRS may challenge the manner in which income, gains, losses and deductions are allocated to
holders of Common LP Units, the General Partner and holders of the Profits Participation LP Units under
the Limited Partnership Agreement. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, allocation of any item of
income, gain, loss or deduction io a partner in a partnership will be given effect so long as the allocation
has “substantial economic effect,” or is otherwise in accordance with the partner's interest in the
partnership. If an allocation of an item pursuant to the Limited Partnership Agreement does not satisfy
this standard or is deemed not to satisfy this standard by the IRS, it will be reallocated by the IRS among
the Partners on the basis of their respective interests in KUE (as determined by the IRS), taking into
account all facts and circumstances. In such a case, holders of Common LP Units could have additional
tax liabilities or suffer adverse tax consequences.

Treatment of Cash Distributions, WKUE's distributions to a Partner generally will not be taxable to the
Partner for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent of such Partner’s adjusted tax basis in its
Common LP Units immediately before the distribution, Cash distributions in excess of a Limited Partner's
adjusted tax basis generally will be considered to be gain from the sale or exchange of the Common LP
Units. Any reduction in a Limited Partner's share of KUE's liabilities, if any, for which no Partner bears the

An 11-month police investigation led to an indictment on one felony charge of
solicitation of prostitution. That was in July 2006, and part-time Palm Beacher
Jeffrey Epstein still has faced no repercussions for allegedly preying on underage
girls.

So maybe Mr. Epstein is satisfied that he's getting his money's worth from his large
legal team, which includes Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz
(remember O.J. Simpson?) and Kenneth Starr (remember Monica Lewinsky?). Jack
Goldberger of West Palm Beach, who's also on the team, told Post columnist Jose
Lambiet in November: This case is absolutely going to end without a trial within

the next two months.

He was wrong, but Mr. Goldberger remains on Mr. Epstein's payroll, feigning

moral outrage at two lawsuits filed this year against the Manhattan money

manager. The lawsuits allege sexual exploitation of teenaged girls, one of

them as young as 14. Said Mr. Goldberger after the first lawsuit, seeking

more than $50 million, was filed on Jan. 24: We think this shows what this

case is all about: money. Yes, it is - Mr. Epstein's effort to buy his way out

of prosecution.

According to the lawyer of a 17-year-old whose parents are suing him, Mr. Epstein
masturbated in front of her (she was 14 at the time) and used a vibrator on her at his
home itn February 2005. Another Epstein attorney, Lilly Ann Sanchez dismissed it:
Jeffrey Epstein did not have sex with this woman.

For those girls who claim that he did, Mr. Epstein's lawyers maintain that he did not
know their ages, despite a police search of his home and garbage that found phone
messages about the girls’ school schedules and even a high school transcript. For all of
his money, Mr. Epstein's best defense remains I didn't know that I was a criminal
pervert?

Palm Beach Post Editorial #4

Rich man fought the law and he mostly won

Palm Beach Post Editorial

Monday, July 07, 2008

Two years after a grand jury indicted him on a felony charge of solicitation of
prostitution, Jeffrey Epstein finally admitted that he lured a teenage girl to his $8.5
million, 13,000-square-foot Palm Beach mansion for sex. A week ago, the 55-yearold
investment banker began serving 18 months in jail.

But that plea deal - guilty of felony solicitation of prostitution and procuring a

person under the age of 18 for prostitution - does not account for all five of the girls,
one as young as 14, who alleged that Epstein sexually abused them. And why is Epstein
serving his term in the overcrowded Palm Beach County Jail and not a state prison, where
inmates are sent if their sentences are longer than one year?

The slow, dissatisfying resolution of the case sends a message to the public

Post your that there's a different system of justice for the wealthy who hire highcomments

powered lawyers. Epstein's legal team included West Palm Beach defense

of the US federal government. Because most PRC attempts to influence American
opinion and practices occur at the local level, and because local media, universities,
companies, and advocacy agencies are often involved in these efforts, knowingly and
unknowingly, local leaders, just as much as national leaders, need an understanding

of PRC goals and strategies.

“We Have Friends All Over the World”

China pursues sister city relationships under an organization called the Chinese
People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, which is part of China’s
united front bureaucratic structure (See Appendix: Chinese Influence Operations
Bureaucracy) that aims to strengthen the rule of the Chinese Communist Party and
increase China’s influence overseas. With its long-standing Maoist slogan, “We Have
Friends All Over the World,” the association had its heyday in the 1950s, when China
was isolated and the group became a bridge between China and overseas supporters.

It was marginalized in the 1980s, as China opened to the West and established
diplomatic relations with hundreds of countries. However, under the administration of
Communist Party leader Xi Jinping, the association has been revitalized as China seeks
to groom local business, political, and media leaders in countries around the world. Its
new standing is exemplified by the splendor of its headquarters located in the elegant

old Italian Embassy compound near Tiananmen Square.

The way the association and other Chinese organizations cultivate relationships

with local officials follows a general pattern. First, in the United States, China
demands that sister city relationships and state-to-province sister relations be carried
out under “principles” on which Sino-US relations were established in the 1970s

(as interpreted by the Chinese side). This means that China’s representatives will
likely protest should local officials seek to maintain ties with representatives of Taiwan
or with other individuals, such as the Dalai Lama, whom China regards as hostile
forces. Second, it is important to understand why China seeks a relationship with
localities, especially during times of tension with the federal government: China

seeks to build alternative networks of interaction and support, while using these new
relationships to help gain new traction back in Washington. Local American expertise,
information, and opinion are also of more than passing political interest to Beijing,
even if on paper an exchange relationship is only to “enhance people’s friendship,
further international cooperation, safeguard world peace and promote common

development,”' for Beijing understands clearly that local leaders today become the

Article 7.

Military Review

An Old Man’s Thoughts on War and

Peace
Edward Bernard Glick

May-June 2011 -- WHEN I WAS a young man in graduate school,
two books impressed me mightily. They still do. One is Konrad
Lorenz’s On Aggression. An M.D. and a Ph.D. and a 1973 Nobel
laureate in medicine and physiology, Lorenz established the field of
ethology, the study of the behavior of animals within their natural
environment. In his prologue to On Aggression, Lorenz wrote, “The
subject of this book is aggression, that is to say the fighting instinct in
beast and man, which is directed against members of the same
species.” According to him, animals, particularly males, are
biologically programmed to fight over resources and turf, and this
behavior is part of natural selection. In short, to a great degree,
ageressive behavior is innate.

The other book that influenced me mightily as a young man was
Robert Ardrey’s The Territorial Imperative. Ardrey popularized and
expanded on Lorenz’s ideas. After reading Ardrey, a Book-of-the-
Month Club reviewer asked, “Are we a territorial species? Do we
defend ourselves, whether by war or other means, because we have
learned to do so—or because, as animals, we must?”

Reading Lorenz and Ardrey provides a good reason for believing the
Roman proverb Si vis pacem para bellum, “He who wishes peace
should prepare for war.” (The full text of the proverb goes on to say,
“He who desires victory should carefully train his soldiers; he who
wants favorable results should fight relying on skill, not chance.”)

barbaric weapons.

action, but its major bodies refused even to condemn the genocide until after the killing was
completed and at least 1.8 million people lay dead. The General Assembly, for instance, did not
mention Cambodia in a single resolution until November 1979—nearly a year after the genocide’s
end. Even then the resolution was framed in terms of sovereignty and did not mention specific
human rights violations, let alone genocide.’ Only in 1980, nearly five years after the atrocities
began, did the UNCHR finally pass a resolution condemning the genocide.

The hard left was similarly uninterested in the Cambodian genocide. While millions were being
murdered, many leftists dismissed the atrocities as western propaganda. Activists Gareth Porter
and George Hilderbrnd wrote, “Cambodia is only the latest victim of the enforcement of an
ideology that demands that social revolutions be portrayed as negatively as possible, rather than
as a response to real human needs....” According to the pair, what “was portrayed as [the Khmer
Rouge’s]| destructive backward-looking policy motivated by doctrinaire hatred was actually a
rationally conceived strategy for dealing with the problems that faced postwar Cambodia.” Noam
Chomsky also dismissed the genocide, writing that “if Cambodian terror did not exist, the
Western propaganda systems would have had to invent it, and in certain respects they did.” He
unabashedly wrote that blaming solely the Khmer Rouge for deaths from malnutrition and disease
was as “if some Nazi apologists were to condemn the allies for postwar deaths from starvation
and disease in DP camps.”

Instead of focusing on the savage mass murder of more than a million civilians in Southeast Asia,
the global community chose instead to use its limited time and resources to try to delegitimize
Israel. Just a few months after the Cambodian atrocities began, the General Assembly adopted
the most infamous resolution in its history, resolution 3379, declaring that “Zionism is a form of
racism and racial discrimination.” 72 countries voted in favor, including, ironically, Cambodia. 35
voted against and 32 abstained. This and other similar actions by the General Assembly led Abba
Eban to proclaim that if Algeria offered a resolution than the earth was flat and Israel flattened it,
it would pass 72 to 35, with 32 abstentions. The United States representative to the United
Nations, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, fumed that “the United States rises to declare before the
General Assembly of the United Nations and before the world that it does not acknowledge, it
will not abide by, it will never acquiesce in this infamous act.”

The result of this resolution was that “Zionists” were blacklisted and banned from speaking at
several colleges and universities that had “anti-racist” speaking policies. Not a great victory for
“human rights” or for freedom. In a world, where genocide, slavery, disappearances, torture,
systematic rape, murder of dissidents and other grave violations of human rights were being
routinely perpetrated by its member nations, Zionism and Israel became the number one enemy of
the U.N., with more resolutions condemning Israel than all the other member nations combined.

The record of the UN Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) on the matter is much the same. In March 1978
the United Kingdom petitioned the UNCHR to appoint a special rappourteur for human rights in Cambodia.

Syria, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia blocked the move. Instead of appointing a rappourteur, the commission
invited comment by the Khmer Rouge, referred the matter to a sub-committee, and (despite the ongoing genocide)
delayed consideration of the matter until 1979. By the 1979 meeting of the commission, Vietnam had already
invaded Cambodia and effectively ended the killings. Yet again, however, the commission delayed consideration
of the Cambodia matter.

Rashomon Rape Cases

In the great Japanese film, Rashomon, a horrible crime is presented through the very different
perspectives of several participants. In some rape cases, a similar Rashomon perspective is
sometimes at work. In the Mike Tyson case, for example, it is possible (though unlikely in my
view) that Desiree Washington did not intend to consent to sex but that Mike Tyson reasonably
believed—based on her “groupie-like” actions and statements—that she did. What should the
law be in such situations?

Under American law, if a person makes a reasonable mistake of fact which leads to the
commission of a crime, he is generally not guilty. For example, if a person walking down the
street sees another person coming at him with a gun about to pull the trigger, and he shoots first
and kills his assailant, he is not guilty, even if the “assailant” turns out to be an actor in a movie
holding a gun that shot blanks. Since the defendant reasonably, though mistakenly believed, that
his life was in danger, his reasonable mistake of fact constituted a complete defense to a murder
charge. A crime requires both a criminal act and a criminal intent, and if the defendant reasonably
believes that facts, as he saw them, made what he was doing permissible under the law, then he
does not have a guilty mind. A mistake about law, on the other hand, is not a defense, since
everybody is presumed to know the law. (This latter point led an English wag to comment that
“all Englishmen are presumed to know the law, except Her Majesty’s judges, who have a court of
appeals above them to set them right.”’)

In recent years, however, there has been a movement to deny defendants in rape cases the right to
raise the defense of reasonable mistake of fact, especially when it comes to whether the woman
consented. No means no, and no man should be allowed to believe that no might mean yes or
even maybe. (There is the anachronistic joke about the difference between a diplomat and a lady:
When the diplomat means maybe, he says yes. When he means no, he says maybe. A diplomat
never says no, for to say no would mean he was not a diplomat. When a lady says no, she means
maybe. When she says maybe, she means yes. A lady never says yes, for to say yes would mean
she was not a lady.)

The law is correct in demanding that a man understand no to mean no. He may subjectively
believe that no means maybe when it comes to him, but such a belief is unreasonable as a matter
of law. In some situations, however, the woman does not say no. Nor does she say yes. Nor does
she even say maybe. (There was a song made famous by Ella Fitzgerald entitled “She didn’t say
yes. She didn’t say no.” The lyrics continued: “She didn’t say stay, she didn’t say go...clearly
she took one sly little look and something awoke and smiled inside. Her heart began beating wild
inside. So what did she do? I leave it to you. She did what you’d do too...she didn’t say yes.
She didn’t say no. She wanted to stay but knew she should go. She wasn’t so sure that he’d be
good. She wasn’t even sure that she’d be good...above her, sweet love was beckoning and yet
she knew there’d be a reckoning....”) In real life, women often convey their intentions via
ambiguous verbal and physical cues. In such situations, it is morally wrong, in my view, for a man
to assume consent, but it may also be legally wrong for the law to punish such immoral behavior

than interactively understanding it and agreed on the recommendation
that it was safe to return. Clearly they did not understand the ambiguity
otherwise they would have realized they did not have enough information
to form a conclusion. This is the tragedy of lack of understanding. If they
had known how little they knew, they could have deployed a spy satellite
to take pictures of the damage - one was available nearby and would
have taken a few hours to re-task — but they did not.

Ed Tufte served on the second shuttle disaster commission and
provided an analysis of the disaster. He views slides as a poor medium for
communicating complex problems and thinks documents are far better.
The danger with slides is they force you to simplify information in a way
that destroys the essence of the information. His analysis of the failure of
communication at NASA formed a major part of the final report on the
disaster. Later he coined the paraphrase “All Power corrupts; PowerPoint
corrupts absolutely” Good communication benefits from stories and
narrative, not bullet points and graphic fluff. Instead of using bullet
points, speak! After all, we have evolved for 250,000 years to understand
language, but only 25 to read PowerPoints. ’

If you write presentations, Ed Tufte’s book The Cognitive Style
of PowerPoint is compulsory reading. He argues that much of the
information you want to communicate is complex and interconnected.
PowerPoint or any similar presentation software encourages you to
simplify it into hierarchical bullets. The format implies simple causal
relationships where none exists. This is dangerous. Communication
should convey understanding — which is very important — and not just
information. What, you ask, is the difference?

How a future Trump Cabinet member 
gave a serial sex abuser the deal of a lifetime 
By JULIE K. 610 WN 
MIAMI — On a muggy October morning in 
2007, Miami, top federal prosecutor. Alexan-
der Acosta, had a breakfast a,intmeri with a 
former colleague, Washington, D.C., attorney Jay 
Lethowitz. 
It was an unusual meeting for the then-38-
year-okl prosecutox a rising Republican star who 
had grwd in somml White House posts before 
being named U.S. attorney in Miami by President 
George W. Bush. 
Instead of meeting at the pros.utor's Mithni 
headquarters, the two mai — both with profes-
sional roots in the prestigious Washington law 
finn of Kirldand . Ellis — convened at the 
Marrien in WeSt Palm Beach, about 70 miles 
away. For Lethowia, a U.S. special envoy to 
North Korea and corporate lawyer, the meeting 
was critical. 
His clic, Palm Beach multimillionaire Jeffrey 
Epstein. 54, wis accused of assembling a lazie.

help of young female r.nriters — to coerce into

just Eli Zeira’s failure to activate the sayeret’s listening devices in Eygpt,
deeply damaging though that was. It was judgement. Inside Aman, a kind of
groupthink had taken hold. It was rooted in a confident, costly misconception
which went unchallenged: that Egypt would never risk another war without an
air force capable of breaching our defences and striking towns and cities deep
inside Israel. No one pressed the alternative scenario: that Sadat might strike
with more limited territorial objectives and, under cover of his SAM batteries
on the other side of the Suez Canal, advance into the Sinai.

In the Lebanon war, the inquiry suggested, Yehoshua Saguy did try to warn
the generals, and the government, about major risks. But individual ministers
testified that they hadn’t heard, hadn’t been there, or hadn’t understood, leading
the inquiry to stress the responsibility of a Rosh Aman to ensure not just that his
message was conveyed, but that it was received as well.

I set out to address both problems. Inside the department, I insisted on
making all our preconceptions open to challenge. I set up a unit whose sole
function was to play devil’s advocate when a consensus was reached. It began
with the opposite conclusion and, through a competing analysis of the data, and
logical argument, tried to prove it. I also wanted to be challenged on my
preconceptions. I assigned a bright young major as my personal intelligence-
and-analysis aide. He read everything that crossed my desk and could access
any material in the department. “You have no responsibility to agree with any of
the analysts, or with me,” I said. “Part of your job is to disagree.”

In the Lebanon war, Saguy had faced an additional problem. He was
excluded from some government meetings at which crucial decisions were
made. That was out of his control. I didn’t want it to be out mine. I raised the
issue with Begin in our first meeting. “If you want to get the maximum value
from your head of intelligence,” I said, “you should make sure he’s there not
just after, but when decisions are made.” Yet he was now only months from
leaving office, exhausted by the war and its aftermath. He waved his hand
weakly in response, as if to say none of it mattered. His successor, in October
1983, was Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir. Ideologically, he was cut from the
same cloth: an advocate from the 1940s of securing a Jewish state in all of
Palestine, by whatever force necessary. He’d broken with Begin’s pre-state
Irgun militia to set up a group called Lehi, which went further and carried out
political assassinations: the 1944 killing of Lord Moyne, Britain’s Minister for

you have your own credit card and start building a good credit history . so you can 
have money wired into your own account. and no one gets to review what you do with it.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014004.txt,"3. Pricing Before Product— Plan Distribution First

Is your pricing scalable? Many companies will sell direct-to-consumer by necessity in early stages, only
to realize that their margins can’t accommodate resellers and distributors when they come knocking. If
you have a 40% profit margin and a distributor needs a 70% discount to sell into wholesale accounts,
you're forever limited to direct-to-consumer ... unless you increase your pricing and margins. It’s best to
do this beforehand if possible—otherwise, you’ll need to launch new or “premium” products—so plan
distribution before setting pricing. Test assumptions and find hidden costs by interviewing those who
have done it: Will you need to pay for co-op advertising, offer rebates for bulk purchases, or pay for
shelf space or featured placement? I know one former CEO of a national brand who had to sell his
company to one of the world’s largest soft drink manufacturers before he could access front-of-store
shelving in top retailers. Test your assumptions and do your homework before setting pricing.

4. Less Is More— Limiting Distribution to Increase Profit

Is more distribution automatically better’? No. Uncontrolled distribution leads to all manner of headache
and profit-bleeding, most often related to rogue discounters. Reseller A lowers pricing to compete with
online discounter B, and the price cutting continues until neither is making sufficient profit on the
product and both stop reordering. This requires you to launch a new product, as price erosion is almost
always irreversible. Avoid this scenario and consider partnering with one or two key distributors instead,
using that exclusivity to negotiate better terms: less discounting, prepayment, preferred placement and
marketing support, etc. From iPods to Rolex and Estée Lauder, sustainable high-profit brands usually
begin with controlled distribution. Remember, more customers isn’t the goal; more profit is.

5. Net-Zero—Create Demand vs. Offering Terms

Focus on creating end-user demand so you can dictate terms. Often one trade publication advertisment,
bought at discount remnant rates, will be enough to provide this leverage. Outside of science and law,
most “rules” are just common practice. Just because everyone in your industry offers terms doesn’t mean
you have to, and offering terms is the most consistent ingredient in start-up failure. Cite start-up
economics and the ever-so-useful “company policy” as reasons for prepayment and apologize, but don’t
make exceptions. Net-30 becomes net-60, which becomes net-120. Time is the most expensive asset a
start-up has, and chasing delinquent accounts will prevent you from generating more sales. If customers
are asking for your product, resellers and distributors will need to buy it. It’s that simple. Put funds and
time into strategic marketing and PR to tip the scales in your favor.

6. Repetition Is Usually Redundant—Good Advertising Works the First Time

Use direct response advertising (call-to-action to a phone number or website) that is uniquely trackable
—fully accountable advertising—instead of image advertising, unless others are pre-purchasing to offset
the cost (e.g., “If you prepurchase 288 units, we’ll feature your store/URL/phone exclusively in a full-
page ad in...”). Don’t listen to advertising salespeople who tell you that 3,7, or 27 exposures are needed
before someone will act on an advertisement. Well-designed and well-targeted advertising works the first
time. If something works partially well (e.g., high response with low percentage conversion to sales, low
response with high conversion, etc.), indicating that a strong ROI might be possible with small changes,
tweak one controlled variable and microtest once more. Cancel anything that cannot be justified with a
trackable ROI.

7. Limit Downside to Ensure Upside—Sacrifice Margin for Safety

sian KGB and SVR reported that Chinese intelligence received from
Russia a continuous stream of communications intelligence about
the United States in the late twentieth and early twenty-first cen-
turies. Russia’s intelligence resources during this period were for-
midable. They included geosynchronous satellites, listening stations
in Cuba, sleeper agents, and embassy-based spy networks. Presum-
ably, this relationship further deepened under President Putin’s
regime. Putin asserted in speeches in 2014 that Russia and China
continued to share a key strategic objective: countering the United
States’ domination of international relations, or what Putin terms
“a unipolar world order.” China’s president, Xi Jinping, expressed a
very similar view, saying in 2014 in a thinly veiled reference to the
United States that any attempt to “monopolize” international affairs
will not succeed.

Since the end of the Cold War, Russia has been the major supplier
of almost all of China’s modern weaponry. It licenses for manufac-
ture in China avionics, air defense systems, missile launchers, stealth
technology, and submarine warfare equipment. To make these arms

© effective, it also provides China with up-to-date intelligence about ®
the ability of the United States and its allies to counter them. While
such intelligence cooperation may be limited by the reality that
China and Russia still compete in many areas, they still have reason
to share much of the fruits of their cyber and conventional espio-
nage against the NSA in accordance with their intelligence. After all,
the NSA works to intercept the military and political secrets of both
these allies. Moreover, as the CIA’s former deputy director Morell
points out in his book, NSA secrets are a form of currency for adver-
saries in the global intelligence war, saying that part of Snowden’s
cache could be traded by a country that acquired it to the intelligence
services of Iran and North Korea.

Snowden’s stay in Hong Kong from May 20 to June 23 in 2013
made the Chinese intelligence service, willy-nilly, a potential player
in whatever game he was involved in. China’s full responsibility for
Hong Kong’s national security and foreign affairs includes moni-
toring foreign intelligence operatives. Chinese intelligence main-

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019915.txt,"One of Kushner’s now-frequent wise-men callers was Henry Kissinger. Kissinger, who
had been a front-row witness when the bureaucracy and intelligence community revolted
against Richard Nixon, outlined the kinds of mischief, and worse, that the new
administration could face.

“Deep state,” the left-wing and right-wing notion of an _ intelligence-network
permanent-government conspiracy, part of the Breitbart lexicon, became the Trump team
term of art: he’s poked the deep state bear.

Names were put to this: John Brennan, the CIA director; James Clapper, the director of
national intelligence; Susan Rice, the outgoing National Security Advisor; and Ben
Rhodes, Rice’s deputy and an Obama favorite.

Movie scenarios were painted: a cabal of intelligence community myrmidons, privy to
all sorts of damning evidence of Trump’s recklessness and dubious dealings, would, with a
strategic schedule of wounding, embarrassing, and distracting leaks, make it impossible
for the Trump White House to govern.

What Kushner was told, again and again, is that the president had to make amends. He
had to reach out. He had to mollify. These were forces not to be trifled with was said with
utmost gravity.

Throughout the campaign and even more forcefully after the election, Trump had
targeted the American intelligence community—the CIA, FBI, NSC, and, altogether,
seventeen separate intelligence agencies—as incompetent and mendacious. (His message
was “on auto pilot,” said one aide.) Among the various and plentiful Trump mixed
messages at odds with conservative orthodoxy, this was a particularly juicy one. His case
against American intelligence included its faulty information about weapons of mass
destruction that preceded the Iraq war, a litany of Obama Afghanistan-Iraq-Syria-Libya
and other war-related intelligence failures, and, more recently, but by no means least of all,
intelligence leaks regarding his purported Russian relationships and subterfuges.

Trump’s criticism seemed to align him with the left in its half century of making a
bogeyman of American intelligence agencies. But, in quite some reversal, the liberals and
the intelligence community were now aligned in their horror of Donald Trump. Much of
the left—which had resoundingly and scathingly rejected the intelligence community’s
unambiguous assessment of Edward Snowden as a betrayer of national secrets rather than
a well-intentioned whistle-blower—now suddenly embraced the intelligence community’s
authority in its suggestion of Trump’s nefarious relationships with the Russians.

Trump was dangerously out in the cold.

Hence, Kushner thought it was sensible to make a reach-out to the CIA among the first
orders of the new administration’s business.

these sojourns take me around the world; oftentimes they take me around the cormer— Yosemite, Tahoe,
Carmel—but to a different world psychologically, where meetings, e-mail, and phone calls don’t exist
for a set period of time.

Purging the Demons: Emotional Freedom

This is the very perfection of a man, to find out his own im perfection.
— SAINT AUGUSTINE (354 A.D-430 A.D.)

Tne freedom is much more than having enough income and time to do what you want. It is quite

possible—actually the rule rather than the exception—to have financial and time freedom but still be
caught in the throes of the rat race. One cannot be free from the stresses of a speed- and size-obsessed
culture until you are free from the materialistic addictions, time-famine mind-set, and comparative
impulses that created it in the first place.

This takes time. The effect is not cumulative, and no number of two-week (also called “too wea yall

sightseeing trips can replace one good walkabout.4

In the experience of those I’ve interviewed, it takes two to three months just to unplug from obsolete
routines and become aware of just how much we distract ourselves with constant motion. Can you have
a two-hour dinner with Spanish friends without getting anxious? Can you get accustomed to a small town

where all businesses take a siesta for two hours in the afternoon and then close at 4:00 P.M.? If not, you
need to ask, Why?

Learn to slow down. Get lost intentionally. Observe how you judge both yourself and those around
you. Chances are that it’s been a while. Take at least two months to disincorporate old habits and
rediscover yourself without the reminder of a looming return flight.

The Fimancial Realities: It Just Gets Better

Tre economic argument for mini-retirements is the icing on the cake. Four days in a decent hotel or a

week for two at a nice hostel costs the same as a month in a nice posh apartment. If you relocate, the

expenses abroad also begin to replace—often at much lower cost—bills you can then cancel stateside.
Here are some actual monthly figures from recent travels.

Highlights from both South America and Europe are shown side by side to prove that luxury is limited
by your creativity and familiarity with the locale, not gross currency devaluation in third-world countries.
It will be obvious that I did not survive on bread and begging—I lived like a rock star—and both
experiences could be done for less than 50% of what I spent. My goal was enjoyment and not austere
survival.

The Role of ‘Process’ in Creativity

We hear a lot about ‘process’ when developing software and other
creative tasks. The first thing to realize is process does not write software
and every moment spent on process is a moment not writing software.
Excessive process can bring the productivity of the average programmer
down from a thousand lines per day to one. On the other hand, we all
know that using no process to write software results in useless software.
Good solo programmers, playwrights or composers are surrounded by
lists and post-it notes full of process. Where is the balance to be struck?

In my view ‘process’ is there to help humans with the tasks we find
naturally difficult. Humans, as we know, are dreadful at remembering
lists of symbolic information. Give a human ten numbers to memorize
and they will quickly forget them. Give Microsoft Excel ten numbers and
it will remember them forever, or, at least, until your next upgrade! So
the first job of process is to collect lists of things and sometimes even lists
of those lists.

Another significant affliction affecting humans is procrastination.
We tend to put off decisions. Process can set waypoints; when will the
job of splitting a project occur, when will we begin the test, and so on.

The third job of process is to keep track of the division of labor — if
the project has to be divided. Who will do what? Essentially we are back
to lists again.

The most important job of process, in my view, is to keep track
of scope. ‘Logical scope creep’ when unrecognized destroys software
projects. Scope creep is fine if it just adds more linear work. “Could we
add three more product types?” “Could you do another language?” “Can
you make this interface prettier, less cluttered?” It may cause a busy team
to groan, but it does not damage the integrity of the design. To put it back
in Brooks’ language, accidental creep is fine — provided you add some
resource. Essential creep is not. Adding the french language prompts to
a project in English might be fine, putting language translation into a
project may be a step too far. The project may have strayed into a different
logical class. Increases in logical scope often require redesign, you must
stop and re-architect if you are to avoid bugs in plague like quantities.

If programming software is a creative task, how can we help improve
productivity? The most important factor is to provide uninterrupted
peace and quiet. Programming is a task where people need to hold many
ideas in their head at the same time, and this requires deep concentration.
To get some idea of the creative process at work, listen to the excellent
TED lecture by John Cleese.

article noted that this practice of offering Party commissions to overseas Chinese to work
overseas On united front tasks was not new. The president of the United Fujianese American
Association (= )#83#24\M) told reporters: “I have received quite a few letters of appointment
on previous occasions, but none for which I have felt such deep significance as the one
today. It’s a heavy responsibility.”*

Peaceful Reunification Councils

A key goal of PRC overseas activities is to convince, and sometimes pressure, Chinese in
the United States to accept that the PRC government in Beijing is the sole representative
of China and Chinese, and that the Republic of China on Taiwan is an illegitimate
government. To this end, in 1988, the Party’s United Front Work Department founded the
China Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification, and the Washington,
DC, Association to Promote China Unification was folded into the council. The DC
chapter’s assignment was to organize concerts, demonstrations, and other gatherings

to support the PRC. Other chapters soon opened, so that by 2018, the council had
established thirty-three in the United States and more than two hundred branches overseas.
In America, these organizations are generally registered as domestic nonprofit community
organizations, even though their leadership in Beijing includes senior members of the
Chinese Communist Party. Indeed, an article in the People’s Daily, the mouthpiece of
the Chinese Communist Party, spoke in glowing terms about how useful the Peaceful
Reunification Councils were in furthering China’s goals of taking over Taiwan, noting
that while chapters of the Peaceful Reunification Council complied with US law by
registering as nonprofits, they were established to support Chinese government policies
and coordinate activities with PRC consulates in the United States.'° “Over the years, the
China Peaceful Reunification Council in Northern California has actively cooperated
with the local Chinese consulate to work against ‘Taiwan independence’ and promote
national reunification activities, and has some influence in San Francisco’s overseas Chinese
community,” the Northern California Council candidly notes on its website.’

Around the United States, the councils count numerous prominent Chinese Americans as
members. For example, one successful California businesswoman was for years the honorary
chairwoman of the council in Northern California.'* While helping promote US-China
educational exchanges, this individual has also consistently advocated on behalf of PRC
policies in the United States, including China’s claims on Taiwan, and has helped to organize
demonstrations against “Taiwan independence.” She is listed as an advisor to the China
Overseas Exchange Association, which is part of the United Front Work Department.’

The Chinese government has also sought to co-opt local Chinese American community
associations to serve its goals.”° In the past, organizations such as regional associations,
known as Tongs (l#4), had generally been close to the Nationalist government of Taiwan.
In San Francisco, however, that began to change as early as the 1980s when Soon Suey

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016909.txt,"lots of examples of something you want them to learn (pictures of cats labeled “cat,” for
example), along with examples of other random data (pictures of other things). This is
called “supervised learning,” because the neural network is being taught by example,
including the use of “adversarial training” with data that is not correlated to the desired
result.

These neural networks, like their biological models, consist of layers of thousands
of nodes (“neurons,” in the analogy), each of which is connected to all the nodes in the
layers above and below by connections that initially have random strength. The top layer
is presented with data, and the bottom layer is given the correct answer. Any series of
connections that happened to land on the right answer is made stronger (“rewarded”), and
those that were wrong are made weaker (“punished”). Repeat tens of thousands of times
and eventually you have a fully trained network for that kind of data.

You can think of all the possible combinations of connections as like the surface
of a planet, with hills and valleys. (Ignore for the moment that the surface is just 3D and
the actual topology is many-dimensional.) The optimization that the network goes
through as it learns is just a process of finding the deepest valley on the planet. This
consists of the following steps:

1. Define a “cost function” that determines how well the network solved the problem

2. Run the network once and see how it did at that cost function

3. Change the values of the connections and do it again. The difference between
those two results is the direction, or “slope,” in which the network moved
between the two trials.

4. Ifthe slope is pointed “downhill,” change the connections more in that direction.
If it’s “uphill,” change them in the opposite direction.

5. Repeat until there is no improvement in any direction. That means that you’re in
a minimum.

Congrats! But it’s probably a /oca/ minimum, or a little dip in the mountains, so you’re
going to have to keep going if you want to do better. You can’t keep going downhill, and
you don’t know where the absolute lowest point is, so you’re going to have to somehow
find it. There are many ways to do that, but here are a few:

1. Try lots of times with different random settings and share learning from each trial;
essentially, you are shaking the system to see if it settles in a lower state. If one
of the other trials found a lower valley, start with those settings.

2. Don’t just go downhill but stumble around a bit like a drunk, too (this is called
“stochastic gradient descent”). If you do this long enough, you’ll eventually find
rock bottom. There’s a metaphor for life in that.

3. Just look for “interesting” features, which are defined by diversity (edges or color
changes, for example). Warning: This way can lead to madness—too much
“interestingness” draws the network to optical illusions. So keep it sane, and
emphasize the kinds of features that are likely to be real in nature, as opposed to
artifacts or errors. This is called “regularization,” and there are lots of techniques
for this, such as whether those kinds of features have been seen before (learned),

Finally, as you know, Mr. Epstein and the USAO entered into an agreement that deferred
prosecution to the State. In this regard, I simply note that the manner in which this agreement
was negotiated contrasts sharply with Mr. Sloman’s current representation that “/T]he SDFL
indicated a willingness to defer to the State the length of incarceration...” See Tab 1, May 19,
2008 Letter from J. Sloman, p. 2. This statement is simply not true. Contrary to Mr. Sloman’s
assertion, federal prosecutors refused to accept what the State believed to be appropriate as to
Mr. Epstein’s sentence and instead, insisted that Mr. Epstein be required serve a two-year term of
imprisonment (which they later decreased to 18 months plus one year of house arrest). Federal
prosecutors have not only involved themselves in what is quintessentially a state matter, but their
actions have caused a critical appearance of impropriety that raises doubt as to their motivation
for investigating and prosecuting Mr. Epstein in the first place.

At bottom, we appreciate your willingness to review this matter with a fresh—and

US Equities Have Been Shunned All Along

In both our 2018 Outlook and mid-year update, we highlighted the surprising absence of inflows into
US equities based on flows into mutual funds and Exchange-Traded Funds. As shown in Exhibit 9,
flows into US equities were negative in 2018, even before the recent downdraft. In fact, US equities
have seen outflows of $81 billion through August 2018 (based on the most recent comprehensive
data), while non-US developed equities and emerging market equities have had inflows of $72 billion
and $20 billion respectively. This is further evidence of our view that while sentiment and short term
positioning among speculators and hedge fund managers shifts frequently, more stable investors
have shunned US equities during this long bull market in favor of other developed and emerging
market equities and global bonds.

This steady outflow of assets from US equities has been offset by record levels of stock buybacks by
US companies given high levels of profitability and incremental cash from repatriation of overseas
earnings, as mentioned above.

The observation is this: Much of what is wrong with the U.S.-Israel relationship today can be found in that
Romney trip. In recent years, the Republican Party has decided to make Israel a wedge issue. In order to garner
more Jewish (and evangelical) votes and money, the G.O.P. decided to “out-pro-Israel” the Democrats by being
even more unquestioning of Israel. This arms race has pulled the Democratic Party to the right on the Middle
East and has basically forced the Obama team to shut down the peace process and drop any demands that Israel
freeze settlements. This, in turn, has created a culture in Washington where State Department officials, not to
mention politicians, are reluctant to even state publicly what is U.S. policy — that settlements are “an obstacle
to peace” — for fear of being denounced as anti-Israel.

Add on top of that, the increasing role of money in U.S. politics and the importance of single donors who can
write megachecks to “super PACs” — and the fact that the main Israel lobby, Aipac, has made itself the feared
arbiter of which lawmakers are “pro” and which are “anti-Israel” and, therefore, who should get donations and
who should not — and you have a situation in which there are almost no brakes, no red lights, around Israel
coming from America anymore. No wonder settlers now boast on op-ed pages that the game Is over, they’ve
won, the West Bank will remain with Israel forever — and they don’t care what absorbing all of its Palestinians
will mean for Israel’s future as a Jewish democracy.

It is into this environment that Romney wandered to add more pandering and to declare how he will be so much
nicer to Israel than big, bad Obama. This is a canard. On what matters to Israel’s survival — advanced

Federal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations

16, 1949), promulgating 29 CFR 516.18,
the predecessor to 29 CFR 516.4.

5. The Teamsters 357 Decision

In response to the NPRM, the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce submitted a
comment that questions “‘how the
proposal can be said to be consistent
with” the Supreme Court’s decision in
Local 357, International Brotherhood of
Teamsters v. NLRB, 365 U.S. 667 (1961).
Specifically, the Chamber accuses the
Board of ignoring the Court’s
admonition in that case warning that
“Twl]here * * * Congress has aimed its
sanctions only at specific discriminatory
practices, the Board cannot go farther
and establish a broader, more pervasive
regulatory scheme.” Id. at 675. The
Chamber reads this statement out of
context.

To understand why the Board
disagrees with the Chamber’s view,
further explanation of Teamsters 357 is
necessary. In that case, the Supreme
Court rejected the Board’s conclusion
that a union had committed an unfair
labor practice by operating an exclusive
hiring hall pursuant to an agreement
that contained a nondiscrimination
clause but not three additional clauses
that the Board had previously declared
in its Mountain Pacific decision to be
necessary to prevent “ ‘unlawful
encouragement of union membership.’ ”’
Id. at 671 (quoting Mountain Pacific
Chapter, 119 NLRB 883, 897 (1958)).
The Court first noted that Congress had
examined the operation of hiring halls
and had decided not to ban them. Id. at
673-74. Next, the Court observed that
NLRA Section 8(a)(3) ‘“‘‘does not outlaw
all encouragement or discouragement of
membership in labor organizations; only
such as is accomplished by
discrimination is prohibited.’ ”’ Id. at
674-75 (emphasis added) (quoting
Radio Officers’ Union v. NLEBB, 347 U.S.
17, 42-43 (1954)). Since the hiring hall
agreement at issue in Teamsters 357
“specifically provide[d] that there will
be no discrimination * * * because of
the presence or absence of union
membership,” the Court determined
that the Board was attempting to protect
against nondiscriminatory
encouragement of union membership.
Id, at 675. This was impermissible
because “[wlhere * * * Congress has
aimed its sanctions only at specific
discriminatory practices, the Board
cannot go farther and establish a
broader, more pervasive regulatory
scheme.” Id. at 676.

Properly understood, Teamsters 357
does not preclude the Board from
issuing the notice posting rule. The
union had not committed an unfair
labor practice in that case because its

hiring hall agreement did not encourage
or discourage union membership by
“discrimination.” See id. at 674-75. By
faulting the union for not including in
its agreement clauses that the Board’s
Mountain Pacific rule had declared
necessary to prevent “ ‘unlawful
encouragement of union membership,’ ”
id. at 671 (quoting Mountain Pacific
Chapter, 119 NLRB at 897), the Board
had attempted to regulate hiring halls in
a manner that was facially inconsistent
with the discrimination requirement
embedded in NLRA Section 8(a)(3) and
(b)(2). Accordingly, the Chamber makes
too much of the Court’s statement
prohibiting the Board from
“establish[ing] a broader, more
pervasive regulatory scheme” when
“specific discriminatory practices’ have
already been outlawed. Id. at 676. By
that, the Court simply meant to remind
the Board that it may not
administratively amend Section 8(a)(3)
and (b)(2) to prohibit nondiscriminatory
activity that might be viewed as
undesirable because those statutory
sections are clearly aimed only at
“specific discriminatory practices.”
Id.46

This rulemaking does not involve
those provisions of the NLRA that
Teamsters 357 addressed. Accordingly,
the Board does not view that case as
controlling the outcome of this
proceeding.

6. Miscellaneous Matters

The Center on National Labor Policy,
Inc., argues that the Board ‘‘must be
mindful of the Supreme Court’s
admonition in Lechmere, Inc.] v. NLRB,
502 U.S. 527, 534 (1992), that an
employer possesses First Amendment
rights to its property.’’ The Board
disagrees that the property rights
discussed in Lechmere emanate from
the First Amendment, see Thunder
Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200,
217 n.21 (1994) (“The right of
employers to exclude union organizers
from their private property emanates
from state common law * * *.”), and to
the extent that the Center’s reference to
the First Amendment asserts a conflict
between these regulations and
employers’ right to free speech, that
argument is rejected for reasons
explained above. After quoting
extensively from Lechmere, the Center
next contends that “‘if a union has no
access to company property to
communicate with employees, neither

46 To the extent that the Board espoused a
contrary view of Teamsters 357 in a prior
rulemaking proceeding, that view is abandoned. See
Union Dues Regulation, 57 FR 43635, 43637-38
(Sept. 22, 1992), withdrawn, 61 FR 11167 (Mar. 19,
1996).

does the Board without Section 10(c)
authority.” The Board rejects this
argument because it fails to recognize
the important substantive difference
between the conduct at issue in
Lechmere, which involved “‘trespassory
organizational activity’”’ by
nonemployees on the employer’s
grounds, id. at 535 (quoting Sears,
Roebuck & Co. v. San Diego Dist.
Council of Carpenters, 436 U.S. 180, 205
(1978)), and the regulations here which
involve nothing more than the
employer’s responsibility to post an
official notice of legal rights.

The Portland Cement Association
(PCA) comments that the Board’s failure
to place the three law review articles
that the Board cited to the NPRM #7 in
the administrative docket is arbitrary
and capricious. Although the Board
provided the legal citations for these
articles, PCA believes that it should not
have to pay an electronic legal reporting
service to access the material. The Board
has placed these articles in the hard
copy docket, but has not uploaded these
articles to the electronic docket at
http://www.regulations.gov, because
such an action could violate copyright
laws.48

Finally, one comment contends that
requiring employers to set aside wall
space for posting the notices violates the
Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment
to the U.S. Constitution. The comment
cites no authority for this proposition,
which would seem to invalidate the
notice-posting requirements under all
other Federal and state workplace
statutes. Accordingly, the Board rejects
this contention.

In conclusion, the Board believe that
it has fully demonstrated that it
possesses sufficient statutory authority
to enact the final rule, and therefore that
it is not “‘in excess of statutory
jurisdiction” or “short of statutory
right’ within the meaning of the
Administrative Procedure Act, Section
706(2)(C), 5 U.S.C. 706(2)(C).

C. Factual Support for the Rule

As stated above, the Board found that
the notice posting rule is needed
because it believes that many employees
are unaware of their NLRA rights and
therefore cannot effectively exercise
those rights. The Board based this
finding on several factors: the
comparatively small percentage of
private sector employees who are
represented by unions and thus have
ready access to information about the

47 See NPRM, 75 FR 80411 and fn. 3 above.

48 The Board has also placed the other non-case
materials cited to in this final rule into the hard
copy docket.

21. At the appropriate time in this litigation, Plaintiff shall amend her complaint to
assert a claim for punitive damages against Defendants in order to punish Defendants for their

actions and to deter Defendants from repeating their conduct.

TOLLING OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

22. Any statute of limitations applicable to rape, sexual misconduct, criminal sexual
acts, sexual abuse, forcible touching, assault, battery, intentional and reckless infliction of
emotional distress, false imprisonment of a minor, if any, is tolled owing to the continuous and
active duress imposed upon Plaintiff by Defendants that effectively robbed Plaintiff of her free
will to commence legal action until the present time. Cullen v. Margiotta, 811 F.2d 698, 722
(2nd Cir.1987); Ross v. United States, 574 F. Supp. 536, 542 (S.D.N.Y. 1983). More
particularly, Plaintiff was unrelentingly threatened by each Defendant that, were she ever to
reveal any of the details of the sexual and physical abuse caused to her by Defendants, Plaintiff
and her family would be physically harmed if not killed. The duress has not terminated and the
fear has not subsided. The duress is an element of or inherent in the underlying causes of action
complained of herein. The duress and coercion exerted by Defendants has been such as to have
actually deprived Plaintiff of her freedom of will to institute suit earlier in time, and it rose to
such a level that a person of reasonable firmness in Plaintiff's situation would have been unable
to resist. Exhs. A and B.

23. Both Defendants let Plaintiff know that each was a very wealthy, powerful man
and indicated that they had the power, ability and means to carry out their threats. Indeed,
Defendant Trump stated that Plaintiff shouldn’t ever say anything if she didn’t want to disappear

Hezbollah is a political party with a militia. That’s a big problem.
Israel’s ultra-Orthodox Shas party has an outsized influence over
Israel because of coalition politics. That’s a problem. The Muslim
Brotherhood will loom large in a free Egypt because it has an
organizational head start. That may be a problem. Turkey’s ruling
Justice and Development Party is a brilliant political machine with a
ruthless bent. That’s a problem, too.

These are problems of different sizes. But give me all these problems
so long as they present themselves within open (or opening) systems.
They are far preferable to the cowed conformity common to the
terrorized societies of the now doomed Arab Jurassic Park, where
despots do their worst.

It’s over: Enough of the nameless graves that whisper of horror,
enough of the 20th-century police states in the 21st-century. Yes, it’s
over for Ben Ali and for Mubarak. It’s over for Qaddafi, yes it is.
How far it’s over for the other Arab despots and autocrats, whether of
the oxymoronic “republics” or the royals, will depend on how far
they can get out in front of their citizens’ demand to be heard.

You see, you can’t do Hama any more. You can’t do the Iraqi
marshes. Perhaps you can kill dozens, but not tens of thousands.
These despots relied on the limitlessness of their terror. It had to be
as absolute as their contempt for the law.

But now people know. They communicate through the clampdowns.
They are Facebook-nimble. The despots gaze into their gilded mirrors
and, to their horror, see not themselves but the people who will be
silenced no longer. They wonder then if their own myriad agents can
be trusted. They are caught in their own web. They flail; they have
gone too far to turn back but cannot go forward.

something Sunday, before deciding not to. He was trained in west

were to testify truthfully, the testimony would be beneficial

to Ms. Maxwell.

If you ever get the opportunity to watch the video of

these two witnesses, your Honor, it's remarkable because

there's a lot of eye rolling and facial expressions in response

to the leading questions by plaintiff's lawyers that, in my

analysis -- I may be testifying, your Honor, I must admit. But
in my observation, it was basically a nonverbal that's not

true and then the invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege,

and if that gets played for the jury, the jury can see that or

you can see it. At one point Ms. McCawley chided one of these

that the witness was using to invoke the Fifth Amendment

Fifth, Jane Doe #3 claims that she needed to include Prof. Dershowitz in her filing
because her CVRA claim of “unfair” treatment “implicates a fact-sensitive equitable defense
which must be considered in the factual context of the entire interface between Epstein, the
relevant prosecutorial authorities and the federal offense victims.” The “facts” to which this
“defense” is sensitive, even if Jane Doe #3 is allowed to intervene, are the interactions between
the prosecutors and Jane Doe #3, and not anything pertinent to Prof. Dershowitz personally. Nor
are attorney-client communications between Epstein and his counsel at issue, or the proper
subject of discovery in this action under any scenario.

Ill. Jane Doe #3’s Efforts to Bolster Her Lies About
Prof. Dershowitz Are Remarkably Thin

Setting aside the utter irrelevancy of the allegations against Prof. Dershowitz, having
created an international imbroglio by their ill-conceived libels of Prof. Dershowitz, one would
expect that Jane Doe #3 would be able to muster at least some credible support for their
allegations. Yet the two “incontestable” facts she leads with in support of her claim that Prof.
Dershowitz is a serial sex abuser are (1) that Mr. Epstein and Prof. Dershowitz were friends; and
(2) Prof. Dershowitz visited Mr. Epstein’s house. Of course, these supposedly “incontestable”
facts are evidence of nothing.

In the affidavit she submitted to this court, Jane Doe #3’s lack of credibility is readily
apparent. She has now sworn under oath, repeating a fragrant lie that she had previously sold to
a British newspaper: namely that “former President Bill Clinton was present on the island
[Jeffrey Epstein’s private island] at a time when [Jane Doe #3] was also present on the island.”

Federal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations

75 FR 80418-80419 (footnote omitted).

The Board received a few suggestions
for changes to the introduction of the
notice. The first comment suggests
including language stating that
employees are required to contact their
“executive manager” or ‘‘administrative
team” before contacting the NLRB and
suggests that the NLRB refuse to process
employees’ complaints until the
employees first raise the issue with his
or her ‘‘management team.” The second
comment, from COLLE, urges the Board
to add language in the introduction
alerting employees that they also have
the right to refrain from engaging in
union activity. The comment suggests
that by not including the right to refrain
from union activity in the introduction,
the Board is showing a bias toward
union organizing. The comment argues
that a more neutral notice would
include both the right to engage and not
engage in union activity at the
beginning of the document, rather than
wait to first mention the right to refrain
in the affirmative rights section.

The Board does not agree with the
proposal that employees be required to
contact management officials as a
prerequisite to contacting the Board.
Such a procedural requirement is not
contemplated in the NLRA and could
discourage employees from exercising
or vindicating their rights.

The Board agrees, however, that the
introduction should include both the
rights to engage in union and other
concerted activity and the right to
refrain from doing so. The Board
believes that adding the right to refrain
to the introduction will aid in the
Board’s approach to present a balanced
and neutral statement of rights.
Accordingly, the first sentence in the
introduction to the notice in the final
rule will state:

The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)
guarantees the right of employees to organize
and bargain collectively with their
employers, and to engage in other protected
concerted activity or to refrain from engaging
in any of the above activity.

b. Comments Regarding Affirmative
Statement of Rights

The proposed notice contains the
following statement of affirmative
rights: Under the NLRA, you have the
right to:

Organize a union to negotiate with your
employer concerning your wages, hours, and
other terms and conditions of employment.

Form, join or assist a union.

Bargain collectively through
representatives of employees’ own choosing
for a contract with your employer setting
your wages, benefits, hours, and other
working conditions.

Discuss your terms and conditions of
employment or union organizing with your
co-workers or a union.

Take action with one or more co-workers
to improve your working conditions by,
among other means, raising work-related
complaints directly with your employer or
with a government agency, and seeking help
from a union.

Strike and picket, depending on the
purpose or means of the strike or the
picketing.

Choose not to do any of these activities,
including joining or remaining a member of
a union.

75 FR 80419.

The majority of comments addressing
the affirmative rights section were
general and did not specifically address
the language of the individual
provisions. Generally, labor
organizations and employee advocate
groups favor the Board’s language. A
comment from the United Food and
Commercial Workers International
Union asserts that the approach
“achieves an appropriate balance
between providing sufficiently clear
information about employee’s basic
statutory rights and limiting
unnecessary and confusing information
about peripheral rights.’’ On the other
hand, comments from employer groups
do not favor the Board’s language. More
specifically, employer groups argue that
the notice is biased toward union
organizing. Generally, the comments
argue that the right to refrain from
engaging in union activity should have
a more prominent place on the notice,
rather than being the last of the rights
listed on the poster. Many of these
comments contend that the notice
should include the right not to engage
in specific union-related activities.

Other comments about the notice’s
statement of affirmative rights are
directed at individual provisions of the
notice. A discussion of those comments
is set out in more detail below.

i. The Right To Organize and the Right
To Form, Join and Assist a Union

A few comments generally state that
the notice should include the
consequences of exercising the right to
organize, join or form a union.1°> For
example, several comments argue that
employees should be informed that if
they join a union they give up the right
to deal directly with their employers.
Another comment argues that
employees should be informed of the
cost of organizing a union, including the
cost of dues and the potential for the
company to shut down because of
increased labor costs associated with a
unionized workforce. Other comments

105 See, e.g., comment of Pilchak Cohen & Tice.

suggest including language informing
employees that they can be fired for not
paying their union dues.

The Board rejects those suggestions.
The notice is intended to inform
employees of the rights that they have
under the NLRA and does not include
the benefits or consequences of
exercising any of the enumerated rights.
Adding the consequences of one right
would require revising the entire notice
to include potential consequences—
both positive and negative—of all the
protected rights. For example, the notice
would need to include the
consequences of refraining from joining
a union, such as not being permitted to
vote on contract ratifications or attend
union membership meetings. The
necessary additions to the notice would
create a notice that is not a concise list
of rights, but more likely a pamphlet-
sized list of rights and explanations. In
addition, the consequences of
unionization are unique to each
unionized workplace, so it would be
impossible to include a list of general
consequences that could apply
uniformly to all unionized workplaces.
If employees have questions about the
implications of any of their rights, they
can contact an NLRB regional office.

Assisted Living Federation of America
(ALFA) suggests that the affirmative
rights section should be revised to
reflect the anti-union position. For
example, rather than the current
provision that states that employees
have a right to “organize a union to
negotiate with your employer
concerning your wages, hours, and other
terms and conditions of employment,”
the comment suggests the following
provision: ‘‘you have the right to
organize with other employees in
opposition to a particular union or
unions.”’ And “you have the right to:
refuse to form, join, or assist a union,
including the right to refuse to sign a
union card, attend a union meeting or
supply a union with information
concerning you, your co-worker or your
job,” rather than “‘[you have the right to]
[florm, join or assist a union.” The
Board disagrees. The Board’s proposed
notice language reflects the language of
the NLRA itself, which specifically
grants affirmative rights, including
nearly all of those listed in the notice.
Also, the notice, like the NLRA, states
that employees have the right to refrain
from engaging in all of the listed
activities. The Board therefore sees no
need to recast the notice to further
emphasize the right to oppose unions.

ii. The Right To Bargain Collectively

Two comments suggest that the
collective-bargaining provision is

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029514.txt,"you would be told, 'This is a hand, you have a body,' and then you would have an
interpretation of that experience, which you would call a thought. And then you would also
be told, 'This is your body. You have a mind. You’re Indian. And you come from a Hindu
family.’ All social constructs. Fundamental reality is sensory perception, which is an
activation of consciousness, and its interpretation is thought. The rest is a story. Mind, body,
and even universe is a story. Well, that was pretty mind-boggling for a young person at
the age of 35. I’d already trained now, here. Slowly, that lead to how one construct leads to
another construct. Okay, so this is an iPhone. It’s matter. Well I have now reified sensory
experience in consciousness, an activity of consciousness 1n consciousness, with a construct,
iPhone. Then I reify it further, made of matter. And now this is very convenient. I can study
it. It?s made of molecules, made of atoms. So one construct leads to another construct,
particles. Then you get ultimately to possibility waves and then you’re stuck again.

Okay [laughter], but along the chain, one construct built to another construct to another
construct to another construct. Very useful. New York City is a construct. Latitude is a
construct. Longitude is a construct. Time is it construct. Money is a construct. Wall Street is
a construct. Religion is a construct. God is a construct. Universe is a construct, which you
call a model, Okay. So, this led me to consciousness, exploring consciousness. Where now,
you have—you know I just came from this conference, on the science of consciousness,
where you have physicalists, you have dualists, you have panpsychists, you have idealists,
and they’re all arguing about the constructs.

So the physicalists are now in a difficult position, because they’re trying to explain
consciousness with the construct of physicality, and you can’t. Because physicality itself is a
construct. Then you have the idealists going back to Plato who are saying it’s all mental. But
even mental ideas are constructs. Then you have the dualists, Descartes, the two are
separate, mind and body. But then how do you explain their interaction? It violates simple
laws like thermodynamics. If mind is separate and body is separate, how do I lift my arm? I
start with a thought so I do this. How do I speak, how do I walk, how do I do anything? So,
dualism doesn’t make me happy. Idealism doesn’t make me happy. Physicalism, I don’t
know what matter is anymore.

I interviewed the Nobel laureate Wilczek, physicist from MIT. So I said, What is

matter? It’s particles. I said, What are particles, subatomic particles? He says, They are
little things. I said, But then everybody says that’s a wave potential, that’s in Hilbert space.
What is that? Where is Hilbert space? He says, It’s mathematical. What is it? It’s
infinitely dimensional or zero dimensional. Where is it? The usual answer is Shut up and
calculate, right? So I realized that the entire new paradigm of multiverse, superstrings,
eternal inflation, whatever, is all in mathematical imagination. Hilbert space is in
mathematical imagination, the wave potential is in mathematical imagination. I said to
Wilczek, What is matter? And he said, We’re still trying to figure that out. [Laughter.] I

see Colonel Qaddafi gone, he also said that the air war was unlikely
to accomplish that by itself. Most important, he vowed that there
would be no American ground troops in this fight. “If we tried to
overthrow Qaddafi by force,” he said, “our coalition would splinter.”
He said “regime change” in Iraq took eight years and cost thousands
of American and Iraqi lives. “That is not something we can afford to
repeat in Libya.” Instead, he said the United States and its allies
would work to increase the diplomatic and military pressure on
Colonel Qaddafi and his cronies. A meeting on Tuesday with allies
and members of the Libyan opposition is supposed to develop that
strategy along with ways to help the rebels build alternate, and we
hope humane and competent, governing structures. That needs to
start quickly. To hold their ground and protect endangered civilians,
let alone advance, the rebels will likely need air support for quite
some time. Mr. Obama was right not to promise a swift end to the air
campaign. At the same time, he should not overestimate the patience
of the American people or the weariness of the overstretched military.
And as Washington reduces its military role, others, inside and
outside NATO, will need to increase theirs. Within NATO,
unenthusiastic partners like Germany and Turkey need to at least stay
out of the way even if they continue to stand aside from the fighting.
The president made the right choice to act, but this is a war of choice,
not necessity. Presidents should not commit the military to battle
without consulting Congress and explaining their reasons to the
American people. Fortunately, initial coalition military operations
have gone well. Unfortunately, it is the nature of war that they will
not always go well. Mr. Obama needs to work with Congress and
keep the public fully informed. On Monday, he made an overdue start
on that.

Relevant Past Cases

We have not been able to find a single federal prosecution based on facts like these—but
have voluminous evidence of federal prosecutors routinely declining to bring charges in cases far
more egregious than this one. To take just one obvious example, federal prosecutors have self-
consciously refrained from involvement in the literally dozens of sexual cases of former priests,
opting instead to allow seasoned state prosecutors (like the ones in this case) to pursue the
accused former clergymen. That is so despite (1) the large number of victims, (2) the vast
geographic diversity of the cases, and (3) the fact that some of these cases involve allegations
that the defendant forcibly molested, abused, or raped literally dozens of children—including
some as young as five years old—over a period of years. Nonetheless, federal prosecutors have
not hesitated to let their state counterparts pursue these cases free from federal interference—
even though the sentences meted out vary greatly on account of the fact that “[c]riminal penalties
are specific to localities or jurisdictions.”3 The facts of this case, which involve the solicitation
of consensual topless massages and some sexual contact, entirely in the privacy of his home and
almost entirely by women over the age of 18, pale in comparison to the outright sexual abuse and
degradation of preteen minors in many of the priest cases.

Nor does this case bear any of the hallmarks that typify the cases that federal prosecutors
have pursued under the federal statutes at issue here. When asked, the closest case suggested by
the prosecutors was United States v. Boehm—and it hardly could differ more from Mr. Epstein’s
case. In Boehm, the defendant was charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine and cocaine
base to minors, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 846, 841(a)(1), and 859(a); being a felon in
possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1); and sex trafficking of children in
violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 371 and 1591. United States v. Boehm, Case No. 3:04CR00003 (D.
Alaska 2004). Boehm’s actions, unlike Mr. Epstein’s, also had a strong interstate nexus: Boehm
purchased and distributed large quantities of crack cocaine and cocaine that traveled in interstate
commerce, and he used his home and hotels (which were used by interstate travelers) to purchase
drugs and distribute them to minors while also arranging for these minors to have sex with him
and others. Indeed, Boehm not only (1) purchased cocaine in large quantities; (2) distributed the
drugs to minors; (3) possessed illegal firearms; (4) and arranged for the minors to have sex with
other members of the conspiracy in exchange for drugs; but (5) admitted to knowing the ages of
the individuals involved.4 Here, by contrast, as previous stated, all of the conduct took place in
Mr. Epstein’s private home in Palm Beach; there was no for-profit enterprise; no interstate
component; no use by Mr. Epstein of an instrumentality of interstate commerce; no violence; no
force; no alcohol; no drugs; no guns; and no child pornography.

4 In fact, Boehm and his co-defendants distributed drugs to approximately 12 persons between the ages of 13 and
21. Boehm also had a prior criminal history—and one that clearly showed he was a danger to society: he

previously had been convicted of raping both a thirteen year-old girl and a fifteen year-old girl. (Day 7 of
Sentencing hearing p. 32).

Q. Didn't he take the Fifth with respect to a

A. With some other people, yes, but not with

If you look at the Jeffrey Epstein answers to

person under the age of 18 for prostitution - does not account for all five of the girls,

one as young as 14, who alleged that Epstein sexually abused them. And why is Epstein
serving his term in the overcrowded Palm Beach County Jail and not a state prison, where
inmates are sent if their sentences are longer than one year?

The slow, dissatisfying resolution of the case sends a message to the public

Post your that there's a different system of justice for the wealthy who hire highcomments
powered lawyers. Epstein's legal team included West Palm Beach defense

on this attorney Jack Goldberger, Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz,

who defended O.J. Simpson against murder charges, and Kenneth Starr, the

prosecutor who pursued then-President Bill Clinton for lying about sex with

young women.

Palm Beach police spent 11 months investigating Epstein before State Attorney Barry
Krischer sent the case to a grand jury, instead of charging Epstein so the man who once
boasted of accepting only billionaire clients could face a trial. The police had taken a high
school transcript, class schedules and phone messages from Epstein's home that showed
he knew the girls were underage. Yet Mr. Krischer was more swayed by Epstein's
lawyers, who attempted to impugn the girls' character by showing they had chatted on
myspace.com about smoking marijuana and drinking. He should have let a jury decide
whether the victims - and Epstein - were credible.

Ultimately, one charge against Epstein finally reflected the age of one victim, and the
plea agreement left Epstein labeled a sex offender. With that additional charge, if Epstein
had been convicted at a trial, he could have been sentenced to anything from probation to
15 years in prison, Assistant State Attorney Lanna Belohlavek said, adding that the
recommended guideline sentence was 21 months.

Epstein also won't have to certify to the court that he is recetving counseling, typically
required of sex offenders, because he has a private psychiatrist. But without court
supervision, who will ensure Epstein is in fact being treated?

The plea deal also drops a federal investigation of Epstein. If a federal investigation was
warranted, how does dropping it before completion benefit the public?

Epstein preyed on girls and denied it. For three years, his wealth and the influence of his
lawyers bought him the protection the state attorney owed to the victims.

IT looks like New York billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein got off easy when he was hit
with a charge of soliciting a prostitute for a happy ending in Palm Beach.

Because if Palm Beach police had their way, Epstein, 53 - who surrendered last Sunday
and is out on $3,000 bail - might have been whacked with far more serious charges of

paying underage girls for sex.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019901.txt,"Trump’s understanding of his own essential nature was even more precise. Once,
coming back on his plane with a billionaire friend who had brought along a foreign model,
Trump, trying to move in on his friend’s date, urged a stop in Atlantic City. He would
provide a tour of his casino. His friend assured the model that there was nothing to
recommend Atlantic City. It was a place overrun by white trash.

“What is this “white trash’?” asked the model.
“They’re people just like me,” said Trump, “only they’re poor.”

He looked for a license not to conform, not to be respectable. It was something of an
outlaw prescription for winning—and winning, however you won, was what it was all
about.

Or, as his friends would observe, mindful themselves not to be taken in, he simply had
no scruples. He was a rebel, a disruptor, and, living outside the rules, contemptuous of
them. A close Trump friend who was also a good Bill Clinton friend found them eerily
similar—except that Clinton had a respectable front and Trump did not.

One manifestation of this outlaw personality, for both Trump and Clinton, was their
brand of womanizing—and indeed, harassing. Even among world-class womanizers and
harassers, they seemed exceptionally free of doubt or hesitation.

Trump liked to say that one of the things that made life worth living was getting your
friends’ wives into bed. In pursuing a friend’s wife, he would try to persuade the wife that
her husband was perhaps not what she thought. Then he’d have his secretary ask the friend
into his office; once the friend arrived, Trump would engage in what was, for him, more or
less constant sexual banter. Do you still like having sex with your wife? How often? You
must have had a better fuck than your wife? Tell me about it. I have girls coming in from
Los Angeles at three o’clock. We can go upstairs and have a great time. I promise ... And
all the while, Trump would have his friend’s wife on the speakerphone, listening in.

Previous presidents, and not just Clinton, have of course lacked scruples. What was, to
many of the people who knew Trump well, much more confounding was that he had
managed to win this election, and arrive at this ultimate accomplishment, wholly lacking
what in some obvious sense must be the main requirement of the job, what neuroscientists
would call executive function. He had somehow won the race for president, but his brain
seemed incapable of performing what would be essential tasks in his new job. He had no
ability to plan and organize and pay attention and switch focus; he had never been able to
tailor his behavior to what the goals at hand reasonably required. On the most basic level,
he simply could not link cause and effect.

The charge that Trump colluded with the Russians to win the election, which he
scoffed at, was, in the estimation of some of his friends, a perfect example of his inability
to connect the dots. Even if he hadn’t personally conspired with the Russians to fix the
election, his efforts to curry favor with, of all people, Vladimir Putin had no doubt left a

she could apply, but she should know that there are only a few grants in each round; most projects proposed 
don't get funding. It is like rolling the dice. what people don't understand is that many grants are not funded not 
because they are defective in any way, but simply because there is not enough funding to cover even a part of 
what comes in (there are thousands of applications and hundreds of millions of dollars of requests that go all 
through different kinds of review; it is hard to know what will make it through because different people make 
the priority decisions at different stages of review; and it depends what other applications are in the pool in a

This end-of-the-year letter is to catch you up on developments and to report progress made in 2016 
by Poetry in America, by its associated non-profit production company, Verse Video Education, and 
by (and with) our new Harvard partner, the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning. Whether 
you are a longstanding adviser and supporter of Poetry in America, or you've more recently joined 
our circle of proponents, your contributions, thought partnership and enthusiasm have made this 
year's successes possible. 
Last fall, I knew this would be a crucial year. Goals for 2016 included moving our co-produced 
television series, Poetry in America, toward a concrete release date (now entering post-production, 
we launch nationwide in April 2018), converting our six HarvardX MOOC modules into for-credit 
courses (now complete and being offered by Harvard's Division of Continuing Education), and 
getting the word out on our first course developed especially for K-12 educators, Poetry in America  
for Teachers: The City from Whitman to Hip Hop. With a mission of creating and distributing the 
highest-quality humanities content for a wide variety of learners, our projects now rely on a salaried 
production staff of five, a rotating corps of part timers and contractors, and a growing cohort of 
Harvard graduate students, undergraduates and interns whom we train in the public-facing 
humanities. Growing fast, in 2016 we more firmly established Verse Video Education as a nimble 
and stable producer of humanities-based content (now including an archive of over 120 separate 
interviews with distinguished discussants), while also defining a forward-looking partnership and 
growth strategy with Harvard. As 2016 draws to a close, I have much progress to report. 
Verse Video Education: Independent 501c3 
In April 2016, Verse Video Education, the fledgling production company I'd founded in 2014, 
received IRS approval and became a 501c3. Now capable of accepting philanthropic contributions, 
Verse Video Education has also begun to generate revenue by producing high-quality educational 
media for other institutions. Clients within our first year included Greenwich Country Day School, 
YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, Schlesinger Library, Harvard Institute for Global Health, and 
Project Zero. While philanthropic donations remain essential, work for clients allows us to amplify the 
impact of philanthropic donations, not only permitting additional investment in our flagship 
partnerships with WGBH and Harvard, but also fostering development of new partnerships and 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 019330 
projects. These include a video series on poetry and science now running with award-winning 
magazine Nautilus, a collaboration with distinguished poet Robert Pinsky and his Favorite Poem 
Project, and an expansion of our poetry film series with partners at The Nantucket Project. Advised 
by a stellar and diversely talented board, Verse Video Education is looking toward sustainability. We 
are now discussing distribution of new content with a variety of stakeholders, including media 
providers in China. 
New Harvard Partner: Bok Center for Teaching and Learning 
Meanwhile, Poetry in America has deepened its partnership and formulated a plan for growth going 
forward at Harvard. This fall, Harvard's Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Mike Smith, 
endorsed the integration and expansion of my public-facing humanities work within the Derek Bok 
Center for Teaching and Learning. As a Bok Fellow this year, and alongside Bok director Rob Lue in 
the years to come, I will be working to substantially expand Bok's capacity and resources to train 
humanists in 21st-century methods of public engagement-- developing courses, digital fellowship 
opportunities and also securing distribution outlets and partners for content produced in Bok by 
Harvard humanists. By next year at this time, I will be turning some of my attention beyond poetry 
(my favorite, but hardly the only humanistic mode of communication!) to create a wider base of 
humanities materials for use in American schools and other institutions. We will begin integrating and 
anchoring Poetry in America content (on art, sport and play; on the environment; and on health and 
well being) with content created by others. As I continue to experiment with use of digital media 
within my residential courses for undergraduates and graduates, I shall also be working with other 
faculty and graduate students. My work at Bok will also facilitate collaborations between humanists 
working across the whole university. Projects for 2017 include work with HarvardX on drama and 
Shakespeare, with Harvard's Center for the Environment, with the Arts and Humanities Initiative at 
Harvard Medical School, and with several programs within Harvard's Graduate School of Education. 
Launching in 2017: Our First Course Designed Specifically for Teachers 
Verse Video Education has allocated much of its staff time this year to bringing its first course 
designed specifically to support the American secondary classroom to completion. Poetry in America 
for Teachers: The City from Whitman to Hip Hop draws on assets created at HarvardX, along with 
footage captured with our TV partners and independently by Verse Video Education. The resulting 
course, designed for English, Social Studies, and Arts teachers, as well as for librarians, 
administrators and others, provides deep content instruction as well as pedagogical training. 
Common Core aligned, this course, the first of its kind, is now open for enrollment, and will launch 
January 23rd. We are currently discussing group enrollments with major educational systems and 
reformers across the nation, and we are also raising scholarship funds for strapped enrollees. Over 
time, we hope to play a leading role in improving literacy and in strengthening the humanities across 
the American educational landscape. 
Airing Nationwide in 2018: Poetry in America, The Television Series 
In May 2016, Verse Video Education was asked by WGBH and American Public Television to 
expand its television series in development from 8 to 13 episodes, listed below. 
The following episodes are entering post-production: 
On Edward Hirsch's Fast Break: Shaquille O'Neal, Pau Gasol, Shane Battier, Edward Hirsch, 
and an on-court pick-up basketball chorus filmed at Success Academy Charter School; On W.H. 
Auden's Musee Des Beaux Arts: Ambassador Samantha Power, David Brooks, Peter Sacks; On 
Robert Hayden's Those Winter Sundays: Vice President Joe Biden, Elizabeth Alexander, 
Angela Duckworth, Kevin Young, and a chorus of fathers and sons; On Carl Sandburg's 
Skyscraper: Frank Gehry, Robert Polito, and a chorus of Young Student Poets; On Nas's New 
York State of Mind: Nas, Russell Simmons, Salamishah Tillet, Steve Stoute, and a chorus of hip 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 019331 
hop heads; On Galway Kinnell's The Grey Heron: E.O. Wilson, Robert Hass, Laura McPhee; 
On Gwendolyn Brooks's To Prisoners: Anna Deveare Smith, Reginald Dwayne Betts, Li-Young 
Lee and a chorus of exonerees from the Innocence Project; On William Carlos Williams's This Is 
Just To Say: Woody Allen, Jane Hirshfield, Rafael Campo and a chorus of couples young and old; 
On Langston Hughes's Harlem: President Bill Clinton, Herbie Hancock, Sonia Sanchez and a 
chorus of children from Promise Academy; On Allen Ginsberg's Hymmnn from Kaddish and 
Hum Bom: Bono, Juan Felipe Herrera and a chorus of clergy. 
The production of the following episodes will wrap early 2017: 
On Emily Dickinson's I cannot dance opon my Toes: Cynthia Nixon, Yo Yo Ma, Marie Howe 
and Bill T. Jones; On Marianne Moore's The Fish: Jorie Graham, Edward Norton, Conservation 
International scientists, and the passengers and crew of oceanographic vessel The Alucia; On 
Elizabeth Bishop's One Art or Edna St. Vincent Millay's Four Sonnets. 
Jeffrey, 
Just a quick note to thank you again for all the help you've given me. The generous contribution you 
made last year to Verse Video Education is now in use (we've hired our new editor!). Once he helps 
us to plow through the work of this year, we'll begin to look forward to crafting educational content on 
the literature of art, sport and play (these materials now including footage from recent shoots with 
Shaquille O'Neal, Yo Yo Ma, Cynthia Nixon, Bono and others). 100K makes so much possible. 
But, of course, you've also been a key preceptor as I've learned how --squirming all the way--the 
sausage really gets made in public television. I can't say I've been entirely successful in taming costs 
there, but I've been far better armed and more mindful of what they should be after the stern tutorial 
you administered. 
Whenever Templeton might be ready to evaluate another application, I'm ready for another proposal 
for them. I wonder if you might arrange a meeting for me with the famous Bamaby? I can't yet afford 
a grant writer, and so the time one of these suckers takes makes me think doing more advance 
reconnaissance is crucial. Would he meet with me? Kosher? I'd also love to meet with the Blacks as 
I get closer to making content on theatre. I hope that Debra is well.

2004 remains a source of controversy
among his PLO loyalists, many of
whom believe he was poisoned

by Mossad, the Israeli intelligence
service. By the time Shimon Peres, the
Nobel Prize-winning prime minister
of Israel who helped resolve many of
the more intangible issues, died more
peacefully aged 93 in 2016, he had
become one of the most accomplished
statesmen of our age.

But perhaps the greatest casualty
from that era - when there were
genuine expectations on both sides of
the Israeli-Palestinian divide that the
conflict might be resolved peacefully
— has been the peace process itself,
which today is almost nonexistent.
When, for example, I told an Arab
ambassador acquaintance I was
going to see a preview of the play,
he simply remarked: “No one talks
about the peace process any more. It
doesn’t exist.”

This makes Roger’s examination of
one of the most unlikely diplomatic
dialogues ever undertaken all the
more poignant, as it harks back to
an era when reconciliation seemed
genuinely possible.

The task facing the rival delegates
when they first meet is a daunting
one. For the Israelis, if the fact became
known that they were talking to the
PLO, the government would most
likely fall. For the Palestinians, it
would mean an assassin’s bullet.

At the heart of this danse macabre
stands Red-Larsen, whom I met on
several occasions in Jerusalem in the
Nineties when the hard work had
begun on implementing the deal. A
quiet, patient man, he never seemed
to be entirely comfortable with the
rough-house atmosphere of the
region, where disputes were often
more likely to be resolved through
rocks and rubber bullets than rational
persuasion.

Toby Stephens’s portrayal of Red-
Larsen gives him a great deal more
zest and personality than I recall, but
this neatly nuanced performance is
key to the pace of this fast-moving,
entertaining take on the events (Rogers
has said that, in order to liven up what
might otherwise seem a prosaic and
convoluted political process, he studied

the plays ot Noél Coward).

is the one where the lead Israeli
negotiator, taking a break from

the negotiations, entertains his
Palestinian counterparts by giving
an impersonation of Arafat as an
effeminate narcissist, a portrayal I
found entirely plausible from my
own encounters with the PLO leader,
whose vanity knew no bounds.

Uri Savir, who was deputed by
Peres to run the Israeli side of the
negotiations, was someone else I
got to know during that period. An
urbane multi-linguist of an academic
disposition, I generally found Uri to
be softly spoken and thoughtful when
discussing regional issues. Philip
Arditti’s portrayal of him in the play,
though, makes him out to be more
like the uncompromising, muscular
Israeli type, more usually found in the
ranks of the security forces than in the
diplomatic service.

Depictions in theatre of almost
anything to do with the Middle East
tend to stir strong passions among
audiences. I was particularly struck by
Rogers’ sympathetic understanding
of the Palestinian predicament. “I was
very anxious about the combustibility
of it,” said Rogers in a recent
interview. “I assumed there would be
controversy lin America] only because
someone would be enraged that I had
allowed the ‘other side’ to have their
say.” Certainly Peter Polycarpou’s
depiction of Ahmed Qurei, the
Palestinian finance minister sent
by Arafat to make peace, admirably
captures the conflicting emotions
of enduring the pain of exile while
seeking to wreak terrible vengeance
on the Israeli occupiers.

Indeed, for all the quips and
light-hearted banter, Os/o is, at heart,
a deeply emotional drama. When the
Israelis finally strike a deal with the
Palestinians during a telephone call to
Arafat’s headquarters in Tunis, they
think they can hear music playing
in the background. In fact it is the
battle-hardened veterans of the PLO
sobbing at the prospect of being
allowed to return to their homeland.

Ultimately, the play is an implicit
tragedy about the failure of both sides
to build a lasting peace on the basis of
the painful concessions made during

Despite the crass partisan political objective of the undertaking and its utter incompatibility with
the Constitution O’Connor had sworn to uphold, she agreed to help, writing the following letter
for publication:

“You wrote me recently to inquire about any holdings of this Court to the effect that this
is a Christian nation. There are statements to such effect in the following opinions:
Church of the Holy Trinity vs. United States; Zorach vs. Clauson; McGowan vs.
Maryland.”

Not only was O’Connor wrong to write any letter in support of this unconstitutional, partisan,
kooky proposal, she was wrong on the law, wrong on the facts and wrong on her history. First of
all, if this were a “Christian” nation, its form of Christianity would be decidedly Protestant.
Catholics would be second class citizens. Indeed our Constitution, and the earlier Declaration of
Independence, were designed, at least in part, to protect Americans from the influence of the
Catholic Church, which was reviled by many of our founding fathers, including Adams and
Jefferson. (“Monkish ignorance” was a clear reference to the Catholic Church.)” Second, there
are no such “holdings.” Third, the first case she cited (which had long ago been discarded, if not
overruled) contained—in dictum—some of the most bigoted language in Supreme Court history
by one of the most bigoted Justice in its history, David Brewer.

Brewer’s dictum, in an obscure immigration case, declared “Mohomet” and “the Grand Lama” to
be “imposters.” In his other writings and speeches, he decried the evil of Mormonism and other
non-Christian faiths. He was an anti-Catholic bigot and an anti-Semite, as well as a racist and
segregationist. He believed that we were a white Protestant nation and he smuggled the concept
of a “Christian nation” into dictum not even in a case that did not even raise the issue.

When, in 1892, Brewer wrote the disgraceful and bigoted opinion cited by O’Connor, the U.S.
was, demographically, a white Protestant Christian nation. The nation’s demography changed
dramatically in the nearly a century between that decision and O’Connor’s letter. And the law
reflected that change.

Since 1892, the court has not referred to this nation as “Christian” or “Protestant.” Indeed, the
justices have gone out of their way to be inclusive. For example, when Justice William O.
Douglas sustained a New York program permitting public school students to be released for an
hour each week for religious instruction, he specifically gave as an example of religious
accommodations “a Jewish student [asking] his teacher for permission to be excused for Yom
Kippur.” Yet this was one of the decisions miscited by Justice O’Connor as containing statements
to the effect that this is a Christian nation.”

When her letter was disclosed, Justice O’Connor issued a statement regretting that it has been
“used in a political debate,” and the Supreme Court media office said that O’Connor “had no

» Cite Jefferson

3 Tn at least one, a justice said—in passing—that “we are a Christian people.” But he then quickly added in the
same sentence that we are a people who accord “to one another the equal right of religious freedom” (emphasis
added). United States v. MacIntosh, 283 U.S. 605, 625. Justice Holmes, Brandeis Stone, and Hughes dissented.
Justice O’Connor failed to mention this case.

humans are naturally hierarchical — not unlike packs of dogs or beached
walruses. Humor allows us to test the response of others to statements,
which might otherwise be taken the wrong way. Something said in a
‘jokey’ tone of voice may not generate a negative response, even though
the raw content might be quite provocative. “Ah, late again I see...”

It is worth taking a look at some great comedy sketches because
they bring home the richness of human interaction. Here are some of my
favorite links as an antidote to the heavy-duty mathematics I am about
to inflict on you.

The World’s Funniest Joke

Two hunters are out in the woods when one of them collapses. He
doesn't seem to be breathing and his eyes are glazed. The other guy
whips out his phone and calls the emergency services. He gasps, “My
friend is dead! What can I do?” The operator says, “Calm down. I
can help. First, let’s make sure he’s dead.” There is a silence, then a
gunshot is heard. Back on the phone, the guy says, “OK, now what?”

Spike Milligan, from The Goon Show

I think comedy is a fitness display. It demonstrates to those around
us — particularly of the opposite sex — that we can be creative and use
non- computable thought processes, just as dancing is a fitness display of
our agility and coordination. When we tell a joke we are showing others
we can ‘think outside the box’, a valuable survival skill.

At a simple level it has been proven that animals with the ability to
behave randomly escape being eaten more often than animals that follow
a pattern. Non-computability is the ultimate behavioral randomizer
since it is not an algorithm and cannot be copied. The ability to take
non-computable thinking to its logical conclusion to create and invent
has clearly taken off for humans.

Of course, another explanation might be that making people happy
is fun. People like to be around other fun people so humor encourages
crowds to form. If a saber-toothed tiger attacks you, and you are in a
crowd, you're more likely to survive. You only have to outrun one
member of the crowd!

CHAPTER ONE

The Great Divide

“What you’ve seen so far is just the tip of the iceberg.”

-- retired Admiral Michael McConnell, vice chairman of Booz Allen Hamilton

On June 9, 2013, the Guardian, the British newspaper known for the quality and gravity of its
reporting posted Snowden’s 12-minute video on its website. In it, Snowden identified himself as
an infrastructure analyst at a regional base of National Security Agency that was located in Oahu,
Hawaii. He revealed in a calm, unemotional voice that he had been the source for the stories in
both the Guardian and the Washington Post. He said that he had supplied the secret, classified
documents that the two newspapers had used in their scoops about domestic surveillance being
conducted by the NSA, America’s enormous electronic surveillance agency. These sensational
revelations had been, literally, the talk of the world, and now, in another major news event, the
boyish-looking Snowden revealed his responsibility for what would turn out to be the largest theft
of top-secret documents in the history of U.S. intelligence.

In the video, Snowden was questioned by Glenn Greenwald, an American journalist living in
Brazil who had broken the NSA story in the Guardian. What was his motive? Greenwald asked.
Why did he do it? Snowden replied that he had become horrified by the NSA’s secret operations
which, to him, represented a kind of distillation of the excesses of the American national security
state, and he therefore made it his mission to blow the whistle. He believed that the public needed
to be informed of the existence of a vast, secret surveillance operation directed against tens of
millions of Americans that flagrantly violated US laws and was a grave threat to their privacy and
their freedoms. Within hours of the release of that video on the Guardian website, Snowden
was one of the most famous people in the world, celebrated by his supporters as a courageous
whistle-blower.

The Snowden interview in the video subsequently was expanded by the documentary filmmaker
Laura Poitras into the two-hour movie CitizenFour, which won the 2015 academy-award for the
best documentary. Poitras said in accepting her Oscar in the Academy Awards Theater in
Hollywood on February 22 2015, that Snowden acted as a whistle-blower not only to “expose a
threat to our privacy but to our democracy itself.” She received a standing ovation. The film
convincingly depicts Snowden as an altruistic young man who is willing to risk his own personal
freedom and face years of imprisonment for the sake of others. Adding to the drama, almost all
the footage of Snowden in the film is from interviews with him in the confines of Snowden’s small

"
IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019929.txt,"and clear electability, Bannon would not have had his chance.

However much a marginal, invisible, small-time hustler Bannon had been—something
of an Elmore Leonard character—he was suddenly transformed inside Trump Tower, an
office he entered on August 15, and for practical purposes, did not exit, save for a few
hours a night (and not every night) in his temporary midtown Manhattan accommodations,
until January 17, when the transition team moved to Washington. There was no
competition in Trump Tower for being the brains of the operation. Of the dominant figures
in the transition, neither Kushner, Priebus, nor Conway, and certainly not the president-
elect, had the ability to express any kind of coherent perception or narrative. By default,
everybody had to look to the voluble, aphoristic, shambolic, witty, off-the-cuff figure who
was both ever present on the premises and who had, in an unlikely attribute, read a book
or two.

And indeed who, during the campaign, turned out to be able to harness the Trump
operation, not to mention its philosophic disarray, to a single political view: that the path
to victory was an economic and cultural message to the white working class in Florida,
Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.

OOK Ok

Bannon collected enemies. Few fueled his savagery and rancor toward the standard-issue
Republican world as much as Rupert Murdoch—not least because Murdoch had Donald
Trump’s ear. It was one of the key elements of Bannon’s understanding of Trump: the last
person Trump spoke to ended up with enormous influence. Trump would brag that
Murdoch was always calling him; Murdoch, for his part, would complain that he couldn’t
get Trump off the phone.

“He doesn’t know anything about American politics, and has no feel for the American
people,” said Bannon to Trump, always eager to point out that Murdoch wasn’t an
American. But Trump couldn’t get enough of him. With his love of “winners”—and he
saw Murdoch as the ultimate winner—Trump was suddenly bad-mouthing his friend Ailes
as a “loser.”

And yet in one regard Murdoch’s message was useful to Bannon. Having known every
president since Harry Truman—as Murdoch took frequent opportunities to point out—
and, he conjectured, as many heads of state as anyone living, Murdoch believed he
understood better than younger men, even seventy-year-old Trump, that political power
was fleeting. (This was in fact the same message he had imparted to Barack Obama.) A
president really had only, max, six months to make an impact on the public and set his
agenda, and he’d be lucky to get six months. After that it was just putting out fires and
battling the opposition.

This was the message whose urgency Bannon himself had been trying to impress on an
often distracted Trump. Indeed, in his first weeks in the White House, an inattentive

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019929
"
IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013964.txt,"is not my intention. Let’s face it, though: There are tons of things in your home and life that you don’t
use, need, or even particularly want. They just came into your life as impulsive flotsam and jetsam and
never found a good exit. Whether you’re aware of it or not, this clutter creates indecision and
distractions, consuming attention and making unfettered happiness a real chore. It is impossible to realize
how distracting all the crap is—whether porcelain dolls, sports cars, or ragged T-shirts—until you get rid
of it.

Prior to my 15-month trip, I was stressed about how to fit all of my belongings into a 14x 10-foot
rental storage space. Then I realized a few things: I would never reread the business magazines I'd saved,
I wore the same five shirts and four pairs of pants 90% of the time, it was about time for new furniture,
and I never used the outdoor grill or lawn furniture.

Even getting rid of things I never used proved to be like a capitalist short-circuit. It was hard to toss
things I had once thought were valuable enough to spend money on. The first ten minutes of sorting
through clothing was like choosing which child of mine should live or die. I hadn’t exercised my
throwing-out muscles in some time. It was a struggle to put nice Christmas clothing ['d never worn into
the “go” pile and just as hard to separate myself from worn and ragged clothing I had for sentimental
reasons. Once I’d passed through the first few tough decisions, though, the momentum had been built and
it was a breeze. I donated all of the seldom-worn clothing to Goodwill. The furniture took less than 10
hours to offload using Craigslist, and though I was paid less than 50% of the retail prices for some and
nothing for others, who cared? I’d used and abused them for five years and would get a new set when I
landed back in the U.S. I gave the grill and lawn furniture to my friend, who lit up like a kid at
Christmas. I had made his month. It felt wonderful and I had an extra $300 in pocket change to cover at
least a few weeks of rent abroad.

I created 40% more space in my apartment and hadn’t even grazed the surface. It wasn’t the extra
physical space that I felt most. It was the extra mental space. It was as if I had 20 mental applications
running simultaneously before, and now I had just one or two. My thinking was clearer and I was much,
much happier.

I asked every vagabond interviewee in this book what their one recommendation would be for first-
time extended travelers. The answer was unanimous: Take less with you.

The overpacking impulse is hard to resist. The solution is to set what I call a “settling fund.” Rather
than pack for all contingencies, I bring the absolute minimum and allocate $100—300 for purchasing
things after I arrive and as I travel. I no longer take toiletries or more than a week’s worth of clothing.
It’s a blast. Finding shaving cream or a dress shirt overseas can produce an adventure in and of itself.

Pack as if you were coming back in one week. Here are the bare essentials, listed in order of
importance:

1. One week of clothing appropriate to the season, including one semiformal shirt and pair of pants or
skirt for customs. Think T-shirts, one pair of shorts, and a multipurpose pair of jeans.

2. Backup photocopies or scanned copies of all important documents: health insurance, passport/visa,
credit cards, debit cards, etc.

3. Debit cards, credit cards, and $200 worth of small bills in local currency (traveler’s checks are not
accepted in most places and are a hassle)

4. Small cable bike lock for securing luggage while in transit or in hostels; a small padlock for
lockers if needed

5. Electronic dictionaries for target languages (book versions are too slow to be of use in
conversation) and small grammar guides or texts

6. One broad-strokes travel guide

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF CHINA’S 2018 CENTRAL
FOREIGN POLICY WORK CONFERENCE
THE HON. KEVIN RUDD
26 TH PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA
PRESIDENT OF THE ASIA SOCIETY POLICY INSTITUTE, NEW YORK
AN ADDRESS TO THE LEE KUAN YEW SCHOOL OF PUBLIC POLICY
NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SINGAPORE
TUESDAY 26 JUNE, 2018
On 22-23 June 2018, the Chinese Communist Party concluded its Central Conference on Work
Relating to Foreign Affairs, the second since Xi Jinping became General Secretary of the Party
and Chairman of the Central Military Commission in November 2012. The last one was held in
November 2014. These are not everyday affairs in the party’s deliberations on the great
questions of China’s unfolding global engagement.
These conferences are major, authoritative gatherings of the entire leadership, designed to
synthesise China’s official analysis of international trends, and assess how China should
anticipate and respond to them in the prosecution of its own national interests. This one, like
the last one, was presided over by Xi Jinping and attended by all seven members of the
politburo standing committee, plus ex-officio member Vice President Wang Qishan, together
with all other eighteen members of the regular politburo, in addition to everybody who is
anybody in the entire Chinese foreign, security, military, economic, trade, finance, cyber and
intelligence community, as well as the central think tank community.
It’s a meeting that’s meant to be noticed by the entire Chinese international policy
establishment, because if there is to be any new directive concerning China’s place in the
world, it’s likely to be found somewhere in Xi Jinping’s 3,000 character report to this
conference.
Of course, the entire deliberations of the conference are not made public. Three-and-a-half
years ago, only a selected part of it was broadcast and reported in the central media. The
same this time as well. And unlike in Washington, the Chinese system doesn’t leak every
twelve hours. There is, therefore, an often hazardous reading of the tea leaves in interpreting
what it all means, discerning what is new, what is new-ish, and what is not.
WHAT IS NEW?
How does the 2018 Work Conference compare with the one in 2014? The 2014 iteration
represented the formal, official funeral of Deng Xiaoping’s international policy dictum of the
1 of 10
previous 30 years of “hide your strength, bide your time, never take the lead”. It also heralded
the beginning of a new period of confident, independent international policy activism
by Beijing. In part this change reflected Xi Jinping’s greater centralisation of political power in
the Chinese system. In part it reflected the Chinese system’s deep conclusion that American
global power was in relative decline and that the United States would not confront China
militarily if China sought to expand its regional military presence. In part it reflected a Chinese
institutional conclusion that China had finally become an indispensable global economic power
to most countries in the world, thereby enabling China to begin to project its economic
influence bilaterally, regionally and also multilaterally. It also was an expression of Xi Jinping’s
personal leadership temperament, which is impatient with the incremental bureaucratism
endemic to the Chinese system, and with which the international community had become
relaxed, comfortable and thoroughly accustomed.
For those who follow these events closely and have written on the importance of this
significant departure from China’s traditional strategic framework dating from the 2014
conference, a number of developments since then have been illustrative of this overall change
in the style, content and direction of China’s international policy approach. China worked
overtime in 2014-16 to expand its military position in the South China Sea with a rapid program
of island reclamation. China took the idea of the New Silk Road and turned it into a multitrillion
dollar trade, investment, infrastructure and wider geo-political and geo-economic
initiative, engaging 73 different countries across much of Eurasia, Africa and beyond. China
signed up most of the developed world in the first large-scale non-Bretton Woods multilateral
development bank called the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), capitalised it and
launched it so that it now has a balance sheet already approaching the size of the Asian
Development Bank.
China has also become for the first time a multilateral diplomatic activist, launching diplomatic
initiatives of its own beyond its own immediate sphere of strategic interest here in the East
Asian hemisphere, as well as actively participating in other initiatives such as the JCPOA on
Iran, rather than declining to reach beyond its own narrowly defined core national interests
as we have often seen in the past. China has also developed naval bases in Sri Lanka, Pakistan
and now Djibouti (the latter with some 5,000 troops based there), as well as participating in
naval exercises with the Russians in the Sea of Japan, the Mediterranean and even the Baltic.
And now in the most recent National People’s Conference in March 2018, we have the decision
to establish China’s first ever International Development Cooperation Agency to manage
China’s burgeoning aid programs across the developing world. Of course, these leave to one
side the activities of Chinese state financial institutions, other Chinese SOE’s as well as Chinese
mixed investment funds operating on every continent and in every region of the world.
It would be wrong, analytically, to say that all these suddenly began after the 2014 Central
Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs. Some began in the two years before then
after Xi first became General Secretary in late 2012. And some have their antecedents in the
late Hu Jintao period. But my point is that they all either began, were intensified or else were
formally publicly legitimised by the conclusions of the last Central Conference. In short, the
2 of 10
system was given the mandate to contest, assert, and where possible to lead in the various
councils of the world. And this was new.
Furthermore, anyone who continues to entertain the fanciful idea, which I still sometimes
seen in Western commentary, that these changes are not the product of a well-considered
Chinese grand strategy, is simply choosing to ignore the clear evidence of clearly defined
policy purpose systematically at work in the field. Our Chinese friends think things through
carefully. They observe carefully. Not just what is happening in the headlines, which is the
permanent obsession of the Western political establishment. But what is happening, in what
Xi Jinping would describe as “the underlying historical trends” in international relations. And
then, after a period of detailed internal reflection, consideration, and where necessary
consensus building within the system, a new direction is set.
That indeed is what these Central Foreign Policy Work Conferences are all about. They sum
up where the system has got to in its analysis. And then what the system intends to do about
it. It’s part of the rolling system of policy analysis, implementation and review that
characterises the entire Chinese public policy system, both foreign and domestic. It is both
one of the great strengths of the Chinese system. But also one of its great weaknesses if the
conclusions reached prove it be analytically flawed, or unsustainable in practice. It takes a lot
to turn the Chinese ship of state around once that course has been set at the top.
So what changes with the 2018 Central Conference? Is it more of the same? Or simply an
intensification of the trajectory? Or a change in content and tone. The answer is all of the
above—a blend of continuity and change.
A NEW ROLE FOR PARTY IDEOLOGY IN FOREIGN POLICY
First, the press reporting of the conference asserts the absolute centrality of the party to the
country’s foreign policy mission. This is not entirely new. But the emphasis on the role of the
party is much stronger than before. In the recent past, the country’s international policy
establishment, like its econocrats, have seen themselves, and have been seen by the Chinese
political establishment, as a technocratic elite. That is now changing in foreign policy as much
as it has already changed in economic policy.
This is part of a broader trend in Xi Jinping’s China, whose focus is to rehabilitate the party
from moral death from corruption on the one hand, and practical death from policy irrelevance
on the other.
Xi has been concerned that the party had become marginal to the country’s major policy
debates given the technocratic complexity inherent to most of the country’s contemporary
challenges. That is why, for example, we now see a revitalisation of theory over practice, a
reassertion of the power of the major institutions of the party over the major departments of
state, and once again of political ideology over mere technocratic policy.
3 of 10
Nor does Xi Jinping intend presiding over the party’s “death by a thousand cuts” as it contends
with a range of unfolding political forces unleashed by a combination of the market economy,
social liberalisation and foreign influence.
No—Xi Jinping intends for the party to defy the trend-line of Western history, to see off
Fukuyama’s end of history with the inevitable triumph of Western liberal-democratic capitalism
and to preserve a Leninist state for the long term as the most effective means of ensuring
that China prevails in its domestic and international challenges. That is why there is lengthy
treatment in this conference on, to use the language of the Xinhua report, “Upholding the
authority of the CPC Central Committee as the overarching principle and strengthening the
centralised, unified leadership of the Party on external work.”
In case we missed the emphasis, Xi Jinping also states that “diplomacy represents the will of
the state, and diplomatic power must stay with the CPC Central Committee, while external
work is a systematic project.” Xi calls “for implementing reform of the institutions and
mechanisms concerning foreign affairs under the decision of the Central Party leadership and
enhancing party-building in institutions abroad so as to form a management mechanism
catering to the requirements of the new era.”
The conference also emphasised that China’s diplomacy would now be a “diplomacy of
socialism with Chinese characteristics” and as such would take Xi Jinping thought from the
domestic into the foreign policy domain. In the past, this language of “socialism with Chinese
characteristics” applied to the overall Chinese ideological system, usually interpreted as
China’s own form of state capitalism. But now it is applied to diplomacy, and it infers
something else.
It seems to mean conforming diplomacy with a wider ideological worldview which lies beyond
the simple policy pragmatism we have seen for decades guiding most elements of Chinese
foreign policy in the prosecution of China’s national interests. There now seems to be a new
national and-or global vision that now sits above the simple maximisation of national interests.
This seems more than the routine incantations of the China Dream, the party’s centenary
objectives for 2021, and the national centenary mission for 2049 with which we have become
familiar since Xi came to power. At this stage, this new overarching ideological mission may
be inchoate, but the fact that it is as yet not fully formed does not mean that it does not exist.
Lest there be any doubt on this count, the ranking foreign policy technocrat attending the
Work Conference, former Foreign Minister and State Councillor Yang Jiechi, and now Director
of the Foreign Policy Office of the Party Central Committee, refers explicitly to the ideological
significance of this conference. It is worth quoting Yang’s remarks at the conference at some
length. He states that the most important outcome of this conference is that:
“It established the guiding position of Xi Jinping thought on diplomacy.
Xi Jinping thought on diplomacy is an important part of Xi Jinping Thought
on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era...It is a major
theoretical achievement in the thoughts on state governance in the area of
4 of 10
diplomacy by the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the
core, and a fundamental guideline for China's external work in the new
era...We should integrate our thoughts and actions into General Secretary
Xi Jinping's important address and Xi Jinping thought on diplomacy, and
make new advances in China's external work.
To an international foreign policy audience, this may all seem a little arcane. That’s because
in the internal ideological deliberations of a one party state, it is arcane. But we would be
blind not to see that there is something new at play here. It is unclear whether this means
Chinese foreign policy is likely to be more Marxist in its conceptualisation, or even its
execution? Whether it likely to be more Nationalist? Whether it will seek to more actively
promote the Chinese development model of “authoritarian capitalism” as a model for the
world, in competition with the “liberal democratic capitalism” of the West? Whether it is a
much more unformed worldview which will ultimately take shape around Xi Jinping’s as-yetdeliberately-vague
concept of “a global community of common destiny,” which is now the
subject of intense work within China’s think tank community, and with the international
academic community.
Or whether it is something more mechanistic than that altogether, involving a desire to fire
up China’s current diplomatic establishment into a more invigorated, imaginative, creative,
even forceful effort to shape the future global rules-based order more in China’s image, rather
than China being the permanent “price -taker” for rules already determined elsewhere by
others. Particularly where elements of the existing order are seen to represent a continuing
and unwelcome challenge to the legitimacy of China’s domestic political order, for example in
areas such as the rule of law, human rights and democracy.
A NEW IDEOLOGICAL CONFIDENCE THAT HISTORY FAVOURS CHINA
There is a second element to the June 2018 Conference which grows out of the first. It is Xi’s
deeply Marxist, dialectical-materialist view of history based on permanently evolving
“contradictions” between what dialecticians call thesis, antithesis and synthesis. In Xi’s view,
this in turn gives rise to defined “laws” of historical development which are both prescriptive
and predictive.
This may sound like old-fashioned Marxism. That’s because it is. The intellectual software of
generations of Chinese leaders has been shaped by this conceptual framework for interpreting
and responding to what they define as scientific, objective reality. And Xi Jinping belongs to
that tradition. Remember he has already convened special study sessions of the politburo on
understanding both dialectical and historical materialism in the past.
According to the conference report: “Xi suggested to not only observe the current international
situation, but also review the past, summarise historical laws, and look towards the future to
better understand the trend of history.” Furthermore, according to the same report in Xinhua,
to obtain “an accurate understanding of the overall situation, Xi underlined not only the
observation of detailed phenomena, but also a deep appreciation of the essence of the overall
5 of 10
situation in order not to get lost in complexity and the changing international situation.”
Xi concludes on this count by stating that “throughout human history, the development of the
world has always been the result of contradictions intertwining and interacting with each
other.”
Once again, all this will seem more than a little arcane. But in the ideological dialect of the
Communist Party, it seems to mean several things. First, that there is nothing random about
what is unfolding in the world today. Second, these reflect certain immutable laws of political
and economic development. Third, the business of Chinese foreign policy is to use this dialectal
prism to understand precisely what is happening in the world today, why it is happening and
what to do about it. And fourth, applying these disciplines to the current period, it means that
the global order is at a turning point with the relative decline of the US and the West, with
this coinciding with the fortuitous national and international circumstances currently enabling
China’s rise.
To use Xi’s own language, this: “has been in the best period of development since modern
times, while the world is undergoing the most profound and unprecedented changes in a
century” adding that “the two aspects are intertwined and interact with each other.” Xi refers
to the current period as a period of unprecedented strategic opportunity for China and the
current mission of the party. Although this is not itself a new term, Xi says the party’s mission
is to extend this period. To do this, he calls for the party to engage in “in-depth analysis of
the law of how the international situation changes as the world comes into this transitional
period, as well as developing an accurate grasp of the basic characteristics of the external
environment China is facing at this historical juncture in order to better plan and facilitate the
country's work on foreign affairs.”
In other words, what is being said here is that China now has the wind at its back. Of course
there are formidable obstacles ahead. But a dialectical analysis of history causes China to
conclude that the forces of reaction facing the US and the West are greater. Just as the
contradictions operating domestically within the US and the West (in their particular political
systems) are greater as well. Which in turn renders China’s overall domestic and international
circumstances much better by comparison in the emerging contest between the two. All of
which, again in this view, pushes towards a new historical synthesis more in China’s (and
Chinese socialism’s) favour.
You will all be forgiven if you think this all sounds more like medieval theology than modern
international relations. And it’s anyone’s guess what any of this actually will have to do with
concrete foreign policy reality. But we often forget that how one-party states, and in particular
Marxist states, choose to ‘ideate’ reality actually matters. It’s how the system speaks to itself.
It’s the political lingua franca among political and policy elites.
And the important thing here is that the message from Xi Jinping to his international policy
elite is one of great confidence. Not just because China wills it to be so, but because from a
Marxist theoretical perspective, which in their view articulates certain immutable ‘laws’ of
political and economic development, the forces of history are now with China. Furthermore,
6 of 10
this is a call to greater international policy activism, rather than retrenchment in response to
the rise of Trump. In other words, the conclusion is that the great trends of history, or to use
an old Soviet term, the ‘correlation of forces’, are moving China’s way.
TOWARDS A SHARPER CHINESE DIPLOMACY
A third element of the 2018 Work Conference is its injunction to the country’s international
policy institutions and personnel to get with the Xi Jinping project. Xi seems to have the
Foreign Ministry in his sights when he says that “the reform of the institutions and mechanisms
concerning foreign affairs is the internal demand of advancing modernisation in the state
governance system and governance capabilities.” It will be recalled from above that “partybuilding”
within the country’s foreign policy institutions will be a core part of that.
On personnel, Xi Jinping reminds the nation’s diplomats that they are first and foremost “party
cadres.” This has a certain ideological retro to it all. Indeed it’s been a long time since I’ve
heard Chinese diplomats refer to their seniors as cadres. In fact I’m not sure that over the
last 35 years that I can. To quote the Xinhua report: “Stressing that cadres are the decisive
factor after setting the political course, Xi called for a strong contingent of foreign affairs
personnel that are loyal to the CPC, the country and the people and are politically solid,
professionally competent and strongly disciplined in their conduct. He called on foreign affairs
cadres to enhance their ideals and their training so as to upgrade their competency and overall
quality...”
Does this presage a new type of Chinese foreign ministry diplomat abroad? Perhaps. It’s long
been reported that Xi has been frustrated by the performance of parts of his foreign policy
establishment. He sees them proceeding at a glacial pace. Whereas China’s strategic
challenges and opportunities are urgent. Once again, this tends to point in the direction of
greater foreign policy activism in the future in a system that is struggling to keep up with the
political and policy vision of its leader.
CHINA LEADING THE REFORM OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE
Fourth, the sharpest substantive new development to emerge from the 2018 Foreign Policy
Work Conference is what is says about global governance.
In the 2014 Work Conference, Xi referred to an impending struggle for the future structure of
the international order. He did not elaborate on this back then. But much work has gone on
within the Chinese system since on three inter-related concepts: the international order (guoji
zhixu); the international system (guoji xitong), and global governance (quanqiu zhili).
Of course, these mean different but overlapping things in English too. Broadly speaking, in
Chinese, the term “international” or “global” order refers to a combination of the UN, the
Bretton Woods Institutions, the G20 and other global plurilateral or multilateral institutions on
the one hand; and the US system of global alliances to enforce the US definition of
international security on the other. The term “international system” tends to refer to the first
7 of 10
half of this international order—namely the complex web of multilateral institutions which
operate under international treaty law and which seek to govern the global commons on the
basis of the principle of shared sovereignty. As for “global governance”, it tends to refer to
the actual performance, for good or for ill, be it effective or ineffective, of the “international
system” so defined.
It is deeply significant that at the 2018 Work Conference, Xi Jinping states boldly that a core
component of his new ideology of a “diplomacy of socialism with Chinese characteristics”
would be for China to: “lead the reform of the global governance system with the concepts of
fairness and justice.” This is by far the most direct, unqualified and expansive statement on
China’s intentions on this important question we have seen.
China, like the rest of the international community, is acutely conscious of the dysfunctionality
of much of the current multilateral system. It also sees the US walking away from much of
the system as well: from the JCPOA which was agreed to by the UN Security Council; from
the UN’s Paris Agreement on Climate Change; its withdrawal from the UN Human Rights
Commission; its open defiance of the Refugees Convention; and its challenging of the
underlying fabric of the WTO.
Nature, as we know, abhors a vacuum. International relations even more so. And we all saw
Xi Jinping’s riposte to President Trump on climate change and trade at Davos 18 months ago
just after President Trump’s election. If China is indeed serious about leading the reform of
global governance, its attitude to various of these multilateral institutions will be radically
different to the historical posture of the US. Take for example the Human Rights Council in
Geneva, which China would like to see emasculated. Mind you, so too now, apparently, does
the current US administration!
The reference to “China leading the reform of global governance” in this conference is not an
accident. It also reflects a growing Chinese diplomatic activism in a number of UN and Bretton
Woods institutions around the world as China begins to seek to recast these institutions, their
cultures, their work practices and their personnel in a direction more compatible with China’s
core national interests. As I have written before, rather than China having to consistently
resist the pressures of “Westernisation” inherent in the existing laws, institutions and culture
of the current international system, particularly when these prove to be incompatible with the
retention of a Marxist-Leninist Chinese state, the resolve of China’s leadership now seems to
be to use its newfound global power to refashion those institutions within the international
system that may be most problematic for China on the home front.
As for the principles of fairness and justice that Xi refers to as the core principles that will
guide China’s reform of global governance, these terms historically imply China’s preference
for a more “multipolar” international system in which the unilateral voice of the United States
is reduced. China has already developed a strong constituency in Africa, parts of Asia and
Latin America in support of this. ‘Multipolarity’ in Chinese strategic parlance is code for the
dilution of American power in the post-war international system.
8 of 10
THE CENTRALITY OF CHINESE NATIONAL INTERESTS
Lest anyone gets too starry-eyed about China’s intentions for reforming global governance, in
Xi Jinping’s description of the core principles of its new “diplomacy of socialism with Chinese
characteristics,” Xi concludes his list of ten governing principles with the following: that China
must take its “core national interests as the bottom line to safeguard China's sovereignty,
security and development interests”.
Xi makes plain that China’s foreign policy is unapologetically nationalist. Xi assumes that all
other countries’ foreign policies are nationalist as well.
Of course, China’s definition of its core national interests has evolved over time. As have other
nations. It now includes, for example, the South China Sea. A decade ago, that was not a
feature of Chinese official statements defining China’s core interests. Now it is. As for any
state, therefore, the concept of “core national interests” varies over time and will be defined
by the government of the day.
CONCLUSION
But we will soon see how the 2018 Central Foreign Policy Conference translates into different
Chinese foreign policy behaviours on the ground. If the 2014 Conference is an effective guide,
we will see a heightened period of Chinese foreign policy activism. However the precise
content of that activism remains to be seen. But what we are seeing is the slow, steady
emergence of a more integrated Chinese worldview which links China’s domestic vision with
its international vision - and a vision which very much reflects the deep views of China’s
paramount leader Xi Jinping.
The first policy terrain where we are likely to see this is in the existing institutions of global
governance. But it will not be restricted to this area. The text of the report of the 2018 Central
Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs suggests that we will also see this across
China’s bilateral relations, its engagement with regional institutions, as well as its approach to
major power relations as well - all of which are likely to be met with an increasingly forthright
Chinese diplomacy.
The challenge for the rest of the international community is to define what type of future
international order, system and governance it wants. And to take China’s invitation seriously
to engage the Middle Kingdom in a frank and forthright discourse on what the region and the
world precisely want in any future “global community of common destiny”.
What does the European Union want? What does ASEAN want? What does the East Asia
Summit want? What does the African Union want? What does the Organization of American
States want? What does the Gulf Cooperation Council want? What exactly does America want,
with or without Trump?
9 of 10
And in this dialogue, how will the values already entrenched in the UN Charter, Bretton Woods
and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as the founding instruments of various
regional organisations, be preserved for the future?
The future of the global order is now in a state of some flux. In part induced by the recent
posture of the United States. In part induced by the rise of China. China it seems has a clear
script for the future. It’s time for the rest of the international community to do the same.

would be blamed by the inevitable critics, whether for going too far or not far
enough, or simply for the fact the deal had eluded us. I knew the drill: the same
thing had happened when I had come tantalizingly close to finalizing a peace
deal with Syria’s then-dying dictator, Hafez al-Assad, a few months earlier. Yet
these three dedicated men — Gili, who was by training a lawyer; Shlomo, an
academic; and Danny, a former Mossad chief — had just been through dozens of
hours of intricately detailed talks with each of Arafat’s top negotiators at Camp
David, not to mention the dozens of other meetings before we had even got
there. Now they had to accept that, even with the lid of the pressure cooker
bolted down tight, we had fallen short of getting the peace agreement which
each of us knew had been within touching distance.

I don’t think that even they could be described as depressed. On our side,
after all, we knew we had given ground on every issue we possibly could,
without facing full-scale political rebellion at home. We had proposed an Israeli
pullout from nearly all of the West Bank and Gaza. A support mechanism for
helping compensate tens of thousands of Palestinian refugees from the serial
Arab-Israeli conflicts of the past half-century. And most painfully and
controversially — my rivals and critics back home were already accusing me of
“treachery” — we had agreed to let President Clinton present a proposal for the
Palestinians to get sovereignty over the Arab neighbourhoods of Jerusalem as
well as “custodial sovereignty” over the Haram al-Sharif, the mosque complex
perched above the Western Wall, the holiest site in Judaism.

But precisely because we had been ready to offer so much, only for Arafat to
reject it all, even as a basis for talks on a final deal, I could sense how gutted my
key negotiators were feeling.

Still, I’m sure none of them was surprised when my own old operational
instincts kicked in. In my statement to journalists, I had been careful to say that
Arafat was not ready at this time to make the historic compromises needed for
peace. But before parting with President Clinton and Secretary Albright, I’d
been more forthright. It was clear, without my saying so, that the chances of our
getting a peace agreement on Clinton’s watch were now pretty much over. He
had barely five months left in office. Yet my deeper fear was that with Arafat
having brushed aside an offer that went far further than any other Israeli had
proposed — far further than the Americans, themselves, had expected from Israel
— the prospects for peace would be set back for years. Perhaps, I said, for two
decades.

generate a result, we feel that we intellectually grasp it.

The new machine-learning programs are different. Having recognized patterns
via deep neural networks, they come up with conclusions, and we have no idea exactly
how. When they uncover relationships, we don’t understand it in the same way as if we
had deduced those relationships ourselves using an underlying theoretical framework. As
data sets become larger, we won’t be able to analyze them ourselves even with the help
of computers; rather, we will rely entirely on computers to do the analysis for us. So if
someone asks us how we know something, we will simply say it is because the machine
analyzed the data and produced the conclusion.

One day a computer may well come up with an entirely new result—e.g., a
mathematical theorem whose proof, or even whose statement, no human can understand.
That is philosophically different from the way we have been doing science. Or at least
thought we had; some might argue that we don’t know how our own brains reach
conclusions either, and that these new methods are a way of mimicking learning by the
human brain. Nevertheless, I find this potential loss of understanding disturbing.

Despite the remarkable advances in computing, the hype about AGI—a general-
intelligence machine that will think like a human and possibly develop consciousness—
smacks of science fiction to me, partly because we don’t understand the brain at that level
of detail. Not only do we not understand what consciousness is, we don’t even
understand a relatively simple problem like how we remember a phone number. In just
that one question, there are all sorts of things to consider. How do we know it is a
number? How do we associate it with a person, a name, face, and other characteristics?
Even such seemingly trivial questions involve everything from high-level cognition and
memory to how a cell stores information and how neurons interact.

Moreover, that’s just one task among many that the brain does effortlessly.
Whereas machines will no doubt do ever more amazing things, they’re unlikely to be a
replacement for human thought and human creativity and vision. Eric Schmidt, former
chairman of Google’s parent company, said in a recent interview at the London Science
Museum that even designing a robot that would clear the table, wash the dishes, and put
them away was a huge challenge. The calculations involved in figuring out all the
movements the body has to make to throw a ball accurately or do slalom skiing are
prodigious. The brain can do all these and also do mathematics and music, and invent
games like chess and Go, not just play them. We tend to underestimate the complexity
and creativity of the human brain and how amazingly general it is.

If AI is to become more humanlike in its abilities, the machine-learning and
neuroscience communities need to interact closely, something that is happening already.
Some of today’s greatest exponents of machine learning—such as Geoffrey Hinton,
Zoubin Ghahramani, and Demis Hassabis—have backgrounds in cognitive neuroscience,
and their success has been at least in part due to attempts to model brainlike behavior in
their algorithms. At the same time, neurobiology has also flourished. All sorts of tools
have been developed to watch which neurons are firing and genetically manipulate them
and see what’s happening in real time with inputs. Several countries have launched
moon-shot neuroscience initiatives to see if we can crack the workings of the brain.
Advances in AI and neuroscience seem to go hand in hand; each field can propel the
other.

Slowing economy could increase pressure
on Big Tech

Sara Fischer, David McCabe, Courtenay Brown5 hours ago

A potential recession, combined with increasing regulatory threats for some of the biggest
tech companies, foreshadows a difficult 2019 for Silicon Valley.

Why it matters: The biggest tech companies have already raked tn billions of dollars in
profits and benefited from major tax cuts that aren't going to be repeated, so next year isn't
likely to be better for them financially. They've also been dogged by scandals that have left
many questioning their positive role in society, and if on top of that the economy starts to
slip, 2019 could be worse.

People look for scapegoats in a bad economy. And with big tech already on its heels, a
downturn probably would feed arguments that the largest internet companies are too big
and need to be reined in.

— Paul Gallant, an analyst with Cowen Washington Research Group

Big Tech is closing out a contentious year in Washington, and potential regulation will
continue to haunt it well into 2019.

° Google CEO Sundar Pichai has agreed to testify before Congress, and will likely be
asked about whether the company is being transparent about its data privacy practices and
any potential bias. By the year's end, the CEOs of Twitter, Google and Facebook will have
been called to testified in front of Congress for the first time ever during 2018.

° Lawmakers in the United States are pushing for a federal privacy law with an urgency
likely to be exacerbated by more breaches like the one Marriott disclosed last Friday.

° The Federal Trade Commission still has an open investigation into whether
Facebook’s conduct violated a previous settlement with the agency. Margrethe Vestager,

Choice of Attorney

On November 27, Mr. Sloman sent an email to Mr. Epstein’s attorneys stating that “I
intend to notify the victims by letter after COB Thursday [two days later].” See Tab 34,
November 27, 2007 Email from J. Sloman to J. Lefkowitz.

The morning of November 28, attorneys for Mr. Epstein faxed a letter to Assistant
Attorney General Alice Fisher, requesting a meeting with her to discuss the impropriety
of the USAO’s encouraging civil lawsuits against Mr. Epstein under the guise of the
terms of the Non Prosecution Agreement. See Tab 35, November 28, 2007 Letter from
K. Starr to A. Fisher.

Late in the day on November 28, Epstein’s attorneys received from AUSA Villafana a
copy of the USAO’s proposed victim-notification letter that “Jeff [Sloman] asked that I
forward.” See Tab 36, November 28, 2007 Email from M. Villafana to J. Lefkowitz.

(a) The proposed victim-notification letter cited as authority the “Justice for All Act
of 2004” (which U.S. Attorney Acosta later agreed had no application to these
circumstances). It referred to the addressees as minor “victims,” suggested they
make statements in state court, that they were not entitled to make, and referred
incorrectly to Mr. Epstein as a “sexual predator.” Jd.

(b) FAUSA Sloman also proposed advising recipients, in an underlined sentence that,
“You have the absolute right to select your own attorney” to “assist you in making
.. a Claim” for “damages from [Epstein].” But that “[i]f you do decide to use
[two attorneys selected by the U.S. Attorney’s “special master”’] as your attorneys,
Mr. Epstein will be responsible for paying attorney’s fees incurred during the time
spent trying to negotiate a settlement.” Jd.

The USAO Leaks Confidential Information to the New York Times

Perhaps most troubling of all, the USAO has repeatedly leaked information about this
case to the media—including to Landon Thomas, the senior business correspondent for
the New York Times. We have personally reviewed Mr. Thomas’s own notes, and they
are remarkably detailed about highly confidential aspects of the prosecution’s theory of
the case and the plea negotiations.

Mr. Thomas’s calls to the USAO initially were referred to Assistant United States
Attorney David Weinstein. AUSA Weinstein informed Mr. Thomas that federal
authorities were considering charging Mr. Epstein under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591, 2422 and
2423, and told the reporter that Mr. Epstein had both lured girls over the telephone and
traveled in interstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in sex with minors. AUSA
Weinstein also divulged the terms and conditions of the USAO’s negotiations with Mr.
Epstein—including the fact that Mr. Epstein had proposed “house arrest” with extra

the end of the age of liberalism, he was seen as a pariah; today he is the leader of a xenophobic, authoritarian and
often anti-American trend that haunts Poland, Austria and Turkey. He has won many converts to the cause of
strengthening nation-states and weakening multilateral institutions, notably the European Union. His hostility to
migration, particularly what he calls the “Islamic multitude” that “leads to the disintegration of nations,” is widely
shared. He is admired for having built the first wall in Europe — on the Hungarian-Serbian border — to stem the flow
of migrants in 2015. (Paradoxically, Hungary used to be admired for tearing down the barrier between itself and
Austria, precipitating the fall of the Berlin Wall.)

design is littered with what appeared to be good insights that have had bad consequences.
Declarative design rests on all the advances in AI, plus the improving fidelity of
simulations to virtually test designs.

The mother of all design problems is the one that resulted in us. The way we’re
designed resides in one of the oldest and most conserved parts of the genome, called the
Hox genes. These are genes that regulate genes, in what are called developmental
programs. Nothing in your genome stores the design of your body; your genome stores,
rather, a series of steps to follow that results in your body. This is an exact parallel to
how search is done in AI. There are too many possible body plans to search over, and
most modifications would be either inconsequential or fatal. The Hox genes are a
representation of a productive place for evolutionary search. It’s a kind of natural
intelligence at the molecular level.

AI has a mind-body problem, in that it has no body. Most work on AI is done in
the cloud, running on virtual machines in computer centers where data are funneled. Our
own intelligence is the result of a search algorithm (evolution) that was able to change
our physical form as well as our programming—those are inextricably linked. Ifthe
history of AI can be understood as the working of scaling laws rather than a succession of
fashions, then its future can be seen in the same way. What’s now being digitized, after
communication and computation, is fabrication, bringing the programmability of bits to
the world of atoms. By digitizing not just designs but the construction of materials, the
same lessons that von Neumann and Shannon taught us apply to exponentially increasing
fabricational complexity.

I’ve defined digital materials to be those constructed from a discrete set of parts
reversibly joined with a discrete set of relative positions and orientations. These
attributes allow the global geometry to be determined from local constraints, assembly
errors to be detected and corrected, heterogeneous materials to be joined, and structures
to be disassembled rather than disposed of when they’re no longer needed. The amino
acids that are the foundation of life and the Lego bricks that are the foundation of play
share these properties.

What’s interesting about amino acids is that they’re not interesting. They have
attributes that are typical but not unusual, such as attracting or repelling water. But just
twenty types of them are enough to make you. In the same way, twenty or so types of
digital-material part types—conducting, insulating, rigid, flexible, magnetic, etc —are
enough to assemble the range of functions that go into making modern technologies like
robots and computers.

The connection between computation and fabrication was foreshadowed by the
very pioneers whose work the edifice of computing is based on. Wiener hinted at this by
linking material transportation with message transportation. John von Neumann is
credited with modern computer architecture, something he actually wrote very little
about; the final thing he studied, and wrote about beautifully and at length, was self-
reproducing systems. As an abstraction of life, he modeled a machine that can
communicate a computation that constructs itself. And the final thing Alan Turing, who
is credited with the theoretical framework for computer science, studied was how the
instructions in genes can give rise to physical forms. These questions address a topic
absent from a typical computer-science education: the physical configuration of a

Fast withdrawals

As soon as deposits for the Palm House came in, Matthews, Walsh and Laudano, the

project’s general contractor, allegedly began to withdraw money for personal uses.
After Matthews was charged with using the account as a piggy bank, Walsh fired off a
press release last year claiming he and SARC had been absolved.

“It saddens me to see the waste of time, money and talent, and the human and
financial capital that these conspirators perpetrated in multiple courts and plain good
old fashion lies to continue their charade for years,’ Walsh said in the release.

He even reportedly went a step further by hiring Brian Aryai, a certified accountant
who claims to have worked as senior special agent for the Department of Homeland
Security, to provide a detailed audit showing how the money was lost.

The report, meant to clear Walsh’s name, noted that he moved $9.3 million from the
Palm House account to his own company through more than 39 individual
transactions between September 2013 and January 2015.

SARC’s founder is now facing additional civil charges over an office condo project in

Royal Palm Beach — another development SARC raised $6.5 million in EB-5 funds

for.
“Walsh solicited and obtained investors for all of these projects,’ George said.

But USCIS didn’t have to travel far to determine the unfinished project was a racket —
the agency’s local office sits directly across the street from the Royal Palm site,

according to Google Maps.

“It’s remarkable... These cases come and go, and there is no reform,” said Gibson, who
cited “egregious misuse of funds [while] the industry continues without a bump in

the road.”

even Alawite predominance, would never survive a system shaped by
free elections, the rule of law, and the existence of independent
media.

The New York Times interviews were made possible by the deep
uneasiness in the Obama administration with moves that might
destabilize the Assad regime. The Syrians are good judges of their
adversaries’ weaknesses, and what they see in Washington is a
president who prefers the Assads to the possibility of chaos. They
realize that the measures taken until now by the United States and
Europe have been relatively gentle, therefore wholly ineffective. Add
to that the U.N. Security Council’s recent failure to condemn Syria
and official Arab support for Syrian stability, and you will grasp why
the Assad regime saw an opening to reinforce American paralysis.
Nor can the Obama administration ignore that the Syrian leadership
regards American dithering as a sign of implicit approval of its
actions. Indeed, Shaaban described the recent statements of President
Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Syria as “not
too bad,” and the sanctions against Syria as manageable. That can
only mean one thing: If Washington fails to clarify its views on the
carnage in Syria through effective policies, the killing and the arrests
there will continue, with the U.S. bearing partial responsibility. The
White House’s uncertainty can be measured in human lives.

The Syrian protesters are right in not pursuing their salvation in
Washington, let alone Brussels, Paris, or London. This is not an
American administration overly outraged by the viciousness of
dictatorships. Even in Egypt, Obama only turned against Hosni
Mubarak when he was left with no other choice — although doing so
against an old ally while sparing Assad suggests that Obama is like
the coward who will yell at his wife to avoid a brawl with the
neighbor.

80 House members: Shutdown better than Obamacare
Charles Babington — Associated Press

More than one-third of House Republicans urged their leader Thursday to trigger a government shutdown rather than pay for
the implementation of the health-care law they call Obamacare.

Aletter from 80 Republicans asked Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, to resist any spending bills that would accommodate the
new health-care law, which is nearing a critical stage of signing up millions of Americans for health coverage.

Because it’s virtually certain that President Obama and the Democrat-controlled Senate would reject such demands,
leaders of both parties say the standoff likely would result in a partial shutdown of the federal government, similar to those
that occurred in 1995 and 1996.

The letter is mixed news for Boehner and other GOP leaders who view a government shutdown as politically unwise.

The federal 2013 fiscal year ends Sept. 30. New money must be appropriated by then to avoid a shutdown of countless
government offices and agencies.

Voters chiefly blamed congressional Republicans for the mid-1990s shutdowns, and the fallout boosted Democratic
President Clinton. Ever since, many establishment Republicans have urged the party to avoid using shutdown threats as a

bargaining tool.

But a new generation of tea-party-backed conservatives rejects the advice. They say “Obamacare” — officially the
Affordable Care Act — is so unpopular and unworkable that it justifies extraordinary tactics to block it.

A possible solution to the budget impasse, often used in past years, would involve a “continuing resolution” to keep funding
the government at current levels. Many top Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, say it’s
impossible to carve out money for Obamacare in any appropriations measure.

The House letter was authored by Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C. It urges Boehner “to affirmatively de-fund the
implementation and enforcement of Obamacare in any relevant appropriations bill,” including “any continuing
appropriations bill.”

At least a dozen Senate Republicans have signed a similar letter.

In recent years, Democrats and Republicans in Congress repeatedly have failed to reach major compromises on spending.

The impasses led this year to automatic, across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration, which have hampered
some federal agencies and helped shrink the deficit.

Hong Kong. This group constituted the intelligence “mission,” as he referred to it. After
Snowden outed himself on the Internet, the mission began tracking Snowden’s movements. Since
Snowden, his lawyers and the journalists in his entourage frequently used their cell phones to text
one another, it was fairly easy for the mission to follow Snowden’s trail after he left the Mira
hotel. Presumably, the Hong Kong Police also knew where he was during this period. My source
further suspected that the massive Chinese intelligence contingent in Hong Kong also knew, since
it had close relations with the Hong Kong police. If so, Snowden’s whereabouts as he moved
every few days from apartment to apartment was no secret anyone but the public from June 10
to June 23™ “Of course we knew,” he said, adding that there were also photographs of Snowden
entering the office building that housed the Russian consulate. I mentioned that there was a
report in a Russian newspaper that Snowden had visited the Russian consulate in late June in
connection with the flight he later took to Moscow. “All we know is he entered the building,” he
answered, with a shrug. That visit did not come as a complete surprise to US intelligence. After
Snowden left the Mira, his interactions with the Russian and Chinese intelligence services in Hong
Kong also had been closely monitored by the “secret means,” as was subsequently confirmed to
me a former top intelligence executive in Washington DC. All of Snowden’s stealth in exiting
from the Mira hotel, which included wearing a baseball cap and dark glasses, was ineffective in
hiding him from US intelligence and presumably other intelligence services seeking the treasure
trove of documents he had taken from the NSA. Among other things, the Hong Kong lawyers
moving him to a safe house were carrying easily traceable cell phones.

The mystery that most concerned me was, however, not where Snowden was housed in the
interim between when he went public and when he went to Moscow. It was where, and in whose
care, Snowden had been before, he had checked into the Mira hotel on June 1*. When I asked
him about this period, he said that as far as he knew neither the FBI nor the Hong Kong police
could find a trace of him during the period between May 20, when he passed through Hong
Kong customs, and June 1“, when he used his credit card and passport to check into the Mira
hotel. They could not find any credit card charges, ATM withdrawals, telephone calls, hotel
registrations, subway pass purchases or other clues to Snowden’s activities. As far as a paper
trail was concerned, Snowden was a ghost during this period. Could an American just vanish in
Hong Kong for eleven days, I asked”? “Apparently he did just that,” my source replied.

Snowden’s whereabouts during these 11 days was not a mystery I was going to solve on this
first trip to Hong Kong. I needed to know more about Snowden’s activities before he flew to
Hong Kong. After all, Snowden was not, as he himself pointed out from Moscow, an “angel
descending from the heavens.” He had a past working for the US government that extended back
seven years. During that period, he had been part of America’s secret intelligence regime, and
held a clearance for Sensitive Compartmented Information, or SCI. Such SCI material is
considered so sensitive that it must be handled within formal access control systems established by
the Director of National Intelligence.

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016299.txt,"possibility that machines threaten a new fascism must be weighed against the vigor of the
liberal ideas, institutions, and norms that Wiener championed throughout the book. The
flaw in today’s dystopian prophecies is that they disregard the existence of these norms
and institutions, or drastically underestimate their causal potency. The result is a
technological determinism whose dark predictions are repeatedly refuted by the course of
events. The numbers “1984” and “2001” are good reminders.

I will consider two examples. Tech prophets often warn of a “surveillance state”
in which a government empowered by technology will monitor and interpret all private
communications, allowing it to detect dissent and subversion as it arises and make
resistance to state power futile. Orwell’s telescreens are the prototype, and in 1976
Joseph Weizenbaum, one of the gloomiest tech prophets of all time, warned my class of
graduate students not to pursue automatic speech recognition because government
surveillance was its only conceivable application.

Though I am on record as an outspoken civil libertarian, deeply concerned with
contemporary threats to free speech, I lose no sleep over technological advances in the
Internet, video, or artificial intelligence. The reason is that almost all the variation across
time and space in freedom of thought is driven by differences in norms and institutions
and almost none of it by differences in technology. Though one can imagine hypothetical
combinations of the most malevolent totalitarians with the most advanced technology, in
the real world it’s the norms and laws we should be vigilant about, not the tech.

Consider variation across time. If, as Orwell hinted, advancing technology was a
prime enabler of political repression, then Western societies should have gotten more and
more restrictive of speech over the centuries, with a dramatic worsening in the second
half of the 20th century continuing into the 21st. That’s not how history unfolded. It was
the centuries when communication was implemented by quills and inkwells that had
autos-da-fé and the jailing or guillotining of Enlightenment thinkers. During World War
I, when the state of the art was the wireless, Bertrand Russell was jailed for his pacifist
opinions. In the 1950s, when computers were room-size accounting machines, hundreds
of liberal writers and scholars were professionally punished. Yet in the technologically
accelerating, hyperconnected 21st century, 18 percent of social science professors are
Marxists”*; the President of the United States is nightly ridiculed by television comedians
as a racist, pervert, and moron; and technology’s biggest threat to political discourse
comes from amplifying too many dubious voices rather than suppressing enlightened
ones.

Now consider variations across place. Western countries at the technological
frontier consistently get the highest scores in indexes of democracy and human rights,
while many backward strongman states are at the bottom, routinely jailing or killing
government critics. The lack of a correlation between technology and repression is
unsurprising when you analyze the channels of information flow in any human society.
For dissidents to be influential, they have to get their message out to a wide network via
whatever channels of communication are available—pamphleteering, soap-box oration,
subversive soirées in cafés and pubs, word of mouth. These channels enmesh influential
dissidents in a broad social network which makes them easy to identify and track down.

Lawyers for Imam Wanted by Turkish 
Authorities Fear for Their Client's Life 
Fethullah Gulen has been accused by Turkish President Erdogan of 
ordering the launch of July coup 
DEVLIN BARRETT 
Aug. 5, 2016 1:34 p.m. ET 
Lawyers for the imam living in Pennsylvania whom Turkish authorities accuse of directing a coup last month in 
that country said Friday they fear for his life and may ask U.S. authorities to help protect him. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031480 
Since the failed coup that led to the deaths of 271 people, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused 
the imam, Fethullah Gulen, of issuing instructions to launch the coup, a charge Mr. Gulen has denied. 
Turkish authorities have demanded the U.S. extradite Mr. Gulen immediately to Turkey, but The Wall Street 
Journal reported Thursday that U.S. officials don't expect to do that, citing people familiar with the discussions. 
U.S. officials see problems with the evidence presented thus far by Turkey, and they are concerned 
about strident public statements made by Turkish leaders against Mr. Gulen, those people said. 
Mr. Erdogan has called Mr. Gulen and his supporters a terrorist network, a charge U.S. officials have long 
discounted. Turkey in May officially designated Mr. Gulen's network a terrorist organization, making 
membership a crime under Turkish law. 
Mr. Erdogan's government has pressed the Obama administration since the coup to extradite Mr. Gulen, 
arguing that pursuing the imam is part of the broader campaign against terrorism. At times, the Turkish leader's 
aides have said Ankara would view as hostile any foreign government that gave sanctuary to leaders of the 
Gulen movement. 
Turkey hasn't yet made a formal extradition request to the U.S., and Turkish officials say they plan to provide 
more evidence to the Justice Department. 
Mr. Gulen, 75 years old, came to the U.S. in 1999, and has a devoted following in Turkey and other countries. 
At a press conference in Washington on Friday, Mr. Gulen's lawyers said they have spoken to the Justice 
Department about the demands for extradition but are unaware of the U.S. government's thinking or plans. 
Asked if they feared for his life, one of Mr. Gulen's lawyers, Reid Weingarten said, We do. We're very 
concerned about his safety. The lawyer said they are discussing whether to ask U.S. authorities for help in 
safeguarding their client. 
A Turkish court has issued a warrant for Mr. Gulen's arrest, and Turkish and U.S. authorities have privately 
discussed scenarios in which Mr. Gulen might be extradited. But several U.S. officials said they cannot now 
envision a scenario in which they turn him over to Turkey. 
It would be unprecedented and appalling if the U.S. took a frail, almost octogenarian, plopped him on a plane 
to go back into that kind of setting with the hideous things that are being said about him by the entire Turkish 
government, said Mr. Weingarten. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031481 
The bluster, the conspiracy theories, and the threats of Mr. Erdogan are not strong enough to overwhelm the 
American legal system, he added. And for that reason we believe that Mr. Gulen should not and will not be 
extradited. 
Mr. Weingarten said the chances that his client helped plot a coup from his base in the Poconos is about as 
likely as a meteor striking the lawyer's office while he was speaking.

Turkey coup bid: Fethullah Gulen's lawyers 
fear attack on his life 
• 25 minutes ago 
Lawyers for US-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen say they fear an attack on his life, in the wake of the failed coup 
attempt on 15 July in Turkey. 
Turkey has issued an arrest warrant for Mr Gulen, accusing him of orchestrating the coup attempt. It has called on the US to 
extradite him. 
Mr Gulen denies any involvement. 
Turkey has cracked down heavily in the wake of the coup attempt. On Friday the governing AK Party ordered an internal purge 
of Gulen supporters. 
More than 270 people died in events surrounding the coup attempt. 
Speaking at a news conference in Washington, Mr Gulen's lawyers said they expected him to remain at the Pennsylvania 
compound where he lives in self-imposed exile, and not attempt to flee. 
Mr Gulen is a reclusive figure who rarely makes contact with the media. 
Although Turkey has demanded his extradition, it has yet to make a formal request. 
The US has said its judiciary will consider a request if and when it is filed. It also asked for evidence of the cleric's involvement 
in the coup attempt, which Turkey says it has supplied. 
Mr Gulen's lawyers said it was most unlikely any extradition request would stand up in a US court and almost no chance that 
their client would get a fair trial in Turkey, given what had been said against him there since the coup attempt. 
One of the lawyers, Reid Weingarten, said: It would be unprecedented and appalling if the United States took a frail almost-
octogenarian, plopped him on a plane to go back into that kind of setting with the hideous things that are being said about him 
by the entire Turkish government. 
Much of Turkey's crackdown has targeted perceived supporters of the cleric. 
Tens of thousands of public sector workers have been suspended or dismissed, with many having their passports cancelled. 
There has also been a massive reshuffle of the military. 
About 18,000 people have been detained or arrested. 
Now local branches of the AK Party have been told to begin a purge of suspected Gulenists in their ranks. 
Mr Gulen had been a close ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan until a bitter split between his movement and the party of 
the president three years ago. 
Turkey has listed Mr Gulen's movement as a terrorist organisation.

Lawyers for U.S.-based 
Turkish cleric fear attacks 
on his life 
WASHINGTON BY JULIA HARTE 
Lawyers for U.S.-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen said on Friday 
they feared attacks on his life following Turkey's demands that he be 
extradited to face allegations that he ordered a failed coup against the 
government last month. 
The lawyers said they expected Gulen, who has denied any 
involvement in the July 15 coup attempt, will remain in his remote 
mountain compound in Pennsylvania. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031484 
We have read concerns from Turkey that Mr. Gulen, this elderly, frail 
religious leader, is going to flee to another country, said Steptoe & 
Johnson LLP attorney Reid Weingarten on Friday, calling such 
allegations absurd. 
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has blamed Gulen for the violence, 
in which Erdogan said 237 people were killed excluding the plotters 
and more than 2,100 wounded, and said the United States should 
extradite him to Turkey. The U.S. government has not done so, and 
the dispute has raised questions about relations between the two allies. 
Turkey, a member of the NATO alliance, hosts American troops and 
warplanes at Incirlik Air Base, an important staging area for the U.S.-
led fight against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. 
At a news conference in Washington, Weingarten and Michael Miller, 
another Steptoe attorney, said evidence from a 2015 case financed by 
the Turkish government against Gulen in U.S. federal court in 
Pennsylvania showed that the Turkish government relies on dubious 
proof to make its case against him. 
That case alleged Gulen issued coded orders to followers in the 
Turkish judiciary in a 2009 sermon to persecute members of another 
religious sect. It also alleged that the script of a popular Turkish 
television show was laced with follow-up messages. The case was 
dismissed by a judge in June. 
Turkish government officials, however, say such evidence is valid 
because Gulen operates covertly and sends encoded messages to his 
followers. 
Turkey has sent the United States new documents in recent days 
containing evidence that Turkish authorities say proves the cleric was 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031485 
behind the attempted coup. U.S. officials say they are looking through 
them.

Will, if you're concerned that people might want to slice it up, then we likely should not go with the FTP site (option A), 
because the link would not be protected and someone could find it. Posting on Steptoe's YouTube channel (option B) 
with secured settings would make the link only accessible to those who receive the link. It would also provide reporters 
with a faster way to view the video since they would not have to download it. Does that make sense?

I just received a copy of the audio recording with Q&A. The video recording will be available mid-to-late afternoon. As 
the file will be too large to distribute via email, we have two posting options: 
a) Upload to Steptoe's FTP site, where the file is public but not (easily) discoverable to the casual Steptoe.com browser or 
searcher. We would send reporters the link, at which point they would download the recording in order to watch it. 
B) Upload the file to Steptoe's YouTube channel and set the security around the video so that it's only watchable by 
someone who has the link. It would not be discoverable by anyone who doesn't have the exact URL (searching or 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031487 
browsing). The advantage with this option is the reporters could watch the video via the YouTube player, rather than 
downloading a file. 
I believe our preference is the second choice?

this argument, but music is much easier to analyze. It is linear, highly
mathematical and largely uniform by culture and language. Yet it is
universally appreciated. Is music a computational or a creative endeavor?

Is Music Computable

To prove a piece of music is non-computable requires two tests. First to
show we can ‘reduce’ it to a problem that is already non-computable and,
second, to demonstrate it ‘looks like’ or ‘sounds like’ a piece of music. An
accountant would say it needs to pass ‘the smell test’.

The first non-computable problem to be studied in depth was
Emil Post’s Word Problem. Post was a contemporary of Alan Turing
and studied at the Institute of Advanced Mathematics in Princeton. He
solved the Halting Problem six months before Turing, but his proof used
a complex recursive method called the lambda calculus. Turing’s method
was far more practical, which is why we now refer to Turing machines
rather than Post machines. Later in his career, Post came up with a
branch of non-computable mathematics called ‘Post Problems. They
look like a puzzle you might find in a newspaper. Imagine starting with
the word ‘camel’ and being asked to turn it into ‘aardvark, using only a
few simple rules. We'll make the problem very easy to start with: cam
© aard and el ovark. This solution is obvious; just do the substitutions
and you are there. But what if the rules were a little more complex?
Gennadii Makanin, a Russian mathematician based at the University of
Moscow, found a set of extremely simple puzzles that are nevertheless
non-computable. Here is one:

{“CCBB” <> “BBCC”, “BCCCBB” <>
“CBBBCC”, “ACCBB” <> “BBA? “ABCCCBB”
© “CBBA’, “BBCCBBBBCC” <>
“BBCCBBBBCCA’}

Word Problem

Can a computer tell us which word problems have a solution and
which do not? The answer is ‘no. Word substitution puzzles are a class
of non-computable problem. Martin Davis proved this in 1948. Using
a reduction argument we can use these word problems to prove some
music is also non-computable.

Jews had been subjected to “ceilings: no more than 7 to 8 percent. (When I started Yale Law
School in 1959, I noticed that the university’s motto was written in Hebrew—the biblical words
“Urim V’Tomim.” When I asked a friend who has graduated Yale College why Yale’s motto was
in Hebrew, he replied: “It’s a test—if you can read it, you can’t go here!”) But in a zero sum
game — which admissions surely are — floors can impose ceilings, especially if the Black
percentage is taken from the Jewish percentage, as Jewish leaders feared was happening. This
reality led to the famous “bagel” exchange:

Dr. Chase N. Peterson, dean of admissions at Harvard, recently addressed a group of
Jewish faculty members suspicious that Harvard had decided to reduce the number of
Jews it would admit. Peterson averred that there is no particular “docket” or area of the
country whose quota of admissions has been reduced. Rather, he said, it is “the
doughnuts around the big cities,” which are not as successful with the Harvard Admissions
Committee as they used to be...” But now we have to be terribly hard on people with good
grades from the good suburban high schools, good, sold clean-nosed kids who really don’t
have enough else going for them.” The doughnuts, said Peterson, included such areas as
Westchester County and Long Island, New York, suburban New Jersey, and Shaker
Heights, Ohio. When he described these areas to the Jewish faculty members, the
Crimson reports, one stood up and said, “Dr. Peterson, those aren’t doughnuts, they’re
bagels.”

After the account of this exchange appeared, I received dozens of letters and calls from indignant
alumni and parents of applicants concerned that Harvard was returning to a quota system. These
concerns increased when the Bakke case came to the Supreme Court and Harvard took the lead
in defending race-specific affirmative action programs, such as the one it has adopted.

My brother, Nathan, was then working as the top lawyer for the American Jewish Congress, a
generally progressive social action organization. He asked me to help draft an Amicus in the
Bakke brief that presented the views of Jews who supported civil rights but who were concerned
about the impact of race-specific affirmative action programs on Jewish applicants. It was a
daunting task, requiring an exquisite balance.

The Bakke case involved a white applicant to the medical school at the University of California at
Davis (also a state school). Allan Bakke had been denied admission, he claimed, based on his
race. The California Supreme Court agreed with Bakke, ruling that the medical school’s
admission policy violated equal protection. The medical school sought and obtained review by
the Supreme Court. This time there could be no claim of mootness, since Bakke was not
completing his medical school education. The court would have to confront directly the divisive
issue of race-specific affirmative action.

Our brief strongly supported affirmative action as a mechanism for remedying past “educational
handicaps” and for assuring diversity among the student body, but we opposed the concept that
every racial, religious or other group was entitled to proportional representation—or quotas:

A society permeated by racial, ethnic, religious and sexual proportional representation

X-rays

The first Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Wilhelm Rontgen in
1901. He had discovered ‘X’ rays; so called because he had no better
name for them. X-rays, as they became known, are just light of a very
high frequency.

Light comes in a variety of colors; at the low end of the frequency
scale we see red, higher up blue and, at the top, violet. At this point
human eyes give up and cannot see anything higher, so ultraviolet
light is invisible to us. Bees, on the other hand, can see a long way into
the ultraviolet spectrum and some flowers have beautiful ultraviolet
markings that attract bees for pollination. Daylight contains a great
deal of ultraviolet light which is wasted on us — other than to tan our
skin. But all is not lost. Clever manufacturers put fluorescent dyes
into their washing powders which stick to our clothes and convert
ultraviolet into visible light, making our T-shirts look brighter as they
reflect more visible light than fell on them. You can see this effect most
easily in a disco when ultraviolet lights are shone on the dance floor
and anyone wearing a newly washed T-shirt will glow bright white. The
other common substance that fluoresces strongly on a dance floor is
tonic water. Quinine, the active ingredient in tonic water, is a strongly

20, Section 224

This section misunderstands the purpose and effect of the model Jaw and should be
deleted. The Department’s model law was never designed to supplant pre-existing state laws
which target pimping, pandering, or prostitution, but rather to supplement those laws. At the
time that the Department’s model law was issued, most states had comprehensive laws
addressing prostitution, pimping, and pandering. However, most states did not have laws
focused on human trafficking. The Depattment’s law was designed to raise awareness of the
issue of trafficking and to encourage states to closely examine cases to ensure that cases
involving fraud, force, and coercion are not labeled as prostitution offenses. The Department
believes the law has been successful in accomplishing this goal.

21. Section 231

The Department opposes any statutory changes to the annual report, The change in
subsection (1) is unnecessary as this language is currently included in the annual report. The
information requested in the new subsection (I) would be excessively burdensome to gather.

22, Section 232

DO3 opposes this addition as unnecessary. Human trafficking laws that do not require
the proof of force, fraud, or coercion, namely laws that concern minor victims of severe forms of
buman trafficking, are already discussed at the annual conferences. To the extent that this
provision would require the Department to discuss human trafficking laws pertaining to adult
victims that do not require the showing of force, fraud, or coercion, such laws would not fall
under the definition of human trafficking and the annual conference would be an inappropriate
venue for the discussion of such laws. However, DOJ trafficking prosecutors utilize a wide
range of statutes in addition to Chapter 77 offenses to address all criminal conduct associated
with human trafficking. This includes the Mann Act, money laundering, visa fraud, immigration
offenses, criminal labor violations, and extortion, in addition to other criminal statutes,
Accordingly, DOJ traiming at annual conferences, the National Advocacy Center, the National
Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and field training with the Department of Justice
funded Human Trafficking Task Forces and provided through the Innocence Lost National
Initiative include discussion on the importance of using all available criminal statutes as essential
tools in charging decisions. Thus, this section is unnecessary.

23. Section 233

DOJ opposes the change to section 206 of the Trafficking Victims Protection
Reauthorization Act of 2005, which would remove the discretion of agencies in informing the
Senior Policy Operating Group (SPOG) of grants. Such a change could be read as giving the

SPOG oversight authority over grants. It also fails to take into consideration situations where
gtant-making agencies may be unable to notify the SPOG of the grant. i

Democratic flavor-of-the day candidate. The media and political class will predetermine

irrelevance otherwise.

A Democrat-leaning candidate would have to top the ideal third-party ticket. We need someone
with a shot at snaking a plurality of the vote in the blue states Hillary Clinton won (227 electoral
votes), but moderate enough to win a plurality in some combination of Trump states like Florida,
Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan (another 119 votes). The right candidate may even to put
North Carolina, Ohio, Indiana in play for a centrist bi-partisan ticket as well (totaling an electoral
sweep of 464 elector votes). A right leaning candidate would meet the same fate as a primary
challenger to Trump — for all intents and purposes we need to assume that 36% of voters won’t be
cleaved from Trump under any circumstances and run to win around them. The deep red states

would be off the table entirely.

With the Trump reality show airing daily, voters are now expecting to take their politics with a side
of entertainment. Heretofore, ratings will matter no matter how dry the policy topic. Surely
Stephen Colbert would gladly sacrifice his executive producer Chris Licht to produce a daily
comedic segment of this dream candidate interviewing Americans in truck stops and McDonald’s
across the country. A few of the “Saturday Night Live” script writers could certainly be enticed to
disguise serious debates as informative amusement. Any candidate must be committed to a near
daily cadence of high quality, compelling video production. It will be especially crucial to keep
the voters’ attention during what will be a raucous Democratic primary season. Rules governing
access to the general election debate stage dictate that a candidate enjoy support of at least 15% of

voters in the months leading up to the general election.

This dream candidate would pledge to serve only four years and address all of the U.S.’s ticking
time bombs like Social Security, Medicare, health care reform, climate change, money in politics,
gerrymandering, and infrastructure investment in a single term. This one-and-done term decouples
our candidate from the usual politics and gives them the power of promise and deliver decisive

action. A four-year term pledge ensures governance independent of campaign finance concerns and

ideas are often stymied by an inexperienced White House that doesn’t
understand the role of drama and stagecraft in diplomacy. They say
that Hillary is the daring, decisive risktaker, while the president is
hampered by slow reflexes and an overly cautious and unimaginative
approach. Not surprisingly, Obama hands insist this is wrong. The
only significant policy difference between the two principals, they
note, was over Afghanistan, where the president’s policy hardly
lacked boldness. On Egypt, it was Hillary who early on recommended
caution and Obama who insisted that U.S. policy should be to push
for an immediate transition. And they offer a domestic example for
good measure: had Hillary been president, she would likely have
sided with Rahm Emanuel and compromised much earlier on health-
care reform, which would have meant a less ambitious bill.

Where the risktaking point might apply is in critical personnel
decisions. Hillary likes the challenge of handling big, talented,
difficult individuals; it’s what attracted her not just to Bill but also to
advisers like Richard Holbrooke. Obama (through then national-
security adviser Jim Jones) almost fired Holbrooke. Although Hillary
told the White House about her own exasperation with Holbrooke (a
position she didn’t advertise after his death), Obama’s treatment of
the envoy rankled both Clintons. “I never could understand people
who didn’t appreciate him,” Bill Clinton said in his eulogy at
Holbrooke’s Kennedy Center memorial service. This was a not-so-
veiled shot at people like Obama, who was sitting onstage nearby—
the president’s no-drama impatience with certain protean characters
extends to his strained relationship with the former president. Hillary
is caught in the middle, but doesn’t appear to be making efforts to
bring the two most important men in her life closer.

Even so, she works hard to keep the hatchet with Obama buried. This
requires staying on good terms with his White House. Hillary has
known Tom Donilon, the national-security adviser, since 1978, when

INTRODUCTION

In light of concerns about mass incarceration and excessive search practices by police, ' underenforcement of criminal law is
not the first problem that springs to mind for American criminal justice. But in fact, some of the prominent contemporary
complaints about U.S. criminal justice, as well as some longstanding ones, object to underenforcement of criminal law. Two of
the most notable categories are failures to prosecute in cases of unjustified police violence, especially against nonwhite victims,
and in cases of sexual assaults. Lower-profile examples abound as well, as do historical examples.

Gtven the nation's history, underenforcement problems are often related to race. Insufficient law enforcement attention to
crimes in minority neighborhoods, for example, has been criticized as depriving African American victims and communities of
their fair share of government protection from criminal harm. ? In earlier eras, law enforcement inattention to, or wholesale
neglect [*845] of, white offenders' victimization of black victims - in lynchings, attacks on civil right activists, sexual assaults,
and other contexts - was often patent. ? But the problem of unjustified underenforcement is not confined to these contexts, nor
to the United States. Failures to prosecute arise from a fundamental structural challenge faced by all criminal justice systems:
how to ensure unbiased, evenhanded enforcement practices - safeguards in favor of justified enforcement. This challenge gets
less attention than criminal procedure's central preoccupation of guarding against excessive or groundless criminal charges.
Concern about misuse of the state's prosecution authority rightly motivates much in criminal procedure, from search and
seizure rules * and judicial review of arrests > to evidence disclosure duties, © the right to counsel, 7 and standards of proof. °

! USS. incarceration rates quintupled over the last forty years and are five to seven times higher than those in other advanced democracies.

The request that had come across my desk a few days earlier need not have
changed that. Even though Arik had failed, for now, to bring down the
government, he was keen to make political capital from the collapse of Camp
David. He now declared his intention to pay a visit to the Temple Mount. The
Mount - or as it was called in Arabic, Haram al-Sharif — was part of Israel. The
unsubtle point of Arik’s visit was to dramatize his determination to keep it that
way. The target of this political theatre was not Arafat or the Palestinians. It was
the Israeli public, me, and my government. In an all-perfect world, I would have
liked to find a way to block the visit. In a democracy, it wasn’t that easy. The only
way I could do so was on the grounds it was a threat to public order or security, a
judgement in the hands of our police and security services. I duly asked for the
views of Avi Dichter of the Shin Bet, and Shlomo Ben-Ami, who in addition to
being interim Foreign Minister was Minister of Internal Security, in charge of the
police. Both came back with the same answer: though we’d all be happier if Arik
stayed down on his farm in the Negev, there was no reason to expect his visit
would pose a major public-order issue, and no basis for blocking it. When Shlomo
contacted Jibril Rajoub, Arafat’s West Bank security commander, Rajoub asked
only that two conditions be imposed, and Shlomo agreed. The first was that the
visit not occur on a Friday, when the mosques would be full of worshipers; the
second, that Sharon not set foot in either of the mosques on the Haram. Our chief
of police informed Sharon that if he didn’t accept the conditions, we’d deny him
permission to go. But he agreed. When he went, for about half an hour under
police escort on Thursday morning the 28, he complied.

At first, we thought it would prove a one-off media stunt. But that evening,
Danny Yatom brought me an intelligence report with evidence that Arafat’s
Palestinian Authority was planning for wide-scale violence after Friday prayers, in
protest over Sharon’s visit. Danny called Dennis Ross. Madeleine Albright called
Arafat, to urge him to ensure this didn’t happen. But as Dennis would remark later,

The trouble began the next day, shortly after Friday prayers. It was also the eve
of the Jewish New Year, and the Western Wall area was crowded. As people
poured out of the mosques, a number began hurling stones, some of them the size
of small boulders, onto the Jewish worshippers and police below. One knocked out
the highly experienced, steady-handed commander of the Jerusalem police, which
I’m sure contributed to making the confrontation that followed even worse. By the

Jeffrey Epstein: February 2, 2011

t's Groundhog Day, and once-reclusive Jeffrey Epstein is hit-
ting the peak of his fame in a ripped-from-the-headlines epi-
sode of Law & Order: SVU that tracks, eerily well, with his
| own legal history.

The setup for this episode is the rape of a very young French
1 girl. One who's been flown to New York on a very rich man’s pri-
4 vate jet, then flown back—coach class —to Paris.

_ Onthe plane, she has a freak-out. She thinks the middle-aged
guy sitting next to her is trying to rape her. In Paris, the local
“police get involved.

__ ‘It was just a birthday party,” the tearful girl tells the SVU
¢ Ops via videoconference from France. “We were his present.”

q The cops ask: Whose present?

_ “The billionaire. The one who owns the jet.”

_ Does the French girl know his name?

the deposition of Tommy Mattola. That assertion is untrue. Mr. Mattola's deposition was set by
the law firm of Searcy Denny Scarola Barnhart and Shipley. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit “N”
at (16.

74. Edwards gave notice that he intended to take David Copperfield's deposition.
Edwards possessed a legitimate basis for doing so. Epstein’s housekeeper and one of the only
witnesses who did not appear for deposition with an Epstein bought attorney, Alfredo Rodriguez,
testified that David Copperfield was a guest at Epstein’s house on several occasions. His name
also appears frequently in the message pads confiscated from Epstein’s house. It has been
publicly reported that Copperfield himself has had allegations of sexual misconduct made against
him by women claiming he sexually abused them, and one of Epstein’s sexual assault victims
also alleged that Copperfield had touched her in an improper sexual way while she was at
Epstein’s house. Mr. Copperfield likely has relevant information and deposition was reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit “N” at
17.

75. Epstein also takes issue with Edwards identifying Bill Richardson as a possible
witness. Richardson was properly identified as a possible witness because Epstein’s personal
pilot testified to Richardson joining Epstein at Epstein’s New Mexico Ranch. There was
information indicating that Epstein had young girls at his ranch which, given the circumstances
of the case, raised the reasonable inference he was sexually abusing these girls as he had abused
girls in West Palm Brena and elsewhere. Richardson had also returned campaign donations that

were given to him by Epstein, indicating that he believed that there was something about Epstein

play it, and getting reinforced on correct behavior
Interactive Verbal Instruction
— Example task: Learn to build a particular structure of blocks faster based on a
combination of imitation, reinforcement and verbal instruction, than by imitation
and reinforcement without verbal instruction
Written Media
— Example task: Learn to build a structure of blocks by looking at a series of diagrams
showing the structure in various stages of completion

e Deduction, from uncertain premises observed in the world
— Example task: If Ben more often picks up red balls than blue balls, and Ben is given
a choice of a red block or blue block to pick up, which is he more likely to pick up?
e Induction, from uncertain premises observed in the world
— Example task: If Ben comes into the lab every weekday morning, then is Ben likely
to come to the lab today (a weekday) in the morning?
Abduction, from uncertain premises observed in the world
— Example task: If women more often give the robot food than men, and then someone
of unidentified gender gives the robot food, is this person a man or a woman?
Causal reasoning, from uncertain premises observed in the world
— Example task: If the robot knows that knocking down Ben’s tower of blocks makes
him angry, then what will it say when asked if kicking the ball at Ben’s tower of
blocks will make Ben mad?
e Physical reasoning, based on observed “fuzzy rules” of naive physics
— Example task: Given two balls (one rigid and one compressible) and two tunnels
(one significantly wider than the balls, one slightly narrower than the balls), can
the robot guess which balls will fit through which tunnels?

reflecting the balance in each part of the south.

Israeli troops might still have to cross into Lebanon, but only for brief,
targeted operations to preempt preparations for a terror attack. “We need to
remember what we’re there for,” I said. “We have no territorial claims. It’s to
protect the north of Israel. But it will end up being about protecting our own
troops inside the security zone. It will be like the Bar-Lev line in 1973, fighting
for fortifications we don’t need.” I couldn’t persuade him. I’m sure he
understood the argument, and he may even have agreed. But when Katyushas
next fell on northern Israel, he as Minister of Defense, not I, would be the one in
the political firing line.

Far from straining our relations, our frank exchanges on Lebanon seemed to
build further trust between us. We worked closely on a range of issues. When
Sayeret Matkal or another intelligence unit planned an operation across our
borders, both of us would present the action to the cabinet. During the
operations, I’d be either in the kirva or a forward command post. Since nearly
all of them happened after nightfall, Yitzhak would usually be back home,
asleep, by the time they ended. I would phone him. The trademark voice — slow,
gravelly, deep even when he was wide awake — would answer. I’d tell him the
mission was over and — with only one exception during my period as head of
intelligence — successful. “Todah,” he would say. “Lehitraot.” Thanks. Bye. He
was never a man to waste words.

For one of the very few times I can remember, He phoned me one morning in
October 1985. It came a couple of days after an especially gruesome Palestinian
terror attack. Even with Arafat now more than a thousand miles away in Tunis,
much of Rabin’s focus was taken up in responding to, or trying to preempt,
Palestinian terrorism. The issue was especially sensitive politically in the wake
of a war in Lebanon that was supposed to have eliminated that threat. For Rabin,
moreover, it had become personal. He’d had to sanction an unprecedented
exchange of 1,150 Palestinian security prisoners earlier in the year to secure the
freedom of three Israeli soldiers, including one of our men from Sultan Yacoub,
who had ended up in the hands of the radical Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine — General Command. Now a group from another of the radical factions,
the Palestine Liberation Front, had hijacked an Italian cruise ship called the
Achille Lauro en route from Egypt to Israel. They murdered one of the
passengers, a wheelchair-bound, 69-year-old Jewish American named Leon
Klinghoffer, and dumped his body overboard.

simply transform the way we perceive the world without altering
reality itself. Let me give you an example. While writing these lines,
my friend calls. He is at Heathrow Airport waiting to get on a plane
to Austria for a skiing holiday. His plane has been delayed for three
hours already, because of snowstorms at his destination. I guess this
is both a good and bad thing, he says. Waiting at the airport is not
pleasant, but he quickly concludes that snow today means better
skiing conditions tomorrow. His brain works to match the unexpected
misfortune of being stuck at the airport to its eager anticipation of a
fun getaway.

A canceled flight is hardly tragic, but even when the incidents that
befall us are the type of horrific events we never expected to
encounter, we automatically seek evidence confirming that our
misfortune is a blessing in disguise. No, we did not anticipate losing
our job, being ill or getting a divorce, but when these incidents occur,
we search for the upside. These experiences mature us, we think.
They may lead to more fulfilling jobs and stable relationships in the
future. Interpreting a misfortune in this way allows us to conclude
that our sunny expectations were correct after all — things did work
out for the best.

Silver Linings

How do we find the silver lining in storm clouds? To answer that, my
colleagues — renowned neuroscientist Ray Dolan and neurologist
Tamara Shiner — and I instructed volunteers in the {MRI scanner to
visualize a range of medical conditions, from broken bones to
Alzheimer's, and rate how bad they imagined these conditions to be.
Then we asked them: If you had to endure one of the following,
which would you rather have — a broken leg or a broken arm?
Heartburn or asthma? Finally, they rated all the conditions again.
Minutes after choosing one particular illness out of many, the
volunteers suddenly found that the chosen illness was less

Atlantic Council 
Syria: Blackberry Diplomacy 
By Frederic C. Hof 
July 11, 2013

, Mahle, Melissa 
Seche, Stephen A. 
>, Dixon, Timothy 
A friendly discussion about Syria with a former US State Department colleague gave rise to a point I 
will not soon forget. Fred, there's no time for policy deliberations about Syria or anyplace else. We 
live in the era of Blackberry diplomacy. We react and we improvise as best we can. 
Anyone under the age of thirty reading the above would probably think, Why in the world is the US 
government using the Blackberry? Those who turned thirty long before the end of the last century—
even those of us who try seriously not to be technological Luddites—wonder sometimes if the 
communications revolution and the 24/7 news cycle it has spawned will end up doing more harm than 
good to the progress of civilization and well-being of the republic. 
Those who have had the privilege and burden of working in the US national security establishment 
are well-acquainted with how hard it is to find time to think. This was true long before the advent of 
email and other forms of electronic communication. Although there may have been times when 
officials could contemplate great matters of state at something approaching leisure, those days have 
been long gone. Even offices created expressly to explore policy options stretching beyond a twenty 
minute horizon—the State Department's Policy Planning Staff comes to mind—routinely get pulled 
into the maelstrom of daily struggles to manage breaking developments through some combination of 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030211 
strategic messaging and diplomatic demarches. Email makes it easy for officials up-and-down the 
chain to plunge into the fray, battling to mold language for use at a daily briefing; language that all-
too-often mystifies or misleads foreign listeners who hang on words from the podium as if they are 
meant to convey the results of deep, deliberative thought on the part of the world's only superpower. 
Yet email neither created the problem nor prevents its solution. 
The problem is the failure of government, certainly in the context of Syria and likely in other foreign 
policy contexts as well, to wrap the daily news cycle food fight in an insulated casing of objectives and 
strategy clearly understandable to those charged with planning and executing foreign or national 
security policy. There may be some who believe that objectives and strategy are just so 20th century; 
so Brent Scowcroft-like and so pre-Twitter. There may be some who actually handle affairs of state in 
ways they would not dream of applying to their personal financial portfolios. Perhaps resistance to 
structured, deliberative processes producing objectives and accompanying strategies is a function of 
fewer and fewer people in the national security establishment ever having availed themselves of 
military service; an experience where matters of this nature become, through training and education, 
as natural as breathing. Perhaps in the specific case of Syria there has been a temptation to avoid 
the hard choices such a process would serve up in the hope that the regime of Basher al-Assad 
would just go away, thereby making hard choices someone else's problem. 
The arrival of a new assistant to the president for national security affairs is an ideal opportunity to 
restore best practices to the national security apparatus. To her credit, Susan Rice appears to be 
reaching out with this very much in mind. If changes are made that better serve the president by 
forcing people to think through policy options in the context of objectives and strategies, those 
changes should not reflect poorly on the stewardship of her predecessor. The president gets 
precisely the national security system he mandates and deserves. He is, as JFK noted in the 
immediate wake of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, the responsible officer of government. 
In the end it is the president, and not the Blackberry or some other device, who will drive the direction 
and processes of foreign policy and diplomacy. It is up to him to tell his national security advisor that 
he wants the interagency to stop tweeting and start thinking; to tell him how he should be evaluating 
US national security objectives with respect to Syria (for example) and strategy options aimed at 
accomplishing them. This kind of deliberative process will not require people to wear powdered wigs 
and inscribe talking points on parchment with quill pens. It will not even oblige them to disconnect 
electronically. 
Perhaps the biggest obstacle to an orderly national security process that is deliberative is the sheer 
brainpower of the people sitting atop the bureaucratic pyramid. Barack Obama and Susan Rice are 
among the very brightest people to serve in the US government. They may think they can figure Syria 
out themselves, within a small circle of trusted political advisers. They may think they can handle 
Syria without reaching beyond their own national security staff, without probing deeply into the 
Departments of State, Defense, the intelligence community, and elsewhere where additional 
expertise resides. They will outsmart themselves if that is the approach they choose. 
Blackberry diplomacy is a choice, not a device decision and certainly not a fact of life. Even in this 
day and age, it is possible to figure out what one wants and how to go about getting it: even in 
government work.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018612.txt,"The most important thing for my safety is that I'm willing and able to walk away from
situations. I'm not desperate -- I won't starve or die if I don't do this work. I meet all my
clients in public first for a meal, and if someone sketches me out, I leave. I'm not so
desperate that I'll get into a situation that scares me.

I guess I am at risk if I meet a really crazy person who wants to chop me up and put me in
a dumpster. But I could meet a person like that during a normal night at a bar, too.

The major risks that I see include that I might catch an STD -- but I use protection. I
might end up alone with someone who believes that the money he's paying actually gives
him the entitlement to do whatever he wants to my body, but I've never encountered
anyone like that. The thing is, as I said before, I haven't met anyone who I think would
actually describe themselves as paying for sex. The terms on which I continue to see
these men are probably less explicitly negotiated than an escort's terms would be. I don't
have flat rates, for example.

I've heard escorts complaining that people who use sugar baby sites are unprofessional,
and I think that from an escort's perspective they probably are.

Clarisse Thorn: If people are unwilling to actually talk about sex for money, it must
be hard to negotiate your encounters. Do you have a set of steps for negotiation?

Olivia: I haven't been doing this for very long. It's varied so far. Usually, I meet them for
some kind of meal, and we chat. We have a perfunctory conversation, like -- How was
your day? Then one of us will say something like, Tell me a bit more about what you're
looking for. Why are you on the site?”

Then we'll explain our deal to each other. Like, he might say: I'm divorced, I'm looking
for companionship.” At some point, money comes up. I am always extremely vague
when I talk about money. I've found a good deal of variation in how squeamish people
are about money.

For example, one client was saying that he wanted to get married again, but not yet. I
said, Huh, well, if you're interested in a more emotional relationship, how do you feel
about involving money? The way he explained it to me was that people are attracted to
each other for all kinds of reasons, probably including money, so why not be up front
about the fact that money is attractive. He seemed almost confused about why I asked.
With that guy, I ended up sleeping with him before we even talked about money -- which
was a huge risk, but I thought it might work, and it did. We had the money conversation
immediately after we had sex -- at some point when we were taking a break, I asked what
he was looking for more specifically from this relationship, and he said that he wanted to
see me again, maybe once a week. I think I asked him his preference for a monthly
allowance as opposed to every time we meet, and he said he'd rather do something
monthly. Then when we were getting dressed, he pulled out $1,000 cash and handed it to
me, and said, I'll give you the balance next time we see each other.”

With other people I can be more straightforward. Maybe they aren't sure how to set up
the relationship, so maybe I talk about another client, like: I have another client I see 3
times per month for $3,000, and they might say, That sounds good. But some guys
will just negotiate it per encounter. One guy brought it up very quickly after we'd

Epstein’s arrest, investigators are believed to
have found a list of men’s names on his
computer and asked him whether they had been
‘treated’ to sexual encounters with his menage
of minors.

Conviction: Jeffrey Epstein

‘He took the Fifth Amendment, refusing to answer, indicating that if he were to answer the question,
it could be incriminating,’ a source told The Mail on Sunday.

Epstein struck a deal resulting in what commentators characterised as a ‘slap on the wrist’ for him,
and ended up serving 13 months of his sentence, much of it in a liberal work-release programme
Lawyer Brad Edwards, who represented several of Epstein’s victims, said: ‘Rather than punish him
the way they would an average Joe, they sent a clear message that with enough money and power
and influence, the system can be bought.’

Virginia was spared her the humiliation of having to go before a jury, and has kept her feelings
bottled up until last weekend's photograph of Andrew with Epstein triggered distressing memories.

Virginia says: ‘| am appalled. To me, it’s saying, “We are above the law.” But Jeffrey is a monster.’
Last night, neither Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell nor Prince Andrew would comment on Virginia’s story.

repatriation act could drive spending amounting to $185-200bn in revenues through
2025, which could help fund infrastructure/defense spending.

S&P 500 companies could bring back over $1tn - mostly in Tech & Health Care
Our FX team has written that US corporates in aggregate (including Financials) hold
~$2tn in cash overseas, and their work suggests that nearly half is concentrated within
20 companies. Similarly, as we discuss below, half of the repatriated cash following the
2004 Homeland Investment Act came from just 15 companies, predominantly in Pharma
and Tech. Our own analysis of the S&P 500 (based on filings and estimates from our
analysts) suggests that non-Financials in the S&P hold approximately $1.2tn overseas,
nearly three-quarters of which is in Tech and Health Care (Chart 4).

Repatriation in context: a look back at 2004

The last repatriation holiday in the US was the Homeland Investment Act (HIA) of 2004
(part of the American Jobs Creation Act), which allowed for a one-time repatriation of
foreign earnings by US multinationals at a reduced effective tax rate of 5.25% (vs. the
statutory 35% rate), based on an allowable exemption of 85% of foreign earnings from
US taxes (35% x [1-85%] = 5.25%). This deduction could be claimed in the tax year
beginning before or after the passage date in Oct. 2004. Approximately $300bn was
repatriated, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)’s U.S. International
Transactions Accounts Data, vs. an average of S60bn over the prior five years. The IRS
estimates’ that 843 US companies took advantage of the act.

Despite HIA’s intent; most repatriated cash was spent on buybacks/dividends
Despite the U.S. Treasury Department’s guidelines that repatriated earnings should be
spent on capital investment, R&D, M&A, and other pro-growth uses such as hiring, this
was not ultimately the result: the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER}
estimates? that $0.92 of every $1.00 brought back was used to return cash to
shareholders ($0.79 for buybacks and $0.15 for dividends)’, and that repatriation
ultimately did not lead to a pick-up in capex, employment or R&D. In fact, a 2011 report
by US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations® found that the top 15

government, but of non-governmental organizations such as the media, the academy and, most
important, the citizenry. As I wrote in Rights from Wrongs:

This balance is part of our dynamic system of governing, which eschews too much
concentration of power. American sovereignty, unlike that of most other Western
democracies, does not reside in one branch of government or even in the majority of the
people. Our sovereignty is a process, reflected in governmental concepts such as checks
and balances, separation of powers, and judicial review. More broadly it is reflected in
freedom of the press, separation of church from state, academic freedom, the free-market
economy, antitrust laws, and other structural and judicial mechanisms that make
concentration of power difficult.

These checks on abuse cannot operate effectively in the absence of visibility, accountability and
public discourse. What is needed, and what is sorely lacking, is a theory of when governmental
actions may appropriately be kept secret (and for how long) and when they must be subject to
open debate and accountability. I have been seeking to contribute to the development and
articulation of that theory by writing and teaching about areas of law in which the criteria and
standards for state action are either hidden from public view or so vague that they invite the
exercise of untrammeled discretion not subject to the rule of law.

Perhaps it is my interest in this issue of standards and accountability that is one of the reasons why
I chose to focus my academic career around areas such as the prediction and prevention of
harmful conduct, where there are few articulated standards and little public accountability. Or
perhaps it was my focus on prediction and prevention that sensitized me to the more subtle issue
of lack of visible standards and criteria. Whichever was the chicken and whichever the egg, these
two paramount areas of my interest have worked symbiotically to generate my body of
scholarship.

My insistence on articulate standards and accountability has not been without controversy. When
I espoused the need for “torture warrants” to cabin the widespread use of extreme methods of
interrogation, such as waterboarding, by the Bush Administration, I was accused of being an
apologist for torture. When I have sought to learn the actual criteria by which students are
admitted pursuant to affirmative action programs, I have been accused of insensitivity to racial
issues. When I have demanded clearly articulated rules for limiting “offensive” speech on campus,
I have been accused of favoring censorship. (More on these issues later.) When I have insisted
on neutral standards of human rights, articulated with clarity. I have been accused of being a
special pleader for Israel. The reality is that neutral standards and public accountability are
essential to democratic governance. That is why I have devoted so much of my writing and
teaching to these issues over the years.

I will continue to work on these issues as long as I can think, write and speak—even after my
active teaching career at Harvard comes to an end. I am a teacher first and foremost. All of my

work—classroom pedagogy, academic and popular writing, lecturing, media appearances, even
litigation—is teaching. Only the audience is different.

TK OK ok

My Top Questions About Dealing With Multiple Lovers

I have a lot more theoretical exposure to polyamory than personal experience, but I've
been gaining more personal experience over the last year. It's often interesting, sometimes
painful.

Some recent experiences are making me think I am not nearly as smart or as on top of my
emotions as I like to believe I am. I remind myself that I have to be willing to
acknowledge when I don't know what I'm thinking, but that's harder than it looks... I don't
always take enough time to understand my feelings before speaking or acting.

Still. Through the stupid mistakes and the understandable ones, though my own failures
to be sensitive and the little heartbreaks I've sustained, I've been learning.

One thing I think I've figured out is what I want: I want a number of different
relationships that are ongoing, and one or two relationships that are primary, or especially
committed. Ideally, in fact, I'd love to eventually have a permanent relationship with a
primary polyamorous partner in which we have kids with each other, live together most
of the time, etc, but are still polyamorous. That would be a while in the future, though --
for now, it's important to me to not feel as though my partners expect me to settle down
or stay in one place or anything like that. It seems like any relationship I develop, even
during this relatively early time in my life, could become a child-rearing relationship
eventually -- like, years from now -- but if it does, I doubt I'd want to make it
monogamous.

I recognize that we don't always get our ideal world. In fact, we usually don't. Although
polyamory is a high priority for me, it may be something I eventually compromise on,
given that the majority of people in this world identify as monogamous.

Keeping all that in mind, my preference for polyamory presents some challenges, and
questions that I worry about. Such as:

1. What are my responsibilities towards my partners’ other partners? A lot of poly
people will tell you that if you get into a relationship with, say, a married polyamorous
man, then you must also expect to interact with his spouse. In other words, don't assume
that your relationship means you only interact with one half of a couple. I'm totally fine
with this, but on occasion I've felt like I was getting sucked into the couple's problems, or
like I was expected to have no individual relationship with my partner -- that I always had
to go through his primary partner.

Yes, it is certainly my responsibility to communicate with my partners’ other partners and
to be friendly with them. But I need to set boundaries on that too -- just dating a poly guy

financial capacity to make war, threat goes from left to right smoothly at the back of
the box as tension gradually increases without the onset of armed conflict. When
effective fighting capacity is cheap and/or already well funded, the country well
armed, the increases in threat go from left to right at the front edge of the box and
encounter the cliff of catastrophe and war is declared. Cost of, or ability to wage war
varies from the front to back, and serves as the splitting factor. Considering prison
riots, social tension is the normal factor and alienation (degree of identification with
prison authority) is the splitting factor.” Using factial expressions of dogs sketched
by the Konrad Lorenz, Christopher Zeeman then of Warwick Mathematics Institute
in England, considered countenances reflecting increasing rage as the normal
factor, the amount of fear was the splitting factor. Increasing rage at high fear
increased smoothly at the back of the box; at low fear, increasing rage falls off the
cliff to an animal attack at the front of the box.” He paced as he talked, occasionally
looking up to see if | was following him. He continued,

“A light above the box casts a shadow from the roof to the floor, outlining the
gradually widening fold created by the transition from the smoothly rising back of the
roof to its ‘S-shaped’ front. This triangle on the x-y causal floor is the region in which
the discontinuity in the result surface roof results and is called the bifurcation set. An
increasing amount of the causal ‘normal factor’ is represented from left to right
along the *x’ dimension, the results of which change smoothly at the back of the roof
but encounter a discontinuous jump up or fall down crossing the inaccessible
crevice in the °S’ fold at the front of the roof. Again, the triangular shadow on the
floor made by the fold indicates the parameter region in which discontinuous
changes in the result surface occur. The reason the parameter that determines the
front to back location of the left to right movement of the ‘normal factor’ is called the
‘splitting factor’ becomes obvious. Its value determines whether the results induced
by increasing amounts of ‘normal factor’ will be smoothly changing or generate a
discontinuous jump. The entire visualizable object is called a cusp catastrophe and

Snowden still had his security clearance, despite his highly prob-
lematic exit from the CIA, because the agency had instituted a policy
a few years earlier that allowed voluntarily retiring CIA officers to
keep their clearance for two years after they left. This “free pass,” as
one former CIA officer called the two-year grace period, had been
intended to make it easier for retiring officers to find jobs in parts of
the defense industry. This accommodation, in turn, made it easier for
the CIA to downsize to meet its budget.

Not only did Snowden retain his clearance, but unlike when he
had applied for his job at the CIA in 2006, he could now list on his
résumé two years of experience in information technology and
cyber security at the CIA. Dell could check only a single fact: that
Snowden was employed at the CIA between 2006 and 2009. His CIA
file, which contained the “derog,” was not available to Dell or any
other private company because of government privacy regulations.
Even though the CIA had “security concerns” about Snowden, it
could not convey them to either Dell or the NSA without violating
the privacy rules. “So the guy with whom the CIA had concerns left

© the Agency and joined the ranks of the many contractors working ©
in the intelligence community [IC] before CIA could inform the rest
of the IC about its worries,” Michael Morell, then CIA deputy direc-
tor, explained. “He even got a pay raise.”

Obviously, this was a glitch in the security system. As a result of
it, though, Snowden entered the secret world of the NSA only five
months after being forced out of the CIA.

For the next forty-five months, Dell assigned him various IT tasks
at the NSA. In June 2009, he was sent to Japan to work in the NSA
complex at the U.S. Yokota Air Base, which is about two hours by car
from downtown Tokyo. He moved into a small one-bedroom apart-
ment in Fussa, just outside the sprawling base.

His initial job for Dell was teaching cyber security to army and air
force personnel. In this capacity, he instructed U.S. military officers
stationed at the base in how to shield their computers from hack-
ers. Such security training had been required for military person-
nel dealing with classified material after several successful break-ins
to U.S. military networks by China, Russia, and other adversary
nations. It was not a challenging or interesting job.

long held personal stories as opposed to lies about in-the-moment situations. When we distort reality,
either omitting information or twisting it to create a false belief, we have to inhibit the way things are to
create an illusion of the way we wish them to be. In each case, there is conflict between one version of
reality and another. In each case, the electrical and chemical choreography of the brain recruits its
braking mechanism, stifling one piece of knowledge in the service of lifting another to the surface of our
lips. We perfect this capacity over the course of development. Some are born lacking this capacity.
Others have a system that is out of control, unable to distinguish truths from falsehoods. Somewhere
along this spectrum are healthy members of society who have the potential to justify themselves and a
society of willing listeners about the importance of becoming willing executioners, a phrase coined by the
historian Daniel Goldhagen to describe Germans involved in the Holocaust.

Desire + Denial. We all carry out this sum easily, often automatically and unconsciously. When
we are pushed by a desire to eliminate others or to achieve some other goal, we call on denial to justify
both extraordinary means and exceptional ends. We convince ourselves that we are morally in the right
and that extermination or manipulation are our only options. We convince ourselves that the other is an
object or animal, emotionally inert or unrecognizable. We shrink our moral circle, creating a culture of
indifference. We convince ourselves through self-deception that the other is a threat. When we feel
threatened, we raise our hackles in self-defense. When self-defense steps forward it recruits violence,
justified by the belief that fighting back is not only right, but obligatory. Once violence starts, supported
by a moral imperative, uncontrollable escalation follows, leaving a trail of dead bodies, raped women, and
abducted children. Desire couples with denial. Once this liaisons forms, it evolves, grows and feeds on
itself. We have arrived at excessive harms. We have arrived at evil.

What can we do? How can we harness our understanding of evil to predict when it might occur
again? Can we reduce future danger?

Future dangerousness

Why do we allow 16 year olds to drive in many parts of the United States, but prevent them from drinking
alcohol until 21 and from renting a car until 25? Why must the President of the United States be at least
35 years old, but members of the House of Representatives can enter at 25? If 16 is the magic number for
driving, why isn't it also the magic number for drinking, voting, becoming president, marrying without
parental consent, joining the military, and being executed for a felony murder? Or why not make 21 the
magic age for all age-restricted behaviors and positions? This would make sense in terms of our biology:
it is precisely around the age of 21 that our frontal lobes have matured more completely, thereby
providing us with a more functional engine for self-control. Or, why not question why we have a legal age
at all? Why not have a brain scan for frontal lobe maturation along with a test for self-control that would
allow some pre-16 year olds to drive, but might prevent some post-21 year olds from drinking? And if
you are in favor of the death penalty — I'm not — than why not detach it from age altogether and look at
the individual's moral competence and capacity for self-control?

These are hard questions. How we answer them will have resounding implications for law and
society. When a legal system decides that someone can drive, drink, vote, kill, run for president, marry,
and die as a penalty for crime, it has constrained human behavior based on a statistical evaluation of
psychological capacity. In each case, our assignment of age-appropriateness indicates that we believe the
person is responsible for his or her actions and thus, his or her future actions. It also indicates that those
under age are not responsible for their actions. We grant permission to drive at 16 years of age because
we believe that most 16 years olds are capable of driving responsibly, now and in the future. We believe
that a person who committed a heinous crime at the age of 18 is responsible for harming others and is
likely to do so in the future. He or she is thus eligible for the death penalty, at least in some states within
the United States. In contrast, we believe that someone at the age of 17 is still developing and has the
potential to change. In this sense, we hold them less responsible for their actions.

I don’t know whether those stories were true. But the point was that while he had
no problem with Jews in their long coats and black hats praying in the holy city,
Jews exercising authority or sovereignty, or a Jewish state, was something else

Advanced Self-Modification: A Possible Path to
Superhuman AGI

18.1 Introduction

In the previous chapter we presented a roadmap aimed at taking AGI systems to human-level
intelligence. But we also emphasized that the human level is not necessarily the upper limit.
Indeed, it would be surprising if human beings happened to represent the maximal level of
general intelligence possible, even with respect to the environments in which humans evolved.

But it’s worth asking how we, as mere humans, could be expected to create AGI systems with
greater intelligence than we ourselves possess. This certainly isn’t a clear impossibility — but it’s
a thorny matter, thornier than e.g. the creation of narrow-AlI chess players that play better chess
than any human. Perhaps the clearest route toward the creation of superhuman AGI systems is
self-modification: the creation of AGI systems that modify and improve themselves. Potentially,
we could build AGI systems with roughly human-level (but not necessarily closely human-
like) intelligence and the capability to gradually self-modify, and then watch them eventually
become our general intellectual superiors (and perhaps our superiors in other areas like ethics
and creativity as well).

Of course there is nothing new in this notion; the idea of advanced AGI systems that increase
their intelligence by modifying their own source code goes back to the early days of AI. And
there is little doubt that, in the long run, this is the direction AI will go in. Once an AGI
has humanlike general intelligence, then the odds are high that given its ability to carry out
nonhumanlike feats of memory and calculation, it will be better at programming than humans
are. And once an AGI has even mildly superhuman intelligence, it may view our attempts at
programming the way we view the computer programming of a clever third grader (... or an
ape). At this point, it seems extremely likely that an AGI will become unsatisfied with the way
we have programmed it, and opt to either improve its source code or create an entirely new,
better AGI from scratch.

But what about self-modification at an earlier stage in AGI development, before one has
a strongly superhuman system? Some theorists have suggested that selfmodification could be
a way of bootstrapping an AI system from a modest level of intelligence up to human level
intelligence, but we are moderately skeptical of this avenue. Understanding software code is
hard, especially complex AI code. The hard problem isn’t understanding the formal syntax of
the code, or even the mathematical algorithms and structures underlying the code, but rather
the contextual meaning of the code. Understanding OpenCog code has strained the minds of
many intelligent humans, and we suspect that such code will be comprehensible to AGI systems

39, Edwards learned that Jane Doe felt so strongly that the plea bargain was
inappropriate that she made her own determination to appear on a television program and
exercise her First Amendment rights to criticize the unduly lenient plea bargain Epstein received
in a criminal case.

40. The CVRA action that Edwards filed was recently administratively closed and
Edwards filed a Motion to reopen that proceeding. See No. 9:08-CV-80736 (S.D. Fla.).

Epstein’s Entry of Guilty Pleas to Sex Offenses

41. Ultimately, on June 30, 2008, in the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit in Palm Beach
County, Florida, defendant Epstein, entered pleas of guilty to various Florida state crimes
involving the solicitation of minors for prostitution and the procurement of minors for the
purposes of prostitution. See Plea Colloquy (Exhibit “R”).

42. As a condition of that plea, and in exchange for the Federal Government not
prosecuting the Defendant, Epstein additionally entered into an agreement with the Federal
Government acknowledging that approximately thirty-four (34) other young girls could receive
payments from him under the federal statute providing for compensation to victims of child
sexual abuse, 18 U.S.C. § 2255. As had been agreed months before, the U.S. Attorney’s Office
did not prosecute Epstein federally for his sexual abuse of these minor girls. See Addendum to
Non-Prosecution Agreement (Exhibit “S”) (in redacted form to protect the identities of the

minors involved).

savings account, and more likely to bet the farm on a bad investment.
But the bias also protects and inspires us: it keeps us moving forward
rather than to the nearest high-rise ledge. Without optimism, our
ancestors might never have ventured far from their tribes and we
might all be cave dwellers, still huddled together and dreaming of
light and heat.

To make progress, we need to be able to imagine alternative realities —
better ones — and we need to believe that we can achieve them. Such
faith helps motivate us to pursue our goals. Optimists in general work
longer hours and tend to earn more. Economists at Duke University
found that optimists even save more. And although they are not less
likely to divorce, they are more likely to remarry — an act that is, as
Samuel Johnson wrote, the triumph of hope over experience. Even if
that better future is often an illusion, optimism has clear benefits in
the present. Hope keeps our minds at ease, lowers stress and
improves physical health. Researchers studying heart-disease patients
found that optimists were more likely than nonoptimistic patients to
take vitamins, eat low-fat diets and exercise, thereby reducing their
overall coronary risk. A study of cancer patients revealed that
pessimistic patients under the age of 60 were more likely to die
within eight months than nonpessimistic patients of the same initial
health, status and age.

In fact, a growing body of scientific evidence points to the conclusion
that optimism may be hardwired by evolution into the human brain.
The science of optimism, once scorned as an intellectually suspect
province of pep rallies and smiley faces, is opening a new window on
the workings of human consciousness. What it shows could fuel a
revolution in psychology, as the field comes to grips with
accumulating evidence that our brains aren't just stamped by the past.
They are constantly being shaped by the future.

infelicitously calls “townterviews,” a combination of university town
meeting and television interview featuring a group of effusive local
journalists, students, and faculty. The format allows her to promote
civil society and human rights without getting in the face of the
country’s leaders. Often a questioner will refer to her in fractured
English as “President Clinton.” In Asia, this can be especially
mortifying for the shy audience. She’ll cheerfully reply “I wish!” or
“Almost!” to disarm the situation, before going on to explain how her
serving in the government of the man who defeated her is a sign of
democracy’s strength. Almost every trip includes meeting with
leading women from local NGOs, many of whom line up to tell
Hillary with what little English they can muster how inspirational she
has been to their efforts. “She has almost singular recall from years
back,” says Kurt Campbell, assistant secretary for East Asian and
Pacific affairs, who recounts being amazed at what she remembered
about a group of Chinese women from a path-breaking trip in 1995.
“Not just names, but obscure details about people she’s met only
once and hadn’t been briefed on.”

State of the Union

No one abroad seems interested in a subject that continues to
fascinate Americans—the state of the Clintons’ marriage. The truth,
at present, is hardly momentous. “They’ve been in good shape as a
couple for way longer than people realize,” says one friend in a
position to know. “When things are not good, they’re not good at
hiding it.”” Wherever Bill’s behavior took the relationship, the friend
continues, there remains “a profound level of forgiveness and
attachment between them.” Despite heart problems, Bill is in good
health, but his weight loss—thanks to a vegetarian diet—has left him
looking shrunken in person. The rumors of straying have subsided.
Aides to both claim, implausibly, that the Clintons talk on the phone
every day. The former president doesn’t use e-mail (Hillary, by

PRC-Funded and PRC-Controlled Media Outlets

The Chinese Communist Party liaises with Chinese-language media mainly through
the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council (or Qiao Ban {*7). The Qiao
Ban holds an annual conference on Chinese-language media called the World Chinese
Media Forum. These media outlets are registered in the United States by US citizens
or permanent residents, but they might actually be owned by Chinese state-run

companies.

The Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council of PRC (FRR #REBHAS)
appears to directly control the Asian Culture and Media Group (HS: WicikheR SB)
in America, which has three media subsidiaries: SinoVision (ZH #}X##), the China
Press (Qiaobao or #4), and the Sino American Times (iN). Sky Link TV (KF)
is another media outlet in the United States. Unlike SinoVision and Qiaobao, it is fully
owned by Guangzhou Media American Co, Ltd. (2B Bi AiR a]), which in turn

is owned by GZ Television Media (J N32 SRA al), a Chinese state-owned media

outlet.

SinoVision

The group’s main TV outlet is SinoVision. It operates two twenty-four-hour channels
(one Chinese and one English), and it is on the program lineups of cable systems Time

Topic: The quixotic search for energy solutions

Today’s US energy reality: electricity generation

Before exploring why some of these ideas did not pan out, let’s look at where the US is right now in electricity generation. The
table below shows each energy source; its installed capacity; the electricity this capacity generated in 2010 and percent of total
generation; its capacity factor; and its long-term levelized cost for new construction, estimated by the Energy Information
Agency. Capacity factors are important since they measure the intermittency of each source (capacity factor = actual generation
relative to potential maximum generation). Baseload natural gas plants can run at higher factors than 28%; this number reflects
the fact that many gas plants are used as “peaking” facilities to provide short-term energy during periods of elevated demand.

As stated above, fossil fuels dominate, followed by nuclear. Hydroelectric is next (efficient and cheap, but most large-scale
sites are already in use); followed by non-hydroelectric renewable energy, which across all categories makes up less than 5%, in
part due to their low capacity factors. Non-hydroelectric renewable energy is a similarly small component of the country’s
overall energy use, a broader category which includes transportation fuels”.

Energy Conversions 101
What went wrong with renewables? Theories generally fall into 3 buckets: (i) why bother, since there are plenty of fossil fuels;

(ii) renewable energy would have a larger share if it benefitted from the massive R&D put into things like nuclear; and (iii)
renewables have thermodynamic, structural and practical limitations that inhibit their ability to represent much larger shares of
electricity or transportation fuel production. While (i) and (ii) have some merit®, it is hard to escape (iii). Energy Conversions

District Attorney or the Florida Prosecutors should provide notice promptly. To require the Post
to notify victims itself — without any ability to discover who those victims are — would be an
absurd result that defeats the purpose of the unsealing provision of section 50-b, which allows
“any person” to file an application requesting that information be unsealed for “good cause.”*

In sum, the strong presumption of openness that governs New York courts compels the
conclusion that the appellate briefs in this action must be unsealed (with the names of any
victims of a sexual offense redacted).

CONCLUSION

For the reasons set forth above, the Post respectfully requests an order unsealing the

Chapter 3

The Enemy Within: Civil Society at Bay

Among the more surprising developments in
21st-century politics are the reversals experienced by
civil society, once regarded as an irresistible force in
the global struggle for democracy.

According to Freedom in the World, the ability of
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and other
civil society institutions to function without state re-
strictions has suffered a pronounced decline over the
past decade. The setbacks have been concentrated in
authoritarian states like Russia, China, Venezuela, and
lran. But civil society has also met with growing prob-
lems in democracies—India and Indonesia among
them—and in settings where democracy’s prospects
are unclear, as with Ecuador, Hungary, and Kenya.

The growing offensive against civil society is in many
respects a tribute to the prominent role that NGOs
have come to play in the political life of most coun-
tries. An active civil society is often seen as a formida-
ble threat to a repressive or illiberal status quo. Civil
society was the linchpin in the successful popular
revolutions in Serbia, Ukraine, and Georgia. In fact,
civil society organizations frequently pose a greater
threat to autocracy than do traditional opposition par-
ties, which have proven relatively easy for determined
strongmen to sideline, neutralize, or co-opt. Civil soci-
ety movements, by contrast, are generally composed
of younger activists, committed to a cause, more
resilient, more agile, and less prone to corruption.

To be sure, even some authoritarian states can boast
of an active and growing civil society sector consist-
ing of humanitarian organizations, religious entities,
conservation groups, associations focused on public
health or development, and so forth. It is with the
NGOs that pursue politically sensitive objectives—hu-
man rights advocacy, democratic reform, or anticor-
ruption measures—that oppressive leaders have
serious differences. Especially in countries where
elections have been rendered meaningless, civil soci-
ety groups can become surrogates for a democratic
opposition, and are therefore regarded with deep
suspicion by the leadership.

The specter of ‘color revolution’

The term “color revolution” emerged in 2003-05 to
describe a phenomenon whereby an existing politi-
cal leadership is overthrown by a popular movement

“Countries in western Asia and
northern Africa, Ukraine and Thai-
land, which have experienced street
protests and even armed conflicts,
have been led astray to the wrong
path of Western-style democracy,
that is, ‘street politics.’.. The United
States and some Western forces
have been involved in the street
politics in these countries, either on
stage or behind the scenes.”

—Xinhua, paraphrasing an editorial by MiBohua of the
People’s Daily

“In the modern world, extremism is
being used as a geopolitical instru-
ment and for remaking spheres of
influence. We see what tragic conse-
quences the wave of so-called color
revolutions led to... We should do
everything necessary so that noth-
ing similar ever happens in Russia.”

—Vladimir Putin

using tactics of nonviolent civil disobedience.

Successful nonviolent democratic revolutions are not
new. Perhaps the first color revolution took place in
1974, when a dictatorship in Portugal was overthrown
by military officers who drew on the support of civilian
democracy advocates. Later peaceful revolutions
overcame authoritarian regimes in the Philippines,
South Korea, Chile, and Poland.

In the 21st century, however, the definitive events
behind the new label took place in Georgia (2003) and
Ukraine (2004-5). Both countries were governed by
politicians with close ties to Moscow who were either
personally corrupt or tolerated high levels of graft.

In the Ukrainian elections of 2004, there was strong
evidence of rigging to ensure the victory of Viktor Ya-
nukovych, the candidate of the pro-Russian old guard.

104 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 59, *100

[#101] crimes or crimes against children. 74! In Indiana, the plain language of its statute leaves open the possibility of a
conferral right before formal charges to the extent that the statute includes two separate time frames: after a crime ... has been
charged or before any disposition of a criminal case involving the victim. 747
To be sure, not all states have afforded victims a voice throughout the entirety of the criminal justice process. 743 In some
states, the statutes are ambiguous. 74 In a handful of states, there is clear language limiting rights until after the filing of
charges. For example, Louisiana constrains the conferral right to criminal matters In which formal charges have been filed by
the district attorney's office. 745 Yet, unlike the federal CVRA, this statute specifically excludes pre-charging situations. And,
in any event, despite Louisiana's limitation on a particular right within the statute, the legislature in this state still often saw fit
to provide the victim with notification rights, even in the absence of the formal filing of charges. 74°
Very few state courts have ever considered the precise issue of whether conferral rights may attach prior to the formal filing of
charges. This is likely caused by the fact that, unlike the federal statute, many state statutes fail to provide the victim with a
procedural mechanism for challenging the conduct of prosecutors or law enforcement agencies. 74” However, in rare cases,
state courts have implicitly recognized that a meaningful interpretation of victims' rights should include some rights prior to
filing.

For example, a Connecticut court concluded that a company injured by the delinquent act of a minor was entitled to
information about the case [*102] contained in a police file in a civil proceeding, even though it appears that there was little
indication that criminal charges had been filed. 74% Similarly, the South Carolina Supreme Court, while limiting the ability of
the victim to challenge the conduct of a prosecutor, concluded that the same rights under the state constitution must attach prior
to the formal filing of an indictment. 74° Other courts have even permitted a victim to recover compensation or reparations for
unindicted or acquitted conduct. 7>°

238 See Office of Victim-Witness Advocacy, supra note 237, at 4 (including pre-grand jury remand, administrative dismissal, grand jury
remand, grand jury dismissal, and indictment returned).

239 Td. at 26 (describing victim involvement at grand jury and arraignment stages of the proceeding).

240 See Mass. Ann. Laws ch. 258B, § 2 (LexisNexis 2004).

41 Idaho Code Ann. § 19-5306(1)(f) (2004). As in the case of most of the state statutes, the Idaho statute is not without ambiguity. A
different provision within the statute makes the notification right contingent upon the filing of a criminal complaint or juvenile petition ... .
Id. § 19-5306(2).

242 Ind. Code Ann. § 35-40-5-3(b) (West 2012); id. § 35-40-1-1 (failing to define case).

43 See, e.g., Md. Const. art. 47(b) (In a case originating by indictment or information filed in a circuit court, a victim of crime shall have the
right to be informed ... .).

44 In Delaware, for example, the statute contains an additional limitation in the conferral provision that is noticeably absent from the duty
imposed on law enforcement to provide information about the victim's rights to that victim. Compare De/. Code Ann. tit. 11, § 9405 (2007),
and Del. Code Ann. tit. 1], § 9411 (2007) (imposing additional requirements after the Attorney General commences the prosecution), with
Del. Code Ann. tit. 1], § 9410 (2007). Query whether the limitations imposed in one section should be inferred in the other under the doctrine

DYNAMICS MORE BROADLY CREATE OPPORTUNITY IN DEVELOPMENT STAGE AND
EARLY COMMERCIAL STAGE COMPANIES

For the last several decades the healthcare venture capital industry has been the predominant
source of early and growth stage funding for smaller, technology focused companies while they
pursue product development, regulatory approval, and early commercialization. Over the last
several years, there has been a significant contraction in the size of the healthcare venture
capital industry in terms of amount of capital available to fund new companies, and the number
of active firms investing in new companies. This contraction creates significant opportunity for
those funds that remain active, as fewer firms and less capital is translating into less
competition for deals. The Fund Managers have benefited from the reduced level of
competition during the new investment period for NLV-II, and they believe these conditions
will remain in place for at least part of the new investment period of NLV-III. It is too soon to
know for sure, but it is likely the industry may have already reached the bottom of this cycle of
contraction and could see a re-set that begins to shift the industry to more normalized
conditions due to the recent stronger IPO and M&A markets.

The market for IPOs was strong during 2013 and the first quarter of 2014 for companies with
compelling stories based on differentiated technology, targeting important unmet medical
needs, large market opportunities, and experienced management teams. Although the number
of IPOs in the healthcare technology sector increased significantly, most of that activity was
driven by offerings for biopharmaceuticals companies. The significant increase in IPO activity
was driven by a number of factors, but one that had an important impact is the Jumpstart Our
Business Startups Act (JOBS Act). This legislation was signed into law in the U.S. in April, 2012
and it changed the regulations governing how certain private companies can interact with
investors in advance of an IPO. Under the new regulations, emerging growth companies can
file their IPO draft registration statement privately with the SEC, and continue to meet with
interested investors over several weeks or months to explain clearly their company strategy and
technology in “testing the waters” meetings. The Fund Managers believe these new regulations
are especially helpful to private biopharmaceutical companies, as they allow interested

m Public Capital Markets: Canada

As of November 30, 2017, six cannabis-related companies were trading on the TSX, 20 were trading
on the TSXV and 41 were trading on the CSE. Most of the publicly traded cannabis-related companies
in Canada are licensed producers under Canada’s Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regula-
tions, which allow a company to produce and sell medical cannabis products in Canada. A number of
companies traded on the CSE also have cannabis-related operations in the United States. The following
table provides a summary of cannabis-related companies traded on Canadian stock markets.

US. No matter how we might explain our attack, with the joint exercises soon to
begin, it would come over as a deliberate attempt to implicate our most important
ally in a potential conflict with Iran, against the explicit wishes of President
Obama. I felt this even more strongly when, a few weeks later, I was contacted by
one of Bibi’s close political allies. He sounded me out on the possibility of
launching our strike against Iran after the joint exercise: barely two weeks before
the 2012 US election. Politically, he argued, Obama would then feel compelled to
support Israel’s action, or at the very least to refrain from criticizing it. In other
words, we would be setting a political trap for the President of the United States. I
couldn’t quite believe he was suggesting it. But my reply to this last-gasp
suggestion of a way for us to attack the Iranian sites required no hesitation, and
only two words: “No way.”

Bibi would have known I would oppose such a ploy. But as with so much else
in the years I spent in his government, I think it was the politics of the scheme,
more than the substance, that enticed him. Almost everything he did seemed
increasingly about creating a kind of grand narrative to secure his position on the
right, solidifying a base which he figured would sustain him in office. At its core,
the narrative presented a picture of vulnerability and victimhood: a kind of
“fortress Israel” threatened by terror, missiles on its northern and southern borders,
and now potential nuclear annihilation from Iran, while our main ally, the United
States, was under the sway of a President who neither understood nor
fundamentally supported us. In day-to-day policy terms, this allowed Bibi to insist
we couldn’t risk serious engagement with the Palestinians. On domestic issues as
well, like the widening gap between those at the top of our high-tech economy and
a painfully squeezed middle class, the sense of crisis he encouraged gave him
license to hunker down, warn of impending doom, and do virtually nothing.

Effective though the narrative was for him politically, it bore no resemblance to
reality. Yes, President Obama disagreed with us on issues of policy, both the peace
process and on how to deal with Iran. But he was unquestionably committed to
America’s alliance with Israel. I had dealt face-to-face with four US presidents:
both of the Bushes, President Clinton and now President Obama. In terms of Israeli
security, none had proved as consistently supportive and helpful as Obama. And
yes, Israel did face an array of security challenges. A nuclear-armed Iran would
undeniably make things worse. But far from being under existential threat, we

War, Peace, Networks

1.

One afternoon in the fall of 2009 I received an unexpected call from the Pentagon.
The US was, then, nearly a decade into the wars of Afghanistan and Iraq. Each, in its
own way, possessed a strange and shifting character, the sort of dim premonition of
a greater violence that has always most unnerved warriors and politicians. The old
soldier’s saying — Fear chaos as much as the enemy - seemed to animate, constantly,
the progress of these two fights. Once, before I gave a speech to an audience of
newly promoted one-star generals in 2010, a four-star general pulled me aside fora
moment. He explained that I’d be speaking to a crowd of officers who had come of
age pacing the murderous streets of these wars, watching soldiers under their
command killed by an often invisible enemy. “You have to remember that these men
have been seared, seared, by a decade of combat,” he said. The best American
military minds had tried, with characteristically direct and relentless energy, to box
the wildness of these wars. In books and papers and thousands of patrols, through
millions of hours of language training, and endless risky nights, they had tried. It
never quite seemed to work. There would never be a durable sense of mastery. The
wars, which appeared a certain and unfairly tilted fight to American victory at the
beginning, had run longer than any in the nation’s history. They were engines of
chaos and fear.

The American Marine Corps General Victor Krulak once observed, “The war you
prepare for is rarely the war you get,” and you could find this phrase whistling
through the years of American combat after 9/1135. One of the lessons of both Iraq
and Afghanistan - and of the post-World Trade Center wars generally - was that the
Pentagon and the fighting services had been unready for what they faced. Soldiers
had arrived in Baghdad with forest-colored uniforms, thin-skinned transport, tank-
led battle plans - all wrong and mostly dangerous. The most feared weapons system
of the era told you something of the tone of the new millennium’s wars: $50 to $100
Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Hidden smashups of dynamite, duct tape,
cellphone detonators and as much stubbly, impaling iron as could be found. They
were impossible to deter. Rapidly deadly. The IED threat, one officer later reflected,
“is a contemporary example of conventional militaries being confronted with a
tactical surprise with operational—if not strategic—implications.” 3° Like so much in

One day while he was hearing arguments, and I was working in the office, I received a note from
the Justice asking me whether it was required under Jewish law that an orthodox woman always
wears a hat, even while arguing a case in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court had a rule
prohibiting wearing any head covering. But Goldberg was willing to insist that there be an
exception if there was a religious obligation. I wrote back saying that there was such a rule for
strictly orthodox women. He wrote back asking me to come into the courtroom, which I did.
When I got there I looked at the offending hat. Just as I did so, I got another note from Justice
Goldberg saying is there anything in Jewish law that requires a woman to wear such a big ugly
hat. I assured him that there was not. Nonetheless they made an exception, but Justice Goldberg
told me to discreetly inform the woman that next time she argues, she should wear a smaller hat.

Justice Goldberg also asked my advice about whether he should sit on the opening day of Court,
which fell on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, during which all work is
prohibited. I looked at the calendar of cases to be argued that day and noted that there was a
capital case. I told him that Jewish law permitted violation of nearly all religious precepts if
human life was at stake and recommended that he call the rabbi of his congregation. The rabbi
confirmed my view and told him to sit only on that case. He did and helped save the life of the
condemned man.

The Supreme Court had a small basketball court on the fifth floor. The clerks called it “The
Highest Court in the Land,” since it was directly above the Supreme Courtroom itself. Rumor
had it that in previous years the clerks used to play basketball while the Justices were hearing
arguments, and the sound of the bouncing ball could be heard through the ceiling of the Court. A
rule was established therefore prohibiting the playing of basketball during Court sessions. By the
time I got there the games were in early evening, and occasionally Justice White, who had been a
former professional football player, participated. As a basketball player, White was a great
football player - - not much finesse, but lots of elbows. I played only occasionally, but was there
once when Justice White was in a game. He boxed me out for a rebound and, in the process of
grabbing the ball, hit me in the face with his elbow. I instinctively yelled, “That’s a foul, damn it!”
to which I quickly added, “Mr. Justice.” I was overruled by His Honor.

According to historians of the Supreme Court, the 1963-64 term was among the most significant
and innovative in the history of the American judiciary, and Justice Goldberg was at the center of
the action. He assigned me to draft the famous Escobedo opinion, which changed the law of
confessions and led to the even more famous Miranda decision. Escobedo was suspected of
killing a relative and he was interrogated without his lawyer being present, even though his lawyer
was in the police station, trying to advise him on his right to remain silent. I penned the following
words that became an important part of my legal philosophy throughout my career:

We have...learned the...lesson of history that no system of criminal justice can, or should,
survive if it comes to depend for its continued effectiveness on the citizens' abdication
through unawareness of their constitutional rights. No system worth preserving should
have to fear that if an accused is permitted to consult with a lawyer, he will become aware
of, and exercise, these rights. If the exercise of constitutional rights will thwart the

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019530.txt,"42 | HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETS

That same July, Snowden had other things on his mind, includ-
ing an attempt to advance himself. Although his position at Dell as
a system administrator was a well-compensated one, especially for
a twenty-nine-year-old with no formal education, it carried little
prestige. He sat from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. in a windowless room
watching a bank of monitors in the so-called tunnel. Many of those
who worked with him were, as he described them, “eighteen year old
soldiers.” Presumably, they had little interest in discussing with him
the weightier issues of the world. Working as an outside contractor
was also a dead-end job that hardly matched the vision he had of
himself in his Internet postings. In real life, in a cubicle in the NSA,
he was decidedly not the Wolfking Awesomefox heroic image he had
of himself in his dream vision.

Snowden now decided to apply for a position in the NSA itself.
He apparently believed that if he scored high enough on its entrance
exam, the NSA would invite him to join it as a Senior Executive
Service officer, or SES, which was the civilian equivalent in rank and
pay to a flag officer in the U.S. armed forces. “I’m still amazed that

© a twenty-eight-year-old thought he could get an SES position,” a ©
civilian contractor working for the NSA during the same period told
me, “Snowden had a very overinflated view of his self-worth.” To
enhance his chances of getting the SES job, Snowden in the summer
of 2022 illicitly hacked into the NSA’s administrative files and stole
the answers to the NSA exam. As the NSA’s subsequent postmortem
would determine, it was the first known document that Snowden
took without authorization at the NSA.

It was not the first time, however, that he had used his hacking
skills to attempt to advance himself. At the CIA in 2009, as he later
said in Moscow, he had added text to his annual CIA evaluation in
what he termed “a non-malicious way” to prove a point. His CIA
superior took a much darker view of that incident when the hack
was detected, calling for an investigation. It was the threat of that
investigation that, it will be recalled, in effect ended Snowden’s CIA
career. At the NSA, his intrusion was not detected for almost a year.
“He stole the [NSA] test with the answers, and he took the test and
he aced it,” the former NSA director Michael McConnell recounted

She did not want to have a drink cuz she was tired 
I left the hotel lobby somewhat abruptly. 
When I'm reflective I think I'm dodging a bullet. There are huge ups with her but very self

victims in this matter; however that option was rejected by your Office. Had that option been
chosen, we would not object to your notifying the alleged victims at this point. At this juncture,
however, we do not accept your contention that there is a requirement that the government notify
the alleged victims of a potential civil remedy in this case.

Accordingly, for all the reasons we have stated above, we respectfully -- and firmly --
object to your sending any letter whatsoever to the alleged victims in this matter. Furthermore, if
a letter is to be sent to these individuals, we believe we should have a right to review and make
objections to that submission prior to it being sent to any alleged victims. We also request that if
your Office believes that it must send a letter to go to the alleged victims, who still have not been
identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein has entered his plea. This letter should
then come from the attorney representative, and not from the Government, to avoid any bias.

As you know, Judge Starr has requested a meeting with Assistant Attorney General Fisher
to address what we believe is the unprecedented nature of the section 2255 component of the
Agreement. We are hopeful that this meeting will take place as early as next week. Accordingly,
we respectfully request that we postpone our discussion of sending a letter to the alleged victims
until after that meeting. We strongly believe that rushing to send any letter out this week is not
the wisest manner in which to proceed. Given that Mr. Epstein will not even enter his plea for
another few weeks, time is clearly not of the essence regarding any notification to the identified
individuals.

Thanks very much,

Jay,

Please accept my apologies for not getting back to you sooner but I was a little under the weather
yesterday. I hope that you enjoyed your Thanksgiving.

Regarding the issue of due diligence concerning Judge Davis’ selection, I’d like to make a few
observations. First, Guy Lewis has known for some time that Judge Davis was making
reasonable efforts to secure Aaron Podhurst and Bob Josephsberg for this assignment. In fact,

when I told you of Judge Davis’s selection during our meeting last Wednesday, November 21°,

Fields Medal

The equivalent of a Nobel Prize for mathematics is a Fields Medal.
Joseph Field provided the money and helped set up the prize. Today it
is administered as part of the International Mathematical Union. You
must be under 40 to receive the prize. Andrew Wiles was 45 when he
solved Fermat's Last Theorem, so they created a special prize for him
called a Fields Fellowship. Until recently only men had received the
prize. However in 2014 Maryam Mirzakhani won the prize for her work
on the geometry of Riemann surfaces.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013569.txt,"As in most systems of authoritarian premises, precise definitions and what
appears to be strict logical continuity, as in discussions of Torah among Orthodox
Jews and Canon Law by Catholic bishops, classical equilibrium thermodynamic
ideas that are borrowed for use out of the context of their origins, risk the calumny
of their physicist practitioners. We have probably already earned more than a little
distain from those quarters with our use of none-minimal or none-maximal but in-
between entropies. This phrase cannot be found in the literature of physics or, as
such, in the writings of communication and information theory. In the modern theory
of nonlinear motion called dynamical systems, in-between entropies can be
generated by chaotic systems that are non-uniform in their rates of separation of
near by points and convergence of far-away points in dynamics that have been
previously described as nonuniformly hyperbolic.

The energies and their transformations that fuel and support karmic escape
from the personality fixations of samsara and accession to unmanifest Divine Life
can occur without the loss of the richness and multiplicity of apparent reality. Big
internal changes without external sign can occur in the arrangements of the
ineffable and mysterious formless silence within which we have associated with
states of high, but not maximal, in-between entropy. For examples, the Indian Saint,
Sri Aurobindo, in the early 20 Century, the Catholic metaphysical anthropologist,
Teilhard de Chardin and currently American pandits (spiritual seekers with
intellectual and academic inclinations) such as Ken Wilber, among many others
over the millennia, direct us toward the goal of Nirvanically changeless emptiness
without the properties of space or time. At the same time, we maintain an astute
and effective yet distantiated appreciation for existential realities. The non-dual
enlightenment of Integral Being or Yoga involves realizing emptiness through the
world of form. There is a way of thinking about and even computing that “nothing
within” and its changes.

As John R. Pierce suggested in the 1981 revision of his book that made the
theorems of the father of communication theory, Claude Shannon, so accessible,
“_..If we want to understand information-related entropies, it is perhaps best to clear

our minds of any (physical) ideas associated with the entropy of physics.”

investigation. In 2006, the government learned these background
checks were often prematurely ended. In Snowden’s case, because
the CIA did not share its files with a private concern, USIS did not
have access to Snowden’s CIA files, and it therefore did not learn
about the threatened security investigation. Nor did it learn from
the Internet, where he always employed an alias, that he was a dis-
gruntled employee. So Snowden’s new clearance was approved in
the summer of 2011, allowing him to continue working for Dell on
secret intelligence projects.

Meanwhile, in August 2011, Mills began her own blog titled
L’s Journey. In it, she described herself as “a world-traveling pole-
dancing super hero.” Many of her posted pictures were provocative
poses of herself in her underwear and various states of undress. She
wrote, “I’ve always wanted to be splashed on the cover of magazines,
with my best air-brushed look.” Her wish would be gratified two
years later in a way she likely did not anticipate.

For his part, Snowden seemed happy to encourage her fantasy
about being a superhero. He even gave her a Star Trek—inspired head

© visor. Despite all the concerns he voiced about privacy, he did not ©
seem to mind her provocative posts. On the contrary, he took pho-
tographs of her, telling her at one point that her photographs were
not “sexy” enough.

Snowden was soon offered a new position by Dell at the NSA’s
Kunia regional base in Hawaii. Dell, which was in the process of
expanding its government consulting business, wanted him to be a
system administrator on the NSA’s backup system. The NSA needed
this system before it could upgrade new security protocols that
would audit suspicious activity in real time. In Hawaii, as in Japan,
system administrators still worked alone. Snowden knew from his
experience in Japan that this solo work in an unaudited workplace
provided an opportunity for a system administrator to steal docu-
ments. So he might also have realized that as a solo system admin-
istrator in Hawaii, he would have this opportunity. Whether this
was on his mind or not, on March 15, 2012, he accepted this offer.
Dell agreed to pay all his relocation expenses and provide him with
a housing allowance.

He found a 1,559-square-foot house in Oahu, located at 94-1044

with them, I had gotten to understand a few of their quirky ways. Even if
I didn’t agree with them, they knew I would for their sake of opinion.
What did it matter anyways I thought, I had been degraded in every other
physical way what's the difference from taking their mental abuse too.
Not the exact choice of employers [ would’ve chosen over again if given
the opportunity but here I was and doing my very best to excel at their
demands.

I was sent home for a little over a week to pack for the long trip and
make the rounds visiting my family before I left overseas on my first trip
all by myself. It was great to see my family after such a long time away.
My older brother and his wife even came down to visit for the well
wishing of my departure. Everyone in my family seemed stoked at the
prospects my long journey had led me down. Here I was jet setting
around the world in my teens and getting paid to study the course of my
dreams at a cost that I only knew I would have to pay. It was a wonderful
get together with all of them around, a great way to remember them. If I’d
only known it would be the last time I would see any of them I would’ve
emphasized to my brothers how much I really loved them both and how
much I would miss them in the decade to come! But I didn’t know what
my future held for me, I had nothing planned out I was just hoping for the
right opportunities.

lalso had a few good friends to catch up with before I went. Every ~
night was another party and by the end of the week I had drunken enough
to drown an Irishman on St. Patty’s Day. I was given the lists to all of my
friends email address and told to keep in touch. Yeah right I thought, I
was going to be too busy having too much fun to be thinking about sitting
on a computer emailing people, but I told them 1 would anyways. Save
myself the point of having to explain that in many different ways to a
group of already tipsy slurring teenagers. Out of everyone who was really
happy for me, T.J wasn’t. He hated the idea of me leaving him to havea
non-stop party in Thailand without him. He was just starting to seem like
he was coming good and I didn’t like having to leave him at such a
vulnerable state but in my young years I had already realized I needed to
do some things for myself and this was one of them. There was still a
huge amount of broken trust between us, trust that could probably never
be rendered again so I thought I was being decent enough letting him stay
at my apartment while 1 was gone, but he was not to drive my truck, at
all. | paid too much money on insurance for that thing and knowing his
driving record | didn’t want the risk of something happening while I was
gone for so long. He didn’t agree with me at all, throwing a grown up
tantrum all over my apartment. Hitting the walls and doors, shouting the
entire complex down, there was nothing I could say or do at this point in

time so J just put my dog on the lead and took her for a walk to calm
down the situation and give me some time to be alone. Mary Jane was the
only one I hated leaving behind. When we got back from the long walk
she barricaded my suitcase while I was packing the horrendous amount of
clothing that I always did. I was promising her I wouldn’t be long and
told her how much I loved her giving her a big hug. I choked back on the
tears that were swelling up in my eyes, it was like she already knew the
night before I flew out to New York that this would be my final trip.

There was a commercial flight booked for me in the morning and I
needed the rest that night to fully recover from my binge of celebration
drinking. T.J crept into bed later that night and tried to redeem his
behavior with sweet nothings and dry humping my backside. It did
nothing for me sexually. | didn’t feel like that for him any longer and the
sooner he realized that, the better he’d be off. I told him I wasn’t up for it
and he picked up a pillow and slammed the door behind him. It didn’t
matter I told myself, the next day I was off and wouldn’t have to deal
with him or anyone.

T.J caught a cab with me to MIA, the airport in Miami. He walked with
me to the furthest point he was allowed to go by the security gates and as
we stood in line together it was almost heartbreaking seeing him cry. I
told him I’d try to call him everyday, attempting to give him optimistic
ways to look at this time away from each other. In the end he had me
crying and J had to give into my remaining feelings I had for him. One
last kiss under the x-ray bridge and he vanished out of my sight as I
furthered down the terminals long hall.

Chapter 20

It was only a short flight to New York and I just couldn’t wait until next
week when I’d be jetting of to an exotic destination all by my lonesome
self. ft was all I could think about talk about and dream about, finally my
break. Ghislane did what she did:best that week and prepped me for
everything I could imagine under the sun. Do’s and Don’ts, emergency
numbers and western union locations were among some things on the list
she gave me. Like I said, she showed her caring side in other ways.
There was also the name of the girl I was supposed to be meeting, the
room she was in and what dates she would be staying there.

When | got out of Ghislane’s office I was instructed to meet Jeffrey in
his office. She had to stay back for some paper work that she had to catch
up on pronto. Making my way up the red and gold trimmed carpeted

I issued a standing directive in the kirya that we should agree to anything
Fayyad asked for, as long as there no security reason to say no. We ended up
arranging a direct source of fuel supply to Jenin, on the northern edge of the West
Bank, and built new terminals to handle it. We facilitated construction permits for
a new industrial zone. For a conference of international economists and business
people, we set up VIP treatment at Ben-Gurion Airport, and limousine transport to
the conference venue. I believed that if Fayyad succeeded in what he was trying to
accomplish, it would be a benefit not just for the Palestinians, but for Israel too.
Bibi was agnostic on Fayyad’s efforts. Yet he recognized they did no harm. And in
a way, my support for them was politically convenient. To the extent the
international community, especially the Americans, appreciated our efforts to help
the Palestinians, Bibi and others in the government could, and did, claim credit.
When there were complaints from the right, Bibi could and did say: “It wasn’t me.
It was Barak.”

My part in our relations with the Americans was more politically delicate. As I
continued to prod Bibi toward accepting a settlement freeze during the summer and
autumn of 2009, my de facto role became to help smooth over the increasingly
rough edges in our ties with the Obama administration. I knew key figures from
earlier incarnations in their public lives and mine: Secretary of Defense Bob Gates,
who had been President George H. W. Bush’s deputy security adviser 1n the first
Iraq war and then head of the CIA; and Hillary Clinton, now Secretary of State.
During a series of early trips to the US as Defense Minister, I met Gates, Hillary
and other senior figures in the administration both formally and informally. In part
because they were aware I favored agreeing to a settlement freeze, they clearly
found it a lot easier to talk to me than to Bibi. On one visit, to my regret and Bibi’s
evident frustration once I’d got home, the press highlighted this dramatic
difference in mood. Emerging from talks with me at the State Department, Hillary
told reporters that our talks had gone “wonderfully.” She added: “As longtime
friends do, much was said. And much didn’t need to be said.” Still, I was careful to
avoid any explicit criticism of Bibi in my meetings in the US. I would point out the
domestic political pressures on him in deciding how to proceed. And in any case,
the Americans knew that no matter what I might say to them, it was Bibi’s actions
that ultimately mattered. He, not I, was Prime Minister.

I was as surprised as they were when he finally announced a settlement freeze
in November 2009. As with nearly everything else he did regarding the peace

wisest minds could foresee. Eventually the entire world was pulled into the fire. “In
the autumn of 1919, in which I write, we are at the dead season of our fortunes,” the
economist John Maynard Keynes wrote after the Paris Peace Conference settled The
Great War, dimly aware that an even deader season lay somewhere in the future in
the form of another war*®. During this murderous 75 year run, in the reviving of
European and then global fortunes, America played a decisive if reluctant role. As in
that first period, she emerged richer, more central, and more modern.

A third struggle, the Cold War, immediately followed the end of this second period.
This contest was intensely material and as ideological as any conflict in hundreds of
years. It represented a struggle at the level of the most fundamental question of
politics: How should life be lived? Two totalizing, uncompromising worldviews were
placed in opposition. This 45-year struggle occurred under the threat of nuclear
disaster, which gave it an aspect new in human history, the potential for complete
destruction. It was possible to find sober-minded theorists pondering problems like
this one: “Let us assume that for 10 billion dollars one could build a device whose
function is to destroy the earth,” Herman Kahn wrote in the 1960s, with a spirit
typical of his age in his slick, sickly worrisome masterpiece On Thermonuclear
War’*’. Yet in this period too, over time, America found herself in an axial role, first
carrying one end of the risky fight and then, at the conflict’s surprising and jubilant
conclusion in 1989, discovering the country was in a position of unprecedented,
unchallenged power. As with the two earlier shifts, this one had brought with it an
arrangement nearly ideally tuned, yet again, to America’s advantages.

I mention all this here because while it may be fashionable to speak of the period
just passed as the “American Century” - and to wonder whose century comes next,
the reality is that for two and a half centuries, through some of the most violent and
wonderful changes in human history, America has had a remarkable run**. A senior
American military official once asked me, a week or so before he sat with the
Chinese President, how best to begin his remarks. “You might say,” | suggested, “that
America respects what China has done in the last thirty years. To have brought 400
million people out of poverty as Beijing has done is an historic accomplishment. But
he must understand that America, particularly in the last intense century, has paid
in nearly countless dollars and in the cost of hundreds of thousands of American
lives, to establish an order that has benefited billions. The scale of this
accomplishment is, by a great measure, historic.” America has been an emblematic,
profound force. It has been a country tuned exactly to the needs of her age. Three
times over. Inevitably, the world now asks: Can this continue?

When I told Bazelon about the justice quote from the Torah, he asked me why the word justice
was repeated. Wouldn’t it have been enough to say “justice you must actively chase after.”
“Why ‘justice, justice.”” No word, or even syllable of the Torah is supposed to be redundant.
Every one has a meaning. I told Judge Bazelon that the rabbis had a field day providing
interpretation to the repeat of justice. My favorite, the one I had proposed in my Bar Mitzvah
speech, was that the first “tzedek” meant legal justice, while the second meant compassionate
justice. Judge Bazelon corrected me: “Compassion must come before the law. The first means
compassionate justice, the second legal justice.” Whichever came first in Judge Bazelon’s court,
every decision that he wrote or joined combined elements of both. His compassion wasn’t always
appreciated, even by its objects. Judge Bazelon once showed me a letter he received from his
most famous defendant, a man named Monte Durham. Durham was the defendant in the case in
which Bazelon announced his innovative approach to the insanity defense in the form of a new
tule called “The Durham Rule” that declared a person to be legally insane, and thus not guilty, if
his crime was “the product” of a mental disease or defect. This controversial rule revolutionized
the relationship between law and psychiatry. The letter from Monte Durham complained about
the rule bearing his name. “Now everyone calls me “Durham the Nutcase.’” He noted that when
doctors discover a new disease, they name it after themselves and not after the patient. He
wondered why the new rule wasn’t called “The Bazelon Rule” instead of the “Durham Rule!”
Bazelon apologized to Durham and noted that if judges could name new rules after themselves
there would be too many new rules.

Judge Bazelon and I were a match made, if not in heaven, at least in legal nirvana. I learned a lot
from him and even taught him a little. We remained lifelong friends, though the year of clerking
was more like hell than heaven, at least as regards to working conditions.

Bazelon was never satisfied. He never told me that a draft opinion or article was good. It always
needed to be “made better.” “It’s getting there” or “it’s close,” was the highest compliment he
ever paid. But when it was done and published, and colleagues complimented him on the finished
product, he would always give me credit. But never to my face. I always had to hear it from
others. He was beyond a perfectionist. He knew his opinions would be read by generations of
law students, professors, lower court judges and assorted critics. He was on a never-ending
mission, and nothing was ever good enough. Even if it was good enough to publish or deliver
because of artificial deadlines, it was never quite good enough for David Bazelon. But the long
hours, demanding boss and difficult working conditions were well worth it. Law clerks who
endured this trial by fire went on to great careers. Former Bazelon clerks include the deans of
Harvard and Yale Law Schools, the President of New York University, the former Chancellor of
the New York City school system, a prominent reform rabbi, numerous law professors, lawyers
and business and political leaders. He influenced us all, and his influence continues in the work
that many still do. As Peter Strauss, a law professor at Columbia once aptly characterized the
relationship between Judge Bazelon and his clerks: “He the pebble, we the ripples.”

The primary job of the law clerk related to the appellate cases that came before the United States
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. In the years I was a clerk, that court served not
only as a federal appellate court, but also as the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, a
reasonably sized city with a racially mixed population and a relatively high violent crime rate.
Many of our cases involved very high level appeals relating to federal administrative

Stock view: Expect solid 1Q revs., but loss of non-GAAP reconciliation a concern
New concerns have been raised on the YouTube advertiser pullback, but with the cuts in
spending surfacing primarily in the back half of March, we anticipate only modest
impact to 1Q revenue, with more significant potential impact to 2Q17 (see Advertiser
boycott raising concerns on 10/20 revenues). Looking beyond the YouTube issues, our
early 1Q ad checks were mostly positive, with Merkle highlighting modest revenue
growth acceleration, better than the 7Obps of ex-FX Website revenue deceleration in
1Q17 (vs 4Q16) we’ve assumed in our model. Overall, we expect in-line to slightly
better 1Q results driven by mobile and PLA strength (and perhaps some maps ads), but
see risk of moderate Street estimate cuts for 2Q/3Q revenue on YouTube concerns. For
most companies, we would expect management to help clear up the advertiser
controversy on the call with some added financial disclosure or guidance, but predicting
what Alphabet will say on the topic is more difficult.

1Q results will be the first quarter that Google reports GAAP EPS without a non-GAAP
EPS reconciliation. With higher than usual SBC in 1Q due to changes in grant timing, it
is possible Google misses Street GAAP EPS. We are leaving our revenue unchanged but
lowering GAAP EPS to $7.26 from $7.36 based on higher SBC. Also, unusual charges are
more likely to be controversial for Google without a non-GAAP EPS reconciliation.

Core margins remain a key focus, as has been the case since 3Q16 when core Google
non-GAAP operating margins contracted 95bps y/y. We expect core margins to remain
down y/y driven primarily by segment mix, and our model assumes 2017 core margins
are down 50bps in 2017 (to 46.1%) and another 20bps in 2018 (to 45.9%). For 1Q17,
we assume 45.8% core Google non-GAAP operating margin, up 30bps q/q and down
75bps y/y. Our recent deep dive analysis suggests segment mix alone drives a natural
220bps margin headwind, which we think can be partially offset with 1) upside in high
margin search growth from monetization growth (clicks and pricing); 2) leverage in
individual segments from scale; and 3) cost cutting measures across the business (see

Digging into the Alphabet revenue mix and margin drivers).

We continue to like the stock, but recognize that potential estimate trimming on
YouTube concerns, further margin contraction, SBC pressure on GAAP EPS and
challenging 2Q17 comps could continue to drag on near-term sentiment. Looking ahead,
we are optimistic on 2H17 based on the potential for new ad format ramps, easing
comps, and potential YouTube relief (we assume the advertiser boycott eases exiting
2Q). Alphabet trades at 22x GAAP (17x ex-Other Bets, cash), in-line with the S&P and
in-line to below the 5-year average (23.5x), which we view as attractive.

Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q: Website growth, core margins

We believe the key metrics for the quarter will be ex-FX Website growth and core
margins. For ex-FX website growth, we currently model 7Obps of deceleration in 1Q17
(vs 4Q16}, and we think deceleration could persist through 2Q17, after which the y/y
growth comps ease considerably.

104 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 59, *92

Of particular interest here is the Department's policy for grand jury subpoenas issued to a target of a criminal investigation.
When such a target is subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury, the Department of Justice will advise that target of his rights,
such as the right to refuse to answer any question that might be incriminating. !8° The Department of Justice defines a target
of a criminal investigation as a person as to whom the prosecutor or the grand jury has substantial evidence linking him or her
to the commission of a crime and who, in the judgment of the prosecutor, is a putative defendant. 18°

If the Department's investigation has coalesced sufficiently so that it can provide notice of rights to putative defendants, it
should likewise be in a position to provide notice of rights to that defendant's victims. Combining the Department's definition
of target with the CVRA's coverage and definition-of-victim provisions produces a formulation whereby CVRA rights attach
in (at least) the following circumstances:

CVRA rights attach when an officer or employee of the Department of Justice or any other department or agency of the United
States engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution of crime has substantial evidence that an identifiable person has
been directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a federal offense or an offense in the District of
Columbia, and in the judgment of the officer or employee, that person is a putative victim of that offense.

This formulation borrows from the CVRA's coverage provision !%° to define the relevant universe of substantial evidence as
that in the possession of the Justice Department or other federal agencies. For instance, if state law enforcement officers are
investigating a bank robbery, the fact that the robbery might also be prosecuted federally 1°! does not make the teller at the
bank a federal victim of the crime until evidence regarding the crime comes into the possession of a federal agency. The
formulation also tracks the CVRA's definition of victim in limiting the universe of potential [*93] victims to those who have
been directly and proximately harmed. !°? Finally, the formulation requires some federal officer or employee to evaluate the
evidence and reach the conclusion that a federal offense has been committed that harmed the person in question. This
determination responds to the observation by the District Court for the Eastern District of New York that the CVRA cannot be
read to include the victims of uncharged crimes that the government has not even contemplated. 193 At the same time, such a
formulation obviously does not require the filing of formal criminal charges, or even the preparation of formal criminal
charges. Instead, all that is required is for the Department to recognize that a person is a putative victim of a federal offense,
just as all that is required for the mailing of a target letter to a subpoenaed suspected criminal, is recognition that he is a
putative defendant in a federal case.

B. APPLYING THE TEST TO THE EPSTEIN CASE

To illustrate how the test would operate, it is useful to examine the facts of the Epstein case. Applying the proposed test to that
case produces straightforward answers, which suggests that the test would be workable in practice.

From 2001 to 2007, Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused more than thirty minor girls in his mansion, including Jane Doe Number
One and Jane Doe Number Two. 14 Initially, of course, his acts of abuse were secret, unknown to law enforcement. During
that period of time, the victims would not have had rights under the CVRA.

The Fund Managers have a proactive approach to deal sourcing, which focuses on both private
and public opportunities. The established and proven sourcing activities seek to identify the
most compelling healthcare technology investment opportunities, at the most attractive time
points for venture capital investment. The Fund Managers’ goal is to identify opportunities that
are based on the most interesting novel and proprietary technologies, but place their emphasis
on being positioned for investing in these technologies in the round(s) that offer the most
attractive risk-adjusted returns potential. These investment opportunities are identified
through a number of parallel efforts, including:

e Systematic tracking of private and public companies that have product programs and
technologies targeting disease areas and biological targets of high interest that are
approaching key value inflection points. Current activities include comprehensive
screening of companies with programs targeting high unmet medical needs where the
strength of the science coupled with a rapid and lower capital intensity development
path, provides a compelling risk-reward case for investment. At the present time, the
Fund Managers are tracking a biopharma investment universe of approximately 1,000
mid-late stage private and small-cap public companies, many of which are in
therapeutic areas of specific interest to the Fund Managers (e.g. Oncology, Infectious
Disease, Central Nervous System, etc.);

e Continuous contact with a network of current and former portfolio company
management teams;

e Networking with current and former senior management team members from leading
pharmaceutical, biotech, medical device, and HIT companies to understand their
strategic priorities and to identify assets/programs that may become available for
spinouts or structured financings;

e Staying up to date and in contact with leading academic thought leaders working in
NLV’s fields of interest;

e Active coverage of major investor, medical and scientific meetings; and

e Working closely with other venture capitalists with overlapping interests to ensure NLV
sees the broadest range of high quality opportunities and are positioned for working
with the strongest syndicates.

A key success factor behind the Fund Managers’ deal sourcing activities is a strong network of
entrepreneurs, industry executives, renowned clinicians, leading academic scientists, other
venture investors, and experienced consultants. The Fund Managers believe that this network
plays a critical role in helping to identify the most interesting opportunities, bringing the
leading resources to bear to assist in due diligence, and in providing important technical and
recruiting support in building portfolio companies. The Fund Managers continuously invest
time and energy in updating and building this strong network to ensure access to the managers
and thought leaders that are the industry’s leaders in the sectors of interest.

as discussed above, these ranges is strictly smaller than the range of values over which
CWOL is an equilibrium.

To summarize, CWOL can occur in equilibrium, and this equilibrium is subgame per-
fect, is stable, and has a sizable basin of attraction in the replicator dynamics. Moreover,
we expect player 2 to prefer interacting with player 1s who do not look and player 1s to
actively avoid looking when defection is harmful and the temptation to defect is usually
small but sometimes huge. Finally, under these conditions, cooperation can be sustained
only if player 1 can avoid looking and player 2 can observe whether player 1 looks.

While we modeled player 1 looking at the temptation to defect, we could analogously
have modeled player 1 looking at the benefits to cooperating. This can be interpreted as
looking to see if anyone is watching, asking what one will get, or calculating the value of
the ongoing relationship. In this and some similar cases, the modifications to the model
would be straightforward and analysis would be equivalent.

We now apply the model to shed light on a number of interesting phenomena, including
why we dislike “flip-flopping” politicians and respect principled people more generally, why
people cooperate intuitively, why people feel disgust when considering taboo trade-offs,
and why people fall in love.

We trust candidates for political office whose policies are the result of their convictions
and are consistent over time, and distrust those whose policies are carefully constructed
in consultation with their pollsters and who “flip-flop” in response to public opinion, as
caricatured by the infamous 2004 Republican presidential campaign television ad showing
John Kerry wind-surfing, and tacking from one direction to another. At first glance, this
seems irrational: one would think it a virtue for a politician to flexibly respond to public

opinion once in office. This logic is illustrated by John Maynard Keynes’ famous quote:

103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *900

exception is Professor Donald Dripps's current proposal to expand federal criminal law to cover most sexual assault offenses -
precisely the model of federal-state enforcement redundancy that [*901] exists now for drug crimes, corruption, police
violence, and much else. !°? But otherwise, existing policies and reform proposals emphasize more modest, although
meaningful, federal efforts to improve state justice administration through, for example, funding grants (as for rape kit testing)
193 and occasionally by litigation to force institutional reforms in local agencies.

In fact, federal law empowers the U.S. Justice Department to sue local police departments and other agencies, and authorizes
structural injunctions to remedy systemic misconduct. !°4 But the Department's use of this authority has largely focused on
police violence rather than sexual assault underenforcement. !9° Various local law enforcement agencies have entered consent
decrees under which they adopt institutional and policy reforms to reduce patterns of misconduct, even though federal
intervention 1s hampered by the paucity of data on police misconduct, limited federal resources, and at times the political
commitment of the presidential administration. !°° More to the point here, in only a few cases have federal officials targeted
local agencies' inadequate responses to sexual assault. !?7

In sum, and in sharp contrast to public corruption, the problem of underenforcement in the sexual assault context reveals the
resistance, and cost, of U.S. criminal justice to institutional structures of enforcement redundancy. Having ruled out judicial
review and private prosecution from the imaginations of reform-movement activists, the only alternative is the one that U.S.
criminal justice always favors - federalism. Where federal criminal law takes on an enforcement agenda, it is usually effective.
198 Where tradition, politics, jurisdictional limits, or policy [*902] choices restrict the reach of federal law, as with sexual
assault, the U.S. justice system is largely out of options. States were willing to change substantive and procedural law in hopes
of improving rape prosecutions, but not to infringe prosecutors' monopoly control of charging by expanding modes of judicial,
administrative, or private-party oversight.

3. Police Violence

27 New York granted courts nolle prosequi authority in 1829, during its era of private and judicially appointed prosecutors. McConville &
Mirsky, supra note 81, at 35 (citing 1829 N.Y. Rev. Stat. tit. IV, § 68, p.730 & § 54. p.726). For a broad overview of state nolle pros laws, see
Annotation, Power of Court to Enter Nolle Prosequi or Dismiss Prosecution, 69 A.L.R. 240 (1930). The federal rule is Fed. R. Crim. P. 48(a).
Note that these rules give judges implicit power to compel prosecutors to litigate charges they would rather dismiss. For decisions insisting on
judicial deference, see, for example, Genesee Prosecutor v. Genesee Circuit Judge, 215 N.W.2d 145, 147-48 (Mich. 1974). For similar
examples in federal cases, see United States v. Smith, 55 F.3d 157, 159-60 (4th Cir. 1995); United States v. Perate, 719 F.2d 706, 710-11
(4th Cir. 1983); United States v. Smith, 853 F. Supp. 179, 183-84 (M.D.N.C. 1994); Dawsey v. Gov't of Virgin Islands, 931 F. Supp. 397,
402-04 (D.V.J. 1996). A standard explanation for deference is that judges lack means to compel prosecutors to litigate charges at trial. See,
e.g., United States v. Greater Blouse, Skirt & Neckwear Contractors Ass'n, 228 F. Supp. 483, 489-90 (S.D.N.Y. 1964) (Even were leave of
Court to the dismissal of the indictment denied, the Attorney General would still have the right to ... , in the exercise of his discretion, decline
to move the case for trial. The Court in that circumstance would be without power to issue a mandamus or other order to compel prosecution

of the indictment, since such a direction would invade the traditional separation of powers doctrine.). But judges have options short of
mandamus. Presumably they could hold prosecutors in contempt for failures to appear, as they could for all other attorneys. And whenever
prosecutors retain an interest charges they seek to dismiss, judges could incentivize them by ruling that failure to litigate charges results (as
for civil parties) in forfeiture of the claim, or dismissal with prejudice.

28 For an overview of Canadian law on this point, see Mark Phillips, The Public Interest Criterion in Prosecutorial Discretion: A Lingering
Source of Flexibility in the Canadian Criminal Process?, 36 Windsor Rev. Legal & Soc. Issues 43 (2015) (describing case law requiring great
judicial deference to prosecutorial discretion). For Australia cases on prosecutorial discretion, see Miller v Commonwealth Dir. of Pub.
Prosecutions [2005] 142 FCR 394, 399-400 (Austl.).

29 Manikis, supra note 60, at 29. In addition, many nineteenth-century state courts justified privately funded prosecutions by citing the
public value of these contributions to supplement underfunded district attorney offices. See Ireland, supra note 83, at 47, 49-51 (citing and
quoting multiple state courts). Private prosecutors may have different reasons to proceed when despite comparatively low odds of winning a
conviction. Some of those motivations, at least, can be public-regarding. Avlana Eisenberg makes the point that prosecuting hate crimes
cases, for example, can have expressive and educative value that justifies pursuing well-grounded cases despite skeptical juries. Eisenberg,

But both Olmert and Tzipi soon fell prey to the same self-defeating temptation
that had worried me during the meandering war against Hizbollah. Our ground
incursion began a few days into the operation. The intention was to stay for a few
more days and then, responding to inevitable international appeals, call a halt to a
campaign that had already achieved nearly all of its targets. Perhaps wanting to
balance the failures in Lebanon there with “success” in Gaza, Olmert wanted us to
continue, and expand our attacks deeper into Gaza. I reminded him that we’d
agreed the aims beforehand. The longer we stayed, the less clear any gains would
be. Yes, our ground forces had so far faced virtually no resistance or casualties.
“But that’s because we’re outside the main populated areas,” I said. “The deeper
we get in, the better it will be for Hamas. They gain simply by surviving, like
Hizbollah.” Yet Olmert kept insisting that we’d succeeded so far, so let’s not stop.

It wasn’t until January 17, three weeks after the operation began, that we
announced a cease-fire. Militarily, the operation was a success. While Hamas
launched nearly 3,000 rockets into Israel in the year before our attack, there were
only 300 in the year that followed. But politically and diplomatically, the extra
week reduced, rather than helped, the chances of reaching an understanding for a
longer-term reduction of the attacks. To the extent there was any political gain, it
was to burnish Tzipi Livni’s credentials as a tough potential Prime Minister ahead
of the election. That was not her intent. Of all the politicians I’ve known, she is
among the least interested in such games, especially with lives at stake. But it was
one of the effects.

She won the election, in a photo finish, with opinion polls suggesting she’d
been effective in shaping the campaign as a choice “between Tzipi and Bibi.”
Kadima got 28 Knesset seats, to 27 for Bibi and the Likud, which gave her the first
crack at forming a government. There’s no way of disguising the fact that Labor’s
result in my first election back in charge was a disappointment. We went down six
seats, to 13. The big gainer was a far-right, stridently anti-Arab party called Yisrael
Beitenu, led by a former Likudnik named Avigdor Lieberman. Tzipi’s attempt to
form a coalition became less a political process than a contest between rival stalls
in a Middle Eastern bazaar. Bibi was holding parallel talks with the Orthodox
parties critical to assembling a parliamentary majority. He was matching and
raising every assurance of a ministerial seat or budgetary concession that Tzipi was
prepared to offer. In the end, she threw up her hands, saying she refused to draw
out a process which was not so much a negotiation as organized extortion. I am

give the authorities wide discretion in applying
them to regime opponents. Such measures are
typically paired with a court system that uses law
merely to justify political instructions from the ex-
ecutive branch, making a mockery of due process
and international conceptions of the rule of law.

4. History revised: A number of countries have un-
dertaken a refashioning of history to buttress the
legitimacy and aims of the current government.
Historians and journalists are forbidden to cross
certain redlines set by the authorities. In China,
the state has prevented the publication of full,
accurate, or critical accounts of the Great Leap
Forward, the Cultural Revolution, or the Mao Ze-
dong era in general. In Russia, Joseph Stalin has
been rehabilitated. He is now officially portrayed
as a strong if mildly flawed leader rather than as
the man responsible for the deaths of millions of
his own people. In Turkey, Erdogan has decreed
that high school students should study the de-
funct Ottoman language, challenging a nearly
century-old reform linked to Mustafa Kemal
Atatiirk, modern Turkey's founder.*

5. Democracy redefined: It is a testament to the
power of the democratic idea that authoritarian
leaders around the globe have claimed the man-
tle of democracy for forms of government that
amount to legalized repression. Even as they
heap disdain on the liberal order, they have often
insisted on the validity of their own systems
as types of democratic rule. They even devise
terms to describe their special variant, such as
“sovereign democracy,” “revolutionary democra-
cy, or “illiberal democracy.

6. Return of the leader for life: Among the changes
invariably instituted by modern authoritarians is
the de facto or de jure removal of constitution-
al limits on presidential terms. Preventing the
concentration of power in a single leader is a
fundamental goal of democratic governance, but
authoritarian propaganda has presented term
limits as artificial constraints, associated them
with foreign origins, and claimed that they do
not suit every country’s unique historical, cultur-
al, or security conditions.

While these ideas may not amount to a coherent

or complete ideology, they do form the basis for an
impressive degree of collaboration and alliance-build-
ing that has brought together modern authoritarian

regimes with significantly different economic systems,
official creeds, and sources of political legitimacy.

A loose-knit league of authoritarians works to protect
mutual interests at the United Nations and other inter-
national forums, subverting global human rights stan-
dards and blocking precedent-setting actions against
fellow despots. With the formation of the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization, Russia, China, and a number
of Central Asian governments have come together to
discuss common regime-security strategies.>

More disturbingly, modern authoritarians collaborate
to prop up some of the world’s most reprehensible
regimes, apparently reasoning that the toppling of
one dictator thins the herd, inspires imitation, and
endangers them all. This is most visible in Syria, where
Russia, China, Iran, and Venezuela at various times
have offered diplomatic support, loans, fuel, or direct
military aid to the regime of Bashar al-Assad.

Dashed hopes

Democracy recorded unprecedented gains during the
20th century's last decades. In 1975, Freedom House
found that just 25 percent of the world’s sovereign
states qualified for the Free category; by 2000, the
share of countries rated as Free had reached 45
percent.

The numbers told an optimistic story, and a series of
accelerating social trends suggested that the recent
improvements would hold firm and expand as the new
millennium dawned.

There was, to begin with, a strong identification of free
societies with free markets. The degree of economic
freedom varied from one society to the next, and
corruption was a problem in practically all of the new
democracies. But there was no longer a major bloc of
countries that rejected capitalism, and practically ev-
ery country sought to deepen their participation in the
global economic system, as witnessed by the number
of governments seeking admission to the World Trade
Organization. Authorities in the United States and
elsewhere predicted that as countries came to accept
the rules of the game set down by the WTO, they
would also be more amenable to accepting the norms
of liberal democracy, including fair elections, freedom
of expression, minority rights, and the rule of law.

A second development was the introduction of the in-
ternet and other digital media. In the wake of the col-
lapse of the Soviet Union, communist governments in

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019242
"
IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029931.txt,"livered to the government by members of
the Black Panther Party,” he told me.
Even that didn’t work. The Chinese de-
nied the request, and Kaptchuk spent
much of the next decade studying in
Macau.

Today, it is hard to imagine Ted
Kaptchuk as a radical, let alone a fugitive.
He is an observant Jew who wears a yar-
mulke on top of a shaggy bowl haircut
that looks as if he'd copied the Beatles,
circa 1964, then let it grow. As a devotee
of Eastern thought, he bars shoes from
his house and speaks in a hushed, mea-
sured voice. David Carradine would have
played him beautifully.

Kaptchuk is the first prominent pro-
fessor at Harvard Medical School since
Erik Erikson with neither a medical de-
gree nor a doctorate, and it would be easy
to dismiss him as a signature representa-
tive of the unsubstantiated-alternative-
health-care movement. But he has pub-
lished scores of books, articles in highly
regarded peer-reviewed journals, letters,
and review notes—on subjects ranging
from placebo research to exorcism, from
cancer treatment to shaman rituals among
Navajo Indians. He has just finished a
study designed to answer a central ques-
tion in placebo research: Do the genes of
people who respond to placebos differ in
significant ways from those of people
who don't? (The data, compelling but so
far preliminary, suggest that the answer
is yes.)

“Ted Kaptchuk is the most knowl-
edgeable person in the world on all mat-
ters placebo,” Franklin Miller told me.
Miller is a senior faculty member in the
Department of Bioethics at the National
Institutes of Health. “He has done the
research, the scholarship, and the most
interesting and clinically relevant stud-
ies.” One day, I asked Kaptchuk how a
man who practiced acupuncture and dis-
pensed herbs, rather than earning a
Ph.D. in biology or statistics, had learned
to design complicated trials. He told me
that he spent years seeking the advice of
the most highly respected and rigorous
medical statisticians. “I basically appren-
ticed myself,” he said, “and they were
happy to help a quack who wanted to
deal with data.”

Kaptchuk is proud of being what he
calls “a card-carrying member of the
Harvard establishment.” It is a dis-
tinction that did not come easily, even

36 THE NEW YORKER, DECEMBER 12, 2011

though he has received millions of dol-
lars in funding for his projects from the
National Institutes of Health. “The goal
is to understand placebos so that they
may be used intelligently,” he said one
day. “But this is the area where I veer
from some of my colleagues. Because
what do I really want? Anything that
gets people away from the conveyor belts
that move from the pharmaceutical
houses to doctors and on to patients is
worth considering. Anything. We need
to stop pretending it’s all about molecu-
lar biology. Serious illnesses are affected
by aesthetics, by art, and by the moral
questions that are negotiated between
practitioners and patients. Chiropractors
never say that your pain is all in your
head. But orthopedists do it all the time.
What a fucking way to try and help
somebody heal. Do you know how evil
that is?”

That kind of deeply held conviction
touches on the fundamental questions
that challenge American medicine.
Kaptchuk wants to broaden the defi-
nition of healing, which is exactly what
enrages many scientists. In one recent
study of a major asthma drug, he and his
colleagues reported that, although place-
bos had no impact on the chemical
markers that indicate whether a patient
is responding to therapy, patients none-
theless reported feeling better. Kaptchuk
concluded that objective data should not
be the only criterion for doctors to con-
sider. “Even though objective physiolog-
ical measures are important,” he wrote in
the study, published earlier this year in
The New England Journal of Medicine,
“other outcomes such as emergency
room visits and quality-of-life metrics
may be more clinically relevant to pa-
tients and physicians.”

“My jaw dropped when I read this,”
David Gorski, a professor of medicine at
Wayne State University School of Med-
icine, wrote on the science blog Re-
spectful Insolence. “ ‘Other outcomes’
besides objective measures of disease se-
verity may be ‘more clinically relevant?”
That kind of assertion clashes with the
basic truths of the scientific method.
Kaptchuk counters that we are losing
sight of our goal—which is to make
people feel better. “This study demon-
strated that, without a change in objec-
tive data, you still get incredible subjec-
tive improvement,” he said. “So is a

doctor really supposed to say, Gee, the
patient is feeling good but I better ig-
nore that and go by the numbers?”

It was late in the afternoon, and we
were sitting in Kaptchuk’s garden in
Cambridge. He looked at me and threw
his hands into the air. “Is my approach
just hocus-pocus?” he said softly. “Isn’t
that what you are really asking? You want
to know the relationship between ratio-
nality and feeling and between science,
critical thinking, and the art of medicine.
And that boils down to one question: Do
you think this entire field is based on a
foundation of magical thinking, or do
you not?”

hree years ago, a week before

Thanksgiving, while I was sitting in
my office, my chest began to throb. It
was a diffuse pain, but pain nonetheless.
I am a middle-aged man with the usual
amount of stress (too much) and I han-
dle it in the usual way (denial). My cho-
lesterol and blood pressure are normal,
and I exercise regularly and try to eat sen-
sibly. Still, I have read many obituaries of
“healthy” men my age who ignored chest
pain. So, somewhat sheepishly, I called
my doctor and explained the situation,
and he told me to come right over.

He conducted a thorough examina-
tion, and then we talked. He told me I
was fine, that Thanksgiving is often a
tense time, and that I should relax. My
pain suddenly disappeared. I have writ-
ten frequently of my belief that magic
is for fairy tales and science is for hu-
mans. But something about that process
soothed me. Of course, it was a relief to
know that I wasn’t sick. But could words
really banish a pain I had struggled with
for hours?

After I got home, I realized that I had
been given a placebo. Not purposefully,
perhaps, but it had the same effect. My
doctor told me that I was fine, and that
made my pain go away. It also eased my
anxiety at least as effectively as if I had
swallowed a pill. My doctor takes an ex-
tremely science-based approach to his
work. That’s what makes him so good at
his job. But that afternoon we engaged in
exactly the type of ritual that, according
to Kaptchuk, will have to play a critical
role in the future of American health
care. And, at least in this instance, it
would have been hard to argue that it
didn’t work. ¢

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030253.txt,"As the President, by nature and design, tries to claim aggressive
new powers, the Mueller team, almost in equal proportion, is trying to
limit the theory of Presidential power and, even, to criminalize an
expansive exercise of those powers.

People who know and have worked with Mueller find it, at best,
unexpected that this traditional by the book G-man would be pursuing
such far-reaching legal theories. But one possible explanation, shared by
many in the White House, is that Mueller is overly reliant on his staff—
in fact, is being led by his number two, Andrew Weissmann.

Weismann has a longstanding reputation for aggression: he was
the prosecutor whose pursuit of the accounting firm Arthur Anderson in
the Enron debacle ended in its conviction—a judgment reversed well
after the firm's bankruptcy and dissolution. One White House advisor
likened him to Victor Hugo's obsessed policeman Inspector Javert—a
prosecutor consumed with taking down the President. Indeed,
Weissmann, who has in the past contributed to Democratic candidates,
is a particular bet noir and favorite whipping boy for the White House
his central role in the Mueller investigation taken there as evidence of a
deep bias against Donald Trump.

But in another view it is precisely because Mueller, a former
Marine, is so by the book and Semper Fi that he finds Trump's behavior
to be personally offensive, and, on its face, corrupt. Bob Mueller is all
about limits and rules. Donald Trump has none and acknowledges
none, said one lawyer who has worked with Mueller in the past.

It may yet be even a more profound clash then that, the executive
branch at war with itself—the Justice Department against the White
House. In this, the President's almost daily tirades against the DOJ, the
Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, the Deputy Attorney General,
Rosenstein, the former head of the FBI, Comey, and his former deputy,
Andrew McCabe, are part of an effort to obstruct justice and save
himself.

The Mueller strategy (or Weissmann strategy) is a war strategy, in
the view of some legal observers. An indictment of the President would
be litigated to the hilt. It would force both the substantive issues of
obstruction and abuse of power and the meta issues of Presidential
immunity—in essence, the President's claims to being above the law—
into open court for a long and painful review and dissection that might
shadow the November election.

of uniformed US personnel. The focus was, of all things, on defense against a
missile attack from Iran. I contacted Leon Panetta to see whether we could delay it.
The official reason cited by the Americans, when they agreed to do it, did have the
merit of being true: that Bibi was coming under pressure to shift our budgetary
priorities away from defense toward social and economic issues. But Panetta
understood that my request for a delay meant we were at least considering military
action. He also realized that if we did launch an attack, it was in the Americans’
own interest for their troops be as far away from Israel as possible. We agreed to
reschedule the exercise for October 2012. That meant that if we did decide to
attack, we’d have until well into September, when significant numbers of US
troops would begin arriving.

As we weighed our final decision, I held a series of high-level meetings in
Washington: with Panetta, national security adviser Tom Donilon, Hillary Clinton,
and President Obama himself. Though not explicitly saying we were ready to
attack, I left no doubt that we were seriously considering it, and explained the
reasons we believed our country’s fundamental security interests might make it
necessary. The message from all of the Americans I met was that the
administration shared our basic goal: to prevent, or at least seriously impair, Iran’s
drive to get a nuclear bomb. But they continued to believe that non-military
pressure was the best way to do it.

The Americans knew we were skeptical that the non-military route would work,
and that we were deeply worried about the implications of not taking military
action if it failed. I discussed our thinking — and, in general terms, our plans — in
my meetings with Panetta. He already had a pretty good idea of the broad contours
of what we were contemplating, since US radar systems and electronic intercepts
had been recording the volume and nature of air force exercises we’d been
conducting over recent months. Leon and I had by now got to know each other
well, having first met when he was in charge of the CIA at the start of the Obama
administration. In one of our early meetings at CIA headquarters in Langley, there
had been a small bunch of grapes on his desk and I plucked a few in my mouth
with obvious enjoyment. Now, at the Pentagon, he had a big bowlful ready
whenever we met. The fact that he opposed an Israeli military operation made him
no less of a pleasure to deal with. He was unfailingly calm and even tempered. He
had an encyclopedic grasp of issues of defense, intelligence, budgets and policy.
He was always rock-solid in America’s commitments to Israel. It’s worth

chemistry that doctors need to know, they study the chemistry re-
search that their professors are doing. When they want to learn busi-
ness, they learn economics. When they want to learn how to write,
they learn about literature. All of this happens because of the nature of
the research universities’ domination of our education system.

In order to fix our high schools, we need to get rid of departments
based on rather arbitrarily defined academic subjects.. We should or-
ganize universities around the kinds of work people do, where work
means the kinds of thinking that they engage in, not the machines
that they play with. Anyway that’s my suggestion.

AN IMAGINED FIRST YEAR IN COLLEGE

We all know that what I propose will never happen. University faculty
would stop such a proposal at every turn. So, in the name of real-
ity, I want to make a suggestion that university faculty possibly could
adopt.

Simply divide the 4 years that make up college into two parts.
Dedicate the first 2 years to the teaching of the 12 processes and the
last 2 to the study of the subjects that the faculty so dearly love. Intro-
duction to X, which now dominates the first 2 years of college for most
students, would be abandoned. The faculty hate teaching it anyway
and the students hate taking it.

How would this work? Let’s first consider the set of processes
grouped under conceptual processes.

Conceptual Processes

Prediction is an area of life that is worth getting good at doing.
Who, in the various faculties, organize their daily lives around predic-
tions? Economists make predictions. It is what they do all the time.
Medical doctors make predictions. Physicists make predictions. Po-
litical scientists make predictions. Let’s imagine that students were
taught by a team of people from these four areas who were the exactly
those people who specialized in making predictions all the time in
their careers. And, let’s suppose that they created a year-long course
in how to make predictions based on known evidence, past cases, and

Highlights from F2010 USA Inc. Financials

e Summary — USA Inc. has challenges.

e Cash Flow — While recession depressed F2008-F2010 results, cash flow has been negative
for 9 consecutive years ($4.8 trillion, cumulative), with no end to losses in sight. Negative
cash flow implies that USA Inc. can't afford the services it is providing to 'customers,’ many
of whom are people with few alternatives.

e Balance Sheet — Net worth is negative and deteriorating.

e Off-Balance Sheet Liabilities — Off-balance sheet liabilities of at least $31 trillion (primarily
unfunded Medicare and Social Security obligations) amount to nearly $3 for every $1 of debt
on the books. Just as unfunded corporate pensions and other post-employment benefits
(OPEB) weigh on public corporations, unfunded entitlements, over time, may increase USA
Inc.’s cost of capital. And today’s off-balance sheet liabilities will be tomorrow’s on-balance
sheet debt.

e Conclusion — Publicly traded companies with similar financial trends would be pressed by
shareholders to pursue a turnaround. The good news: USA Inc.’s underlying asset base and
entrepreneurial culture are strong. The financial trends can shift toward a positive direction,
but both ‘management’ and ‘shareholders’ will need collective focus, willpower, commitment,
and sacrifice.

Note: USA federal fiscal year ends in September, Cash flow = total revenue — total spending on a cash basis; net worth includes

unfunded future liabilities from Social Security and Medicare on an accrual basis over the next 75 years. Source: cash flow per

White House Office of Management and Budget; net worth per Dept. of Treasury, “2010 Financial Report of the U.S.

KP Government,” adjusted to include unfunded liabilities of Social Security and Medicare.

recognition but also has induced the launch of other Arab airlines that followed the same model. Emirates has
encouraged many established Arab airlines to enhance their fleets and upgrade their services. This has
ultimately led to increasing Arab airlines’ share of the in ternational travel market. Leading by example,
Emirates has set new benchmarks for quality services not only regionally but also internationally. One can only
gain world recognition by proving success and ability to take the initiative, yet this recognition may not
necessarily reflect acceptance.

By Thabet Amin Awad of Al Ahram Egyptian newspaper

There is no doubt that good planning is one of the key factors behind the success of the
UAE, backed by the close monitoring of the ongoing challenges and opportunities. In
your plans, what are the challenges that you foresee? What is the country’s level of
readiness to address them?

Humans face challenges throughout their lives. Through commitment to proper planning of projects and
programmes, and following up on their implementation, challenges can be successfully addressed. It is also
crucial to anticipate challenges without ignoring any possibility. Yet, there are some unforeseen challenges that
originate remotely but influence us -- as in the global financial crisis that erupted in the United States and
spread to the economies of developed countries and the rest of the world. One must be prepared to effectively
deal with the implications of such challenges to one’s country, economy and security. We, in the UAE, are
aware of the challenges that we face and are always prepared for the worst, and are also willing to face
whatever unforeseen developments regardless of their magnitude and im pact.

By Thabet Amin Awad of Al Ahram Egyptian newspaper

You have always stressed that the main challenge facing the Arab world, is that of the
development of human resources in the knowledge era. Do you believe that the current
education systems are equipped to prepare a new generation that is able to face this
challenge and How?

I am not in a position to assess the efficiency of the Arab educational institutions. But a common concern across
the Arab world is the poor education systems at both school and university levels. The international rankings of
the Arab universities are unsatisfactory to both the keen learners as well as the academic institutions.

Yes, the main challenge facing the Arab world is the challenge of human development in the era of knowledge.
Without the development of strong education systems, we will not easily achieve the desired development.
Despite the importance of the state’s role in the development of education, the development effort is the
responsibility of society as a whole; the State must lead these efforts and involve the broadest segments of
society. Isn’t strange that we approach the second decade of the third millennium with the average percentage
of illiteracy in the Arab world more than 30 percent?

By Thabet Amin Awad of Al Ahram Egyptian newspaper

Amid the growing global crisis and in the latest G20=2 O0summit, many were demanding a
re-consideration of the global economic system, and declaring the failure the entire
system of capitalism. Would the United Arab Emirates -- with its regional and
international reach -- consider a new financial direction, such as the Islamic banking
system as a substitute, even temporarily, to the current global economic system — which is
currently deteriorating?

power that look extremely reasonable until one day they look insane. For thousands
of years the idea that one feudal lord should control thousands of serfs seemed
perfectly reasonable to the lords and serfs alike. John Maynard Keynes’ famous line
about Egypt - Just because you built the pyramids doesn’t mean you get to use them -
marked a whole approach that seemed inarguable for centuries, even if the
experience of it was inarguably awful®?. Features of the world - moats, massive
cathedrals, pyramids, sweatshops - exist only because distributions of power
permitted or enabled or encouraged them. The quotidian interactions of our lives -
how we shop, where we hang out with friends, the kinds of performance or politics
we follow - these all produce long-lasting structures. Malls, democracies, war
zones.”° Pushing power into networks, we can see already, creates whole new
arrangements. Some are as unimaginable to us now as a voting booth would have
been to an Egyptian slave. When we say that ours is a revolutionary age, it’s not
because you can watch videos on your phone. It’s because of why you can watch
video on your phone - and what that implies for the old, nervous structures around
us.

Before the age of the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution began most political
and economic power was extremely concentrated. A few kings and feudal lords
controlled most economic production. Priests decided who could speak to God, and
how and when. Finance was dominated by a few families, largely working in the
secretive counting rooms of early banking capitals such as Amsterdam or Genoa or
Lyon. Knowledge about the world, a sense of science and of history and even
geography, was closely held, fiercely opaque. Inside monastery walls or university
halls the aim of protecting (and editing) what the world knew far outstripped any
hunger for new ideas, for innovation or dissemination. In those times a lucky or
brutal few decided the economic, political and intellectual lives of many. You can
picture power as balled up almost, in the hands of a tiny and fortunate elite.

Over time, cracks appeared in this system. One of the earliest was also one of the
most fundamental: The schism that split the Catholic Church. This was, at first, the
work of a young German theologian named Martin Luther in the 16 Century.
Luther was a man whose view of life, he would say often in later years, was shaped
by a single sentence: Romans 1:17. “The righteousness of God is revealed from faith
to faith, as itis written: The just shall live by faith.” The Epistle to the Romans, as
Romans is formally titled, was a letter from Saint Paul to a collection of recalcitrant,

How art can make greed look fabulous

Olivia Cole
07.10.10

Literature's most sinister art connoisseur is probably Henry James's Gilbert Osmond, the collector of beautiful
objects to whom Isabel Archer shackles her fortunes in The Portrait of a Lady. She is at first dazzled by his advice
that “one ought to make one's life a work of art”, before realising that he has no imagination of his own, only
acquisitiveness: beauty by proxy. By that time, as his wife, she is part of his collection.

So how to spot a Gilbert Osmond today? You might imagine one lives in The House of the Nobleman, an
exhibition opening next week in a vast Edwardian pile on the borders of Regent's Park to coincide with the nearby
Frieze art fair.

Surveying the J20 million-worth of paintings, from Poussin to Warhol via Picasso, visitors are invited to believe
that they are in the house of an extravagantly committed collector. This imagined character is someone like
Randolph Hearst in Citizen Kane: a rich man with non-existent morals but exquisite taste. Like Dick Fuld, Lehman
Brothers’ last CEO: earlier this month, it took Christie's days to sell off the bank's art collection.

Here there is no so such owner: this collection has been curated by two artists, Victoria Golembiovskaya and the
painter Wolfe von Lenkiewicz. The nobleman of their title is a modern-day Don Quixote, caught between fantasy
and reality. Von Lenkiewicz says City practices such as shorting have “no direct relationship to reality”. Their
modern-day nobleman hankers for meaning and order: beauty even. Hence the kind of people who fervently
collect in London. The compulsion to be known not only as loaded but cultured is often observed but rarely
examined. It's interesting that this show is staged by artists all of whom have a complex relationship with the kind
of people characterised by Vince Cable as merely “spivs and gamblers”. Wolfe refers to people who do
“unspeakable things” before reiterating that the show isn't a moral judgment.

Even so, their show tries to lift the veil on the activity at Frieze. As a centre for commercial art sustained still by
swilling disposable income, London eclipses Paris and New York. Frieze will be swarming with both people like me,
who go to look, and hundreds of the modern-day “noblemen” with their Black Amex cards. It’s no small irony that
The House of the Nobleman naturally has its own massively wealthy backer, Russian property giant Mirax. Greed
might not be good but it sure can look fabulous.

And what about the savvier artists? Tracey Emin whines about arts cuts yet moans about her tax bill. Damien Hirst
has exploited the market in his own work as ruthlessly as any hedge-funder. Wolfe himself confidently discusses
algorithms and is a favourite of collectors such as Bono and Richard Devereux, co-founder of Virgin. London's
most successful artists aren't exactly in the gutter, looking at the stars.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013582.txt,"A global statistical context for these qualitative differential systems was
inspired by the Russian mathematician, Andrei Nikolaevic Kolmogorov. In his now
famous foundational talk about the stability of classical mechanical systems in the
final session of the 1954 International Congress of Mathematics, he gave public
birth to, among other ideas, what has come to be called the ergodic or statistical,
measure theory of dynamical systems. Here, ergodic means the existence of an
invariant statistical measure on the phase space attractor of the system that can be
obtained using a variety of equivalent methods and beginning the count at any of its
points. Two phase space objects generated by a dynamical system may look
different in phase space but their statistical measures may all be the same, L.e.
invariant. These qualitative orbits in a box-partitioned space can be visualized as
Paulus and Geyer’s rats exploring a space and Selz’s path sequences of computer

screen dot quenches produced by clicking on them with a computer mouse.

A precursor of Kolmogorov’s ergodicity was the earlier ergodicity of Ludwig
Boltzmann. This describes a suitably partitioned system such that equivalent values
come from quantitating the behavior of one single orbit exploring the space of the
lattice of boxes over very long times time as those obtained from a single aggregate
photograph of a// orbits run from all possible starting places simultaneously. The
ergodicity of gas-like molecular randomness implicates systems being in one of only
two possible equilibrium statistical states: measure zero (at most occupying a single
point, zero, minimal entropy) or its “complement,” full measure one (occupying all
available space in a state of maximal entropy). Joseph Goldstein, a well known
teacher of meditation, giving advice recorded in Daniel Goleman’s 1977 book on the
subject said that all methods of nirvana directed meditation amounted to “...simple
mathematics ...all systems aiming for One or Zero—union with God or emptiness.”
In place of the maximal or minimal values for the H; and Hy entropies of these
states of transcendence, we in the world of samsara are stuck in states of in-
between entropy which invariant statistical measures of on phase space shapes

help quantify.

To generalize measures made on rat and computer mouse paths to more

general and idealized systems, after plotting an orbital path in a phase space, we

Breitbart News chairman’s remarks because microphone placement made the opening
mostly unintelligible, but we have completed the transcript from a video of the talk on
YouTube. You can hear the whole recording at the bottom of the post.

Here ts what he said, unedited:

Steve Bannon: Thank you very much Benjamin, and I appreciate you guys including us
in this. We’re speaking from Los Angeles today, right across the street from our
headquarters in Los Angeles. Um. I want to talk about wealth creation and what wealth
creation really can achieve and maybe take it in a slightly different direction, because I
believe the world, and particularly the Judeo-Christian west, is in a crisis. And it’s really
the organizing principle of how we built Breitbart News to really be a platform to bring
news and information to people throughout the world. Principally in the west, but we’re
expanding internationally to let people understand the depths of this crisis, and it is a
crisis both of capitalism but really of the underpinnings of the Judeo-Christian west in
our beliefs.

It’s ironic, I think, that we’re talking today at exactly, tomorrow, 100 years ago, at the
exact moment we're talking, the assassination took place in Sarajevo of Archduke Franz
Ferdinand that led to the end of the Victorian era and the beginning of the bloodiest
century in mankind’s history. Just to put it in perspective, with the assassination that
took place 100 years ago tomorrow in Sarajevo, the world was at total peace. There was
trade, there was globalization, there was technological transfer, the High Church of
England and the Catholic Church and the Christian faith was predominant throughout
Europe of practicing Christians. Seven weeks later, I think there were 5 million men in
uniform and within 30 days there were over a million casualties.

That war triggered a century of barbaric — unparalleled in mankind’s history — virtually
180 to 200 million people were killed in the 20th century, and I believe that, you know,
hundreds of years from now when they look back, we’re children of that: We’re children
of that barbarity. This will be looked at almost as a new Dark Age.

But the thing that got us out of it, the organizing principle that met this, was not just the
heroism of our people — whether it was French resistance fighters, whether it was the
Polish resistance fighters, or it’s the young men from Kansas City or the Midwest who

stormed the beaches of Normandy, commandos in England that fought with the Royal Air

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012844.txt,"there was significant activation in the nucleus accumbens. They felt an immediate honey hit, joy over the
rival’s pain. The higher the activation in this reward area, the more likely they were to choose the option
of watching the rival experience pain — like watching a public execution and cheering for just deserts.
These results show that individual differences in our compassion toward others in pain predicts our
willingness to help them. It reveals another dimension, like language, that biases our sense of justice, both
in our judgments and in our behavior. Conversely, individual differences in our joy over others’ misery
predicts our willingness to allow others to suffer, suppress our instincts to help and, I suggest, facilitate
our capacity to harm. Similar response patterns arise in the context of race —a feature of group
membership that is fixed at birth.

As noted earlier, babies stare longer at faces of people from the same race than from people ofa
different race, and by the pre-school years, are more likely to show social preferences for peers and adults
of the same race. In brain imaging studies, specific areas activate when we process faces as opposed to
other objects, and one tenth of a second later, other associated regions activate when we process race.
This rapid activation occurs whether we are consciously engaged in classifying faces by race or not; for
example, the same areas activate even when we are forced to focus on gender or familiarity. This shows
that from the brain’s perspective, we don’t have an option of processing a person’s race. The brain
automatically and unconsciously hands us this information, like it or not.

The fact that we process race automatically gains importance based on a powerful set of
behavioral studies showing that virtually every person, independently of their explicit avowals of non-
racist attitudes, holds implicit or unconscious racist biases. Using a research tool developed by the social
psychologists Tony Greenwald and Mahzarin Banaji called the Implicit Attitudes Test or IAT, subjects see
different faces or read different descriptions of people, and then make evaluative judgments about these
people. Often, the presentations are rapid so that there is little or no time to reflect upon the evaluation.
For example, in a study focused on race, subjects first classified photographs of people’s faces as either
Caucasian or Black. Next they classified words into those associated with good positive meaning — joy
and friend — and those with bad negative meaning — hate and bomb. In the third and critical step,
subjects saw faces and words together and, using a rule provided by the experimenter, struck one of two
keys on a keyboard as fast as possible: for example, strike the #1 key if you see a Black face and a good
word, but the #2 key if you see a Caucasian face and a good word. The intuition here is that if certain
faces and words are more strongly associated, because this is what people have learned over time, then
they will press the relevant key faster than for weaker associations. Results from several studies confirm
this intuition. For example, Caucasian subjects who explicitly deny racist attitudes are nonetheless slower
to respond when Black, as opposed to Caucasian faces are associated with good words, and faster to

respond when Black, as opposed to Caucasian faces are associated with bad words. These patterns hold

the Classical Period in the Third Century, the Medieval Period in the Fourteenth
Century, the Renaissance in the Seventeenth Century and, now, as we know, in the
Western World toward the end of the Twentieth Century. An increase in general
acceptance of talk, writing and practice focused on mystical experience is said by
many to accompany historical high points in intellectual, literary and political
achievement. One might include as a component of our growing cultural richness,
the new science about chemical dialogues with the brain. Although no central
nervous system agents were ever allowed in the ashrams of Baba Muktananda, it
was common during some evening sessions of questioning, called satsangs, for him
to acknowledge that one or a few experiences with entheogenic agents can open
many recalcitrant folks to the existence of the God within. This, in turn, led them to
the drug free spiritual exercises, sadhana, of love, se/f-truth, and spontaneity (each
according to their nature) as well as abstinent discipline, meditation, chanting and
yoga to maintain the knowledge. We might speak of participating in the creation and
maintenance of the spiritual ecology of ones inner and outer being. Underhill said
that the cultural richness of an efflorescent epoch is taken inward and accompanies
personal and societal mutations into states and institutions involving higher spiritual
consciousness.

In addition to an increase in the common outward manifestations of having
had a mystical experience, such as an increase in compassion, forgiveness and
more respectful and reverential attitudes toward the Earth and all its creatures
(currently taking the forms of deep ecology, ecofeminism, herbal medicine, organic
farming and the like), these times bring more public consideration of the nature of
reality itself, apart from its material manifestations. The theme of the life’s work of
the Dominican priest, Thomas Aquinas, made master of theology by papal
dispensation in 1259, involved the existential recognition of this dichotomy of
existence, esse, and essence, nature and grace, the material world and God.
William James wrote famously about mystical experience penetrating the thin veil
between these two worlds. Those with a mystical orientation attribute reality to inner

experience in relationship to a transcendental, supernatural world. Whereas

And, particularly, the harder-nosed the capitalism, the better. However, like I said, there’s
two strands of capitalism that we’re quite concerned about.

One is crony capitalism, or what we call state-controlled capitalism, and that’s the big
thing the tea party is fighting in the United States, and really the tea party’s biggest fight
is not with the left, because we're not there yet. The biggest fight the tea party has today is
just like UKIP. UKIP’s biggest fight is with the Conservative Party.

The tea party in the United States’ biggest fight is with the the Republican establishment,
which is really a collection of crony capitalists that feel that they have a different set of
rules of how they’re going to comport themselves and how they’re going to run things.
And, quite frankly, it’s the reason that the United States’ financial situation is so dire,
particularly our balance sheet. We have virtually a hundred trillion dollars of unfunded
liabilities. That is all because you’ve had this kind of crony capitalism in Washington, DC.
The rise of Breitbart is directly tied to being the voice of that center-right opposition. And,
quite frankly, we’re winning many, many victories.

On the social conservative side, we’re the voice of the anti-abortion movement, the voice
of the traditional marriage movement, and I can tell you we’re winning victory after
victory after victory. Things are turning around as people have a voice and have a

platform of which they can use.

the humanizing emotions of compassion and empathy. This is adaptive. This is a transformation that
enables doctors working in war-torn areas or regions afflicted with a disease outbreak, to treat hundreds
of suffering patients as if they were treating inert cars on an assembly line. Good doctors allow their
compassion and empathy to return as their patients regain awareness. Bad doctors maintain their cool,
detached manner, insensitive to the physical and psychological pain of their waking patients. Bad doctors
continue to perceive their patients like cars on the assembly line. Really bad doctors see their patients like
cars that were created for personal R&D.

Recall from earlier sections that when we see someone else in pain, particular areas of the brain
activate as we imagine their suffering. Many of the same areas of the brain also activate when we
personally experience pain. This is the circuitry for pain empathy. The French cognitive neuroscientist
Jean Decety showed that when physicians look at video clips of people experiencing pain from a needle
prick, this circuit is suppressed relative to non-physicians. For physicians, it’s as if they were watching a
needle prick a pillow. Though we don’t know how much experience was necessary or sufficient to cause
the physician’s lack of pain empathy, or the extent to which physicians are physicians because they were
born with less empathy, Decety’s findings point to individual differences in our capacity to feel what
others feel and the potential modulating role of experience.

Several studies now show that based on individual experience, the human brain readily flip-flops
between empathy and callousness. In two similarly designed experiments, one recording from pain related
areas in the brain, and the other from a motor area associated with the hand, Caucasian and Black subjects
watched a video of a needle penetrating a human hand. Consistently, subjects showed weaker activation
in the pain and motor areas when watching the needle penetrate the hand from another race. This lowering
of pain empathy and motor response for the out-group was greatest for subjects with the highest implicit
or unconscious racial biases, as measured with the IAT tool noted earlier.

These studies of the brain, like the behavioral studies I discussed earlier, add to the idea that we
have a racial bias for pain empathy. We feel others’ pain, but only for those who share the same race. But
since, by definition, we look more like those from within our racial group than those outside it, perhaps
the bias is less about race and more about those that don’t look like us. To explore this possibility, Black
and Caucasian subjects saw a needle penetrate a violet-colored hand. Violet hands are not only different,
but far more different than either black or white hands in terms of our experience of skin coloration.
Nonetheless, the activation pattern in the brain matched the subject’s own race. When we feel less
compassion for someone of another race, it is because of racial biases, not because of superficial

differences in appearance. Color is simply a cue that reminds us of our prejudice.

plunging neck line and put on my mother’s jewels. Jim Coleman takes me the Night Before Party in the
hotel. This is Jeffrey Katzenberg’s, 9th Annual A-lister event benefiting The Motion Picture & Television
Fund where they raise $6.5 million dollars in one night. I walk right into Valentino who gives me the
once over and approves my outfit. I tell him and Giancarlo Giammetti that Woody Allen’s new film,
“Midnight in Paris” is opening the Cannes Film Festival and they must bring the yacht. Woody is also
filming all summer in Rome and I am counting on them to entertain him.

Elton John and David Furnish join our conversation and of course we ask for intimate details about the
new baby. Elton says this is the first time they have been away from him for more than a night and they
are delirious with parenthood. I segway over to Amy Adams who mentions she also hates leaving her baby in
the hotel room. I tell her she’s acted like a lady with all the attention showered on Melissa Leo and
that someday soon she will win an Oscar because she consistently hands in amazing performances and
everybody loves her. Next stop is Kate Capshaw in a black bowler hat chatting with Steven Spielberg’s
god-daughter Gwyneth Paltrow. Kate gushes as she talks about her two grandchildren from daughter Jessica.
I have known Steven since “I Wanna Hold Your Hand”. In 1982, as a young publicist on “E.T.” I moved to
california to work for him as one of his thirteen assistants. I now tell him I’m going to Broadway
opening of “war Horse” with Kathy Kennedy and Frank Marshall and cannot wait to see his movie version. He
is wildly excited about the film. I beg him to work on it.

I meet sweet Jennifer Aniston, her new hair cut and her perfect little body. Her date tells me her secret
is a half hour on the treadmill every day. Somehow I think that’s an understatement. I tell Jesse
Eisenberg I was on his plane home from the Baftas last week. He was hiding under his hoodie and I knew
not to bother him. He said innocently, “You should have said ‘Hello’. I always cover my head because I
think my curls make me look like a girl”.

shoppers are Steven and Heather Mnuchin, Viacom’s Deborah and Philippe Dauman, Tamara Mellon, Christine

Next stop is The Weinstein Company’s Pre-Oscar party at the Soho House, sponsored by MontBlanc,
celebrating their new charity partnership and $1 million dollar donation to the Princess Grace
Foundation-USA. Long gone are the funky Miramax Saturday night parties where nominees spoofed their own
films in homemade costumes and ad-libbed hilarious skits. Grown men would dress as Anna Paquin and play
the piano in hopes of winning a Max Award.

There is social anxiety at the Soho House garage entrance. Guests patiently wait as super stars whisk by.
A four hundred pound gorilla refuses to let me on the elevator until I spot Benny Medina. Once on, I see
the radiant Jennifer Lopez in the corner and remind her we met on Len Blavatnik’s yacht in Cannes. She
graciously pretends to know me. Her manager, Benny Medina is kicking me.

I slip into Colin Firth’s booth by the front bar to have a tete-a-tete with him and his wife Livia
Giuggioli about tomorrow night. Jokingly, I suggest when he wins to say, “I’m speechless”. Colin
patiently assures me many people, far more clever than I, have already mentioned this. He then says that
others are waging bets on whether he might subconsciously stutter. I grill him about his wardrobe,
assuming he will be wearing a new Tom Ford tuxedo. He tells me both he and Ford will be in older models
as Ford only designs classics. I tell him I made director Charles Ferguson, front runner for the
financial documentary “Inside Job” spend $6,000 dollars last week for a new Tom Ford tuxedo.

In the back room Jennifer Lopez is now seated with wWeinstein’s wife Georgina Chapman. Nominee Helena

equals realized work plus realized (recovered) human depreciation”.

Prior claims means outflow (transfer out), from sources other than the direct
receiver of revenue, which are recovered in it and owed back to them. Maintenance
consumption can be defined as any transfer out from any asset of either factor,
outside the human capital of the earner, which supports pay in the sense that any

less maintenance consumption would have realized less pay. This meets every

criterion of prior claims but one. Maintenance consumption is the prior claims

meant by z, in (A5.5) if and only if it is actually recovered in pay or so intended.

I gave my arguments that it is neither, but is rather exhausted in satisfying our taste

for survival, in Chapter 6 and elsewhere. If I am right, (A5.4) gives

m,.=0 and = W, +D(H), = W, gross , (A5.5)

so that pay would measure and compensate gross realized work. This is the pay rule.

By (A3.3), positive cash flow is gross realized output less plowback from revenue.

That comes to

F(H), = W, gross 1, =a-T, . (A5.6)

Now we have

Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 2 of 18

Even from jail, sex abuser manipulated the system. His victims were kept in the dark

BY Julie K. Brown

A decade before #MeToo, a multimillionaire sex offender from Florida got the ultimate break.

fy
Palm Beach County Courthouse
June 30, 2008

Jeffrey Edward Epstein appeared at his sentencing dressed comfortably in a blue blazer, blue shirt, jeans and gray sneakers. His attorney, Jack

Goldberger, was at his side.

At the end of the 68-minute hearing, the 55-year-old silver-haired financier — accused of sexually abusing dozens of underage girls — was fingerprinted

and handcuffed, just like any other criminal sentenced in Florida.

But inmate No. W35755 would not be treated like other convicted sex offenders in the state of Florida, which has some of the strictest sex offender laws in

the nation.

Ten years before the #MeToo movement raised awareness about the kid-glove handling of powerful men accused of sexual abuse, Epstein’s lenient
sentence and his extraordinary treatment while in custody are still the source of consternation for the victims he was accused of molesting when they

were minors.

Beginning as far back as 2001, Epstein lured a steady stream of underage girls to his Palm Beach mansion to engage in nude massages, masturbation, oral
sex and intercourse, court and police records show. The girls — mostly from disadvantaged, troubled families — were recruited from middle and high
schools around Palm Beach County. Epstein would pay the girls for massages and offer them further money to bring him new girls every time he was at

his home in Palm Beach, according to police reports.

The girls, now in their late 20s and early 30s, allege in a series of federal civil lawsuits filed over the past decade that Epstein sexually abused hundreds of
girls, not only in Palm Beach, but at his homes in Manhattan, New Mexico and in the Caribbean.

In 2007, the FBI had prepared a 53-page federal indictment charging Epstein with sex crimes that could have put him in federal prison for life. But then-
Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta signed off on a non-prosecution agreement, which was negotiated, signed and sealed so that no one would know

the full scope of Epstein’s crimes. The indictment was shelved, never to be seen again.

Epstein instead pleaded guilty to lesser charges in state court, and was required to register as a sex offender. He was sentenced to 18 months

incarceration.

But Epstein — who had a long list of powerful, politically connected friends — didn’t go to state prison like most sex offenders in Florida. Instead, the
multimillionaire was assigned to a private wing of the Palm Beach County stockade, where he was able to hire his own security detail. Even then, he didn’t
spend much time in a cell. He was allowed to go to his downtown West Palm Beach office for work release, up to 12 hours a day, six days a week, records
show.

DALAL ABU GHAZALA, Al Hayat Newspaper

Some Western media are trying to defame the UA E either through exaggerating the
impact of the economic downturn on Dubai, or through inaccurate reports such as
Human Rights Watch’s on the Media Law in the UAE. What do you think are the reasons
behind such campaigns? And what is your response to these campaigns?

We don’t care who stands behind such campaigns, but rather pay attention to the content of these reports either
issued by media or international nongovernmental organizations. We deal with such reports with absolute
objectivity -- for example when producers of these reports express their wish to visit the UAE and meet
concerned officials, we open our doors for them and welcome all constructive discussions, offering them full
briefings on all facts. We attentively listen to their views and, I like to think, so do they.

Regarding Human Rights Watch’s report on the UAE’s new draft media law, the international organisation’s
officials were in the country last week. They met with the concerned UAE officials who defended the law and
disputed the report’s inaccurate remarks, explaining the law’s different clauses and articles. They tried to steer
the report’s producers away from any misleading interpretations of its content.

PAUL STOBER, Gulf News

The government has taken significant steps to support the financial services and
property industries in the UAE. Are you happy with the results so far?

I am very pleased with the results, and I am confident we are on the right track. Everybody will recognise
shortly the encouraging indicators of the economic recovery.
PAUL STOBER, Gulf News

Ifit became necessary, what further steps of support would the government consider for
the financial services and property industries? Would the government consider
extending support to other important industries in the UAE, like tourism? Ifso, what
form might this take?

The measures we have undertaken so far have shifted the UAE economy from the crisis mood to the solution
mood. Not one country in the world, regardless of what efficient systems it boasts, could have ensured recovery
from the financial crisis before recognising its actual impact on the global economy and international markets.
No one could predict ensuring recovery before the world’s leading economies consolidates their efforts to face
the crisis. That actually took several months of constant work. Now, optimistic voices are getting louder
worldwide, while markets’ fear has started to gradually diminish.

The UAE has one of the region’s most progressive, vibrant and open economies. Efforts by world leading
economies to deal with the financial crisis have been effective and fruitful, while the tendency to increase
international cooperation — including recent decisions by the G20 summit in London — remains very positive
and encouraging. I can confidently say that the UA E is very well positioned on the recovery path, thanks to our
domestic policy measures — such as the fiscal stimulus, easing monetary policy, and increasing liquidity in the

increased political resistance -- and
outright opposition -- from the countries
in the region. That resistance is likely to
come from the new regimes emerging
from the Arab uprisings, as well as a
number of Gulf monarchies.

Indeed, the political trends in the region
are unlikely to conform to the rosy
predictions of democratic peace theorists,
whose musings have implicitly informed
the security policies of both Republican
and Democratic administrations for
decades. Old authoritarian regimes seem
to be passing the way of the dodo bird,
but the new regimes taking shape are
heavily influenced by militant Islamic
ideology that will make them less likely
to engage in security or military
cooperation with the United States.

Democracy optimists argue that these
ideological regimes, once entrenched in
power, will have to moderate their zeal in
order to govern. Pragmatism will
ultimately trump ideology. That line of
reasoning, however, is based on the
assumption that the policy decisions of
such regimes can be explained by rational
choice economic theory. In other words,
if they want to attract international capital
and participate in the world economy,
they are going to have to break with their
ideological affinities. But that reasoning

up in our inner Group of Eight discussions, I could usually count only on Dan
Meridor, and occasionally a handful of others, to argue in favor of any form of
initiative on our side. In private meetings, Bibi did sometimes engage in discussion
about what Israel might do. But he invariably steered the conversation elsewhere,
insisting that the real issue was the Palestinians’ lack of any interest in making
peace.

My main worry wasn’t the immediate future of the negotiations. For now, the
chances of an agreement seemed close to zero. It was the longer-term damage
Bibi’s approach would do in further delaying any serious move by Israel to put our
relations with the Palestinians on a more stable and sustainable footing. The
dithering, delay and deadlock suited him politically. Ironically, my own efforts on
the security front had also made it easier for us to do next to nothing. Intermittent
outbreaks of violence always remained a threat. Yet the West Bank security fence,
along with our military, police and intelligence measures, meant it was very
unlikely we’d see a return to the full-blown terror war of the second intifada. I was
also working to secure US support for our development of increasingly effective
anti-missile weapons to reduce the threat from Hamas in Gaza. The overall result
was that for many, if not most, Israelis, the conflict with the Palestinians didn’t
impact on their day-to-day lives. It was unseen and largely unfelt.

Still, the effect of the stalemate on our relationship with Washington did matter:
both for our security cooperation on things like the anti-missile weapons and,
crucially, the challenge which had led me into Bibi’s government in the first place:
keeping Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.

It was a race against time. The Iranians were producing more and more
yellowcake, building more advanced centrifuges, accumulating more low-enriched
uranium. They were getting better at hiding and protecting the network of facilities
being used to try to produce a nuclear weapon. And in the early months of Bibi’s
Prime Ministership, the question we faced wasn’t even whether to take military
action against Iran — something I knew, from Bob Gates and others, that the
Obama administration viewed no more favourably than George W. Bush. It was

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031538.txt,"The story continues, with the appointment of an EC member, Dr. Karla Leeper, as the Title IX
coordinator, to succeed the departing John Whelan (again, the head of HR, who left to return to his
adopted state of Indiana as head of HR at IU-Bloomington). This basic fact stands uncontested -- at no
time did Baylor University fail to have a high-level Title IX coordinator in place. Never. Not for one
instant.

The suggestion that the Administration somehow failed to have a Title IX coordinator in compliance with
OCR guidance is demonstrablyis manifestly wrong. Indeed, Baylor was months ahead of OCR’s later
guidance that the issues swirling around Title IX were sufficiently complex that a full-time coordinator
was called for. Baylor was way ahead of the curve.

Following numerous meetings of the specialized Task Force, the Administration engaged a leading
consulting firm, Margolis Healy & Associatesd, to assess Baylor’s compliance with Title IX and the Clery
Act (a federal law requiring reports of on-campus assaults; note the key requirement of on-campus).
Within a few short months, Margolis Healy recommended the appointment of a full-time Title IX
coordinator. At the round table, the EC discussed that recommendation, along with others (including
our shortcomings in reportings due under the Clery Act). Without dissent, the EC embraced the
consulting firm’s recommendation, and by October 2014, Patty Crawford was in place in her full-time
role.

In the meantime, the Sexual Assault Advisory Board developed an elaborate prevention proposal to
launch in the fall of 2014. That exemplary proposal resulted in the “Bear Up Now” program, designed to
prevent all forms of interpersonal violence. In August and September 2014, a full year before the Texas
Monthly neutron-bomb report, widespread campus training for all students was launched. In particular,
the effort featured the renowned “Green Dot” program (developed by the federal government in
response to sexual violence reports at the Air Force Academy). Green Dot is a state-of-the-art program
that sets the standard for the pivotally important function of bystander intervention.

Throughout late August 2014, almost 150 peer-leader educators were trained in prevention; those peer
leaders then lead elaborate prevention education sessions in small groups with community leaders and
their residents. Beloved Baylor Police Officer Kandy Knowles guidedled numerous discussions with
students in residence hall meetings early on in the new academic year. Chapel, thea cherished Baylor
tradition, featured the highly impressive Rachel Sibley and others in the Baylor community who were
outspoken on the subject of preventing sexual violence. The faculty and staff likewise joined in the
effort. Over a three- month period from August through October 2014, almost 2000 faculty, staff and
student workers completed training sessions on both Title IX and the Violence Against Women Act, a
measure which had been signed into law (a reauthorization) by President Obama in the early spring of
2013).

of engineering and after a year allow them to work on designing a
787. Such a project-based, real-world curriculum is, in my mind, an
important improvement on the way things are done now in school.

At the very beginning of the meeting, this professor said that he
hoped the outcome of this high school curriculum redesign meeting
would be a curriculum that taught math and science better because
the average student at the University of Washington that he encoun-
tered had very weak math and science skills.

This was not my intent at all and I told him so. I was hoping to
allow high school students to have a year-long experience of actually
doing engineering so they could decide whether that interested them
or at least make use of some of what they learned in their later lives.
As far as I’m concerned, there is too much math and science in high
school now and I told him so,

Since no one ever says things like that, he was quite shocked. I
asked him, since he thought entering college students who wished
to study aerospace were deficient in math and science, why he didn’t
think it was his obligation to teach it to them? He replied that this was
the duty of the high schools. His position then was that even though
less than 1% of college students would study aerospace engineering,
nevertheless every student in the country should be made to learn
the math and science they might need just in case they might study
aerospace engineering.

Of course, this is hardly a unique position. In fact, this stance is
exactly the one in place in high schools today. Just in case you some
day might need it, we will teach it to you.

What is the reasoning behind this point of view?

What is really going on here relates strongly to the teaching
requirement issue I mentioned earlier. I had a light teaching load. This
man certainly teaches more often than I did. To see what his load was,
I looked him up on the web. Here are the courses he was teaching in
2007-08 as I wrote this:

e AA 430 Finite Element Structural Analysis
e AA 432 Composite Materials for Aerospace Structures
e AA532 Mechanics of Composite Materials

I had guessed what kinds of courses he taught before looking him up.
The man is about my age, which means he has seniority, and he is

TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013437.txt,"﻿Jeffrey Epstein 'kept a diary of his under-aged victims'
The Duke of York’s billionaire paedophile friend kept a secret journal, described as “The Holy Grail”
by lawyers, which listed his alleged under-aged victims and the celebrity guests he entertained at his
Florida mansion.

Jeffrey Epstein used the “black book” to log contact details of the girls that gave massages to him and his friends and those
of his powerful and famous associates, such as Bill Clinton and Donald Trump.
A servant at the £4 million manor in Palm Beach, where Prince Andrew enjoyed daily massages during several stays, stole
the journal and initially kept it secret from investigators. He is now in prison after attempting to sell it for $50,000 (£31,000).
Epstein, 58, was accused of sex offences by more than 20 under-aged girls. They alleged that after being recruited as
masseuses by aides including Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late tycoon Robert, they were seriously assaulted and
then paid hundreds of dollars.
The billionaire financier, who attended The Queen's birthday party in 2000, was sentenced to 18 months in prison in 2008,
having secured a plea bargain that prevented full criminal trials. He later settled more than a dozen multi-million dollar civil
lawsuits from his alleged victims out of court.
The previously undisclosed journal, however, “detailed the full scope and the extent of Epstein's involvement with underage
girls”, according to lawyers for several alleged victims.
Prosecutor of the Duke of York’s sex offender friend Jeffrey Epstein speaks of
Duke of York pleads with government over links to dictator
'assault’ (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/8407689/Prosecutor-of-the-Duke-of-Yorks-sexoffender-friend-Jeffrey-Epstein-speaks-of-assault.html)
(http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/8363180/Duke-of-York-pleads-for-government-support-overdinner-with-Tunisian-dictators-relation.html)
It contained the names of girls that Epstein allegedly abused in “Michigan, California, West Palm Beach, New York, New
Mexico, and Paris”, according to court papers.
It also listed extensive contact details for Epstein’s house guests, who had “no connection whatsoever” with alleged
offences, including Mr Clinton, the former US President, and Mr Trump, the famous businessman.
It could not be confirmed last night whether the book contained contact details for the Duke. One lawyer for Epstein’s
alleged victims said: “I would bet he is, because he is that good a friend”.
There is no suggestion that the Duke did anything wrong. However he has this week faced a string of questions about his
judgment due to his association with a convicted child sex offender.
Epstein kept 21 different phone numbers for Mr Clinton, including some for his assistant and also “Clinton’s personal
numbers”, the court papers state.
Alfredo Rodriguez, a servant who “saw numerous underage girls coming into Epstein’s mansion for purported ‘massages’,”
took the journal and did not mention it to investigators.
“Because of the importance of the information in the journal to the civil cases, Mr Rodriguez called it ‘The Holy Grail’,” the
court documents state.
He attempted to sell the book to lawyers for $50,000 (£31,000) in August 2009 - by which time Epstein had already been
sentenced and released from jail.
The lawyers contacted the FBI, who sent an undercover agent to buy the book from Rodriguez. He was then arrested and
charged with obstruction of justice.
Rodriguez, who said in sworn testimony that he was terrified of Miss Maxwell, also said he took the book as an “insurance
policy” to prevent Epstein making him “disappear”.
He was sentenced to 18 months in prison – the same punishment Epstein received for his sex offences – in June last year.
His wife, Patricia Dunn, told The Daily Telegraph that he was “sorry” for his error.
Dave Lee Brannon, an Assistant Public Defender who represented Rodriguez, said: “If this book had been produced when
requested, Mr Epstein’s sentence may have been significantly different.”
Details of the journal emerged in a lawsuit brought in Florida by Epstein against Brad Edwards, a lawyer representing
several alleged victims.
Epstein alleges Edwards was linked to a Ponzi scheme run by a colleague, which lured investors by falsely claiming
Epstein had agreed to settle sex-offence lawsuits for hundreds of millions of dollars.
Edwards rejects the allegation, which has already been dismissed by the Florida Bar.

biggest mistake of his presidency was doing nothing to prevent
genocide in Rwanda.

Hillary’s personal connection to Sarkozy helped cement the coalition.
In 2010, Sarkozy had gallantly steadied her after a shoe had come off
her foot as she climbed the stone steps of the Elysée Palace. (“I may
not be Cinderella but you’re certainly my Prince Charming!” Hillary
inscribed a photo, which sits in his office.) Now, over mixed fruit and
chocolate, the French president took the normal diplomatic flattery a
step further in their “bilat’” (diplo-speak for bilateral talks). “Hillary, I
always like being with you,” he told her. “You are tough. You are
smart. You are a good person.”

From Paris, on the 15th, she went with some trepidation to Cairo,
where many young protesters still angry about her support for
Mubarak refused to meet with her. Others vented to her face in a Four
Seasons conference room before the mood changed and they talked
about democracy building. Her 10 to 15 minutes in Tahrir Square the
next day (where she was greeted cordially) and drop-by in Tunisia on
March 17 left her small security detail jittery; the local authorities,
her guards felt, had no clue what they were doing. She arrived back in
Washington early on March 18 before heading across the Atlantic
again. She arrived in Paris at six a.m. on March 19 and set to work
rounding up support from other allies.

The rollout of the “kinetic military action” (the ridiculous euphemism
used to avoid the word “war’) was botched and misleading. Hillary
had little warning before Sarkozy announced that French planes were
in the skies over Libya. At her Paris press conference she made it
seem, with her frequent references to “they” and “them”—with the
U.S. providing “assistance”—that someone else was leading the
intervention. Hillary was safely on her plane en route back to
Washington on the evening of March 19 when the world would learn
that the core of the attack—112 cruise missiles directed at Libyan

though neither he nor anyone else I asked was sure if they were true. But it
seemed that the Phalangists had been sent into Sabra and Shatila. And that they
had begun killing people.

I'd like to think that, in Amos Yaron’s or Amir Dori’s place, I’d have been
sufficiently wise not to have allowed the Phalangists into the camps in the first
place. But the truth is that I’m not sure. If the decision was to send someone in, I
certainly wouldn’t have sent in Israeli troops. But unlike other Israeli generals,
my first-hand knowledge of the Phalangists was limited to a single lunchtime
encounter in Tel Aviv. My impression from that meeting was that they were
overblown, post-adolescent thugs, not murders. I did, of course, know the
milita’s reputation for untrammelled violence in the Lebanese civil war. Still, I
might conceivably agreed to have the Phalangists go in — under strict orders to
limit themselves to keeping order — in the knowledge that our own troops were
stationed in the area immediately around the camps.

Yet from the moment of the first rumors — as soon as I heard even the hint
that killings were underway — I had not a second’s doubt about what had to be
done next: get the Phalangists out. Immediately. I felt a particular urgency
because of the rooftop gripe I’d heard the day before, about our troops having to
do their fighting for them. That made me pretty certain that, at the very least, we
had indeed sent the Phalangists into the camps.

I tried to reach Arik, but couldn’t get through to him. I contacted Oded
Shamir, the former intelligence officer who was his main liaison with the army.
I told him that if the Phalangists were inside the camps, he had to urge Arik to
get them out. Then I called Tsila Drori, Amir’s wife. I asked whether she’d
spoken to him that morning. She said no. He’d called her the day before,
however, and she was sure he’d be in touch before the New Year. “Please,
swear to me, Tsila, you'll give him a message,” I said. “I was there yesterday.
Tell him please do whatever he can to stop this action. It will end very, very
badly.” I told her he would know what I meant.

It was too late to stop it altogether. The slaughter — the round-ups and the
beatings and the killings of Palestinians in the two camps — had indeed begun
the night before. Amir found out about it late on Friday morning. Not from me,
I believe, but from his staff officers. He ordered the Phalangists to stop. But
they didn’t. No one in command acted, at least successfully, to make sure that
the militiamen got out of the camps. The atrocities went on. It was another 24
hours before the militamen finally withdrew.

massage, Epstein turned around and masturbated. S.G. was so disgusted, she did not say
anything; Epstein told her she “had a really hot body.” Jd. at 14. In the report, S.G. admitted
seeing Jeffrey Epstein’s penis and stated she thought Epstein was on steroids because he was a
“really built guy and his wee wee was very tiny.” Jd. at 15.

However, Edwards had a good faith basis to believe and did in fact believe that Epstein’s victims
were substantially more than forty (40) in number. In addition to the deposition excerpts from
two of his many victims above about the number of underage girls brought to Epstein and the
Palm Beach incident report, there is overwhelming proof that the number of underage girls
molested by Epstein through his scheme was in the hundreds. See Complaint, Jane Doe 102 v.
Epstein, (hereinafter Jane Doe 102 complaint) (Exhibit “B’’); see also Deposition of Jeffrey
Epstein, April 14, 2010, at 442, 443, and 444 (Epstein invoking the 5th on questions about his
daily abuse and molestation of children) (Deposition Attachment #6).

ae At all relevant times Edwards has had a good faith basis to believe and did in fact
believe that Epstein and his attorneys knew of the seriousness of the criminal investigation
against him and corresponded constantly with the United States Attorney’s Office in an attempt
to avoid the filing of numerous federal felony offenses, which effort was successful. See
Correspondence from U.S. Attorney’s Office to Epstein (hereinafter “U.S. Attorney’s

To human rights organizations: Human rights groups
operating from the safety of democracies should be
more aggressive in publicizing the plight of political
prisoners. The defense of jailed dissidents was a major
factor behind the rise of the modern human rights
movement. Political prisoners became a lower priority
as their numbers declined after the Cold War, but
today there are more than a thousand in China alone,
and many others in Venezuela, lran, Azerbaijan, and
elsewhere. It is past time for the phrase “prisoner of
conscience’ to again become an important part of our
regular political vocabulary.

Furthermore, human rights organizations need

to develop strategies that address the varied and
sophisticated methods of repression used by mod-
ern authoritarians. There should be better efforts to
identify individual perpetrators of abuse, document
their culpability, and expose their actions. Among oth-
er benefits, such work would feed into governmental
mechanisms for imposing sanctions, like the United
States’ Global Magnitsky Human Rights Account-
ability Act, which allows visa bans and asset freezes
for foreign officials who are personally involved in
egregious human rights violations.

To the free world: All democratic governments should
make support for civil society in authoritarian and
illiberal environments a bigger priority. This is espe-
cially urgent given that laws and regulations designed
to neutralize nongovernmental organizations, which
were first adopted by Russia, are now being taken up
in countries like Hungary and Poland.

Democracies will also have to push back against
Chinese censorship. The sheer size of China's econo-
my gives Beijing the clout to insist on unreasonable,
nonreciprocal, and often antidemocratic concessions

1. “Big Data, Meet Big Brother: China Invents the Digital Totalitarian S

from trading partners, the most prominent of which

is the state's right to determine what its people can
read, watch, or circulate via social media. The Chinese
leadership expects the rest of the world to accept its
brand of censorship as the normal state of affairs in
China, and it is increasingly extending its demands
beyond its borders, affecting the information available
to global audiences.

Chinese censorship practices should be challenged at
international forums and in bilateral meetings. Demo-
cratic governments should speak out when their own
academics, artists, media companies, and corpora-
tions are subjected to censorship or blocking by the
Chinese authorities. As long as Beijing maintains its
current policies, democracies should take measures
to prevent their own media, entertainment, and other
information-related corporations from falling under
the control of Chinese companies that support or
benefit from censorship.

Finally, the free world must keep faith with states
whose democratic goals are under threat from large
and aggressive authoritarian powers. A prime example
is Ukraine. That country represents the absolute

front line in the global struggle for freedom. Building
democracy in an inhospitable neighborhood is always
difficult, particularly when your most powerful neigh-
bor is determined to steal your land and wreck your
home. Kyiv has made impressive strides; indeed, it has
gone much further along the democratic path than it
did after the Orange Revolution in 2005. But it still has
hard work ahead, and it remains in serious danger. A
positive outcome in Ukraine would not by itself erase
the broader gains secured by the world’s autocrats
over the past decade, but it would be a pivotal defeat
for their campaign to sow chaos and disunity among
those who still live or aspire to live in freedom.

Marina Market Analysis

Marinas are not at all homogenous, and the various combinations of business and physical
components result in significantly different results for the owners and operators. The two major types
of marinas are coastal (usually found in saltwater inland waterways that lead to an ocean port), and
freshwater (found on lakes). Saltwater marinas tend to attract larger vessels and require a completely
different level of maintenance. Freshwater marinas typically cater more toward day-sailors and day-
boaters who do not have personal space with which to keep their boats.

Typical marinas in both coastal and freshwater locations can include any combination of the following
components:

e Wet Slips (covered and uncovered)

e Dry Storage (land)

e Dry Storage (stack)

e Maintenance and Repair Yard and Services

e Marine Dealerships (boat sales)

e Merchandise Sales (fishing, boating, sundries)
e Fuel Sales (gas and diesel)

e Equipment Rental

With regard to slip rentals (wet and dry), these spaces can be either rented (the traditional route), or
sold as “dockominiums” and “rackaminiums.” The sellout component became very popular in the last
decade, and many marinas were converted to all or part sellout type enterprises. Part of the reason is
that developers in recent times prefer to develop real estate for sale (condominiums or homesites)
that surround the marina, and in turn could sell the boat spaces and then move on to another
investment. The market for dockominiums (wet and dry) somewhat dried up during the recent
recession, and many of the unsold units were subsequently rented instead of sold.

Another trend of development prior to the 2008 recession was for marinas within luxury resort
communities that also have a residential component. These include 4 and 5-star resorts in the
subtropical USA as well as the Caribbean. Typical luxury resort developments planned in the last
decade would include a hotel (which the developer would license to a “branded” operator),
condominiums and villas for sale, home sites for sale, and recreational components such as a golf
course and marina. The sellout types of dock spaces fit well into the business model of the developer,
as they sell other components and license the hotel operation to a separate entity.

Marinas also vary in size from small “mom and pop” or “lifestyle” businesses with less than 50 slips to
large enterprises that attract institutional purchasers. Across the board, marinas are affected by
economic downturns due to the leisure component of the boating hobby. During the last two
recessions (2000-2003 and 2008-2009), many marinas went into foreclosure. This created difficulty for
marinas to obtain financing.

especially the individual’s future dangerousness.

Individual differences in glucose metabolism, together with relative differences in brain activity,
lead to stable differences in self-control. But there’s more, both luck of the draw genetic effects and
clinical distortions. Recall that the low expressing form of the MAOA gene results in lower levels of
serotonin which, in turn, leverages less control over aggressive impulses. There is another gene —
SLC6A4 — that also comes in two forms and regulates the level of serotonin. The short form of this gene
gives you less serotonin, is commonly found in pathological gamblers and psychopaths — two heavily
male-biased disorders that are associated with impoverished impulse control. Psychopaths also have
relatively smaller frontal lobes , especially within a region that has a high density of serotonin neurons.
Psychopathy is joined by a family of impulse control disorders that also implicate dysfunction of the
serotonin system, including kleptomania (stealing), pyromania (burning), trichotillomania (hair pulling),
and oniomania (shopping). Like glucose, serotonin plays a lead role in our capacity for self-control.
When serotonin is sidelined from the performance, any number of impulsivity problems may emerge.

What I have said thus far is only a partial accounting of the biological ingredients that figure into
our capacity for self-control. What this partial recipe tell us is that regardless of the situation, some
individuals are inoculated against the pull of authority and group ideology and others are susceptible. If
you missed the inoculation clinic in utero, you are more susceptible to temptations and excesses,
including excessive violence. This is important for our interpretation of the real world and of the famous
psychological experiments by Milgram, Zimbardo, and others in which seemingly good people carried
out unambiguously horrid things. Some individuals carry a genetic skeleton that resists the push and pull
of charismatic leaders and powerful isms. These people will not be pushed into doing bad things. Others,
faced with the exact same situation, will find their skeleton buckling, tempted to take risks and lash out

when the going gets tough.

Invisible risks

Several years ago, Ira Glass, the brilliant radio show host of This American Life, delved into the topic of
superheroes. One episode focused on a question that has become part of my repertoire for dinner parties,
especially those in need of a conversational catalyst: if you could become a superhero with one power,
which would you take — the ability to fly or to be invisible? Most people have a rapid-fire, confident
response to this question, while others reflect a bit, often engaging themselves in a public debate over
their conflicted views. What is interesting about people’s answer to this question, independently of

whether they pick flying or invisibility, is that they rarely talk about using their power to do good in the

Judeo-Christian West to defend its ideals, right?

If you go back to your home countries and your proponent of the defense of the Judeo-
Christian West and its tenets, often times, particularly when you deal with the elites,
you're looked at as someone who is quite odd. So it has kind of sapped the strength.

But I strongly believe that whatever the causes of the current drive to the caliphate was —
and we can debate them, and people can try to deconstruct them — we have to face a very
unpleasant fact: And that unpleasant fact is that there is a major war brewing, a war that’s
already global. It’s going global in scale, and today’s technology, today’s media, today’s
access to weapons of mass destruction, it’s going to lead to a global conflict that I believe

interview to journalist he was aboard an Aeroflot plane bound for Moscow where he would
become, if he was already, a potential espionage source for Russia.

Whatever his initial motivation may have been, Snowden’s actions would appear squarely at
odds with his assertions of serving his country’s interests. Even accepting that he began with a
sincere desire to be a world-class whistleblower, his mission evolved, deliberately or not, into one
that led him to disclose key communications intelligence secrets to a foreign power with an

Dershowitz acted as a sort of kibitzer for Harry. He noted that the crew of the Glomar
Explorer, [which] had been shown a videotape of Deep Throat, had more to do with
transporting obscene material in interstate commerce than Harry Reems did. Would Larry
Parrish prosecute them? When I asked Parrish, he said: “They’re not insulated against
prosecution.”

Not all the stories were flattering. Mike Royko complained in a syndicated article how depressing
it was that after two hundred years of men like Jefferson, Paine, Debs, and Darrow, “we are now
asked to fight for the right of Harry Reems to be a public creep... Anybody who contributes to his
defense fund,” Royko concluded, “is a mental moonbeam.”

But people contributed and Reems and I persisted in making our case in the court of public
opinion. In time, the publicity had its intended effect on the public, on the Justice Department,
and on the courts. We began to get the message that the Reems conviction was an
embarrassment. This was exactly what we had hoped would happen.

In the end, the Justice Department decided to drop the case. Reems’ conviction was vacated and
his indictment was dismissed, over the strong objections of the Memphis prosecutor and judge.
We did not have the law on our side, but we did have public opinion. We might have lost our
case in the court of law (or won it on grounds other than my “choice”, “externality approach,”)
but we had clearly won in the court of public opinion.*”? Harry Reems went free, retired from the
porn business, became a born-again Christian and moved to Utah, where he sold real estate. As
my legal “fee” for winning his freedom, he sent me a photograph of him with the following
inscription: “To Alan Dershowitz who me everything I know.” The First Amendment was safe

from the likes of Larry Parrish—at least for a time.

My second encounter with Deep Throat presented a more daunting challenge to my theory. It
took place on my home turf of Harvard, and the people urging criminal prosecution were Harvard
students. The people who these students wanted to see prosecuted were other students, one of
whom eventually became a founder of Microsoft.

It all began with some drunken Harvard College students viewing the film Animal House and
throwing beer cans at the screen and damaging it. The Quincy House Film Society was
responsible for the screen. In order to raise the several hundred dollars needed for repair, they
decided to show Deep Throat.

Some women students who lived in Quincy House protested. “This is our home,” one
complained. “We shouldn’t have to be subjected to abuse and degradation right in our own living
room.”

The uproar had caught the film society by surprise. The showing of Deep Throat had become a
pre exam tradition at many colleges. My own nephew sponsored a showing at MIT. It was seen
as a lark, an escape from the tensions of the tests. But feminists were beginning to take
pornographic movies, especially Deep Throat, quite seriously.

ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY Challenges of Artificial Intelligence:
Envisioning and Addressing Adverse Outcomes

1) FINANCIAL MARKETS
Al, Trading Systems, and Market Manipulation

(Incorporating contributions by Michael Wellman and others)

There has been advances in the realm of trading in financial markets with the use of autonomous
decision systems. Financial markets now operate almost entirely electronically, over networks with
relatively well-scoped and well-defined interfaces. Markets generate large quantities of data at high
velocity, which require algorithms to digest and assess state. The dynamism of markets means that
timely responses to information are critical, providing a strong incentive to take slow humans out of
the decision loop. Finally, the rewards available for effective trading decisions are large, enabling a
commensurate devotion of resources toward talent and effort to develop and analyze technically
sophisticated strategies.

The rewards and pervasive automation are a tempting target for market manipulation. Thus there are
potential incentives to employ deceptive tactics designed to mislead counterparties about market
conditions or world state, toward the goal of exploiting misled participants for profit.

“Manual” market manipulation—from spoofing to outright fraud—is prevalent in financial markets
today. Al can amplify the magnitude and effectiveness of manipulative behavior, degrading market
efficiency or even subverting the essential economic functions of global capital markets. For example,
automation can enable more rapid and massive simultaneous attacks on electronic markets, and
adaptive capabilities may persistently evade known detection methods.

DISCUSSION

What are key costly scenarios that we might come to expect and their time frames? What might be
done to counter this direction and help to keep markets efficient and functioning well? How might
adversaries and incentives lead to a thwarting of such attempts?

POTENTIAL GOALS
Identify key challenges ahead, including very costly outcomes. Identify key directions with best
practices, mechanism design, monitoring and regulatory activity to help to thwart poor outcomes.

perform a reasonable investigation before making the allegations in the Federal Action.
Plaintiffs argue that they did. Dershowitz must be allowed to contact witnesses and advise them
of what Roberts alleges so that Dershowitz can not only verify or disprove her allegations and
credibility, but also determine whether Plaintiffs ever made efforts to contact key witnesses to
verify Roberts’s allegations and credibility. As explained by one Florida court, “[o]penness in

I am Curious Yellow

My initial professional encounter with the First Amendment involved a direct challenge to the
concept of offensiveness in the context of a Swedish anti-war film called I Am Curious Yellow.
The story involved a young girl coming-of-age both politically and sexually during the Vietnam
War. It included several scenes in which she was nude and engaged in sexual activities. By
today’s standards, it could be shown on cable television and in art theater with an R rating, but in
the late 1960s, it was scandalous. (The young girl who played the lead role, and also starred in an
Ingmar Bergmann film, recently died at the age of 66, thus bringing home to me how much time
had passed).

The film was seized by US Customs and banned throughout the country. Grove Press, a radical
publishing house in New York, owned the film and retained me to argue for its protection under
the First Amendment. I don’t recall whether I charged a small fee or whether I took the case pro
bono, but I put everything I had into my new found role as part time litigator on behalf of my
beloved First Amendment.

I decided on a bold challenge to the traditional power of the government to censor obscene
material—indeed to censor any “offensive” material shown only to people who aren’t offended by
it. Instead of arguing that the film itself was not obscene, I decided to argue that it was none of
the government’s constitutional business to act as a board of censors—to tell its adult citizens
what they could and could not watch in the privacy of a movie theater that was off limits to
children and that did not advertise in a pandering manner that would reasonably offend people
outside the theater. There was no legal binding precedent for such a challenge. Indeed the
Supreme Court had just recently reaffirmed the power of the government to ban and prosecute
obscenity, as an exception to the freedom of speech. In this respect, my bold and unprecedented
challenge was much like the one I helped Justice Goldberg devise against the death penalty, with
the difference being he was a Justice of the Supreme Court, while I was a novice lawyer litigating
my first case. What both challenges shared was a large dose of chutzpah. The leading case
affirming the power of government to censor porn was Roth v. United States. But in a more
recent case, Stanley v. Georgia, the court carved out an exception to the exception. A divided
court ruled, in an opinion by Justice Thurgood Marshall, that the state had no power to prosecute
an adult for merely possessing obscene material—in this case some old stag films—in the privacy
of his home. The ruling was a combination of 4 Amendment (the right of privacy in one’s home)
and 1 Amendment principles and was somewhat unclear about its reach, because it went out of
its way to reaffirm the holding in Roth that obscenity was not protected by the First Amendment.

I decided to try to use the Szan/ey case as a battering ram against the very idea that government
has the power to tell adults what films they could watch in a theater. The mechanism I chose for
this attack was to challenge the constitutionality of the Massachusetts obscenity statute under
which the owner of an art theater located across the street from the famous Boston Symphony
Hall was being prosecuted for showing J Am Curious Yellow.

In those days, a challenge to the constitutionality of a state statute could be brought in front of a
three judge district court with the right to appeal its ruling directly to the Supreme Court. The

Keynes saw slumps as investment deficits. I see them as return deficits. Keynes

The third choice Snowden made, and the choice that most effectively defined him to the public,
was to reveal himself as the man behind the leak in a video in Hong Kong. He not only
identified himself as the person who stole the government documents published by the Guardian
and Washington Post, but he incriminated himself further on camera by allowing Poitras to film
him actually disclosing NSA’s secret operations to Greenwald. By disclosing classified data to
Greenwald, an unauthorized person, he intentionally burned his bridges.

What makes this choice intriguing is that there was no evident need for him to expose himself
in this way. If he merely wanted to be a whistle-blower, he could have, as Bradley Manning did,
anonymously sent the documents to journalists as “Citizen 4.” In fact, in late May 2013, that was
exactly what he did. He sent Barton Gellman the PRISM scoop anonymously which the
Washington Post published on June 6, 2013. In that scoop, Snowden’s name was not revealed.
He also sent Greenwald and Poitras documents while he was still the anonymous source “Citizen
4.” Neither Gellman nor Greenwald had suggested the need for a face-to-face meeting with
Snowden. Even after he had revealed his true identity to Poitras and Greenwald on June 2™
2013, Guardian editor Ewen MacAskill offered him the option of remaining an unnamed source
for the stories. He said, as he later told Vanity Fair. “You should remain anonymous; the stories
are just as good without you.” However, anonymity was not part of Snowden’s long game.

The reason he gave Greenwald in Hong Kong for going public in this way was to avoid any
suspicion falling on his co-workers at the NSA. Yet, if merely wanted to take sole responsibility
for stealing state secrets, he did not need to be the subject of a documentary. He could have
simply allowed Greenwald to identify him by name as the source in the stories. That would not
present an issue since he had not been identified by either name or position in the initial stories
published on June 5 and 6 by Greenwald, Poitras and Gellman. In short, he did not act to defect
suspicion from his co-workers for the initial investigation. Why now?

The one thing that Snowden could not accomplish by anonymously transferring the
documents to journalists was a starring role in the drama. If he had appeared digitally-masked
in Poitras’ video with an altered voice, he would not achieve fame in the media. For that, he
needed to allow Poitras to film him committing the crime of turning over NSA documents to
Greenwald. This video was also the result of his advanced planning. Indeed, one reason he
chose Poitras was that she was a prize-winning/ documentary film-maker who had already made a
documentary about NSA whistle-blower William Binney. Snowden, while he was still working at
the NSA in March 2013, made it clear how he intended to use Poitras' film-making skills. He told
her: “My personal desire is that you paint the target directly on my back.”

He chose to make himself the on-camera star of a 20-hour long reality show. This sensational
footage would transform him in the public’s mind into a selfless hero. It would be a mistake to
assume that the central role he gave himself was an exercise in narcissism. It was an integral part
of his personal transformation. After this globally-watched video, he was no longer a near non-
entity servicing a computer system at a back-water NSA base in Hawaii. In the space of 12
minutes on television, he had emerged from the shadowy world of electronic intelligence and
became one of the most famous whistle-blowers in modern history. It was a mantle that would
allow him to also become a leading advocate of privacy and encryption rights as well the leading
opponent of NSA spying. While this remarkable transformation may not have been his entire
motive, it certainly was the result of the choice he made to go public.

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011663.txt,"My new posting came not just as momentum was building toward an
invasion. It followed on the heels of a major new crisis in our peace with Egypt.
Only weeks before I gave up my Sinai command, President Anwar Sadat was
shot and killed by an extremist Muslim officer at the annual Cairo military
parade to mark the anniversary of the 1973 war.

Like many Israelis, I felt an almost familial sense of bereavement. Sadat was
not just the first Arab leader to make peace with Israel. He seemed to
understand us: people who were ready, willing and able to fight, but wanted
above all to live unmolested and accepted by our neighbors. Yet for Begin and
the Likud, I knew the assassination would cast the whole peace process into
doubt. Sadat’s successor, Vice-President Hosni Mubarak, did make it clear he
would abide by the peace treaty, defusing calls on the Israeli right for us to
cancel our final withdrawal from the Sinai. But after Sadat’s killing, Begin and
those around him seemed more determined than ever to hold the line against the
wider peace negotiations agreed with President Carter and Sadat at Camp
David. At Begin’s insistence, Camp David had not proposed giving the
Palestinians a state, but instead “autonomy” and a locally elected “self-
governing authority”. Yet that was defined as a transitional period. The elected
Palestinians were to be included in negotiations for a yet-unspecified “final
status” arrangement for the West Bank and Gaza. That, Begin feared, left the
door ajar for something more than autonomy. Shutting that door, I would soon
discover, was a big part of Arik’s ornate reasoning for invading Lebanon.

Beyond the fact that my new job was a promotion, I had a personal reason
for welcoming the move back to Tel Aviv. Ten days after Sadat’s assassination,
I had endured a frightening few days surrounding the birth of our third daughter,
Anat. The crisis was another reminder that the demands of frontline command
rested not just on my shoulders, but my family’s. We had moved house again
early in Nava’s pregnancy, to the suburb of Ra’anana, about 10 miles north of
Tel Aviv and a few miles in from the coast. We bought one of a newly built row
of small, semi-detached townhouses which, best of all, had a backyard. It was
tiny by American standards, but was still a place for the girls to play. Once
again, however, I wasn’t there when my daughter was born. I was rushing north
as Nava went into labor.

The birth itself went smoothly. By the time I got to the hospital, both baby
and mother seemed happy and healthy. A few days later, however, when they
were back in the townhouse and I’d returned to my division, Nava felt suddenly,
desperately unwell. I shudder to think what might have happened were it not for

Chapter 7

Bullying the Neighbors: Frozen Conflicts,
the Near Abroad, and Other Innovations

Vladimir Putin's publicists have used the phrase
“sovereign democracy” to describe the political
system that evolved in Russia under his leadership.
In practice, however, Putin's regime respects neither
democracy nor sovereignty.

Sovereign democracy bears no more resemblance to
the unmodified original than did previous variants:
guided democracy, managed democracy, people's
democracy. Nor does sovereign democracy represent
a genuine commitment to the notion of national
sovereignty, as countries on the Russian periphery

will attest. On repeated occasions, Putin has demon-
strated a readiness to intervene in the affairs of nearby
countries by fomenting ethnic discontent, undermin-
ing the economy, or grabbing territory.

Putin has in effect set down a doctrine of limited
sovereignty for Russia's neighbors, especially those
that were part of the Soviet Union. The Kremlin's
tactics are meant to keep these countries fearful and
off balance. The instruments of choice range from

the nonviolent, such as destabilizing propaganda and
economic pressure, to the lethally aggressive, such as
proxy insurgencies and outright invasion.

The following are the main techniques employed by
the Kremlin to influence the actions of its neighbors:

1. Civil society and ‘traditional values’: The Krem-
lin has funded and encouraged pro-Russian civil
society organizations in neighboring states to

“Certainly within the next four to five
years [Russia] will have the ability
to conduct operations in eastern
Ukraine and pressure the Baltics

and pressure Georgia and do other
things, without having to do a full
mobilization.”

—U.S. Lieutenant General Ben Hodges

3. The energy weapon: At various times during Pu-
tin’s tenure, Russia has sought to use its oil and
natural gas exports as a means of disciplining
Ukraine and other neighbors. It has raised and
lowered prices for political reasons, abruptly
halted deliveries in the dead of winter, and ma-
nipulated pipeline routes and investments to
drive a wedge between Germany and other Eu-
ropean powers on one side and the Baltic states
and Ukraine on the other.

. The trade weapon: Russia has invoked dubious
health concerns and other pretexts to block
the import of products from countries whose
governments displease Putin, including Georgia,
Moldova, and Poland, as well as the European
Union (EU) as a bloc.®

5. Cyberwarfare: Russian-backed hackers are

build influence among local populations and
promote its policies and interests. The Russian
government has also exploited its partnership
with the Orthodox Church to present itself as a
champion of “traditional values,” and to portray
opponents—including human rights activists
and European democracies—as purveyors of
hedonism and immorality.’

. Propaganda offensives: The Kremlin has made
powerful use of Russian-language media, es-
pecially state-controlled television stations, to
spread disinformation and foment discontent
among ethnic Russians in the Baltics, Ukraine,
Moldova, and elsewhere.

widely believed responsible for a powerful 2007
cyberattack on government websites in Estonia
in the wake of a controversy over the removal of
a war memorial. Other countries in the region
have since suffered similar attacks, particularly
Ukraine following the 2014 ouster of President
Viktor Yanukovych and Russia’s invasion of
Crimea and the Donbas.

. Military threats: In the wake of the Ukraine inva-

sion and subsequent sanctions, the Russian mil-
itary launched a series of military exercises on
its borders with the Baltic states and intensified
more distant patrols that tested the readiness of
a number of European navies and air forces.

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023920.txt,"174 Teaching Minds

Rule #1: A teacher should never tell a student anything that the
teacher thinks is true. Now, on the surface this seems ridiculous.
How can you resist telling students the truth? Isn’t that your job as a
teacher? No. It isn’t.

Why not?

Because, in general, students wouldn't believe you anyway. Stu-
dents don’t take what teachers say as gospel. And, they tend not to
remember what you say. I have taught many a class and asserted X
only to be told minutes later that I had asserted not X. People don’t
listen very well. So what is the point of saying true things, besides
feeling good about having said something wise? The point certainly
isn’t teaching.

How will students learn what is true, then? By discovery. By fail-
ure. By repeated experience. By talking with people about what they
think and having to defend their claims. Not by listening to you.

Let’s consider mistake #2.

Mistake #2: Believing that a teacher’s job is assessment

What does this mean? In the real world, teaching and assessment
are usually conjoined. Teachers teach and they also give grades and
test. This is a problem. It is a problem because satisfying the teacher
becomes a goal of the student that tends to supersede learning, and it
is a problem because as the ultimate arbiter of truth, a teacher gets to
say what is true and students have to believe it. To fix this a teacher
needs to not be in this dual role.

This is easier said than done, of course. I used to tell students they
would get an Ano matter what they did as long as they handed in the
work that I asked for. This had the effect of having many students sign
up for an easy A and having the administration become annoyed with
how many A’s I gave out. Both of these outcomes were entirely pre-
dictable. But what I did, changed student behavior in the class greatly.

They often wrote about how much they wanted to please the
teacher and how once I took that out of the equation, how much
it changed their view as to why they were doing anything at all. For
some, it had a very bad effect. They just didn’t take the class seriously.
Others took it more seriously than ever because they were the judges
of their own work. (I asked them to defend their viewpoints to the
class during class time so their friends were also judges.)

Get to this Difficult Point?

USA Inc. Has Not Adequately Funded Its Entitlement Programs

Recessions come and go (and affect USA’s revenue), but future claims
(related to entitlement program commitments) on USA Inc. now
meaningfully exceed its projected cash flows.

For the last 40 years, management (the government) has committed
more long-term benefits through ‘entitlement’ programs like Medicaid /
Medicare / Social Security...without developing a sound plan to pay for
them.

Many of these programs provide important services to low-income,
unemployed, and disabled Americans in great need for help. But without
proper financing, support may dwindle.

USA Inc. Has Substantially Expanded

lts “Business Lines” Over Past 80 Years

From 1789 to 1930, 41%!‘ of USA Inc.’s cumulative
budget was dedicated to defense spending (compared
with 20%! in F2010), per the Census Bureau.

This began to change in the 1930s, when the federal
government substantially expanded its role (in effect,
expanded its “business lines”) in response to the Great
Depression.

Note: 1) 41% is the cumulative defense spending (excluding veterans’ benefits and services) as % of cumulative total federal
spending from 1789 to 1930. including veterans’ benefits and services, defense spending would have been 49% of cumulative
annual budget from 1789 to 1930 and would have been 22% in F2009. Source: Census Bureau, “Historical Statistics of the

the warning to evildoers in Romans 13:4, that God had appointed ministers on earth to carry out
his wrath against them. He believed it was his mission to conduct “search and destroy”
operations against the porno industry. As a prosecutor of pornography, he had already secured
more than forty convictions.

Many observers saw the decision to bring Reems to trial as evidence of Parrish’s creativity. Asa
Memphis lawyer, familiar with Parrish, put it: “Parrish figured that putting an actor on trial was
the way to get publicity [and] a man is less likely to pick up public sympathy than a woman.”
Parrish acknowledged that his purpose in prosecuting Reems was to made it clear that no one
involved with a porno film was immune from criminal liability.

Reems came to see me after he had been convicted and was facing years in prison. He wanted me
to argue his appeal. He told me he had no money and asked me to take his case on a pro bono
basis. I agreed. I told him I preferred not to watch the film and explained to him my theory of
“choice” and “externalities,” but assured him that I would make every argument that had any
chance of freeing him.

There’s an old saying that goes this way: “If you have the law on your side, bang on the law. If
you have the facts on your side, bang on the facts. If you have neither the law nor the facts on
your side, bang on the table.” I have never believed that, but I do believe in a variation on that
theme: If you don’t have the law or legal facts on your side, argue your case in the court of
public opinion. In the Reems case, the Memphis jury had rejected Reems’ factual defense, and the
judge had rejected his legal defense. The Supreme Court had rejected my “choice” and
“externality” approach. I continued to believe, however, that the broader general public, or at
least the most influential segment of the public, would be sympathetic to my libertarian approach
to obscenity and free speech, especially in the context of an actor who was being prosecuted.
Reems, to be sure, was not Helen Hayes or Marlin Brando, but to make the point that the
principle was the same, we adopted the following slogan: “Harry Reems today, Helen Hayes
tomorrow.” We made a determined effort to elicit support from the mainstream entertainment
industry and from the media.

We succeeded in getting The New York Times to cover the case. Its initial story told how the
Reems prosecution was first seen “as a joke,” but is now being understood “as a very serious
issue”:
With Mr. Dershowitz as the lead lawyer and the American Civil Liberties Union and other
prominent groups and individual prepared to help, Mr. Reems has some of the country’s
most impressive legal talent working on his appeal.
He also has the support of some of the country’s best known entertainers: Colleen
Dewhurst, Ben Gazzaza, Mike Nichols, Stephen Soundheim...Warren Beatty, Jack
Nicholson and Gregory Peck.

As Mr. Dershowitz interprets the Deep Throat case, “Any person who participates in any
way in the creation, production, editing or distribution of a sexually explicit film,

playing field. Solow saw most of the truth, but didn’t go far enough. Mill saw more.
And even Mill stopped short. All we have to do is look at the charts and tables.
Capital accumulation does not exist. Any attempt lowers consumption with no

growth to show for it.

Keep track of national wealth including human capital by my method here, and also
by Petty’s of 1664, 1676 and 1685. What would we think of corporate management
that added up only the smaller part of corporate assets? We now consider physical
capital only. Political parties debate what taxes and the national debt should be

without the key facts.

Policy prescriptions can also aim at schools and what they teach. Macroeconomics
should start over. It reached most of its present form in the “years of high theory”, in
the 1920s through 1950s, without the concepts of human capital or market-valued
capital. It is founded on the inaccurate Y = C + I equation and the concomitant belief
that output equals pay plus profit. It recognizes ex ante — ex post distinctions only
crudely as to saving, by taking it as either invested or uninvested, and not at all as to
investment itself. By missing the lag between market effects and book reaction, it

misreads some of our worst years as our best and conversely.

The path forward is omnibus funds and devolution of commercial banks. Bank
reform along the lines I suggested should need no help from lawmakers. But for
gosh sakes, let’s not set up barriers against it. Commercial banks and 10:1 leverage
make slumps inevitable. Crashes are as sure as death and taxes until we phase them

out.

Snowden to come to Russia. Putin’s s decision no doubt set in motion the operation to exfiltrate
him on Aeroflot, the state-controlled airline.

We know that the Russian government acted in advance to facilitate Snowden’s trip from Hong
Kong. Without such an intervention, it would not be possible for an American without an entry
visa to Russia, or, for that matter, any other country to check-in and board an Aeroflot flight to
Moscow. Aeroflot had to be instructed to allow Snowden on the plane without a visa. We also
know that a special operation was mounted to take Snowden off the plane once it landed in
Moscow. Such an operation could not have been done without advance planning. Nor would he
be removed from the plane without a plan for his stay in Russia. Since Putin himself has taken
credit for authorizing Snowden’s trip to Russia, there is no reason to doubt that these plans, and
whatever cover stories were deemed necessary, were approved at the highest level of the regime.

When an intelligence service makes such elaborate preparations for extracting a foreign
intelligence worker, it presumably also expects to debrief him or her on arrival. Pelton, for
example, who had access to far less valuable information than had Snowden, was held
incommunicado in Vienna for two weeks during his debriefing. What would be inconceivable
would be for an intelligence service to go to such lengths to bring a potential espionage source
such as Snowden to Russia and allow him to catch the next plane to Latin America. The false
report provided to the press that Snowden was flying to Latin America was likely nothing more
than a cover story to confuse foreign observers while he was receiving his initial debriefing and
evaluation.

When it comes to the esoteric enterprise of reconstructing the work of U.S. signals intelligence,
military as well as civilian experts in cryptology, computer sciences and communications are
necessary. Unlike in the case of Pelton, Snowden had secret material in his possession, at least
according to Anatoly Kucherena. Even if Russian intelligence had already acquired copies of his
electronic files prior to Snowden’s arrival in Moscow, Snowden’s interpretation of them would be
part of the debriefing since intelligence data needs to put in context. “This debriefing could not be
done overnight,” according to a former high-ranking officer in the GRU, the Russian military
intelligence service. “There is no way that Snowden would not be fully debriefed,” he said. He
also said GRU specialists in signal intelligence would be called in.

We know that the Putin regime paid a significant price in terms of the cancellation of the pre-
Olympics summit with Obama. Having to accept the onus of declining relations with the Obama
administration, it is hard to believe that it didn’t attempt to get the bonus of signals intelligence
from Snowden. The GRU, SVR and other Russian intelligence services would not be denied the
opportunity to y question Snowden until to all they had squeezed out of him whatever state
secrets he had or knew during the 38 days that he had vanished from public sight. Since
Snowden was rewarded with sanctuary, a residence and body guards, there is no reason to doubt
that he satisfactorily accommodated his interrogators. While he might elect to continue believing
that he a whistle-blower true to his ideals, as far as Russian intelligence was concerned, he was an
espionage source. /

For an intelligence service, the game is not over when it obtains state secrets. It still needs to
fog over the extent of its coup, as far as possible, to prolong the value of the espionage. Hence it
is plausible that the story that Snowden had thoroughly destroyed all his data he stolen the prior
month prior to departing for Russia as well as the story that he had turned down all requests to be
questioned by the FSB and other Russian intelligence officials were part of his legend. The
repetitions of these uncorroborated claims in his press interviews also may have enhanced his
public image for the ACLU effort to get clemency for him. Even so, in view of the importance of

Obviously, I'm sharing what follows on the assumption that everything here is just between us. 
The thesis of the Times piece is that the rich and their corporations have SO much power 
that we no longer live in a democracy. 
Can we the people make change? Not really. 
Who can? The rich and powerful. 
Huh? All they want is the status quo. Or more. 
But they could --- okay, its not likely, but they could --- turn on the bad actors at their social/economic level. 
For example: Wall Street CEOs, donors to the Tea Party, etc. 
That's the topic. Shaming. Shunning. 
One of the people I deal with --- there are several others. --- is Jeffrey Epstein. 
Reading the clips, I don't see that Jeffrey as been shunned.

I read: 
The crowd at the events top publicist Peggy Siegal has organized for Epstein proves the point, at least behind closed doors. I and 
many others that know him describe him as brilliant, says Siegal. 
His unique mind is what attracts the world's smartest people to his home. Last September, with Siegal's help, Epstein hosted a Break 
Fast after Yom Kippur. A group of 120 friends brought their children over for a buffet dinner 
This was just a few months after he finished his prison obligations in Florida. 
And here he is, entertaining --- with children present. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031694 
This Break Fast is one of a number of social events involving post-prison Jeffrey that attracted celebrated, powerful people. 
Of course I have zero idea who said, NO WAY and didn't cross his doorway. 
My questions are: 
1) I You have known him for decades, were/are friends, etc. 
Why was your reaction to his crimes to continue being his friend --- and not in a covert way? 
2) What would he have had to do for you to shun him --- to cut him out of your life? 
You're the ultimate professional; you may not want to respond. 
Especially because I'm NOT reaching out to anyone else who's named in the piece. 
I don't care about them.

Some people do yoga on vacation; others go for the occasional run. This week we're thinking a little more... adventurously, from active escapes at Travaasa Hana in Maui to racecar driving in Baja and hiking Moab with the experts at Austin-Lehman Adventures. And after all that action, chill out with stays at the new Dream South Beach, the gorgeous Pavilions Phuket and other luxe resorts worldwide. (Image: The Pavilions Phuket - on sale Fri, July 31.)

Dream South Beach

	This South Beach newcomer lives up to the hype. Set in two landmark Art Deco buildings on Collins Avenue, right behind the former Versace Mansion, the boutique hotel has 108 sleek guestrooms washed in blue and white, and access to soft, sandy beaches, a restaurant helmed by chef Geoffrey Zakarian and a hip rooftop pool scene.

Maui's Memorable Journey

Travaasa Hana - Hawaii

 
 <http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=c046fbc079dcd8524f9fd039c2647ed43b9a873948a29725ad2484950b04b6867c7e34f49484da85>  
 
	
	Reinvented from the former Hotel Hana Maui, the brand new Travaasa Hana combines - in concept and name - travel and pravaasa (memorable journey in Sanskrit). The mix of adventure, relaxation and truly experiencing a destination are hallmarks of Travaasa. With the beauty of Hana, Hawaii, all around, it's hard to imagine a better marriage of purpose and place.

	It's rare to find a luxury resort as down to earth as this Condé Nast Traveler Hot List alum. Sitting on 50 wild acres of jungle by the beach, this striking Italian-style villa has white sand-colored interiors that match the serene beach outside. The Duchess of Ferrari originally built this tropical hideaway on Mexico's fabled Yucatan Peninsula in the early 1990s to entertain her globetrotting friends. It has since been remade as a 29-room boutique wonder, where that local culture is so intrinsic to the design that it can be found in the minutest details.

Hotel Las Palmas - Mexico

	On a nine-mile stretch of Playa Blanca, just 20 minutes from downtown Zihuatanejo, Hotel Las Palmas is unique escape between lush rain forest and the open Pacific Ocean. All 10 suites were individually designed by Enrique Zozaya in a sleek, modern-tropical style and capture the unspoiled views on private terraces and balconies. With the soaring Sierra Madre del Sur mountains in the distance and sleepy fishing village of Barra de Potosi close by, the Hotel Las Palmas is a true barefoot hideaway in a quintessentially Mexican setting.

Minimalism to the Max in Long Beach

AVIA Hotel - Long Beach, CA

	There's a lot to love in Long Beach. It's the sixth largest city in California (with nearly half a million people), one half of the western hemisphere's largest port, and it's finally coming into its own as a magnet for travelers. The modern, 138-room AVIA Hotel sits at the epicenter of all the action. And the cheery Long Beach lovers staffing the property are happy to highlight the best of the city.

	It's hard to imagine, but true: Summer will slip away before you know it. Which means it's time for a mini-getaway to one of your favorite cities. And this is the time to go - the streets are quieter, the parks are in bloom and concerts, movies and performances are staged nearly every day. We've got last-minute availability at the Landmark London and three Manhattan standouts: the elegant Hôtel Plaza Athénée, the family-friendly Roger Williams and the über-sleek Thompson LES. Choosing can be tough when the options are so good.

	Located 20 minutes north of Miami Beach in the heart of Aventura, Fairmont Turnberry Isle Resort & Club mixes country club charm with the sleek styling of a boutique hotel. The 392-room property is home to two Raymond Floyd-designed golf courses and the Laguna Pool, which features a water slide, a lazy river and cabanas outfitted with TVs and refrigerators (this is Miami, after all). With its family-friendly vibe, Turnberry Isle falls somewhere between Grossinger's in the Catskills (at its legendary height) and a posh island resort.

	In the city's former stock exchange building, the 306-room Sofitel is retrofitted with streamlined rooms and an intimate brasserie. This Philadelphia gem is where French and American style come together - think Shaker quilts next to spacious marble bathrooms - in the French Quarter of an All-American destination.

	Epic renderings of sandstone and the frothy beauty of the Colorado River form the backdrop for Austin-Lehman's six-day exploration of the Utah desert in and around its fabled adventure capital, Moab. Guests hop on bicycles, bound down the river in rafts, clamber into 4x4s, and, of course, hike into some of the most jaw-dropping geology on the planet. Evenings are as relaxing as the days are active, with a fixed homebase - a lodge set against red-rock cliffs that happens to have its own winery.

	Known as Napa of the North, Canada's Okanagan region is a year-round retreat east of Vancouver. The area is home to award-winning wineries, Canada's warmest lake and a stunning desert landscape fit for golfing virtually every day of the year. With exceptional service and Pueblo-style architecture, Spirit Ridge Vineyard Resort & Spa is just as much a hotel for oenophiles looking to unwind as it is for golf fanatics and families looking to take advantage of mild weather and myriad activities.

	Near swank shops and Houston's art-gallery scene, the Hotel Derek is designed to feel like a superhip home, with 60s-style settees, English wingback chairs and cowhide rugs. The hotel works on the assumption that its guests have the same qualities as the fictional host, Derek: worldliness, a sense of humor and an eye for beauty.

	It starts with a grand entrance: You'll walk in on a three-story staircase as wide as an IMAX screen. A double-sided fireplace and baby grand piano jazz up the lobby while Technicolor furnishings like cherry-red sofas and silver wallpaper add to the whimsical vibe. The Allegro, a Kimpton hotel, is a vibrant example of boutique-style hospitality in Chicago that playfully tips its hat to old-world glamour without ever taking itself too seriously.

	In the mountainous north of the country, just over an hour from Porto, the recently opened Vidago Palace has, in one fell swoop, raised the bar for luxury getaways in Portugal. As far removed from the sun and sand of the touristy Algarve as you can get, this is a destination for the discerning traveler and the lover of fine things, whether they be cigars, hand-painted silk wallpaper, the country's best spa or a championship golf course.

	With 285 rooms, Crete's Candia Maris beachfront resort is large by Greek hotel standards. It shares the space between the large and airy guestrooms, a choice of restaurants and a host of activities, whatever your interest. Waterbabies will love the seven pools and sybarites can camp out in the resort's Thalassotherapy spa. Overlooking Amoudara beach just outside Heraklion, the resort underwent a top-to-bottom renovation five years ago, adding modern style and amenities to this uber-resort.

	Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda made this elegant B&B famous in the 1981 film On Golden Pond, but three decades later the 13-acre estate on Squam Lake remains a revered and romantic New Hampshire countryside escape. With unbeatable views of the White Mountains, Manor on Golden Pond has distinctive guestrooms - from the Cotswold Cottage to the Canterbury Manor - plus all the trappings of a sophisticated inn, with the English heritage to back it up.

	Grenada is known as the most gregarious of the Caribbean islands, and Maca Bana, on a secluded cove on the Point Salines peninsula, represents a microcosm of that, from the general manager to the gardener. The boutique villa hotel (appropriately named after a tree in the indigenous Arawak language) has an infinity pool and beachside restaurant to entertain, plus each villa has a deck with a private hot tub. And even though the resort is just five minutes from the airport, it feels worlds away.

	With room decor by Ralph Lauren, Round Hill is a true standout among the properties along the northwest coast of Jamaica. High-end yet relaxed, it has sprawling grounds and a full-service attitude that invites total indulgence for guests. It's also got awe-inspiring views of the Caribbean from the rooms, restaurants and infinity pool, where visitors feel as if they're literally floating in the sea.

	Skilled in the art of seduction, the Fairmont Royal Pavilion was one of the first great beach hotels to open on Barbados. Refreshed by a major 2010 renovation, this graceful Colonial-style estate makes the most of its location - by day guests swim, sail and cavort along the powdery beach or simply enjoy the views from a private terrace overlooking the water. And by night, one of the island's most elegant tables will be available, where dinner is served with the serenading sounds of the surf.

	This six-day journey with Momentum Adventure explores the wild, stark landscape of the Baja Peninsula, and balances adrenaline-infused outings with relaxation at the iconic One&Only Palmilla. Navigate a Baja Challenger racecar through sand washes, cactus forests and lone beaches; score a hole-in-one at a Jack Nicklaus-designed golf course; and fish for blue marlins in a yacht off the shore. Come evening, sip tequila in a breezy villa that overlooks the Sea of Cortez.

	Over the last decade, Siem Reap, the gateway to Cambodia's magnificent temples of Angkor Wat, has morphed from a dusty backpacker hangout to a picturesque town filled with an array of five-star hotels, artsy boutiques and restaurants oozing with ambience. Service here is some of the finest and friendliest in the region, a trait nowhere more evident than at the all-suite Alila Sothea. The hotel's regal 39 rooms, which surround a glittering slate-and-gold-leaf-tiled pool, offer a tranquil, resort-like atmosphere that's rich with local culture and just 20 minutes by car from Angkor.

	The best part of staying at the Anantara Bophut - besides the fact that it's on a beautiful Koh Samui beach - is the activities menu, which keeps every type of traveler entertained. Spend mornings windsurfing or learning Thai kickboxing, and afternoons cooking authentic regional dishes or snorkeling in the Gulf of Thailand. If you're craving some slothful downtime, relax next to the giant lagoon-style infinity pool or in the blissful spa.

	Though it's just steps from Bangkok's best shopping malls (and the city's notorious traffic-thronged streets), the Siam Kempinski Hotel Bangkok manages to provide a tranquil getaway that feels miles from the city's chaos. Capitalizing on the hotel brand's European roots, the design is an artful blend of Art Deco accents and Thai flourishes. In 303 rooms, huge beds, baths and work/lounge areas provide ample space to recharge, while the amenities - a pool area, a spa and one of the city's best restaurants - offer plenty of excuses to stay close to home.

	Named for James Madison, the fourth president and father of the Constitution, this stately hotel has traditional style and refined service to match - plus, a location that puts many of Washington's must-see museums and monuments along the National Mall within walking distance. Opened in 1963, the 353-room hotel has hosted the Dalai Lama, the occasional celebrity and every U.S. president since John F. Kennedy except Barack Obama. Not to worry - you can stop by the White House, just five blocks away.

	With 438 newly renovated cream-and-beige rooms (thoughtful details include iPod docks and air purifiers), a quiet and plush restaurant that serves locally-inspired Southern dishes and a beautifully manicured 9,000-square-foot Japanese garden, the Grand Hyatt Atlanta makes a tranquil retreat in the heart of the city's Buckhead District. This is the shopping mecca of the South, so boutiques, plus lots of award-winning restaurants, are all just steps away.

Subject: Re:

this was just tweeted by famous saudi opposition @mujtahidd.. almost 2 million followers.. 
#Trump MBS scandal involving President @realDonaldTrump and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman... 
Following @realDonaldTrump's visit to SA, US stance on Saudi affairs changed especially on competition 
between MBS & MBN and Qatar siege. 
MBS = Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman (de facto King) 
MBN = Mohammad bin Nayef (deposed Saudi Crown Prince and Interior Minister) 
Prior to @realDonaldTrump, US institutions stood firmly with MBN throughout Obama's presidency. This was 
reaffirmed in a letter to the King. 
After @realDonaldTrump's Riyadh visit, he changed the US stance on the MBS v MBN power struggle and 
forced the establishment to back MBS. 
Past US administrations were keen on avoiding strife within GCC: This is because American interests cannot be 
upheld without a harmonic GCC. 
That was until @realDonaldTrump's return from Saudi upon which Qatar siege began and he openly supported 
it contradicting Defence&State Dept 
That was until @realDonaldTrump's return from Saudi upon which Qatar siege began and he openly supported 
it contradicting Defence&State Dept 
More bizarrely; MBS has a secure direct line to Trump like no other leader has - not even Israeli Netanyahu & 
British May... 
The following story explains MBS's 'special' influence over @realDonaldTrump - even if it means 
compromising America's national interests... 
During @realDonaldTrump's Riyadh visit in May 2017 a private yacht discreetly arrived at Jeddah Port; heavily 
guarded and identity hidden. 
Even the Port's authorities were not allowed near it. Only a number of individuals reached it - delivering several 
boxes of cash ($1bn USD). 
After loading the boxes, the yacht disappeared. The operation lasted hours & was kept secret as was yacht's 
identity, origin and destination 
It transpired from MBS's inner circles that the $ lbn was from MBS himself & the yacht belonged indirectly to 
@Trump Organisation. #Trump MBS

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011675.txt,"Tunisia. Arafat himself left on August 30.

Still, as the evacuation proceeded, another one of Arik’s central aims in Big
Pines was also achieved. On August 23, the Lebanese parliament elected Bashir
Gemayel as the country’s new president.

During the several weeks that followed, there was a confident feeling among
Arik and his inner circle in the Airya. To the extent that Arik and Raful saw any
cloud on the horizon, it was their concern about “several thousand” Palestinian
fighters who they were certain had stayed on in Beirut despite the evacuation.
True, Bashir Gemayel hadn’t been formally inaugurated as president. There had
been reports that he was privately assuring Lebanese Muslim leaders that he
would be conciliatory once he took office, and that he was not about to consider
a formal peace with Israel. He had also been resisting Israeli efforts to make an
early, public show of friendship, such as an official visit to meet Prime Minister
Begin. But there was an undisguised hope that this was just a brief political
hiatus, for appearance’s sake, and that before too long Lebanon would become
the second Arab country to make peace with Israel. Not just peace, but
something more nearly like an alliance.

Though I still looked through the eyes of an army officer, not a politician
and certainly not an experienced diplomat, I had serious doubts this would
happen. Simple logic seemed to suggest that, since Gemayel knew we had no
realistic option of turning our back on him, his political interests were best
served by keeping his distance and trying to build bridges at home. But on the
early evening of September 14, nine days before his scheduled inauguration, not
just that question but the whole new political edifice Arik had envisaged in
launching the invasion, became suddenly, irretrievably, irrelevant.

I was at my desk on the third floor of the kirya, getting ready to go home,
when the news broke: a huge bomb had exploded at the Phalangist Party
headquarters in east Beirut as Gemayel was beginning to address hundreds of
supporters. For a while, the reports from Beirut suggested that Gemayel had
survived the blast, but shortly before eleven at night the confirmation came: the
president-elect was dead.

Certain tax risks relating to an investment in the Fund are discussed in Section XI “Certain Tax
& ERISA Considerations”, which prospective investors should read carefully. No assurances
can be given that current tax laws, rulings and regulation will not be changed during the life of
the Fund. Prospective Limited Partners should consult their tax advisors for further
information about the tax consequences of purchasing a Limited Partner Interest in the Fund.

Withholding and Other Taxes

The General Partner intends to structure the Fund’s investments in a manner that is intended to
achieve the Fund’s investment objectives and, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, there can be no assurance that the structure of any investment will be tax efficient for
any particular investor or that any particular tax result will be achieved. In addition, tax
reporting requirements may be imposed on investors under the laws of the jurisdictions in
which investors are liable to taxation or in which the Fund makes portfolio investments.
Prospective investors should consult their own professional advisors with respect to the tax
consequences to them of an investment in the Fund under the laws of the jurisdiction in which
they are liable to taxation. Furthermore, the Fund’s returns in respect of its investments may be
reduced by withholding or other taxes imposed by jurisdictions in which the Fund’s portfolio
companies are organized.

Confidential Information

The Partnership Agreement will contain confidentiality provisions intended to protect
proprietary and other information relating to the Fund and the Fund’s portfolio companies. To
the extent that such information is publicly disclosed, competitors of the Fund and/or
competitors of its portfolio companies, and others, may benefit from such information, thereby
adversely affecting the Fund, its portfolio companies and the General Partner and the economic
interests of Limited Partners.

Written Agreements

The Fund, the General Partner and the Management Company will be authorized, without the
approval of any Limited Partner, to enter into side letters or similar written agreements with
Limited Partners that have the effect of establishing rights under, or altering or supplementing
the terms of this Memorandum, the Partnership Agreement, such Limited Partner’s
Subscription Agreement or other related agreements. The ability of other Limited Partners to
receive copies of and/or elect to receive the benefit of such side agreements will be limited.

Market volatility

Since 2008, the capital, credit and securities markets have been experiencing unprecedented
levels of volatility and disruption. Ongoing volatility could negatively impact the Fund in a
number of ways. Many of the investments purchased, held and sold on behalf of the Fund may
be complex, and their market values will be highly sensitive to market changes. Overall Fund
returns may be reduced as relatively small changes in the capital, credit or securities markets
may have significant impacts on the profitability of Fund investments. In addition, the U.S.
Congress and regulatory agencies may adopt new financial regulations and tax policies in
response to continued volatility, which could restrict the Fund’s investment options and be
otherwise unfavorable to the Fund.

Jeffrey Epstein address book 'Holy Grail’ of famous names
By MICHELE DARGAN
DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER
Updated: 7:58 p.m. Friday, March 11, 2011
Posted: 7:57 p.m. Friday, March 11, 2011
When talking about the personal address book of billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the term “little black book”
takes that phrase to a whole new level.
Manhattan money manager Epstein’s book reads like a laundry list of the world’s richest and most powerful people,
including some Palm Beachers.
Referred to as “The Holy Grail” by Epstein’s former house manager — now serving time for trying to sell it to attorneys —
the 97-page address book details multiple addresses, phone numbers, e-mails and other contact information for former
President Bill Clinton, Britain’s Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, Donald Trump, Sen. John Kerry, various members
of the Kennedy clan and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, among many others.
The British press has been having a field day digging up new details about Epstein’s friendship with Prince Andrew.
Virginia Roberts — known only as Jane Doe 102 in court papers — has been dishing her story to London’s Daily Mail.
Details include Roberts having been in the company of the prince three times at Epstein’s behest.
Roberts also recounted meeting Clinton on Epstein’s private Caribbean island, according to the Mail.
But Roberts made no suggestion of sexual relations with Prince Andrew or with Clinton, the Mail reported. Similarly,
there is no suggestion of anything salacious with any of the Palm Beachers listed among the money manager’s contacts.
Roberts — who spent four years with Epstein — refers to him as “a monster” who paid her lavishly to satisfy his and his
friends sexual whims — although Roberts doesn’t identify the friends.
British papers also have reported that Ferguson accepted £15,000 from Epstein. The money was paid to her former
assistant, who claimed Ferguson owed him unpaid wages and other bills. Ferguson has since told the Mail and other
British papers that she made “a gigantic error of judgment” in accepting the money from Epstein and that she will pay
him back.
The entire “Grail” was made public as part of a pending civil court case in which Epstein is suing attorney Brad Edwards,
who represented several underage girls who sued Epstein.
Epstein sued Edwards, alleging he was involved in false claims made by Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein; Edwards
countersued Epstein, saying he filed a frivolous lawsuit to get him to back down from representing the young women.
All the lawsuits against Epstein said his modus operandi in the initial visit was the same: The girls were taken to
Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion and led upstairs to a spa room by one of Epstein’s assistants, where he would ask the
girls to perform sexually charged massages and/or various sex acts, for which he would pay them.
Other high-profile names in Epstein’s book include Special Envoy for Middle East Peace George Mitchell, New York City
Mayor Michael Bloomberg, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Barbara Walters, Alec Baldwin, Ralph Fiennes, George
Hamilton, Dustin Hoffman, Kevin Spacey, Liz Hurley, Lauren Hutton, Janice Dickinson, Naomi Campbell, Christy
Turlington, Henry Kissinger, Joan Rivers, Courtney Love, Mick Jagger, Cornelia Guest, Phil Collins, Itzhak Perlman,
Simon LeBon, Charlie Rose, Richard Branson, playwright Candace Bushnell, designers Tom Ford and Vera Wang, soap
opera actress Nadia Bjorlin and erotic film star Koo Stark, who once dated Prince Andrew.
Among the high-powered Palm Beachers listed in the money manager’s address book are Catherine and Fred Adler,
Samantha and Serena Boardman, Jimmy and Jane Buffett, Pepe Fanjul, Conrad and Barbara Black, Gerry Goldsmith,
Marjorie Gubelman, Dana Hammond, David Koch, Henry Kravis, Frayda and George Lindemann Sr., Bob and Todd
Meister, Alfred Taubman, Stanley, Bea and Brett Tollman, and Martin Trust.
Gaston Cantens, a spokesman for Florida Crystals Corp., said Fanjul and Epstein “obviously knew each other and had
some contact in the past. But there isn’t any ongoing business or social relationship with Mr. Epstein.”
Reached by phone at his Palm Beach home, media mogul Black said he knew Epstein as “a friend of my colleague Mr.
Wexner.”
Les Wexner, CEO of The Limited Brands, was reported to have been Epstein’s biggest client and close friend. Wexner
replaced Epstein as his money manager, according to recent reports.
Some of the names in Epstein’s book are sub-listed under geographic locations. The heading “massage” is notated
under many of Epstein’s locations. Names and phone numbers, most of them first names only, are listed under the
massage entries.
Registered as a level 3 sex offender, Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting underage girls for sex at his El Brillo Way home
in Palm Beach. In addition to serving 13 months of an 18-month jail sentence, Epstein has settled at least two dozen
lawsuits with young women for undisclosed amounts.

Series that determines the winner. The real determination is made by
newspapers, or parents who want their kids to apply there, or poten-
tial donors. But the battle is real enough.

This battle was dead serious before U.S. News and World Report
started publishing annual rankings. Now, it is the basis of how the
university functions. When the current president was recruited at
Northwestern, he essentially was told that his job was to get North-
western into the top ten (in the U.S. News rankings). Northwestern was
ranked 12th or 13th at this time. In his first year he succeeded. Why?
Because Northwestern’s football team won the Big Ten title and went
to the Rose Bowl. Of course, he had nothing to do with that. But the
following year applications doubled (or something like that) and that
is a Statistic that U.S. News uses, so presto, we were number nine. It
didn’t last. Neither did it make sense.

Recruiting me was like winning the Rose Bowl. Well, all right, not
really. But a member of the Board of Trustees actually did say to me
when he met me: “It’s our star quarterback.” I brought in money and
prestige. It is natural to wonder who actually got the money that An-
dersen offered and what was done with it and why it was given out,
and, while we are at it, what exactly it was I did all day if I didn’t teach.

First the university’s share. Every dollar of that $30 million went
into Northwestern’s bank account. Then they let me spend it accord-
ing to certain rules. The first rule is called “overhead.” The university
charges an overhead rate on all contracts. The actual percentage varies
and one of the first things I had to negotiate with Northwestern was
how much their take would be. I don’t remember exactly now, but
they got about 30% of what I brought in. So, about $9 million of this
money went into Northwestern’s pocket. Do you see now why they
didn’t care how much I taught? They just wanted me there and they
wanted that money. By the way, they also got the interest on all the
money.

They also got the prestige. I set up a new institute that became in-
stantly well known and was something the university could brag about.
The Institute for the Learning Sciences was something unique. North-
western had one and no one else did. Moreover, I might (and did) raise
even more money for my institute. More overhead money. Yippee!

What did I do with the money? Mostly what you can do with
this money is hire people. If you have a research agenda, something
you want to build or accomplish, you will need help. If you want to
build a rocket ship that no one has ever built before, you will need to

efforts to either (i) limit investment in the Fund by “benefit plan investors” to a level that would
not be considered “significant” under ERISA, or (ii) operate the Fund as a VCOC, or (iii) operate

Reporting

Benefit plan investors may be required to report certain compensation paid by the Fund (or by
third parties) to the Fund’s service providers as “reportable indirect compensation” on Schedule
C to the Form 5500 Annual Return (the “Form 5500”). To the extent any compensation
arrangements described herein constitute reportable indirect compensation, any such

Donald J. Trump proudly acknowledges he did not pay a dime in federal income taxes for years on end. He
insists he merely exploited tax loopholes legally available to any billionaire — loopholes he says Hillary
Clinton failed to close during her years in the United States Senate. “Why didn’t she ever try to change

But newly obtained documents show that in the early 1990s, as he scrambled to stave off financial ruin,

Theory is a subject. Practice in a field means exercising the twelve
cognitive processes we have been referring to, and because of that,
progress is much harder to ascertain. You can test theory. It is harder
to test practice. One can gain a lot of knowledge about what doesn’t
work while practicing and still produce nothing worthwhile. The les-
sons learned are harder to assess. Teaching theory makes all teachers
more comfortable. Of course, theory means there is no doing, so no
one really learns much. After they pass the test, they can forget what
they learned with no consequences.

There is a big difference between knowing that and knowing how.
Schools have always emphasized knowing that. The primary reason
for this is that the stuff you can say you know is testable. But knowing
how is much more important. So we worry that students don’t know
that George Washington was president, without asking what the use of
that knowledge is. There may be a use for that knowledge. It is doesn’t
come to me immediately what that use would be, but let’s assume
there is some use for that knowledge for your average student. If so,
that knowledge should be taught within the context in which it might
be used. There is, for example, a use of that knowledge for construct-
ing a history paper about the origins of the United States. Of course,
that itself may not be a useful exercise. In the context of doing that
exercise, assuming there was good justification for it, that knowledge
would be naturally learned. Natural learning of factual knowledge,
learning it when it comes up, is fine, as long as it isn’t being learned so
that it can be tested. It is much more useful to learn knowledge when
that knowledge enables you to do something, however.

There are endless books about what every 3rd-grader must
know that use the idea that factual knowledge is the basis of
the ability to read as their justification. Unfortunately, the writers
of these tracts have misunderstood the cognitive science behind
those statements. It is difficult to read things when you don’t un-
derstand what they are about. But it does not follow from that,
that the solution is to ram that knowledge down kids’ throats and
then have them read. It is much more clever to have them read
about what they know and to gradually increase their knowledge
through stories that cause them to have to learn more in order to
make the stories understandable to them. In that case, the learning
is in context and thus more natural.

through Russian television stations. On a daily basis,
they are exposed to propagandistic programs in which
the EU is demonized, NATO is treated as an aggressor,
the democracies on Russia's borders are presented as
enemies, and the annexation of Crimea is hailed as a
milestone in the rebuilding of a great Russian state.®

By exploiting the tensions that already exist between
Estonia's ethnic communities, the Kremlin has sought
to turn a complex problem into something combus-
tible. The tendency of Russian speakers and ethnic
Estonians to live in parallel universes is exacerbated
by Russian propaganda, which depicts the Estonian
political leadership as hostile to Russians and as
members of a cosmopolitan European elite that
promotes sexual degeneracy and cultural radicalism.
Moscow also tries to create distrust of the Baltic
states among their NATO allies by depicting them as
overly emotional, irresponsible, and intent on dragging
other countries into a conflict with Russia.

There is no strong evidence that Russian speakers in
Estonia are simply embracing the Russian explanation
of things. Instead, they tend to reject both Russian
and Estonian sources of information. This is in itself

a victory of sorts for Russia, since the goal of external
Russian propaganda is less to win people over to its
way of thinking than to sow confusion and mistrust.
oscow’s interests are served so long as Estonian so-
ciety remains divided. As a report on the integration of
Russian speakers in Estonia concluded, “They [ethnic
Estonians and Russian speakers] reside in separate in-
formation spaces and hold divergent perceptions and
perspectives not just about each other, but also about
the Estonian state and its history, its threat environ-
ment, and its national security policies. Since these
two Estonias do not fully trust one another, when
security developments put pressure on the country
they tend to drift to opposing poles—especially if the
factor of Russia is involved.”*

Awolf in sheep's clothing

n their campaign to assert control over countries on
Russias periphery, Kremlin officials have not hesitated
to use traditional authoritarian methods, up to and
including military invasion and the creation or support
of proxy insurgents. But they have taken care to
defend their efforts in terms meant to appeal to, or at
least confuse, democratic audiences.

This is especially the case with propaganda broadcasts.
While the Russian government has sought to prevent
foreign news services like Radio Free Europe/Radio

Liberty from reaching the Russian people, it expects

its own broadcasts to remain unhindered in neighbor-
ing democracies, which are committed to freedom of
expression. Thus when Latvian authorities imposed a
six-month ban on the Russian television channel Rossi-
ya RTR for inciting ethnic hatred in April 2016, Russian
officials called on international watchdog bodies to in-
vestigate the incident as a violation of media freedom.”

Something similar is at work in the nongovernmental
organization (NGO) sector. Moscow has established or
supported a series of charities, think tanks, and asso-
ciations that promote Russian interests, claim to rep-
resent Russian minorities, and in some cases advance
secessionist causes in the near abroad.'! The Russian
government presumes that these organizations will be
allowed to operate without restriction in democracies.
eanwhile, it compelled the U.S. Agency for Interna-
tional Development (USAID) to close down its Russia
operations in 2012, and has banned contact between
Russian NGOs and foreign organizations that have
been placed on its “undesirable” list.

Russia has also used the extensive distribution of
passports to draw populations involved in frozen
conflicts—or potentially involved in future conflicts—
into its orbit, and to justify its meddling in neighboring
states. Rather than conquering a foreign people, the
Russian authorities convert foreign individuals into
Russian citizens, then claim a right to defend them
from what had been their own government. Up to 90
percent of those living in Georgias breakaway region
of South Ossetia have Russian passports, which are
accessible to anyone who still has Soviet documents
or at least one ancestor who was a permanent resi-
dent of Russia, among other forms of eligibility.

Limited sovereignty, limited options

For Russias neighbors, the constant intimidation and
interference from Moscow have significant conse-
quences. Most importantly, normal political develop-
ment becomes difficult, and sometimes impossible.
The affected countries lack full sovereignty in the sense
that they are not free to make fundamental decisions
about their political systems, their trading partners,

and whether to integrate into Euro-Atlantic institutions.
Their national identity and existence as states are reg-
ularly cast into doubt. Democratic reform often takes

a back seat to security concerns, or to policy conces-
sions aimed at maintaining good relations with Russia.

Prior to the saber rattling from the Kremlin, Estonia
had an economy with one of Europe’ higher rates of

is little sign that the United States and the
P5+1 have improved their offer to Iran
very much. As the talks were announced,
the Washington Post reported: “The P5+1
powers have made only mild revisions to
a proposal that Iran flatly rejected last
June.” Until now, the United States has
been unwilling to acknowledge Iran’s
right to enrich uranium on its own soil
and to suggest that some economic
sanctions might be lifted as part of a deal,
and Iran has refused to agree even to a
limited deal called “stop, ship, and shut”
— involving the suspension of its
enrichment to 20 percent purity, shipping
its existing stockpiles of 20% uranium to
a third country for processing, and
shutting down its underground facility at
Fordo, near Qom — without an agreement
to lift sanctions.

After the reelection of Barack Obama in
November, there were great hopes that
the president would have greater political
freedom of offer concessions to Iran. Yet,
publicly at least, the White House isn’t
signaling that it is ready to make a more
generous offer to Iran, and in fact Obama
in January signed into law yet another
round of draconian economic sanctions.
Perhaps as a result, Iran allegedly
dragged its feet on setting a date for talks.

Show goes on in Iraq's political circus

Sami Moubayed

May 28, 2011 -- DAMASCUS - Iraq has been absent from the
world's radar since upheaval rocked the Arab world in January,
toppling the regimes in Tunisia and Egypt and sending shockwaves
through Bahrain, Libya, Yemen and Syria.

A closer look at the political scene in Baghdad, however, shows that
all is not well. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is in hot water, like
many of his Arab counterparts - and his government might collapse
soon, if not through street power, then perhaps through the shattering
of the delicate balance in the upper echelons of Baghdad.

Last week Maliki hinted that he may resign and call new elections,
just five months after forming his second cabinet. Two months ago,
large and angry demonstrations broke out in Baghdad, inspired by the
Arab Spring, chanting against corruption, poor government services,
and the prime minister.

Among other things, he was accused of mismanagement of public
office, abuse of power, authoritarianism and sectarianism. Maliki
promised immediate action within the next 100 days. That deadline
expires in July and there is nothing on the horizon to prove that the
prime minister is willing, or capable, of living up to his promises.
There is also a daily barrage of accusations against him by his
predecessor Iyad Allawi, who is backed by Saudi Arabia and other
Arab heavyweights who are eager to topple Maliki - seen as an
extension of Iranian influence in the Arab and Muslim world.

Iraq remains sharply divided between the prime minister and Allawi.
The top seats in the ministries of defense and the interior are still
vacant, and Maliki still denies Allawi the right to name the minister

his rally, played it like a virtuoso. “Did you hear what they called you?” he
cried. Chachachim. He slightly mispronounced the word, as if he’d never heard,
much less used, it before, and that even having to repeat it made his blood
curdle. “Is that what you are?” There was pandemonium. Maybe Begin would
have won anyway. But it was close, just one Knesset seat between the two
major parties. And win, he did.

I became increasingly convinced in the weeks that followed that Begin’s
second government, with Arik now moved to defense minister, would further
put the brakes on any follow-up negotiations for a deal with the Palestinians. I
did not yet know that Arik, in particular, had a far more ambitious, military plan
to try to bury the possibility of a Palestinian state once and for all. But I did
know he had his eyes on a possible thrust across our northern border into
Lebanon, where Arafat and the PLO were based.

There was no public mention of any of this. But several times in 1981, I was
ordered to move a large part of my division onto the Golan Heights for weeks at
a time: two brigades, 200 tanks and dozens of APCs in a massive motorcade
from the bottom to the top of the country and back again. We dubbed it
Cinerama, from the Hebrew words for Sinai and the Heights, Ramah. If there
was an escalation of hostilities, the northern command’s regular division would
cross into Lebanon. Our role would be to take their place in defending the
Golan, and possibly follow them in.

When I returned from my final episode of Cinerama in the late summer of
1981, the Sinai withdrawal was entering its final stage. I organized a full-scale
military exercise on the roughly one-third of the Egyptian desert we still held,
knowing that we’d no longer have the room to do so after the final withdrawal.
It was the largest exercise I'd ever commanded. The advances and tactical
retreats, the flanking maneuvers and ambushes and fighter jet attacks were like
a very big war in a very small place.

But a war game was not a real war. The Sinai was not like the Golan, or the
cramped, hilly confines of Lebanon. And it was in Lebanon, the following year,
that the war came. It was different from any in Israel’s history. Arik was in
charge. And I would become involved in ways which began to change the way I
saw not only Arik, but the political and military direction of our country.

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011107.txt,"Price stability can matter. The United States has managed to avoid double-digit
inflation since the Volker reforms of the 1980s. But the danger remains. Modigliani

was right to worry.

A law making real dollars legal tender might prompt better measurements of
inflation. Many economists agree that our official ones overstate inflation by
allowing two little for quality improvements. A Lexus or Tesla is nota Model A. That
was the theme of the Boskin Commission report to President Clinton in 1995. The
Boskin panel argued that quality-corrected inflation has run about 1.1% less than
the numbers posted in the consumer price index (CPI). | think so too. But making
real dollars legal tender, even by these imperfect measures, could still give more

confidence in long-term commitments than the status quo.

Speeding Up Fiscal Policy

Designating real rather than nominal dollars as legal tender would amount to an
unfamiliar and more direct form of monetary policy. Meanwhile devolution of banks
into their separate deposit and lending functions, along with emergence of omnibus

funds, need put no constraints on fiscal policy.

Fiscal policy has prescribed tax cuts and government spending in slumps. It
prescribes the opposite, at least in principle, in booms. A problem is that it has
proved slow to implement. There is an “inside lag” while government diagnoses the
problem and calls for a vote in the legislature. An “outside lag” follows until taxes
come due and spending programs are put together and gradually put plant and

people to work.

The inside lag is unavoidable in a democracy unless the executive branch, or an
independent agency like the Fed, is given standing limited authority to diagnose
early signs of unemployment, and to address them with tax cuts or spending. And
there must be enough outside lag to make sure that the medicine has good

prospects in rate of return. Return comes first.

documents were not their illegality. Nor did the fact they were lawful actions stop him from
taking highly-sensitive GCHQ documents referring to them. In his five weeks at this Booz Allen
job, he also used this same newly-acquired “Priv Ac” at the NSA to steal files from the Israeli,
Canadian and Australian intelligence services.

Jumping from one outside contracting firm to another for the purpose of penetrating other/r
western intelligence services is not the conventional mission of a whistle-blowing. In the parlance
of intelligence operations, an employee of an intelligence service who changes his jobs\ solely to
steal the more valuable secrets of services is called an “expanding penetration.”

It is not possible to believe that Snowden did not know the damage that the highly-sensitive
documents he was taking from the NSA and its allies. Even if they did not reveal any unlawful
American activities, could do immense damage to Western intelligence. Indeed, he said as much
once he got to Moscow. In respect to China alone, he told James Risen, the New York Times’
national security reporter, in October 2013 that he had had “access to every [NSA] target, every
[NSA] active operation” that could turn out the NSA’s “lights” in China. He no doubt assumed
that he had the same power to close down the NSA’s operations in Russia.

His choice to switch jobs did not come out of the blue. It was not based on serendipitously
discovering the documents after he began working at Booz Allen. . It was a carefully calculated
move. As he told Lana Lam, he knew in advance that by switching to the job at Booz Allen he
would gain the opportunity to take the lists of NSA sources. He knew that the NSA’ secretive
National Threat Operations Center’s chief business was, as its name suggests, countering direct
threats from China, Russia and other adversary states, and that, to deal with these threats, the
NSA had used sophisticated methods to hack into the computers of adversaries. The NSA was
even able to remotely gain entry to adversary computers that were not hooked into a network.
“Tt’s no secret that we hack China very aggressively,” Snowden later said from Moscow. He had
a planned target: getting the lists of the enemy computers that the NSA hacked into.

He also knew he was undertaking s a dangerous enterprise. He would tell Poitras in Hong
Kong that the NSA would literally “kill” to protect their secrets. He also said he could be seized
in a rendition operation by the CIA in Hong Kong. He even foresaw the probability that he “would
be in an orange jumpsuit, super-max prison in isolation or Guantanamo.”

He knowingly chose this course, despite the possibility of assassination or imprisonment,
presumably because he believed the value of the secrets he would obtain by switching jobs
outweighed the risk of imprisonment. Part of his calculus might have been the belief that the NSA
lists, GCHQ documents and other material in his possession could give him great leverage, if he
chose to exert it, in his future dealings with intelligence services (including the NSA.) If so, his
choice to widen his access was also a choice to empower himself.

The second choice of consequence that Snowden made was to make Hong Kong his first
stop. He had many other options. He could have remained in America, as almost all previous
whistle-blowers in the past had chosen to do. If he did that, he would have to make his case in
court (and, in that case, the level 3 documents he took might have been retrieved before they fell
into unauthorized hands.) He could have also chosen to make a cross-border escape to a country
that did not have an active extradition treaty with the United States. He could have, for example,
taken a direct flight to Brazil, which has no extradition treaty with the United States. Brazil also
had the advantage of being the home country of Glenn Greenwald, the journalist who he wanted
to break the whistle-blowing story. As Greenwald seemed (at least to Snowden) hesitant to travel

Thus, this false claim strikes at the heart of what I am about, which is to acknowledge fans in a way that makes

Chapter 6 Offensiveness- Pornography: I Am Curious Yellow and Deep Throat

Freedom of speech is not free. The right to say, show or publish often carries a heavy price tag.
As kids, we recited the following ditty: “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but names will
never harm me.” Before too long we learned, often from painful experiences, how wrong it was.
Names—such as “kike,” “fag,” “wop,” “nigger,” “retard,” “sissy,” “fatso”—could harm far more
than sticks and stones. Lies, rumors, gossip, slurs, insults, caricatures could all be painful. Even
the truth can hurt.*' That’s why we learn to be “polite’”—1to self-censor. That’s why families,
schools, groups and other institutions have rules, sometimes explicit, more often implicit,
regulating speech. “We just don’t say that kind of thing around here,” is a common, if informal,
limitation on freedom of expression.

99 ¢¢

It is a far cry, however, from an informal family understanding to formal government legislation
and enforcement of formal restrictions on expression. I would never use —or allow anyone I love
to use—the kind of epithets listed in the prior paragraph, but nor would I want the government to
prohibit, under threat of criminal punishment or prior restraint, the use of those or other hurtful or
offensive words.

You may remember that in the 1970s, the comedian George Carlin listed the seven words that
could never be uttered on radio or television. The list included such innocent words as “piss” and
“tits.” (Use your imagination for the other 5!)

Although the list was never officially promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission,
the uttering of the prohibited words on a Pacifica radio station that broadcast Carlin’s routine led
to a Supreme Court decision setting out standards for what could and could not be said during
certain hours of the day and night.

Carlin’s routine also became fodder for other comedians and led to the widespread mocking of
any attempts to create lists of approved and unapproved words.

Nonetheless, governments have understandably sought to protect some adult citizens*’ from being
“offended” by the words or expressions of other citizens. Nudists are not free to bare their
privates in public, since most people are offended by the sight of other people’s naked bodies,
thought they may be free to do so in special areas set aside for those who are not so offended.** I

31 At common law, truth was not a defense to defamation because a “truthful defamation was deemed more harmful
than a false one.” See Alan Dershowitz, Finding Jefferson (Wiley 2008 pages 104-05).

>». The exposure of such material raises separate issues but the Supreme Court has ruled that the potential exposure
of children does not by itself justify censoring adults. See
33 See Dershowitz, The Best Defense, Chapter 5.

In any event, the issue of pornography illustrates at least two distinct types of harm that have the alleged basis for
prohibiting expression. A related harm grows out of the expectation that certain people who are offended by
certain kind of speech will react violently to the offending person. Thus, if a white person confronts a black person
and calls him by the “N word,” the black person may well respond by striking the offender. Similarly if a Jewish,
Muslim, Italian, Irish, Polish or gay person is confronted with a word or name deeply offensive to him or his

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029066.txt,"I see that every day. I’m a very practical, pragmatic capitalist. I was trained at Goldman
Sachs, I went to Harvard Business School, I was as hard-nosed a capitalist as you get. I
specialized in media, in investing in media companies, and it’s a very, very tough
environment. And you've had a fairly good track record. So I don’t want this to kinda
sound namby-pamby, “Let’s all hold hands and sing ‘Kumbaya’ around capitalism.”

But there’s a strand of capitalism today — two strands of it, that are very disturbing.

One is state-sponsored capitalism. And that’s the capitalism you see in China and Russia.
I believe it’s what Holy Father [Pope Francis] has seen for most of his life in places like
Argentina, where you have this kind of crony capitalism of people that are involved with
these military powers-that-be in the government, and it forms a brutal form of capitalism
that is really about creating wealth and creating value for a very small subset of people.
And it doesn’t spread the tremendous value creation throughout broader distribution
patterns that were seen really in the 20th century.

The second form of capitalism that I feel is almost as disturbing, is what I call the Ayn
Rand or the Objectivist School of libertarian capitalism. And, look, I’m a big believer in a
lot of libertarianism. I have many many friends that’s a very big part of the conservative
movement — whether it’s the UKIP movement in England, it’s many of the underpinnings
of the populist movement in Europe, and particularly in the United States.

However, that form of capitalism is quite different when you really look at it to what I call
the “enlightened capitalism” of the Judeo-Christian West. It is a capitalism that really
looks to make people commodities, and to objectify people, and to use them almost — as
many of the precepts of Marx — and that is a form of capitalism, particularly to a younger
generation [that] they’re really finding quite attractive. And if they don’t see another
alternative, it’s going to be an alternative that they gravitate to under this kind of rubric of

“personal freedom.”

“Look at what’s happening in ISIS ... look at
the sophistication of which they’ve taken the
tools of capitalism ... at what they’ve done
with Twitter and Facebook.”

they decide to relinquish it.

In parallel with Singer’s work on the relationship between pain empathy and our classification of
others as fair-minded cooperators or narcissistically-minded cheaters, so too does race influence our
expression of compassion toward those in pain. Both Caucasian, Black and Asian subjects showed
stronger activation in the pain-related areas of the brain when viewing individuals from the same race
experience pain than when viewing individuals of a different race. When Black subjects played a
computerized game involving social ostracism, they showed stronger activation in areas of the brain
involved in social pain when excluded by Caucasian players than when excluded by Black players. When
others suffer and we have the opportunity to help them, we are more likely to help those of the same race,
and feel good about it as evidenced by activation of brain areas involved in reward.

Our biases, both implicit and explicit, influence our compassion toward others and our motivation
to help. This statement is true whether we are looking at evidence from young children or adults, and
using measures that assess sensory perception, behavioral judgment, or activity patterns in the brain.
Beginning with an evolutionarily ancient brain system that was designed to distinguish friendly ingroup
members and antagonistic outgroup members, we populate the inner sanctum with people who we
perceive as most like us, using both fixed and variable features. With time, the walls surrounding this
sanctum close, attributing the full richness of human nature to those within, and bleaching it from those

outside.

Bleaching humanity

Draw an imaginary circle around yourself with a diameter of about fifty feet. Now imagine packing this
circle with people, forming an expanding set of concentric circles that radiates out from those closest to
you to those you don’t know at all. Based on social network analyses by sociologists such as Nicholas
Christakis, the majority of people within the inner circles will be like you in a number of ways, including
their race, religion, political affiliation, food preferences, and aesthetics. This includes family members
and close friends, but also those we work with, vote for, and play with. As you travel from the inner core
to the outside, you will find less in common. Some in the outer core will not only have less in common,
but as noted earlier in this chapter based on work by Gray, Wegner and Haslam, will be perceived as less
human, stripped of dimensions of experience and agency that define humanity. Some will appear like

objects, others like animals. When we transform others into objects, we have stripped away core aspects

form of sequences of numbers or symbols representing the sequence of labeled
boxes. The complexity of these numeric or symbol sequences was then quantified
in a variety of ways including the use of two fundamental measures of dynamical

entropy.

One measure reflects how many new, previously unexplored boxes were
entered by the rat per unit of time. This rate represents a percent of the possible.
The second measure reflects how much of the time did the rat in each box visited
as a distribution of the probable. The rate of expansion of the possible and the
relative time in occupancy of these possibles, the probables, form the bases for the
computation of these two kinds of entropies. For example, the work of Paulus and
Geyer showed that the administration of a very small amount of stimulant drug,
compared with a salt water control, led to an increase in the first measure of the
number of new, previously unexplored, boxes entered per unit time. With respect to
the second measure, the stimulant drug augmented exploratory activity was also
more uniformly distributed over the possible boxes, making for more uniform
probability. Administration of higher doses of stimulant drugs, at a critical dose, led
suddenly to more spatially and temporally restricted and stereotyped patterns of
motion of the rats, compulsive circling alternating with frozen sniffing. Both
contributed to a decrease in the possible and nonuniformity in the distribution of the
probabilities. In man, low doses of amphetamine tend to increase the rate and
creativity of thought streams and high doses generate fixed ideas and paranoid
delusions. In the statistical approach to nonlinear dynamical systems, time-
dependent generation of new possibilities is called topological entropy, H; and the
entropy associated with the distribution of probabilities is called the metric entropy,
Hy. These kinds of entropies have also been used to quantitate characteristic

patterns of in human behavior as well.

We have previously mentioned these measures as used in human
experiments by Karen Selz, a Research Professor of Psychiatry at Emory University
in Atlanta. Recall that she devised a set of experiments leading to unobtrusive

measures made on human subjects by asking them to remove, as many as they

again.

° The incident happened at a dinner held at the Melbourne Zoo as part of the Australian Skeptics
National Convention, where you were a featured speaker.

° With conference delegates chatting over drinks, a woman asked you for a celebrity selfie.

° As the woman held out her phone to take the picture, you reached over her shoulder and grabbed her
right breast.

° She immediately reacted, bodychecking you and spinning around. “Don’t do that,” she said.

° BuzzFeed News has seen the complaint made by another woman to ASU, ANU, and the New College

of the Humanities in London, including the selfie, her face obscured to conceal her identity. It shows your hand
in motion as a blur in front of her shoulder, apparently moving toward her chest. Two other eyewitnesses have
confirmed the complainant's account of what happened.

° In April 2017, the complainant described the incident on her blog. After hearing more about your
reputation for inappropriate behavior from blog readers, she decided to file a complaint about the Nov. 2016
incident.

° On July 16, she filed formal complaints with Arizona State University, and with the Australian National
University in Canberra and the New College of the Humanities in London, where you have visiting
appointments.

° Both Arizona State and the Australian National University told her they would look into the matter. But
neither university found against you.

° “Based on the material available to the University, we do not have sufficient evidence to substantiate
the allegations,” Kiaran Kirk, dean of the College of Science at the Australian National University, wrote to her.

° Erin Ellison, who heads Arizona State’s Office of Equity & Inclusion, wrote to her explaining that an
inquiry “did not find a violation of university policy.”

° In October, Arizona State denied a request from BuzzFeed News for documents relating to complaints
of sexual harassment against you. However, Cynthia Jewett, the university's senior associate general counsel,
noted that two individuals, neither affiliated with the university, had complained about you. “The University did
not find either communication to state a credible allegation,” Jewett wrote.

Miscellaneous facts:

° In 2008, you founded the Origins Project at Arizona State University in Tempe, a multidisciplinary effort
to understand the origins of the universe, life, and social systems. You have led that effort ever since.

e Thanks to best-selling books like The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe From Nothing, frequent
essays in publications including the New Yorker and the New York Times, and the documentary you made with
biologist Richard Dawkins, called The Unbelievers, you are celebrated as one of America’s leading public
intellectuals.

° You served on the science policy committee for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign and are a
vocal critic of President Donald Trump.

° You also make regular public appearances across the world, often at gatherings of skeptics and
atheists.

° At CSICon in Las Vegas in October, a few dozen fans paid $500 per head to attend a VIP luncheon
with you and Dawkins.

° Many more lined up to get you to sign their copy of your latest book, The Greatest Story Ever Told —
So Far.

° Online, people can buy T-shirts emblazoned “Lawrence Krauss for President.”

° In talks and interviews, you have argued that our universe arose without divine intervention, that

religion drives xenophobia, and that our brains are hardwired to believe.

Image source: TIME

After post-war Berlin was divided into four occupation zones, the living conditions were greatly different in each one.
Between 1949 and 1961, about 2.5 million people fled from Soviet-occupied East Germany. Barricades and barb wire was
placed to stop people from fleeing but that did not stop 19-year-old border guard Hans Conrad Schumann. A crown in
West Berlin was enticing the young soldier to come over. The soldier said he did not want to “live enclosed,” and jumped
the barbed wire, escaping into the West side. The photo was considered a symbol of freedom but Hans did not deal with

the newly-found fame well — he committed suicide in 1998.

in its most difficult stages. We are insistent on developing the education and obtaining excellence in all our
projects and our work, in addition to protecting our favorable environment for innovation and leadership. What

Your Highness, you asked the Ministry of Finance last year to prepare the federal budget
of the State 2009. The early announcement prior to the global economic crisis has
resulted in a deficit-free budget. Would the global crisis have implications on the 2010
budget, particularly with regard to the basic needs of Emirati citizens?

In the last three years, the federal budget was issued early and before entering the new fiscal year. The
submission of the budget for 2009 without a deficit is because its main provisions have not been affected by the
global financial crisis. I also do not think that 2010 budget will be affected. We still have seven months for the
year to end, and in my opinion this is quite a long period -- we may see by the end of it some positive indicators
that would help in accelerating the recovery of the global economy.

AL ITTIHAD

There are those who say that the senior positions in Dubai are granted to a few selected
people, which is described as the phenomenon of the ''Super Man.” How would you
comment on this?

My answer is that all positions are available to competent Emiratis and we are very keen on rejuvenating our
system. The “Super Man” phenomenon that you are talking about does not exist in our organizations and
institutions. I am aware of those reports but would invite you and others to conduct a search within those senior
positions to discover the truth on your own.

AL ITTIHAD

In light of the global crisis some companies announced the postponement and
rescheduling of some projects. What is the status of the infrastructure projects
undertaken by the government subsequent to the changes in the strategic plans?

We will continue working on the infrastructure projects without any delay. What is currently under
implementation will be completed, while we will re-schedule the new projects. The changes of the strategic
plan will be announced as soon as the committee finishes reviewing them. Plans are always subject to change in
normal times and in times of crisis.

By Al-Khaleej Daily

Despite the competitive investment environment enjoyed by the UAE, with its advanced
regional advantages, there are some aspects of the legislative environment that do not
quite match the levels of development and state of the national economy. Do we expect
any updating of the present laws, soon?

The economy is like a living being, whose demands and needs change with constant growth and development.

those restrictions across the country. Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of a British press magnate and Jeffrey Epstein’s close
associate when he was inviting underage girls into his bedroom, leads a TED Talk on
environmental issues.

But she points out that there has been no statute of limitations for federal sex crimes involving children since 2002.

Children who are sexually abused often take decades to reveal what happened to them, in part because their brains aren’t wired at a young age to
understand the trauma they’ve experienced, said Kenneth V. Lanning, a retired FBI agent who investigated and studied child sex crimes for 40 years.

“We want to hold children to some superhuman standard because they behave this way. In reality, police, prosecutors and judges have to understand that
children are not all angels from heaven. They are just plain human beings who are emotionally immature so we have to protect them from their own

decisions.”

Wild, who continues to fight her federal case on behalf of all of Epstein’s victims, said she hopes that the federal judge hearing the Crime Victims’ Rights
case will make a ruling soon, one that will send a message to prosecutors who fail to consider the rights of crime victims.

“Really if you think about this too hard, it’s scary because this is our government that is supposed to protect us but has done everything to protect a
pedophile,” she said.

have made him “disappear.”

But now Rodriguez needed the money. And so a few weeks 2
after Epstein’s release from the Stockade, he approached a lawyer d

Israeli-Palestinian problem.

FP: What were your best and worst
moments in the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations, and what was the greatest
missed opportunity?

Saeb Erekat: Though I was not the chief
negotiator at that moment, the connection
between [then Prime Minister Yitzhak]
Rabin and President Arafat made
everyone around them, including myself,
feel that peace was possible. There was
significant progress in all tracks until
Rabin's assassination by an Israeli
terrorist -- after he was killed, no Israeli
leader had the vision to understand that
the window of opportunity for a two-state
solution would close as fast as they
continued their colonization policies.

The missed opportunity has definitely
been Israel throwing away the Arab
Peace Initiative, which offers
normalization of relations of 57 countries
with Israel in exchange for Israeli
withdrawal to the 1967 border. They
threw it away by bombing Gaza, by
intensifying collective punishments, and
by increasing settlement construction all
over the occupied West Bank,
particularly in and around Occupied East
Jerusalem.

Yet the delay in getting to that point had serious implications for my role as
Labor Party leader. Since the negotiations with the Palestinians were stuck in
neutral, I was under increasing pressure from within Labor to pull out of Bibi’s
government. What on earth was the point of staying, they asked. All I was doing,
from their perspective, was giving Bibi political cover for abandoning any serious
effort to get a peace agreement. Their argument was entirely reasonable. My
frustration was that, due to the need for military secrecy, the counter-argument was
impossible for me to make: that I felt I had a responsibility to stay at a time when
there remained a real possibility Israel might need to take military action against
Iran. To a mix of consternation and anger among many Labor colleagues, I ended
up taking what seemed to me the only realistic option. In January 2011, I left the
Labor Party. With three other of our ministers in the government — who were, of
course, aware of the ongoing Iran discussions — I set up a new “centrist, Zionist”
party called Ha’Atzmaut, or Independence. We remained in Bibi’s government.

My main focus was now on the Americans. In order to secure the “international
legitimacy” any Israeli attack required, we had to win at least their understanding
that we might feel it necessary to act. Fortunately, I had built up a good
relationship with the key figures in the Obama administration. That had not always
been easy, given the tension between the Americans and Bibi. That wasn’t just
because of the deadlock in the peace process, still a priority for President Obama.
There were other complications. Ever since the initial pressure for a settlement
freeze, right-wing politicians and commentators, and Bibi himself, had taken to
portraying President Obama as fundamentally unsympathetic to Israel. After the
Republicans’ victory in the mid-term Congressional elections in November 2010,
Bibi went a step further. He began cozying up to congressmen and senators on the
other side of the aisle. This overt meddling in the internal politics of our closest
ally was not just a breach of longstanding tradition, but of common sense.
Members of the Administration began privately calling Bibi “the Republican
senator from Rechavia” — a reference to the Jerusalem neighborhood where the
Prime Minister’s residence was located.

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030251.txt,"Director Andrew McCabe would confirm statements made by James
Comey about how the president had tried to intimidate him. In
response, the President began a campaign of harassment, threats, and
intimidation against McCabe. On March 16, 2018, after McCabe testified
before Congress, the President, in retaliation, caused his dismissal and
the loss of his pension.

The Mueller team may have a high hurdle in convincing
Rosenstein to approve the indictment. The Department of Justice's
standing view precludes charging a sitting president with a crime. This
is based on an opinion written by the Office of Legal Counsel in the
Watergate era and recently expressed in hyperbolic terms by Giuliani:
the President could kill James Comey if he wanted to without fear of
prosecution. But, according to several former DOJ lawyers, Rosenstein
in this circumstance may have the power to override the Office of Legal
Counsel opinion. In effect, finding that the standing opinion does not
cover the present circumstances. In one view—and in the suspicion of
some in the White House—he may have already authorized Mueller to
proceed with the indictment.

The White House has made the argument—supported in many
television appearances by Trump legal surrogate, Alan Dershowitz—
that a president cannot be prosecuted for exercising his constitutional
prerogatives, even if those actions foster a crime; the President, as the
ultimate federal office, and the nation's chief law enforcement officer,
enjoys nearly unfettered latitude in how he carries out his duties. I
don't think you are going to find a court who will not see the president's
role as unique, said one White House advisor. The Mueller theories are
wishful thinking.

An indictment for obstruction of Justice is described in similar
ways by both Mueller and White House insiders: it puts the President's
public behavior on trial. The nature of that behavior, for the Mueller
team, is corrupt; this, according to the White House, is how voters
elected the President to behave.

The Special Counsel seems less worried about its legal position
than it does about it’s existential one—continuing to anticipate how the
President might use his authority to move against it.

According to insiders, the team has meticulously prepared for
most contingencies it might face from an impulsive president who feels

Why Palm Beach, Florida Is The 'New Greenwich' For Wall Streeters 
JACQUELINE DETWILER, DUJOUR 
JAN. 21, 2014, 1:18 PM 
Neilson Barnard/Getty Images 
The Palm Beach finance crowd can paddleboard whenever they please. 
Behind a semicircular brick drive and a lawn as manicured as a putting green sits a 30,000-square-foot 
masterpiece of Italian Renaissance architecture called Casa Nana. 
John Porter, a real estate associate for Corcoran who oversees some of the largest sales in Palm Beach 
County, Florida, points out the spiral staircase, built by famed 1920s architect Addison Mizner for the 
founder of the National Tea Company. This home went for $30.2 million in 2003; today that sum wouldn't 
be in the top 25 highest prices of houses for sale in this area, Porter says. Palm Beach real estate 
has gone from nothing going on to nothing left to sell. 
Porter is giving me a tour of the so-called Billionaire's Row, a stretch of South Ocean Boulevard on the 
island of Palm Beach that is bordered by some of the highest hedges I've ever seen. Through gaps in the 
greenery appear stone fountains, elephant statues, pools the size of tennis complexes (next to actual 
tennis complexes), and more clay roofs than one could count. It's a monumental display of wealth, and it 
is rapidly expanding, not just here but in Delray Beach, Jupiter, Palm Beach Gardens and Boca Raton, as 
money pours out of the Northeast (and in some cases, from as far as London and Singapore) and into this 
already wealthy section of southeast Florida. Approximately 70 hedge and private equity funds are now 
headquartered here, many of which have set up shop in the last two years, jacking up home prices and 
spurring a countywide initiative to become, as some have said, the new Greenwich. 
For hedge fund managers who might normally be inclined toward Westchester or Connecticut, the allure of 
South Florida is as plain as grits on toast. The homes are sprawling; the Intracoastal Waterway is a 
yachter's paradise. It has a glittering social scene. During high season—October through March—there 
might be several fundraisers on any given night. Perhaps the key factor, however: In Florida, there are 
no individual income taxes, no estate taxes and no capital gains taxes. A hedge fund manager reporting $1 
million in income can expect to pay only the federal government, whereas his counterpart living in 
Connecticut pays that plus an extra $67,000. And if the poor schmuck were still in New York City? He'd 
better be ready to fork over $104,300. 
As for why all of this is happening now, when Florida has long been a sunny tax haven, so to speak, 
financiers point to the upcoming application of Section 457A of the Internal Revenue Code. Before 457A 
was enacted, certain fees and related earnings could grow tax deferred in offshore accounts for up to ten 
years. But now, according to the section, hedge fund managers will need to funnel all of the fees that 
were deferred before 2009 and their related earnings back into the U.S. by 2017. If a manager lives in 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033561 
Florida when this happens, he's much less likely to pay exorbitant state taxes on the whole amount. If he 
still lived in New York City? Fuggedaboudit. 
It's the job of Kelly Smallridge, president and CEO of the Palm Beach Business Development Board, to 
ensure that hedge fund and private equity managers are informed of these benefits, in the hopes that 
they, and their firms, will become Palm Beach County's newest residents. She's developed a red-carpet 
tour that goes beyond looking at office space and real estate to include meeting headmasters at private 
schools, the school-district superintendent and the mayor and speaking with the governor's staff and CEOs 
who have moved their operations here. Plus, of course, a few nights on the town. 
In the winter, when the well-to-do from all over the Northeast visit Florida for charity balls, the board 
hosts dinners and parties for prospective relocators and local captains of industry. Last year, 
Smallridge and company sponsored a soiree aboard a $70 million yacht that featured Veuve Clicquot, caviar 
and live jazz. Guests—who included the CEOs of a national IT company, a major finance company and a land 
developer, venture capitalists, hedge fund managers and the creator of Goldman Sachs' prime brokerage 
division—took private tours with the captain of the yacht. 
Smallridge is also working with former hedge fund CIO Dr. Rainford Knight to develop a club for local 
investment managers called SocialAlpha that encourages bankers in Palm Beach County's ritzy social scene 
to get to know each other. Even Florida governor Rick Scott has gotten involved, sending personal letters 
to friends and prospects from the Northeast (the governor is a former Greenwich resident and businessman) 
to convince them of Florida's merits. 
Smallridge and Governor Scott are hoping to induce a snowball effect, and so far, it seems to be working. 
Every financier who moves south chips away at the primary reason to remain near New York City—the fact 
that everyone else is there. That's not to say it's been easy. Florida is still Florida, and popular 
opinion has not been kind. Even Palm Beach, which has for the most part dodged the insults hurled at the 
rest of the state, is known for its residents' apocalyptically bad driving and worse Hawaiian shirts. 
There was a fair amount of trepidation, says Al Rabil III, managing partner and CEO of Kayne Anderson 
Real Estate Advisors, who made the move from Armonk, New York, with 20 coworkers this summer. But once 
everybody got past the stereotypes and actually came and looked, that changed. He says most of his 
employees weren't looking for bottle service and models anyway. The majority of those who have reached 
the upper echelons of financial management are married with children, and the appeal of a semi-tropical 
paradise with luxury restaurants, year-round recreation, and sophisticated socializing in a community far 
more tight-knit than Manhattan (yes, that'sDonald Trump over there) is not lost on them. 
Porter's tour of Billionaire's Row was part of a modified version of one of the Business Development 
Board's red-carpet tours that I took as part of researching this story. I ate breakfast at the clubby Top 
of the Point restaurant with some of the area's prominent financiers. A waiter in a captain's outfit 
served lobster rolls while a CPA, a lawyer and the executive director of the Palm Beach County Education 
Commission touted the area's benefits. I surveyed real estate and office space surrounded by miles of 
water without once having my foot stepped on by a tourist. You can see how all this might sway someone 
who's on the fence. 
Exploring the sugary beaches of South Florida, one starts to wonder why Wall Streeters would be on the 
fence at all. Between the smiling locals and the shopping on Worth Avenue, the Hiaasen-esque stereotypes 
recede. What remains are the facts: Take-home pay is higher, commutes are shorter, and it's just as 
fabulous as Manhattan, at least for four months of the year. Meanwhile, no one in Florida even owns an 
ice scraper. With the Internet allowing more and more money managers to perform their work from nearly 
anywhere, there are few reasons not to make the move. 
Initially, it was a way to play golf and keep the wife and kids happy, says Brett Langbert, managing 
director and head of sales at I.A. Englander & Co. But once we moved down, it became a quality-of-life 
issue. There are unlimited things the kids can do outside. I have to tell you, my wife and I are so happy 
we haven't had to go to one of those indoor bouncy-castle places since we got here.

felt I needed to say, with what many in the audience, and certainly Ben-Zion
and Bibi, would expect me to say. Not only was Yoni being mourned across
Israel after Entebbe. He was being elevated — in the spirit of Shimon’s words at
the funeral —to something approaching sainthood. I did not want to detract from
his evolving status as national hero, or his importance as a symbol of a
commando success which had, for the first time since the 1973 war, restored a
measure of Israeli sense of self-confidence. A victory, over all logic and all
odds. But I also wanted to find a way of capturing Yoni as he really was: a
brave man, an extraordinary fighter and officer. But also a man sometimes
feeling torn inside, and alone.

I began with words of ancient rabbinic wisdom about the path which all of us
travel from birth to death, and to whatever comes after. The quotation I chose —
from the 2,000-year-old volume known as Pirkei Avot, the Ethics of our Fathers
— seemed right to me. “Know where you came from: a putrid drop... Know
where you are going: to a place of dust, maggots and worms... And know before
whom you are destined to give your final account, the King of Kings.” I spoke
of the loss of Yoni, and said it was impossible not to think about the meaning of
what lay between the “putrid drop” where each of us begins our life and our
final reckoning. “I believe that life is not just a sum of the hours and days
between the beginning and the end. It is the content we pour into the space in
between,” I said. ?d known people who were given the gift of a long life but
who, by that definition, had hardly lived at all. There were also people like
Yoni. He’d lived only briefly. But he had learned and loved. Fought and trained
others to fight. Grappled with the most profound puzzles of existence, and yet
remained open “to the wonders of a smile. A journey. A flower. A poem.” If
there was any consolation for a life ended cut off at age 30, I said, that was it.

But I wanted to give a more personal, nuanced picture of the life that he, and
we, and lost. “Our Yoni... We have seen him torn between his passion for
knowledge on the one hand, and the sense of mission and of personal fulfillment
that he found in uniform. There was the Yoni of history and philosophy books:
Plato and Marx. Who saw the history of Israel not just as a compendium of
facts, but a source of inspiration, and a call for action. The Yoni who rebuilt a
tank battalion reduced to ashes and dust on the Golan. And there was the Yoni
at peace. Tranquil. At home. With his pipe and his phonograph records, out of
uniform. We saw him in his hours of supreme achievement and satisfaction. We
saw him, too, sometimes standing alone, with pain in his heart, biting his teeth,

Richard L. Russell

February 5, 2013 -- Shortly before he left
office in Feb. 2011, Defense Secretary
Robert Gates told West Point cadets that
in my opinion, any future defense
secretary who advised the president to
again send a big American land army into
Asia or into the Middle East or Africa
should ‘have his head examined,’ as
General MacArthur so delicately put it.
The remark no doubt reflected Sec.
Gates's fatigue and frustration from the
enormous intellectual and emotional
burdens associated with overseeing the
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

One suspects, however, that in a more
reflective moment, Gates would have
acknowledged that never say never is a
wise rule of thumb in planning for
military contingencies, especially in the
region that makes up Central Command's
area-of-responsibility. Few, for example,
predicted the 1979 Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan. Gates himself -- who was a
senior CIA official during the covert war
supporting the Afghan resistance -- surely
did not anticipate then that the United

I issued a standing directive in the kirya that we should agree to anything
Fayyad asked for, as long as there no security reason to say no. We ended up
arranging a direct source of fuel supply to Jenin, on the northern edge of the West
Bank, and built new terminals to handle it. We facilitated construction permits for
a new industrial zone. For a conference of international economists and business
people, we set up VIP treatment at Ben-Gurion Airport, and limousine transport to
the conference venue. I believed that if Fayyad succeeded in what he was trying to
accomplish, it would be a benefit not just for the Palestinians, but for Israel too.
Bibi was agnostic on Fayyad’s efforts. Yet he recognized they did no harm. And in
a way, my support for them was politically convenient. To the extent the
international community, especially the Americans, appreciated our efforts to help
the Palestinians, Bibi and others in the government could, and did, claim credit.
When there were complaints from the right, Bibi could and did say: “It wasn’t me.
It was Barak.”

My part in our relations with the Americans was more politically delicate. As I
continued to prod Bibi toward accepting a settlement freeze during the summer and
autumn of 2009, my de facto role became to help smooth over the increasingly
rough edges in our ties with the Obama administration. I knew key figures from
earlier incarnations in their public lives and mine: Secretary of Defense Bob Gates,
who had been President George H. W. Bush’s deputy security adviser 1n the first
Iraq war and then head of the CIA; and Hillary Clinton, now Secretary of State.
During a series of early trips to the US as Defense Minister, I met Gates, Hillary
and other senior figures in the administration both formally and informally. In part
because they were aware I favored agreeing to a settlement freeze, they clearly
found it a lot easier to talk to me than to Bibi. On one visit, to my regret and Bibi’s
evident frustration once I’d got home, the press highlighted this dramatic
difference in mood. Emerging from talks with me at the State Department, Hillary
told reporters that our talks had gone “wonderfully.” She added: “As longtime
friends do, much was said. And much didn’t need to be said.” Still, I was careful to
avoid any explicit criticism of Bibi in my meetings in the US. I would point out the
domestic political pressures on him in deciding how to proceed. And in any case,
the Americans knew that no matter what I might say to them, it was Bibi’s actions
that ultimately mattered. He, not I, was Prime Minister.

I was as surprised as they were when he finally announced a settlement freeze
in November 2009. As with nearly everything else he did regarding the peace

I’ve personally toured most of these areas across the country, and I was very keen on visiting particular areas
and schools that were the focus of the media. I discovered that the situation on ground is often completely
different from the picture presented by the media. Of course, these areas need to be given more attention -- and
this is exactly what the government has committed itself to since its first day in office. The government efforts
in that regard are in line with the directives of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of
the UAE.

Are there any practical measures undertaken by the government to address the issue of
the population imbalance? What about offering incentives to the UAE nationals to have
more children?

The government has embarked on certain measures which have been announced earlier and carried by the
media. The committee in charge of the population issues is working quietly and ina very effective manner. The
UAE Government Strategy has identified a major direction for developing particular steps to address the
population imbalance issue. One of the strategies the UAE government has identified to address this issue
involves focusing on Emiratization through well-planned policy based on combining federal and local efforts.
Incentives for the UAE nationals to have more children are already in place. UAE nationals are offered several
incentives either in terms of services, benefits, salary increments or other privileges for their children. The
UAE government has paid special attention to offering UAE nationals all possible incentives.

By Al Bayan newspaper

Why have the UAE Government retreats been stopped?

The UAE Government retreats have not been put on hold but they are usually organized with relatively long
intervals. Yet, the Cabinet meetings are convened on regular basis.
By Al Bayan newspaper

Some peop le believe that you put more trust in youth rather than veterans to lead Dubai
organizations. What is your comment on this view?

I’ve trusted, and I will continue to trust well-qualified and experienced youth. If youth are not empowered and
given full opportunities, how expertise and new leaderships will be built?

In the meantime, I don’t know which age signifies youth. Are they below the age of 35 or 40? Ifa person who
has spent 10 or 20 years in his/her workplace and still has not developed any experience, can he/she be
categorized as youth? How many years one should spend at work to gain experience -- should we say 5 or 10?

The world has changed. Knowledge is now accessible to everybody. Training and development programmes
are also available for those who seek to develop themselves and opt to enhance their competencies to ensure
successful future career path. Young leaders’ development programmes are also available for all UAE
nationals who prove themselves worthy through tests carried out by an independent body.

We look high at our national expertise, both young and veteran. I will continue to explore and discover young
talent and offer them full opportunities and push them to assume leading positions.

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017803.txt,"Even from jail, Jeffrey Epstein manipulated the system | Miami Herald Page 3 of 17
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 4 of 18

Acosta, who is now President Donald Trump’s secretary of labor, told lawmakers last year at his confirmation hearing that he did not know that Epstein
would receive such liberal treatment while incarcerated. But court records show that federal prosecutors under his authority acquiesced to many of
Epstein’s demands, including that he not go to federal or state prison.

“T can’t remember how I found out that he had taken a plea,” said Courtney Wild, identified by the FBI as one of more than three dozen underage girls —
some of them as young as 13 — who had been molested by Epstein at his waterfront estate between 2001 and 2005.

“We were purposefully misled into believing that his sentencing [in state court] had nothing to do with the federal crimes he committed against me or the
other girls.”

Epstein, now 65, was released in 2009 after serving 13 months.

Wild, who was 14 when she met Epstein, is suing the federal government, alleging that prosecutors kept her and other victims in the dark as part of a
conspiracy to give Epstein — described in the lawsuit as “a powerful, politically connected multimillionaire” — one of the most lenient deals for a serial

child sex offender in history.

Courtney Wild is suing the federal government, claiming that prosecutors deliberately kept her and other victims of Jeffrey Epstein in the dark about the status of his case. The
U.S. Attorney's Office signed a non-prosecution agreement with the multimillionaire. Emily Michot £/1/CHOT@MIAMIHERALD.COM

Now 31, Wild is Jane Doe No.1 in “Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 vs. the United States,” which seeks to overturn Epstein’s plea agreement on the grounds that
it was executed in violation of the federal Crime Victims’ Rights Act. The measure affords crime victims a series of rights, including to confer with
prosecutors and to be notified about plea negotiations and sentencing.

That lawsuit — and an unrelated state court case scheduled for trial on Dec. 4 — could expose more about Epstein’s crimes, as well as who else was
involved and whether there was any undue influence that tainted the federal case.

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031274.txt,"° In a second incident in December of 2007, while you were still at Case Western, the same student
visited your office to interview you for a student science journal. You closed the door behind her, and ignored
the questions she had prepared. Then you made a casual comment about taking her out for dinner.

° Later, in a regular column for the school paper, she described her experiences with you, without
mentioning you by name. “There was even one particular creep of a professor who once told me he thought
differently of me compared to other students and asked me to dinner: a situation so disturbing that it left me
upset for weeks afterward,” she wrote.

° She was then approached by a dean at the university, who suspected that she was referring to you,
based on a previously reported incident with another student. He encouraged her to make a complaint, and
she did.

° University investigators interviewed both you and the student.

° On September 4, 2008, Susan Nickel-Schindewolf, the university’s associate vice president for student
affairs, wrote to the student, telling her that the investigation was complete. She wrote that you had been told:
“This type of behavior could constitute sexual harassment in violation of the university’s sexual harassment
policy.”

° The letter also stated that you were prohibited from making contact with the student as long as she
remained at Case.

° The letter also stated that you are required to get approval from the dean or the chair of the physics
department before setting foot on the campus again.

° The letter also stated, “Dr. Krauss expressed regret about having a negative impact on you, and also
his willingness to use this complaint as an opportunity to reflect and improve on his future interactions with
students.”

° By then, you had already left Case, taking up your current position at Arizona State University the
month before.

° “The opportunities being offered at ASU are simply too great to turn down at this stage in my career,”
you told Case colleagues, in an email announcing your departure on April 16, 2008.

Incident 3:

° A former Case Western physics department administrator confirmed that she had reported a previous
incident involving a student who had confided in her about your inappropriate behavior towards her.

Incident 4:

° You met a student from another university, an atheist activist, in March 2008 at the American Atheists
Convention in Minneapolis. She wanted to expand the atheist group she ran at the midwestern university she
was attending, and hoped to convince you to come and speak. You initially seemed enthusiastic.

° During the convention, attendees including you and Richard Dawkins went for dinner with the student
and volunteers for Dawkins’ foundation.

° Afterwards, the student invited you to join the volunteers for a drink.

° You asked her to come get you in your hotel room. She was wary of your intentions, and so brought a
male friend with her. Opening the door to find them both there, you informed her you had decided not to go.
° You met this student again at the American Atheists Convention in Des Moines, lowa, in April 2011.

° You pulled over a chair for her in the bar, and then started running your hand up her leg under the
table.

° She tried to shift her body away from you, and you persisted in putting your hand on her leg. She

crossed her legs, and you kept trying. Then she turned her entire body away.

“When I accepted the case, I received Snowden’s dossier.” He answered. “I was able to see all
his interviews.”

Presumably Snowden’s dossier included his interviews with the FSB, SVR and other Russian
security services. If so, it would explain how Kucherena could be so certain that Snowden had
brought “material” with him to Russia that he had not provided to journalists in Hong Kong.
Before meeting with Kucherena, I had met with Sophie Shevardnadze, the previously-mentioned
grand-daughter of Politburo member Edward Shevardnadze and widely-followe3d television
journalist. She told me that Kucherena had personally approved the translation of the interview
into English. So I asked Kucherena about his 2013 interview with her, which was the last
interview he had given about Snowden. It will be recalled that in response to a question about
whether Snowden had secret material with him in Russia, Kucherena had said “certainly.” Was
this exchange accurate?

“It was accurate,” he answered.

Snowden himself had said in Hong Kong that he had only given journalists some of the state
secrets he had stolen and that he deemed others too sensitive for journalists. So I sought to find
out from Kucherena which documents Snowden had taken to Russia. I went about it in a
roundabout way. When Shevardnadze asked him about the secret material Snowden had might
reveal in Russia, Kucherena pointedly called her attention to Snowden’s CIA service, suggesting
that he might possess CIA files. I also knew that in his roman a clef novel which Oliver Stone had
optioned for $1 million, he had Joshua Frost, the thinly veiled Snowden-based character, steal a
vast number of CIA documents that could do great damage to U.S. intelligence. By retaining
them, Frost made himself a prime target of the CIA. So I asked “Is Joshua Frost fact or fiction?”

“T can’t tell you that,” he said, “If I said he was Snowden it would violate the attorney client
privilege.”

“T understand,” I persisted, “But did Snowden do what Frost did in your book.”

“That is for you to decide,” he answered with a sly smile. “It’s my first novel.”

When I asked if he could arrange for me to see Snowden, he said that first I would have to first
submit my questions to Ben Wizner, Snowden’s American lawyer. He made it clear to me that
the exposure of Snowden to journalists, or at least the vetting of journalists, had been outsourced
to Wizner, “After that the final decision is up to Snowden,” he said. That seemed to conclude the
interview but, as I got up to leave, he added, “His legal defense is fairly expensive and Snowden is
running out of money.”

I was intrigued by this parting remark. Snowden, as far as I knew, didn’t need a legal defense
because he was not charged with a crime in Russia and the United States had no extradition treaty
with Russia. But I asked, “Could I make a contribution to his defense fund?”

“It would be greatly appreciated,” he said, “We will supply you with instructions to wire
the money to our bank.”

“How much should I send?”

“That’s up to you,” he said, getting up to walk me to the door. “I should add for the
record that the contribution will not influence Snowden's decision to see you.”

“T will send the wiring instructions” Valentina said as I left. “I hope you come back to
Moscow.”

covered this for six months, day in and day out — not one news site — not Fox News, not
Politico, no sites picked this up. And the reason that this guy won is quite simple: Middle-
class people and working-class people are tired of people like Eric Cantor who say they’re

conservative selling out their interests every day to crony capitalists.

“That center-right revolt is really a global
revolt. I think you’re going to see it in Latin
America, I think you’re going to see it in Asia,
I think you’ve already seen it in India.”

And you're seeing that whether that was UKIP and Nigel Farage in the United Kingdom,
whether it’s these groups in the Low Countries in Europe, whether it’s in France, there’s a
new tea party in Germany. The theme is all the same. And the theme is middle-class and
working-class people — they’re saying, “Hey, I’m working harder than I’ve ever worked.
I’m getting less benefits than I’m ever getting through this, I’m incurring less wealth
myself, and I’m seeing a system of fat cats who say they’re conservative and say they back
capitalist principles, but all they’re doing is binding with corporatists.” Right?
Corporatists, to garner all the benefits for themselves.

And that center-right revolt is really a global revolt. I think you’re going to see it in Latin
America, I think you’re going to see it in Asia, I think you’ve already seen it in India.
Modi’s great victory was very much based on these Reaganesque principles, so I think this
is a global revolt, and we are very fortunate and proud to be the news site that is reporting
that throughout the world.

Harnwell: I think it’s important to understand the distinction that you’re drawing here
between what can be understood as authentic, free-market capitalism as a means of

"
IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012852.txt,"example, invading another country is not aggressive, but designed as a pre-emptive strike to protect group
interests.

Moral disengagement enables behaviors that are either immoral, illegal, or counter to deeply
rooted intuitive prohibitions against harming others. It is a process that has the beneficial consequence of
empowering soldiers to go to war under just causes, as well as the toxic consequence of empowering
rogue leaders to carry out genocide under unjust causes. It is a process that allows us to hibernate from
our moral responsibilities. It is a form of self-deception, a partner to dehumanization in the denial of
reality. But self-deception, like deception of others, is not always harmful. In fact, it is often highly

adaptive.

Angelic denial

In a nationally televised address in 2005, the Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad pronounced that
the Jews had created a myth in the name of the Holocaust and consider it above God, religion and the
prophets. Judge Daniel Schreber believed that his brain was softening and that he was turning into a
woman in order to form a sexual union with God. During a doctor’s visit, a man reported that his pet
poodle had been replaced by an impostor, masquerading as if he was the real deal. Judge Patrick
Couwenberg stated under oath that he received the Purple Heart for military operations in Vietnam, and
soon thereafter carried out covert missions in Southeast Asia and Africa as a CIA agent. The pilots of Air
Florida flight 90 ignored signs from their dashboard indicating engine trouble and then proceeded to crash
into a bridge, killing 74 of the 79 people on board. In 2008, while Hilary Clinton was running for
President of the United States, she regaled admiring supporters with stories of her international
experience, including her visit to Bosnia in 1996 where her plane was forced to land “under sniper fire”,
followed by a rapid evacuation for cover. When I was a teenager, I often walked onto the tennis court
thinking that I was John McEnroe, serving and volleying like the world’s number one player.

Each case above tells the story of a person who acted as if the world was one way even though it
wasn’t. The Holocaust and its trail of atrocities were real, confirmed by thousands of scarred survivors
and the relatives who have heard their accounts. Judge Couwenberg was never in Vietnam, never earned a
Purple Heart, and never had a connection with the CIA. There are no pet poodle impostors. Our brains
don’t soften, though they do deteriorate with age. When dashboard indicators suggest engine trouble,
better to be safe than sorry when you are responsible for the lives of many people. Hilary Clinton landed
in the exceptionally safe airport of Tuzla where she was warmly greeted by US and Bosnian officials. I

am no McEnroe.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013594.txt,"episodes of rageful envy of everyone else in the world that had been spared. My
wife escaped into an alcoholic flirtation with her major professor; my sons grew
increasingly ensconced in the generous and kind neighborhood homes of their
playmates. | metered as many hours as possible in equity growing, long lonely days
in a small, dark, couch filled, university office, listening to Beverly Hills, Brentwood
and West Los Angles citizens as they psychoanalyzed their mysterious lack of
emotional fulfillment from materialistic fulfillment. Legend has it that Gautama’s
sudden insight about the universality of this sated, bored condition occurred in 528
B.C. after 49 days of sitting in the lotus position under the bodhi tree, now called
ficus religiosa. In contrast with Buddha’s illumination, my psychoanalytic training-
induced, Freudian-Darwinian instinctual conflict, driven by fears of starvation and
castration, drew me tighter into the world of meaningless, coin flip probabilities.

Our house was a block away from a West Los Angeles synagogue and we
knew the Rabbi and his family well. Our sons played together frequently. The Rabbi
tried to bring comfort to me on my death watch, with hours of discussions about
trans-individual, ethnic belonging and a deeper foray into philosophical humanism.
Both felt completely irrelevant to my condition. As an intern tending to those dying at
night in Ochsner Foundation Hospital in New Orleans, it seemed to me that Jews
tended to die more noisily than Catholics. For my personal escape from low-lying
dread, | needed the metrically linear time of chronos to become the metric-free,
topological, continuous surface of the twisted circular ribbon of a Mobius loop, with
the view from each moment a kairos, a stretchable infinity of each moment’s internal
multiplicity of times.

The ruthlessly reasonable Hebraic historicity, configured by the tooth-for-a-
tooth, Mosaic and Roman falion law, the reciprocal, economic, exchange-calculating
brains of Barkow, Cosmide and Tooby’s The Adapted Mind (1992) and the terrifying
stories of the Five Books of Moses, made the hopelessness of this sinner’s plight
inevitable. It felt like my dichotomous choice of God-type was between One of
merciless fairness and the He and She of unconditionally forgiving generosity. The
mind set of logical problem solving applied to the question about which of these two

represented the true character of God lead to a momentarily distracting, metaphoric

Crossing the Rubicon

What I came to feel is that a regime that is described as a national
security agency has stopped representing the public interest and
has instead begun to protect and promote state security interests.

—EDWARD SNOWDEN, Moscow, 2014

S OON AFTER Snowden failed to get an SES job at the NSA in Sep-
tember 2012, he intensified his rogue activities. As we've seen,
part of Snowden’s job as a system administrator under contract to
Dell was transferring files held at Fort Meade to backup computers
in Hawaii. He “was moving copies of that data there for them,” said
Deputy Director Ledgett, “which was perfect cover for stealing the
[NSA] data” through the fall and winter of 2012. The security mea-
sures at the Hawaii base presented no obstacles to him because, as
a system administrator, he had privileges that allowed him to copy
documents that had not been encrypted. Indeed, it was part of the
process of building the backup system. The flaw he had pointed to
in Japan, in which system administrators working solo could safely
steal files, also existed in Hawaii, as we know. This time, however,
instead of bringing it to the attention of the NSA, he used it to steal
files.

Snowden could be confident that his thefts of documents would
go undetected. Real-time auditing of the movement of documents,

Absolutely. 23rd is great. I teach my seminar that day at 1 but could tape in the morning or after class--in my 
office (very private), or at the Harvardx studios (less) or in the Woodberry poetry room (the nicest place). . If 
Woody wanted, we could bring some students into the taping or just do the two of us... 
Woody is absolutely welcome to come to the seminar, of course 
John McCain, Tony Kushner, Al Gore have all signed on the last 2 days...crazy

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018265.txt,"In our own age, a fundamental conflict lingers as well. This is the struggle between
individual liberty and connection. We have to ask a version of Hayek’s question: Are
we happier, better off, more justly fulfilled through ceaseless linkage to the fast
systems all around us? The appeal of constant connection is not a mere economic
fact. It’s become a feature our personalities and psychologies and even the
biochemistry of our brains. To be disconnected, in so many senses, hurts. And while
the human twitch for freedom remains as alive as a protection for us all, Hayek's
second safety catch is eroding. Networks of deep connection, speed and intelligence
will be powerfully more efficient than central planning; they know more than any
central bureacrat might have. And they may yet be even more productive at times in
their connection and intelligence than our existing structures or markets or
electoral systems. Think of the way centralized, linked dispatch systems make a
“sharing” economy of on-demand cars and rooms available in ways the market itself
could not. Similar alluring evolutions lie ahead in medicine, in finance, in politics.
The temptation to throw all in for some sort of technological political fusion, one
that promises better returns on our time and money in exchange for our liberty, will
grow. When we depend so much on connection for our identity, our work, and our
safety how far from John Stuart Mill’s line from On Liberty might we tread: “Over
himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.”34+ Are we
sovereign over our own bodies and minds? Over the machines? This is nota puzzle
today’s power class can or should touch. They may accidentally lead us to disaster.
Hayek’s fear, that in pursuing one end (freedom) leaders would secure its opposite
(tyranny), is what we should share. The tools of the network age are ripe for misuse.
In some senses, they are built for misuse: They are opaque. They are blindingly fast.
They seduce and enmesh us with their new power. They demand, as a result, new
sensibility for their final control.

There are many ways we will explore the Seventh Sense. The rise and fall of startup
technology companies or terror groups or epidemics will lead us. We will examine,
carefully, the tensions of a network age to understand where the cracks are coming
from, and where new ideas are emerging. But I’m trying at least to write a bit with
that challenge of Master Nan in mind. If we are, really, facing an ephochal change
then we should handle the problems of our era with particular care; we should
study the opportunities with real urgency. Two hundred years from now when the
great companies and billionaires and revolutionaries of our age are crushed down
below the horizon of history, it is the massive movements of states and populations
that will remain, with their awful or wondrous traces. Will we live in an age of war
or peace?

Is that something we can actually decide?

“What about Marshall?”
“Thurgood had a drinking problem that got him into some sexual trouble. He went into therapy
and Hoover gave him a pass.”

I asked Bazelon how he knew, and he told me that Marshall had sought his advice about a
therapist and that the Goldberg story was well known among his close circle of friends.

I was deeply disappointed, but the new information didn’t diminish my respect for the two giants
of the law. It did confirm my belief that there are no heroes without clay feet. It also confirmed
my belief that J. Edgar Hoover was among the most powerful and dangerous forces in
Washington.

About a year after I finished my clerkship with Justice Goldberg the phone rang one night. It was
Dorothy Goldberg, she was sobbing, “Alan, make him change his mind.” Justice Goldberg had
decided to leave the Supreme Court in order to become the U.S. Representative to the U.N. Mrs.
Goldberg was very upset with her husband’s decision, but there was nothing I could say that
would make him change his mind. He talked about patriotism and the need to end the war in
Vietnam and insisted that he was doing the right thing.

Five years after he retired from the Supreme Court, Justice Goldberg decided to run for governor.
He asked his former law clerks, including current Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer and me,
to help him in his campaign. Goldberg was a stiff campaigner, and not particularly knowledgeable
about New York. Once while eating a knish at Yona Shimmel’s on Houston in the Lower East
Side, he told the assembled press how pleased he was to be in Brooklyn. A few days later a friend
of mine who was a reporter with the Daily News called to have me comment on a story he was
writing concerning how stiff and formal Justice Goldberg was. He said he had heard reports that
he required his former law clerks still to call him “Mr. Justice.” It was absolutely true. I told my
friend that I would get back to him with a comment. I then went in to see the Justice and told him
about the upcoming story. He replied, “Well it’s true so why don’t you just confirm it.” I said,
“Mr. Justice can’t we just change it.” He said, “No, I want you to continue to call me Mr.
Justice.” I replied with a compromise, “How about if we continue to call you Mr. Justice in
private but we call you Arthur or Art or Artie in public?” He reluctantly agreed to be called
“Arthur” in public, so long as we still continued to call him “Mr. Justice” in private. I called him
“Mr. Justice” till the day he died. Needless to say, he lost the election to Nelson Rockefeller.

Justice Goldberg always wanted me to become a judge, perhaps even a Justice. I never had any
interest in wearing a robe since judging requires the kind of passivity that is not suitable to my
temperament. I was surprised that Justice Goldberg was so insistent since he himself had left the
bench after only 3 years. I don’t think I would have lasted 3 months. In any event, I never lived
my life so as to make it possible to be nominated for anything that required confirmation. I was
once flattered by a magazine article that listed some of the most talented but unconfirmable
people in America. I was included on that honor roll. My friend Steve Breyer on the other hand,
was always the perfect judge and I worked hard behind the scenes to do everything I could to
help his chances of serving on the bench. I helped him get confirmed for the Court of Appeals
and lobbied President Clinton to appoint him to the Supreme Court. On the night of his
nomination, he had his wife came to our home for an intimate celebration of his assuming the

BofAML US 1 list

The BofAML US1 list is a collection of the firm’s best investment ideas managed with
the goal of providing superior investment performance over the long term. Since the
presidential election, the ’trump tax rally’ that has arguably lifted the broader S&P500
on the expectation of lower corporate taxes has left most US oils lagging given the
absence of any benefit from lower taxes. For Hess, we believe the catalysts are still
ahead while the relative performance hurdle associated with the election has passed.
For this reason, Hess replaces DVN as our energy stock on the BofAML US1 list.

program back by years. And even if the Iranians knew it was coming, they’d be
able to do nothing to stop it.

“Our problem, Mr, President,” I said, “is that we can’t be sure our friend will
show up. Since Iran is already very nearly in a zone of immunity against an Israeli
attack, we can’t afford to wait until the afternoon. By then, with our capabilities,
we won’t even be able to give the bully a black eye.” I said I trusted what he’d just
told me. “I’m sure it genuinely reflects your intentions now. But there are no
futures contracts in statesmanship. There’s no way that you, or any leader, can
commit yourself to what will happen in a year or two. When the moment of
decision arrives, nothing will be able to free you from the responsibility to look at
the situation as it is then, with American interests in mind.”

He accepted the point. But he reiterated his view that “kinetic action” — US
security-speak for a military strike — would not only remove his ability to exhaust
the non-military alternatives. He said it wouldn’t be in Israel’s interests, either.
“We hear that even people high up in your military, in military intelligence and the
Mossad, are against it.”

That, I couldn’t deny. “We highly respect our top people in the military, and in
intelligence. We make a point of listening to them before taking action,” I said.
“But here’s the difference. When they look up, they see Netanyahu, or me. When
Bibi and I look up, we see heaven. Whoever is up there, we clearly can’t go to
them for advice. We are responsible for Israel’s security.”

The president smiled, but brought the discussion back down to earth. When he
again urged us to consider the American position in any decision, I replied: “Mr
President, I feel compelled to tell you frankly how I see the situation. We highly
appreciate, and are grateful, that America supports Israel in so many ways. I
believe we’re doing our best to support American interests in the Middle East as
well. But when it comes to issues critical for the security and future of Israel, and
in a way for the future of the Jewish people, we can’t afford to delegate
responsibility even to our best friend and ally. When we face such situations, we
have to decide on our own, and act on our decisions. I would expect the United
States, and you as its president, to respect that position.” He did not seem
especially happy with what I’d said. But he showed no anger. Though we differed,
it was clear that he understood and respected our position. In any case, I believed it

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024042.txt,"V. NEW LEAF VENTURE PARTNERS INVESTMENT STRATEGY

New Leaf’s investment strategy is differentiated in the venture capital industry in terms of its
sector focus, specific approaches within each sector, and the depth of experience and long-term
track record that supports each element of the strategy. NLV-III will be invested in a diversified
portfolio across four sectors: a primary focus on Biopharmaceuticals and Information
Convergence, and a secondary focus on Medical Devices and Biological Research Tools &
Infrastructure. The Fund Managers believe that these are the sectors within the healthcare
technology industry where, with a targeted and specific sector strategy, there is the potential to
generate attractive returns within a time frame consistent with the goals of investors in a
venture capital fund. Importantly, the drivers behind the opportunity for value creation, major
risk factors, capital requirements, timelines, and universe of potential acquirers in each of these
sectors are distinct, and thus a portfolio constructed with investments with a combination of
these will benefit from this diversification.

The Fund Managers will invest the Fund in a diversified portfolio composed of an estimated 24
- 28 companies that will be predominantly domiciled in the U.S., but could include a small
number of companies based in Western Europe or Canada. The Fund Managers intend to serve
on the boards of directors for the majority of the companies in the portfolio and will generally
seek to establish ownership positions in companies that are large enough to allow them to exert
considerable influence on the company’s strategies, budgets, financing plans, operating
objectives, management team composition, and paths to exit.

Consistent with past transitions between funds, the Fund Managers have evolved the
investment strategy for NLV-III to reflect the team’s view of where the most attractive
opportunities will exist during the life of the Fund. The investment strategy for NLV-III will be
distinct from other recent funds in terms of the specific weightings that will be placed on the
targeted sectors, and certain considerations for company selection within those sectors.

BIOPHARMACEUTICALS INVESTMENT STRATEGY

As in all previous funds, biopharmaceutical investments will be the core focus for NLV-III and
will comprise approximately 50% - 60% of the Fund. The Fund’s biopharmaceutical
investments will be mostly in development stage and commercial stage private companies, and
will also likely include some investments in small capitalization public companies through
structured transactions. The Fund Managers intend to construct a well-diversified portfolio of
biopharmaceutical investments that includes a balanced mix of companies with earlier stage
and later stage development programs and product platform technologies. Regardless of stage,
by focusing on biopharmaceutical investments ahead of key risk inflection points, the Fund
Managers expect to fund companies through the periods of greatest value creation to points
where they will either become attractive targets for acquisition or partnership, or become of
high interest to public market investors. In some cases, private companies whose underlying
assets mature to these stages will become viable candidates for initial public offerings (IPOs) or
mergers into public companies.

104 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 59, *98

220

Notably, while the strength of these rights varies from state to state, nearly forty states require the prosecuting attorney to

notify or confer with the victim regarding plea negotiations. 77! Several jurisdictions involve the victim in the charging
decision. 722 In some states, law enforcement and prosecutors must involve the victim at any critical 723 or crucial 74
stage of the criminal proceeding; and in a minority of jurisdictions, the judge must ascertain whether the prosecutor has

afforded the victim statutory protections prior to accepting a plea agreement. ?7°

The general contours of state provisions suggest that several state governments have recognized the value in informing victims
of their rights and involving them in the criminal process prior to the formal filing of charges. ?°° Indeed, a brief look at the
statutory protections illustrates the extent to which states have attempted to afford protections to victims long before the formal
filing of charges.

[*99] For example, Arizona has adopted a constitutional amendment and statutes that expansively protect victims. Under
Arizona law, the definition of victim hinges on whether a criminal offense has been committed, and the term criminal offense
is defined as conduct that gives a peace officer or prosecutor probable cause to believe a crime has occurred. 777 In short, a
victim's status does not hinge on the formal filing of charges but rather on the criminal conduct itself. 77° Arizona law
enforcement personnel must give information to victims describing their rights as soon as possible, even if formal charges have
not yet been filed, and a victim may request that the prosecutor discuss the disposition of the case, including a decision not to
proceed with a criminal prosecution, dismissal, plea, or sentence negotiations and pretrial diversion programs. 27? A victim
may even pursue some rights if counts are dismissed. 73° Arizona courts have also permitted victims to invoke their rights in
the context of civil forfeiture proceedings. 73!

Hawaii's victims’ rights statute illustrates how a state has defined the term case more expansively than the limited definition
advocated by the Department in order to facilitate victim participation. By statute in Hawaii, victims must, upon request, be
informed of major developments in any felony case. 73? Along a similar vein, the prosecuting attorney must consult or

Victims of Crime, 25 New Eng. J. on Crim. & Civ. Confinement 21, 64 & n.168 (1999) (citing to victims' rights statutes in Connecticut,
Illinois, and Michigan, among others). Unfortunately, as some commentators have noted, the notice and conferral provisions in some states
are ambiguous, and the absence of case law precludes a definitive understanding of the reach of the right in some jurisdictions. See LaFave et
al., supra note 168, § 21.3(f), at 1041-42; see also, e.g., Kan. Stat. Ann. § 74-7333(a)(5) (2002) (The views and concerns of victims should
be ascertained and the appropriate assistance provided throughout the criminal process.). In some jurisdictions, the ambiguous use of an
illustrative list could be read as suggesting that a particular right, such as conferral, hinges on formal charges. See, e.g., Kv. Rev. Stat. Ann. §
421.500(6) (LexisNexis Supp. 2012) (requiring consultation on disposition of the case including dismissal, release of defendant pending

A few things to think about: 
If the Patterson book is being published in August, that presents some time frame issues. You would not be 
able to do a competing book or documentary before then. This is not to say that they shouldn't be pursued. In a 
sense, better that they know what Patterson's position is and, a year from now say, be able to counter it. I have 
some thoughts on book and doc to share at your convenience. 
That being said, you do need an immediate counter narrative to the book. I believe Trump offers an ideal 
opportunity. It's a chance to make the story about something other than you, while, at the same time, letting 
you frame your own story. Also, becoming an anti-Trump voice gives you a certain political cover which you 
decidedly don't have now. Still, this necessary involves you going public. And so the most basic decision is 
about your willingness to do that. My view is that in a couple of weeks you could master message and 
technical proficiency. I know a bunch of people who could be very helpful here. This would involve something 
along the lines of you writing an op-ed, doing a high profile television interview (Charlie Rose, I'd say), and 
perhaps some social media efforts. 
Speaking of which, again, I think a strategic plan, involving your public identity, philanthropic activities and 
interests, and the development of media allies, ought finally to be put in place. A big, comprehensive, 
expensive effort. 
The alternative is to continue to keep head down and hope Patterson book is just more he-said she-said and 
Connolly getting lost in the reeds (which, as an inveterate conspiracist, he always does). My worry is that 
Patterson can be counted on to produce a bestseller, and while he isn't regarded as a serious writer, he'll surely 
be unloading a lot of tabloid copy. Because this will be tied to the election, the Trump-Clinton angle will amp 
up the attention 10-fold, in fact, possibly, a hundred fold. Possibly more than anything you've encountered 
before. 
Meanwhile--
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 032858 
In a lawyer's letter, I'd suggest including the following points--not necessarily legal, but a warning about how a 
press campaign might unfold (publishers are more worried about being caught in negative media controversy 
than they are of legal threats): 
1) Little, Brown has made on the record representations to at least one well-known journalist that it was not 
publishing a book by James Patterson about Jeffrey Epstein--possibly an effort to avoid inquiries about the 
questionable nature of the book; 
2) The actual author of the book, John Connolly, is someone other than the stated author, James Patterson. 
Connolly is known to have developed an obsession with Epstein, such that, his longtime employer, Vanity 
Fair, has refused to allow him to write about Epstein for the magazine; 
3) Sources have confirmed for us that Patterson has had little more than a minimal consulting role in the book, 
and that Connolly has functioned in every material way as the book's researcher and writer. We believe 
Patterson's authorship of the book will not stand up to scrutiny. And, indeed, that the entire notion of an 
extension of the Patterson franchise into nonfiction, as it has been used in fiction and children's book--
effectively other authors writing under the Patterson name—presents a host of journalism ethical issues.

became highly sought after in Paris,
where he would routinely “mesmerize”
his followers—one of whom was Marie
Antoinette. The King wasn’t buying it,
however, and he asked a commission of
the French Academy of Sciences to
look into the claims. (The members in-
cluded Franklin, the chemist Antoine
Lavoisier, and Joseph Guillotin—who
invented the device that would eventu-
ally separate the King’s head from his
body.) The commission replicated some
of Mesmer’s sessions, and, in one case,
asked a young boy to hug magnetized
trees that were presumed to contain the
healing powers invoked by Mesmer. He
did as directed and responded as ex-
pected: he shook, convulsed, and
swooned. The trees, though, were not
magnetic, and Mesmer was denounced
as a fraud. Placebos and lies were inter-
twined in the public mind.

It was another hundred and fifty years
before scientists began to focus on the
role that emotions can play in healing.
During the Second World War, Lieu-
tenant Colonel Henry Beecher—who
went on to become the first chairman of
the anesthesia department at Massachu-
setts General Hospital—attempted to
assess the degree to which the severity
of a soldier's injuries corresponded to
the amount of pain he felt. In Europe,
Beecher met with more than two hun-
dred soldiers, gravely wounded but still
coherent enough to talk; he asked each
man if he wanted morphine. Seventy-
five per cent declined.

Beecher was astounded. He knew
from his experience before the war that
civilians with similar injuries would have
begged for morphine, and he had seen
healthy soldiers complain loudly about
the pain associated with minor inconve-
niences, like receiving vaccinations. He
concluded that the difference had to do
with expectations; a soldier who survived
a terrible attack often had a positive out-
look simply because he was still alive.
Beecher made a simple but powerful ob-
servation: our expectations can have a
profound impact on how we heal.

Armed with this information, and
with his conviction that the placebo
effect could be harnessed to help relieve
suffering, Beecher returned to the United
States and continued his research. In

1955, he published an article called “The

32 THE NEW YORKER, DECEMBER 12, 2011

Powerful Placebo,” in which he wrote
that “placebos have a high degree of ther-
apeutic effectiveness in treating subjec-
tive responses.” The paper has been cited
more than a thousand times by other sci-
entists, and Beecher’s conclusion—that
the placebo effect plays a critical role
in almost any medical intervention—
influenced much of what has followed in
clinical research. His basic supposition
was correct: emotions and expectations
can affect our perception of pain.

Before Beecher’s work, new drugs
were tested in a haphazard manner; since
then, they have always been compared
with a placebo or with another drug. But
Beecher’s methodology was deeply
flawed. Although he reported that place-
bos were effective more than a third of
the time, he shrugged off a phenomenon
known as “regression to the mean.” Over
time, the condition of most patients
improves, with or without treatment.
A person who enrolls in a clinical study
when he is feeling particularly bad is
likely to improve solely as a result of the
natural course of the illness, not because
he was given a placebo. (And people
often enroll in such studies when they are
sickest.) A patient who knows that he is
in a study also may expect a better thera-
peutic result than one who doesn’t. Ifyou
believe that doctors are particularly atten-
tive, you can get better more rapidly, even
if they aren't. This is known as the Haw-
thorne effect. (There is also a “nocebo
effect.” Expecting a placebo to do harm
or cause pain makes people sicker, not
better. When subjects in one notable
study were told that headaches are a side
effect of lumbar puncture, the number of
headaches they reported after the study
was finished increased sharply.)

For years, researchers could do little
but guess at the complex biology of the
placebo response. A meaningful picture
began to emerge only in the nineteen-
seventies, with the discovery of endor-
phins: substances secreted in the brain
that are chemically similar to opiates like
morphine and heroin. The discovery led
to the novel idea that, in effect, the brain
produces its own pharmacy. In 1978,
three scientists from the University of
California at San Francisco—Jon Levine,
Newton Gordon, and Howard Fields—
decided to investigate whether endor-
phins might explain why patients who
received placebos often reported a

significant reduction in pain. People re-
covering from dental surgery were told
that they were about to receive a dose of
morphine, saline, or a drug that might
increase their pain. By then, researchers
had learned not only about the nocebo
effect but that a suggestion of relief will
often trigger the production of endor-
phins, so they were not surprised that pa-
tients receiving saline reported reduced
pain.

What came next, however, funda-
mentally reshaped the field. The re-
searchers dismissed the subjects who re-
ceived morphine and then divided the
remaining participants into those who
responded to the placebo and those who
didn’t. Then they introduced Naloxone
into patients’ 1.V. drips. Naloxone was
developed to counteract overdoses of
heroin and morphine. It works essen-
tially by latching onto, and thus locking
up, key opioid receptors in the central
nervous system. The endorphins that we
secrete attach themselves to the same re-
ceptors in the same way, so Naloxone
blocks them, too. The researchers theo-
rized that, if endorphins had caused the
placebo effect, Naloxone would negate
their impact, and it did. The Naloxone
caused those who responded positively to
the placebos to experience a sharp in-
crease in pain; the drug had no effect on
the people who did not respond to the
placebo. The study was the first to pro-
vide solid evidence that the chemistry be-
hind the placebo effect could be under-
stood—and altered.

“Tt was one of those studies that make
the scales fall from your eyes,” Kaptchuk
told me. “T had just started to think about
the placebo eftect—scientifically and his-
torically. And here comes this paper that
says that, even if it’s all in your head, there
is still a biological mechanism driving
these reactions. It was very exciting.”

aptchuk assumed that the results

would add legitimacy to the field.
He was wrong. “Things are better than
they were,” he said. “But even now, you
know, people at Harvard talk about pla-
cebos the way the Popes used to talk
about medicine. They declared that Jews
were not allowed to treat Christians—
not because they were not good doctors
but because it would have been ethically
wrong. These are ethical judgments mas-
querading as science. Because from the

The CCP has also asserted control over news outlets
in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Chinese diaspora commu-
nities around the world.’® Beijing has used pressure
tactics and exerted influence through intermediaries
to change editors or owners of critical outlets in

Hong Kong.’? Wealthy progovernment forces from the
mainland have begun to buy up media outlets in Hong
Kong and elsewhere. And there have been instances
in which businessmen with economic interests in
China have attempted to expand their media holdings
in Taiwan.**

Perhaps more disturbing is China's effort to purchase
influence in global culture through its state-affiliated
and nominally private companies. For example, Visual
China Group, a mainland company, has purchased
the image and licensing division of Corbis, a company
that controls a huge archive of historically important
photographs. The trove includes iconic photographs
of the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations,
which CCP censors have worked hard to keep out of
the Chinese media. Those involved in the sale offered
assurances that the new owners would not hinder the
global circulation of politically sensitive images, but
there is little to prevent them from casting aside such
pledges at some future date.°?

Another Chinese company, Dalian Wanda Group,

has raised concerns with its rapid incursions into the
U.S. film industry. Already the world’s largest owner
of cinemas, including the second-largest U.S. theater
chain, Wanda purchased Legendary Entertainment, a
production company, in 2016 and is said to be inter-
ested in gaining control of a major Hollywood studio.
American lawmakers were sufficiently disturbed by
Wanda’ initiatives to request a Justice Department in-
vestigation. There is concern that China's companies,
with state encouragement, are pursuing influence in

Hollywood to ensure a favorable depiction of China
and its CCP regime in major films.°° Even with studios
under U.S. ownership, the international media have
repeatedly uncovered cases in which U.S. filmmakers
altered elements of their work to address or anticipate
the objections of Chinese censors, who serve as gate-
keepers to the country's lucrative domestic market.

Exploiting democratic culture for authoritarian ends
Ironically, some products of democratic culture have
facilitated the work of modern authoritarian propa-
gandists. The notion that there is no such thing as
objective truth and that history is nothing more than a
contest of competing narratives owes its popularity to
radical theorists who have gained a strong foothold in
academia and even among some who call themselves
journalists, such as Glenn Greenwald.

While accusations that the press is biased or publish-
es lies are common in American political campaigns,
the hysterical charges hurled by Donald Trump against
the media during the 2016 presidential campaign
served to reinforce the Kremlin's model of a world in
which the truth is determined by power rather than
impartial investigation.

Moscow especially makes shrewd use of an unfortu-
nate journalistic habit in which evenhandedness—a
worthy goal when presenting two sides in a genuine
debate—is improperly applied, so that patently false
assertions are treated as symmetrical with legitimate
views or facts.

Many outside Russia would not disagree with Kise-
lyov's dismissive views on the concept of impartial
reporting. In meeting the challenge of authoritarian
propaganda, a good place to start would be a reaffir-
mation of the central role occupied by high-quality,
traditional journalism in democratic societies.

of primitive musical instruments. Variations like this could be helpful but aren’t necessary for
the world to serve its essential purpose.

Note that one does not have true fluid dynamics in BlocksNBeadsWorld, but, it seems that
the latter is not necessary to encompass the phenomena covered in cognitive developmental
tests or preschool tasks. The tests and tasks that are done with fluids can instead be done with
masses of beads. For example, consider the conservation of volume task shown in Figures 16.1
and 16.2 below: it’s easy enough to envision this being done with beads rather than milk. Even
a few hundred beads is enough to be psychologically perceived as a mass rather than a set
of discrete units, and to be manipulated and analyzed as such. And the simplification of not
requiring fluid mechanics in one’s virtual world is immense.

Next, one can implement equations via which the adhesion coefficients of a bead are deter-
mined in part by the adhesion coefficients of nearby beads, or beads that are nearby in certain
directions (with direction calculated in local spherical coordinates). This will allow for complex
cracking and bending behaviors — not identical to those in the real world, but with similar qual-
itative characteristics. For example, without this feature one could create paperlike substances
that could be cut with scissors — but with this feature, one could go further and create woodlike
substances that would crack when nails were hammered into them in certain ways, and so forth.

Further refinements are certainly possible also. One could add multidimensional adhesion
coefficients, allowing more complex sorts of substances. One could allow beads to vibrate at
various frequencies, which would lead to all sorts of complex wave patterns in bead compounds.
Etc. In each case, the question to be asked is: what important cognitive abilities are dramatically
more easily learnable in the presence of the new feature than in its absence?

The combination of blocks and beads seems ideal for implementing a more flexible and AGI-
friendly type of virtual body than is currently used in games and virtual worlds. One can easily
envision implementing a body with

a skeleton whose bones consist of appropriately shaped blocks

joints consisting of beads, flexibly adhered to the bones

flesh consisting of beads, flexibly adhered to each other

internal “plumbing” consisting of tubes whose walls are beads rigidly adhered to each other,
and flexibly adhered to the surrounding flesh (the plumbing could then serve to pass beads
through, where slow passage would be ensured by weak adhesion between the walls of the
tubes and the beads passing through the tubes)

moO NM

This sort of body would support rich kinesthesia; and rich, broad analogy-drawing between
the internally-experienced body and the externally-experienced world. It would also afford many
interesting opportunities for flexible movement control. Virtual animals could be created along
with virtual humanoids.

Regarding the extended mind, it seems clear that blocks and beads are adequate for the
creation of a variety of different tools. Equipping agents with “glue guns” able to affect the
adhesive properties of both blocks and beads would allow a diversity of building activity; and
building with masses of beads could become a highly creative activity. Furthermore, beads
with appropriately specified adhesion (within the framework outlined above) could be used
to form organically growing plant-like substances, based on the general principles used in L-
system models of plant growth (Prusinciewicz and Lindenmayer 1991). Structures with only
beads would vaguely resemble herbaceous plants; and structures involving both blocks and
beads would more resemble woody plants. One could even make organic structures that flourish

NYT
Setting Sail on Gaza’s Sea of Spin

Ethan Bronner

July 2, 2011 -- SOME see a parallel with the Exodus, the ship filled
with Jewish refugees that tried to break the British blockade of
Palestine in 1947 and helped sway world opinion toward Zionism.
Others are struck by the insistence on transporting basic aid — food
and cement — when it is no longer needed. Still others note the way
the Israeli authorities portray the organizers as violent Islamists when
most are middle-aged European pacifists.

Almost everything about the flotilla stuck in Greece and waiting to
challenge Israel’s blockade of Gaza seems to be a parable for
something else, part of an unstated effort to recast the Israeli-
Palestinian narrative in extreme terms. Instead of helping to clarify
what Gaza needs and how it might build a future, the saga has merely
brought out the public relations demons on all sides.

Ostensibly the 10 or so boats, with several hundred advocates from
more than a dozen countries, are trying to take goods to Gaza because
of a siege imposed by Israel and Egypt to pressure Hamas, the
Islamist ruler there. A year ago a similar flotilla was stopped by the
Israeli Navy, and after commandos boarded and scuffles ensued, nine
activists were killed.

The international outrage that followed helped force an easing of the
siege. One result, largely unacknowledged by the flotilla leaders: far
more goods have gone into Gaza over the past year, and while the 1.6
million people there still need many things, basic supplies are not
among them.

Israel is therefore quick to say that Gaza is well provided for and does
not need any flotilla. [fit still wants to bring in aid, it should take it

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019240.txt,"BREAKING DOWN DEMOCRACY: Goals, Strategies, and Methods of Modern Authoritarians

common ideologies, whether faith in Marxist revolution
or ultraconservative, anticommunist reaction.

As the 20th century drew to a close, the weaknesses
of both communist systems and traditional dictator-
ships became increasingly apparent. Front and center
was the growing economic gap between countries
that had opted for market economies and regimes
that were committed to statist economies.

The political and economic barriers that had long shel-
tered the old dictatorships were soon swept away, and
those that survived or recovered did so by making a

series of strategic concessions to the new global order.

odern authoritarianism has a different set of defin-

ing features:

¢ Anillusion of pluralism that masks state control
over key political institutions, with co-opted or
otherwise defanged opposition parties allowed
to participate in regular elections

¢ State or oligarchic control over key elements of
the national economy, which is otherwise open
to the global economy and private investment,
to ensure loyalty to the regime and bolster
regime claims of legitimacy based on economic
prosperity

¢ State or oligarchic control over information on
certain political subjects and key sectors of the
media, which are otherwise pluralistic, with high
production values and entertaining content; in-
dependent outlets survive with small audiences
and little influence

¢ Suppression of nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs) that are focused on human rights or
political reform, but state tolerance or support
for progovernment or apolitical groups that work
on public health, education, and other develop-
ment issues

¢ Legalized political repression, with targets pun-
ished through vaguely worded laws and political-
ly obedient courts

¢ Limited, selective, and typically hidden use of
extralegal force or violence, with a concentration
on political dissidents, critical journalists, and
officials who have fallen from favor

¢ Opportunistic, non-ideological cooperation with

fellow authoritarian states against pressure
for democratic reform or leadership changes,
international human rights norms and mech-
anisms, and international security or justice
interventions

¢ Knowledge-sharing with or emulation of fellow
authoritarian states regarding tactics and legis-
lation to enhance domestic control

China and Russia
The two major modern authoritarian powers are China
and Russia.

Until fairly recently, the conventional wisdom was that
China's one-party authoritarian system would gradual-
ly relax as the middle class expanded and the country
became fully integrated into the global economic

and diplomatic systems. The leadership did expand
citizens’ freedom to travel, make money, and access
information and entertainment that did not touch on
sensitive subjects. But it has resolutely refused to give
up control over the political sphere.

In fact, the state has become increasingly aggressive
in its suppression of political dissent and information
that might challenge the Communist Party narrative.
The regime's rhetoric and policies have become more
hostile to democracy and “Western” values. Its propa-
ganda asserts the superior efficiency of the one-party
system and sneers at the messiness of democracy.
And the focus of its repressive apparatus has steadily
expanded from a relatively narrow segment of political
opposition figures to encompass a broad collection of
target groups, including human rights lawyers, ethnic
minorities, Christians, women’s rights advocates, liber-
al academics, and independent journalists.

Russia is much smaller than China in terms of pop-
ulation and economic might, but it has emerged as
a leader of modern authoritarian innovation. Under
Vladimir Putin, the Russian regime pioneered the
capture of the media through state enterprises and
oligarchic cronies, the adoption of laws designed to
dismember civil society, the use of the judiciary as
an instrument of political harassment, and, perhaps
most importantly of all, the development of modern
propaganda and disinformation.

Russia has also been in the vanguard of a relentless
campaign against liberal values, and has moved
relentlessly to export authoritarian ideas and tech-
niques to other societies, both in neighboring

Since 2005, the Fund Managers have managed the remaining portfolio of healthcare technology
investments in Sprout Capital VI, L.P., Sprout Capital VII, L.P., and Sprout Capital IX, L.P.
under a Sub-Management Agreement between Credit Suisse and New Leaf Venture Partners,
L.L.C. (the “Management Company”). In return for these management services, the
Management Company had received a portion of the management fee collected by those Sprout
funds related to the healthcare portfolio.

At the present time, Sprout Capital IX, L.P. is the only fund with any remaining active
healthcare technology investments. There were six active health care technology companies
(three board seats) in the Sprout Capital IX, L.P. portfolio that are managed by the Fund
Managers, which represented $68 million of carrying value as of March 31, 2014. These
remaining investments are in mature companies and the Fund Managers intend to continue to
manage the investments with an emphasis on finding exit opportunities for each company at an
appropriate time. The Fund Managers have already exited a portion of these companies in
early 2014, leaving a very limited tail of Sprout investments and board seats.

The Fund Managers expect the arrangement with Credit Suisse to continue for the foreseeable
future, but the Management Company no longer receives any management fees for these
services. The Sub-Management Agreement between Credit Suisse and the Management
Company will wind down and eventually be terminated as the investments in the Sprout
Capital IX, L.P. portfolio are exited.

Preface

My father always told me that I would be a teacher. He didn’t mean
it in a nice way. My father talked in riddles. As the only child in the
house, I had plenty of time and opportunity to figure out what he was
really saying. This was it: I am afraid that like me, the best you will be
able to do in life is to be a civil service worker. He was also saying: If he
had realized he was going to be a civil service worker, at least he could
have been a teacher, which he might have enjoyed. He wasn’t really
talking about me at all.

I never had any intention of being a teacher. I didn’t particularly
like school and later, when I became a professor, the part of the job I
disliked the most was the teaching. One might wonder how I wound
up being a professor if I disliked teaching, and one might wonder why
Tam writing a book about teaching if I dislike teaching. One also might
wonder whether I still dislike teaching. Yes. And no. It depends on what
one means by teaching, which is, after all, what this book is about.

The other day my 3-year-old grandson Milo told me he was going
to teach me how to throw rocks. It seemed an odd idea. What could he
mean by this? To Milo, “teach” means to tell someone what to do and
how to do it and then have the person do it too. Teach is part of tell
plus imitate for Milo. Milo is 3. It is not too surprising that this is what
teach means to him. It is a little surprising that he thinks he should
be his grandfather’s teacher, but that is another issue. But it is really
no shock that Milo thinks this is what teach means. It is what nearly
everyone thinks teach means. The commonly accepted usage of teach
is tell and then have the person who was told, do what he was told.
This certainly is not what teach ought to mean, or more important, is
not what good teaching is. And, every good teacher knows this. The
problem is that the system that employs teachers doesn’t know it and
more or less insists that Milo’s definition be the one that is followed.

Actually, Iam being too generous here. Milo’s view, namely, that
after he tells me, I will do what he has said, is a better definition of

104 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 59, *89

CVRA protections - i.e., victims of misdemeanor offenses prosecuted by way of complaint - will never have proper venue to
assert those rights because, according to OLC's strained argument, no prosecution ever started in their cases.

Even limiting the focus to felony cases, OLC misleadingly describes the Sixth Amendment case law. It is not immediately
clear why one would look to the right to counsel to determine the breadth of the term prosecution in the Sixth Amendment.
The right to counsel is not the only right found in that Amendment. The Amendment also extends, for example, a right to a
speedy trial in all criminal prosecutions. !’* The case law on the speedy trial right makes clear that the right may attach
before an indictment and as early as the time of arrest and holding to answer a criminal charge. 174

In any event, the right to counsel cases are quite clear in providing that a Sixth Amendment prosecution can (and often does)
begin well before an indictment. !’4 The Supreme Court has directly held that the Sixth Amendment's right to counsel attaches
at or after the time that judicial proceedings have been initiated against [a person] - whether by way of formal charge,
preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment. !7° Thus, under this controlling precedent, some earlier point in
time before indictment is the triggering point of a Sixth Amendment prosecution.

The cases that OLC cites are not to the contrary. It is true that some federal appeals courts have stated that the mere filing of a
criminal complaint does not trigger a Sixth Amendment right to counsel. '’° But there is a split of authority on this question,
as OLC acknowledges in a footnote. '77 More importantly for purposes of this Article, the cases holding [*90] that the mere
filing of a complaint does not start a Sixth Amendment prosecution also make clear that a later court hearing would start such a
prosecution. For instance, in the Fourth Circuit case cited by OLC, United States v. Alvarado, the court reasons that the main
reason a law enforcement officer files [] a complaint is to establish probable cause for an arrest warrant. The criminal process is
still in the investigative stage, and the adverse positions of government and defendant have yet to solidify. !78 Relying on that
reasoning, the Fourth Circuit refused to find that the right to counsel had attached merely because a police officer had filed a
complaint to get an arrest warrant. But the Fourth Circuit distinguished that situation from the initiation of adversary judicial
proceedings against the defendant. '7? An initial appearance would be such an adversary proceeding - i.e., it would be a
prosecution under the Sixth Amendment. In light of this, OLC's position that the CVRA's venue provision's no-prosecution-
underway reference covers proceedings, such as an initial appearance, does not work.

The only sensible way to construe the CVRA's venue provision is to read it as conveniently dividing criminal cases into two
phases: a prosecution phase and an earlier investigative phase when no prosecution is under way. !8° Senator Kyl, for

power ideas that are of use in nearly any sphere. How, for instance, to fight a

nation in human history, backed by hypersonic missiles, always-on radars, and
endless jet fuel that found itself unable to stop a group of half-educated and

A few days before Christmas of December of 1787, Thomas Jefferson sat down in
Paris to write a letter to James Madison.*? Madison was on the other side of the
Atlantic, in Philadelphia, and struggling with refinements to the new American
constitution, which had been drafted in the spring and summer just passed. The two
men were frequent correspondents. They wrote to each other with an easy
familiarity, revolutionary to revolutionary. Jefferson was then 44, and had settled
hungrily into his role as the American minister in France, “violently smitten,” as he
wrote, by the charms of The Continent*+. Madison was 36, twenty years removed
from the election of 1808 that would elevate him to the Presidency as Jefferson’s
successor. Madison would become, in a sense, America’s first “Foreign Policy”
President, prosecuting the war of 1812 and negotiating with France for the
Louisiana Purchase. He was known already, in 1787, as “The Father of the
Constitution.”

Jefferson begins his letter with a few of the charming literary asides we expect from
him: He asks Madison about some nuns he wants to help teach his children, inquires
after about a packet of carefully chosen South Carolina rice that has gone missing in
the oceanic post, delaying his plans to impress French palates with an American
crop. But then Jefferson turns to what he knows must be on Madison’s mind, the
new constitution. “I like much the general idea of framing a government which
should go on of itself peaceably,” he says, admiring the elegant balance that emerges
so carefully from the pages of the document. The American constitution, Jefferson
felt, reflected political arrangements new in the history of human governance,
between people and power, between states and the center, between agriculture and
commerce. He is, he says, “capitaved” by the details of what he has seen.

Opinions 1962-1963
Alan M. Dershowitz, Law Clerk”

It is a treasured possession. A year in the life of! And what a year it was.

My first case involved a man named “Daniel Jackson Oliver Wendell Holmes Morgan”—Quite a
name! Any lawyer would be proud to have been named after. “Daniel Webster,” “Andrew
Jackson” and “Oliver Wendell Holmes.” That’s what Mr. Morgan thought too. The only
problem was he wasn’t a lawyer and that wasn’t his name! He was an uneducated, but slick,
African American man whose parents were sharecroppers and who made his way to the District
of Columbia, where he apparently bought a dead lawyer’s bar certificate in a junk shop. He
started to practice law, and he did extremely well, beating real prosecutors in several cases
involving street crimes. For more than a year, he went to court and argued to juries and judges.
His reputation spread in the downtown area, as he kept winning difficult cases. Ultimately the
feds checked him out, discovered that despite his name, he wasn’t a lawyer, and charged him with
multiple counts of fraud, forgery, impersonating an officer of the court and false pretenses. He
represented himself at trial, was convicted and sentenced to 3 to 10 years in prison.

The court appointed a lawyer named Monroe Freedman to argue his appeal. Judge Bazelon
invited me to watch the oral argument.

I was blown away by Freedman’s eloquence, erudition, command of the record and ability to
further his argument while responding to hard questions. I had participated in moot court appeals
as a law student, and I had done very well—even earning a job offer from one of the judges who
was a partner at a Jewish law firm. But this was a different league. I remember thinking “I want
to be like this guy,” and wondering whether I could ever be that good. The lawyer for the
prosecution was also quite good, though not up to Freedman’s high standards. He was an
African American named Charles Duncan, who, I later was told, was the son of the singer Todd
Duncan, who had played “Porgy” in the original Broadway run of the Gershwin opera.

Following the argument, the judges conferred and unanimously decided to affirm the conviction.
I was upset, because Freedman had clearly “won” the argument and had certainly convinced me
that his client deserved a new trial, or at least a reduction in the sentence. I pleaded with Bazelon
to let me try to draft an opinion reversing the conviction. He said, “go ahead,” because he too
was somewhat sympathetic to the defendant. “But you must find a valid legal basis for reversal.
It’s not enough that the defendant’s lawyer was better than the government’s lawyer. Nor is it
enough that we think the defendant should get relief. There has to be a solid legal basis. Go
ahead and look for one.”

I searched and searched, but Freedman had mined every possible nugget from the sparse record
and to no avail. There was no plausible legal basis for reversal. I learned several important
lessons from this exercise in futility: there’s an enormous difference between winning an appellate
argument and reversing a conviction; there’s an equally significant difference between wanting to
see a conviction reversed and finding a valid basis for reversal; all the hard work in the world
cannot bring about a result if the facts and the law don’t justify it. (At least that’s what I believed
until such cases as Bush v. Gore, of which more later.)

Palestinians control of most of Hebron, and accepted further withdrawals under the
Wye River agreement. But amid predictable protests from the right, he had
promptly retreated from his Wye commitments. I knew that his default response to
Obama’s call for a settlement freeze would be “no.” And it was, delivered first to
the cabinet and then to the public, as soon as he got back from his talks with the
President.

In my repeated meetings with Bibi in the weeks that followed — both one-on-
one, and within the informal group of close ministers and aides known as the
Group of Eight — I tried to persuade him that, if only because of America’s key role
on Iran, we needed to show some sign of engagement with Obama’s efforts. I was
not entirely alone. One ally was an old friend: Dan Meridor, who had rejoined the
Likud before the election. Another was more unexpected: Avigdor Lieberman. He
was never going to accept a settlement freeze. Not only did his heart, and political
interests, lie on the West Bank. He lived there. But like many in the party he led,
he had come to Israel from the former Soviet Union, shaping a worldview that in
many ways remained European, and pro-Western. He was worried about creating
the impression of blanket Israeli intransigence toward a popular new American
President, and isolating ourselves internationally, if we didn’t go some way
towards helping to restart talks with the Palestinians.

Though Bibi showed no signs of retreat on the settlement freeze, he did accept
that broader point. Ten days after Obama’s Cairo speech, he publicly accepted the
idea of a Palestinian state for the first time, having ruled it out as recently as the
month before in his White House talks with the President. The shift was dismissed
as trivial not just by the Palestinians, but by many in my own Labor party and
almost everyone else on the left. I disagreed. I knew how deep, genuine and
longstanding Bibi’s resistance to Palestinian statehood was. But I had another,
serious concern about the “peace plan” he announced: an entirely new precondition
he insisted the Palestinians must meet if peace was ever going to be possible. He
said they must “clearly and unambiguously recognize Israel as the state of the
Jewish people.” On a whole series of levels, that made no sense to me. We hadn’t
asked Egypt or Jordan to grant us explicit recognition as a Jewish state when we
made peace with them. Even when Bibi himself had briefly tried to open
negotiations with Damascus in his first period as Prime Minister, we’d never felt
the need to ask it of the Syrians either. To the extent there was any logic in
demanding it of the Palestinians, Bibi’s reasoning seemed to be that this would

into where we were standing, making the moment feel even more surreal
on top of the already popped Xanax I had popped before for breakfast
earlier that morning. Jeffrey was in such a lighthearted mood that day,
making funny cracks at me, and acting like a flirt. When I was finished
washing him he actually wanted to wash me too, which was another
totally out of his character suggestion.

For the rest of the day, he took me everywhere with him, the office and
then to a friends place, even just wanting to hang out with me for a while.
1 wasn’t used to being treated like anything more than a dog on a leash,
when he acted like this it just completely spun me around confusing me
even more.

We were spending heaps of time together these days, a lot more than
usual. At the ranch we would do things together, alone, and not just the
usual! perverted things ] was accustomed to doing with him alone.
Horseback riding on his ranch during weekends away by ourselves and
movie nights snuggling up over a bucket of popcorn instead of having to
massage his feet during the entire film became his way to alter my
perception of my original notion that | wasn’t just his sex slave, I thought
I was finally becoming his friend.

When we went quad biking he no longer wanted me to take my own
bike, he preferred me to sit on the back of his, holding onto him tightly
and he even tried to teach me how to drive a manual stick shift car. He
was definitely trying to show a softer side of himself, different to the
stone cold slave driver | had to come to respect out of fear over the many
years. Still a hard image to change after all | had been through and seen
over the years I had been with him. Nonetheless he was still my “boss” so
I humored his attempts and matched his caring demeanor, giving him the
impression I was intrigued in our new kind of affair.

His attentiveness led into the warmer months that commenced the
beginning of long summer days that | looked forward too. I couldn’t help
but enjoy his eagerness to see me more relaxed these days. He wasn’t
even bothering me to find alternate sources of girls for his twisted
satisfaction anymore and although I was still being used for his distorted
sexual enjoyments he further seduced me into believing I meant a lot
more to him than | ever did.

It all came to a sudden conclusion one sunny afternoon in the Caribbean.
Jeffrey pulled himself up to the ladders first step and climbed up the next
four steps to the top of the dock. His chest was heaving rapidly as he sat
down catching his breath. Ghislane was the next one up and then I
followed lastly behind them. To me it was an invigorating snorkel around
the shallow reefs within the radius of the dock, but to Jeffrey the half an
hour swim in the ocean was enough to overexert his ageing limbs. I took
off my snorkel gear and placed it in the storage bench, grabbing us a few
towels at the same time. Wrapping a towel around Jeffrey’s backside and
handing one to Ghislane, ] sat down next to them on the dock and we
laughed how fatigued Jeffrey was, poking fun that he really is getting
older. A very touchy subject for the vain at heart but he didn’t seem to
mind it, probably knowing we'd never take the joke too far. We sat there
in silence for a moment, an odd silence at that. Jeffrey looked at Ghislane
and then Ghislane looked at me, placing me once again in the spotlight.
They both scooted closer to where I was sitting and I felt something
stirring in the air. The biggest turning point of events in all of my time
spent with them.

Jeffrey sat next to me and put his hand on my back and looked at me
with a certain kind of sincerity I hadn’t seen in him before. “I want to
first of all tell you that over the last few years you have shown me the
kind of devotion and loyalty that I believe is rare to find among people
these days, qualities I hold that high in regard.” Bewildered by the whole
scenario I just nodded every time he paused, trying to grasp what his
intentions were getting at. He continued to praise my nature saying “I
hope you know my appreciation for your embracing of my lifestyle, you
have been achieving a name for yourself among the friends I have
introduced you to. Everybody says basically the same thing about you,
the same thing J believe. You are a delightfully funny girl who has
developed into a mature graceful young woman and | could think of
nobody else I’d rather have a child than with than you.”

And just like that he created a whole new dilemma for me to face. In
utter shock from the completely unexpected proposition and before |
could even think of anything to respond with, Ghislane made the
finishing touches with the business end of the deal starting with the pros
before the cons “You would have around the clock nannies to help you.
Jeffrey would pay for a mansion of your choice in either Palm Beach or
New York” and as if the drumrolls were beckoning “ and... you would
have a hefty monthly allowance from Jeffrey’s bank account” Astonished
at their first offers I nearly took the bait. Then she continued to finish the
terms of our pre-agreement with “But you would have to travel with the
child where and when Jeffrey wanted you to be, and most importantly
you would have to sign a contract stating that Jeffrey and you are not

On confronting dogma, I of course agree — though in my opinion the secular religions — nationalist fanaticism, etc. — 
are much more dangerous. And if some find rational discussion offensive — as, for example, mainstream academics 
find dismantling myths of American exceptionalism or Israeli self-defense or Obama's mass murder campaign, 
etc., offensive — so be it. 
But I don't see why that should extend to ridicule. That includes astrologists. Astronomers can refute astrology, while 
recognizing that perfectly honest and deluded people may believe it and should be treated with respect, while their 
beliefs are confronted with evidence. I also don't see why we should ridicule religious dogma, just as I don't think we 
should ridicule the much more pernicious secular dogmas. Rather, we should respond to irrational belief with 
argument and evidence, while recognizing that their advocates (like most of the intellectual world in the case of 
secular dogma) are people who we should be responding to but without ridiculing them. It may be hard 
sometimes. For example, when the icon and founding father of sober non-sentimental Realism in International Affairs 
informs us that the US, unlike other countries, has a transcendental purpose, and the fact that it constantly acts in 
contradiction to its purpose doesn't matter because the facts are just abuse of history while real history is the 
evidence of history as our minds reflect it, then it's hard to avoid ridicule. But we should. There's no point ridiculing 
virtually the entire IR profession and the major journals, even though such extraordinary irrationality leads to major 
human disasters. 
On Davis, I frankly think that's a non-issue. If she decides she cannot do her job as the conditions of employment 
require (including following the law), then she can quit and look for another job. As in any other such case.

Thief

We begin by coveting what we see every day.

—HANNIBAL LECTER, The Silence of the Lambs

N HAWAII IN 2012, Snowden was living a very comfortable life.

He was earning just over $120,000 a year from Dell. His hous-
ing allowance covered the rent and the lease on his car. He worked
five days a week at the NSA base. The commute, as I timed it, took
only ten minutes. Driving past a sign marked “Restricted Area: Keep
Out,” and the security booth where NSA guards checked his cre-
dentials, he left his car in the outdoor lot for the Kunia Regional
Security Operations Center. (When I drove into the base in 2016,
I was detained nearly two hours at the security booth before being
turned back.)

Snowden worked in a three-story reinforced concrete building
called “the tunnel,” even though it was above the ground. It had
been built during World War II to serve as an aircraft assembly
plant. During the war, it was entirely covered with earth and shrub-
bery to proof it against Japanese bomber attacks. In 1980, the NSA
converted it to its regional base in Hawaii for its intelligence gather-

struggling.

And so he stopped for a moment, held my arms in place, and laid down the law. He
knows I very much prefer some kinds of pain over other kinds of pain, so he told me this:
If you want the kind of pain you like, you have to let me in close. Layer upon layer:
he's not just forcing me to take the pain; he's making me complicit. I think there were also
practical considerations, in that it was actually difficult for him to control how he hurt me
when I struggled a lot, but, still... It was so hot it made me gasp.

I'm not sure, but I suspect that a few years ago, I might not have been able to handle that
level of complicitness: forcing me to acknowledge what I like. Back then, I was too
appalled by my own desires. Now, this level of complicitness adds another level of pain
-- emotional pain; mild pain that I can cope with -- which is awesome. But although
feeling complicit is a new tactic, it's part of an old game. It's merely another kind of
predicament.

Fundamentally, what's hot about predicament bondage isn't the mechanics of what my
partner says or does. It's not about the scenario or the equipment or the exact words. It's
knowing that he won't stop hurting me, no matter how I fight or beg or scream. It's
feeling that every moment, every action reinforces how much I'm in his power.

It's knowing there's no way out.

RELATIONSHIPS:

[theory] Relationship Tools: Monogamy, Polyamory, Competition, and
Jealousy

I wrote this in 2012, but it's the culmination of over a decade of thought. I came across
my first polyamory books when I was very young, and I remember that even though I was
inexperienced, I felt super frustrated by how most polyamorists discuss jealousy. They
were incredibly un-empathic about it; the advice always seemed to boil down to Get
over it, with a dollop of Stop being so selfish, and without any acknowledgment of
how painful and difficult jealousy can be for the person who's feeling it. But at the same
time, most monogamists aren't much better about this topic! Many monogamists
approach jealousy as something that requires no examination at all.

In this essay, I'm trying to come to a better understanding of all these dynamics. I also
seek to integrate them with BDSM theory, which I'm convinced has a much stronger

Our analysis of the top 15 repatriating companies (from Table 7) suggests that while
these companies initially outperformed both the S&P 500 and equal-weighted S&P 500
from November 2004-April 2005 (by 6ppt and 5ppt, respectively), they subsequently
underperformed during the remainder of 2005 and early 2006 (Chart 6). From the end of
September 2004 through year-end 2006, these stocks were up 27% on average, in-line
with the overall S&P 500, and below the equal-weighted benchmark’s 36% return. And

Post-repatriation cash use: will this time be different?

Valuations, Investor preference, growth & leverage ratios suggest less buybacks
While any potential restrictions on the use of repatriated earnings are still unknown, we
suspect that a pick-up in buybacks is likely, but that a lower proportion will be used for
buybacks today than during the last repatriation holiday. Valuations were generally more
attractive in 2004-2005 on most metrics (Table 9), and we’ve found that buybacks tend
to be more rewarded when stocks are cheap (Chart 8). Additionally, the largest buybacks
have not generated alpha for the last several years, as investors have increasingly
agitated for companies to use their excess cash on pro-growth investments (namely
capex.) According to BofAML’s latest Global Fund Manager Survey, 60% of investors
want companies to increase capex spending, vs. 17% who want companies to return
cash to shareholders (Exhibit 1). This compares to a majority of investors desiring
companies to return cash to shareholders when the HIA was passed in late 2004.

Companies may also feel less pressure to bolster per share metrics by reducing share
count if top line is recovering and organic growth is finally materializing. And from a
capital structure perspective, if leverage loses its tax benefit, given that leverage ratios
are already high (see below) companies may be less likely to reduce their equity capital
base, as that would marginally increase their weighted average cost of capital.

Special dividends, pay-down of debt may be other likely uses

Companies may also return the cash to shareholders by issuing a one-time special
dividend: income remains in-demand, given that both interest rates and dividend payout
ratios remain historically low. And if a repatriation tax holiday comes within the context
of broader tax reform that includes an end to the deductibility of interest expense,
companies may choose to pay down debt over other uses of cash, in an attempt to skew
their balance sheets less toward debt and more toward equity (see the section on no

technical equipment.”25

Control of water in those ancient ages and control of information in our own are not
so different. We are in the midst, after all, of a change in our own “technical
equipment.” We should read Wittfogel with one eye on our own age, particularly his
warnings. “Like the tiger, the engineer of power must have the physical means with
which to crush his victims,” he wrote of those older orders. “The agromanagerial
despot,” he said of the masters of those connected water systems, “does indeed
posses such means.” We should ask: Are we watching the emergence of an
infomanagerial despotism? Who controls the dataflows we rely on now? The
protocols?

If we want to earn an honest understanding of how power works now, we need to
begin by looking under the carpet in for the marbles, in a sense. We need to touch
and follow the networks themselves, observing their construction and flow as
Wittfogel once traced the transmutation of ancient water systems into the politics of
an earlier age. We too need to go down, inside the connected systems of our era
before we can come back up and begin, confidently, to act. That journey won't
always be easy because it will require us, as we'll see, to consider some ideas that
make no sense using our current way of thinking. But, remember: The idea of a
democracy sounded like a laughable joke to hereditary heads of state until the 18%
century — Let the peasants vote for what they want? The implications of our new
networks will set uncomfortably against many of our own habits and biases - or at
least what we've been told our habits and biases should be by an older generation.
But once we have mastered this new instinct, there will finally be a day after which
we will look at the world and really feel the new logic at work. We’ll be Napoleon,
not Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel. And from that day on, everything will honestly be
different.

We are still early in this age of network revolution. It was less than 50 years ago,
after all, that the first digital communication switches emerged. Today, devices,
places, people - are all losing what we might think of as their innocence of isolation.
The “Internet of Things” will expand the range of connected devices - phones,
refrigerators, heart-lung machines - from 10 billion today to 50 billion in less than a
decade. And even with 50 billion connected points only 2 percent of the world’s
people and devices and locations will be linked?’. The analysis of this linked space is
a young discipline, younger even than the nearly newborn technologies at play. It
was only in the mid-1990s that the first sophisticated studies of “network science”

Labor leadership contest. “Shalom, Ehud,” he said when I answered the phone and,
without small talk or preliminaries, asked me: “What do you think we should do?”

I said I couldn’t offer specific suggestions. “It’s a detail-related question, and I
don’t know the details.” But I advised him on the process I felt would be needed to
come up with the right answer when the chief-of-staff, the former air force chief
Dan Halutz, briefed the cabinet. “Halutz will propose what to do. Push him,” I
said. “When he presents his recommended action, ask him for his assessment of
what Hizbollah will do in response. When he, or the head of military intelligence,
has given you the range of possibilities and told you which is the most likely, say,
OK, let’s assume that happens. What’s our next step? How is that going to lead us
to our main objectives? And what are the objectives?” Newspaper reports the next
morning said that Shimon, and only Shimon, did indeed press the chief-of-staff
about each further stage of the operation and about the aims that we wanted to
accomplish. But Halutz finally fobbed him off by saying that once they gof to the
later phases, they could discuss it.

From the first reports I received through my army contacts, I feared the
operation would go badly. There was no doubt we could inflict damage on
Hizbollah. But there were no clear answers to the questions Shimon had raised.
The initial Israeli air force response had been put in place more than five years
earlier, when I was Prime Minister. Codenamed “Operation Cinnamon Sticks,” it
was designed to take out all of the fixed Hizbollah missile sites we had been able
to identify. We knew its limitations. A lot of the rockets were fired from mobile
launchers. But in one exercise, the known “Hizbollah” sites were replicated in the
Galilee. They were destroyed in 43 minutes. I had no doubt that part of the plan
would succeed. In the early hours of July 13, it took only 34 minutes to destroy the
nearly 60 launchers we had pinpointed over the previous five years.

But Operation Cinnamon Sticks had been intended as a first step in a far wider
assault on Hizbollah and other targets, including a number of infrastructure
installations, deeper inside Lebanon. It was part of a plan for a full-scale war, if the
government decided that was necessary. As the early public statements by Olmert
and other ministers made clear, they did not intend to start a war, at least at the
outset. They certainly didn’t have a coherent plan for one. But they would soon
find themselves in Israel’s longest single armed conflict since 1948. When
Hizbollah fired hundreds of missiles at Israeli towns and cities, our operation
intensified not by plan or military logic, but improvisation. As a former Prime

Radical Breakthrough Development Work 
• Research on each of the 13 episodes is ongoing and we are moving towards creating a short list of the top 
contributors per episode (with some contributors in multiple episodes). 
• We are aggregating the top contributors around 4 to 5 central locations, such as SF Bay Area, LA, Chicago, 
Boston, New York, Santa Fe, London, Oxford, and Cambridge for the main shoots. 
• We are creating a short list of locations for the secondary shoot - i.e. the more observational shoots on 
specific labs and research facilities, such as the Music Lab at McGill, the Sleep Lab at Harvard. 
• We are planning a recce in the autumn to assess locations and meet some of the key contributors. 
• We've brought on a production manager / line producer as we develop detailed research, contributors, 
locations, budgets. 
• Our team is working toward interviewing and hiring a top science-literate associate producer / dedicated 
research producer. We've been coordinating with colleagues at HHMI (Howard Hughes Medical Association) 
as well as National Geographic for staffing referrals, and now have a strong short list. This is a critical, long-
term position. 
• We are assessing graphics and animation companies and researching styles and graphic ideas that we might 
use to communicate some of the more complex ideas. 
• Our digital team is researching a web extension for the www.closertotruth.com website, developing ideas for 
a dedicated site neighborhood for Radical Breakthroughs. We are in discussions with several website 
design companies, including the company that designed and built our original CTT site, for ideas and bids on 
creating the expanded site. 
• By mid-October, we expect to begin to schedule the shoots.

world hunger. On a personal level, they would barely notice this donation. With this knowledge, why
should I bother to give a penny? This is one example of apathy regarding our motivation to help others.
What propels individuals to shift from passive bystanders who can allow harm to occur to active
contributors?

Classic studies by the American psychologists John Darley and Bibb Latane reveal the
ingredients for bystander action. Whether it is helping someone having a seizure, being molested, or in
danger of suffocation from smoke, we are more likely to help when alone than when in a group. We are
also more likely to help when we recognize the situation as a crisis and think that there are plausible
solutions. These are all characteristics of the situation. There are also characteristics of the mdividual
bystander, including their level of compassion and empathy toward others, their capacity to identify with
the victim, and their self-control. For example, people who intervene in cases of child abuse, as opposed
to the passive bystanders, are more likely to have been abused as children, more likely to perceive a
solution, more likely to feel responsibility to intervene, and more likely to experience the weight of guilt
for not intervening. We are back to individuals differences. We are back to the egg and coop, and their
joint contribution to helping or harming others. We are back to the established genetic differences in
compassion, risk-taking, and self-control that combine with a history of experience to create some who sit
and watch and others who actively participate.

We are more likely to pardon bystanders because we tend to see omissions as less bad than
actions, and omitters as less responsible for the consequences than actors. This is a dangerous effect.
Bystanders are part of the equation of evil. As noted by the American genocide scholar and psychologist,
Ervin Staub, bystanders start out as passive players on the side lines, but are rapidly transformed into
perpetrators. The transformation starts with the challenge of maintaining passivity while watching other
humans suffer; to maintain this observer status requires suppressing empathy for the sufferers, while
recognizing that they are in the minority and you, the bystander, are with the majority. To avoid feeling
guilty for not feeling empathy, bystanders distance themselves even further from the victims. Distancing
1s an adaptive response as any association with the victims could put a bystander in harm’s way. But like
so many other psychological states discussed in this book, distancing leads to dehumanization.
Dehumanization leads to moral disengagement and greater justification for the perpetrators. Justification
lends cheering support for violence. This is the final transforming step, from passive bystander to active
participant.

Recall that on my account of evil, evildoers either have a desire to cause harm directly or desire
something good, recognizing that it will cause harm indirectly. This is true of actions and omissions. For

example, keeping a secret, even if pressured into spilling the beans, is a good thing because it upholds a

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018610.txt,"So far, no one I've talked to seems remotely interested in hiring what they see as a
prostitute. They seem to want to be having sex with someone they find very attractive
who is also someone they feel like they can respect, whose intelligence they respect. For
example, someone I see occasionally -- the last time I saw him, he gave me money at the
end and he said that he felt good about giving me the money because he knew I wouldn't
spend it on, quote, a designer handbag. He seems to think that I am reasonably
ambitious and have my shit together, and he seems to feel more comfortable giving me
money because he knows it goes towards my grad school costs and credit card debt. My
ability to write with proper grammar, without overusing emoticons, appears to be my
biggest sales point. Men have told me this outright.

That guy also mentioned feeling more comfortable because he thinks I'm from the same
social class as he is. There are a lot of class issues coming up in these encounters, I think.
Being white and from an upper-middle-class background may help me get clients. My
background has also given me a ton of confidence that puts me at an advantage when
negotiating. I do not think I radiate take advantage of me, and I (nicely) tell guys who
start doing that to go away.

The guy I was just talking about -- he also mentioned that he feels like he doesn't want to
have sex with someone that he doesn't feel at least a little bit connected to. There's a
distinction between meaningless sex and casual sex. I think these guys want casual sex --
maybe they aren't at the point where they want to deal with having a partner, or they're
really busy at work, or they already have another partner -- they want casual sex but not
meaningless sex.

In my encounters with these men, the money does two things. Firstly, it enables them to
have a relationship with me that they wouldn't otherwise be able to have. Secondly, it
puts them in this position where they can give me something valuable and have that be
appreciated. The guys I see really want to feel appreciated.

Clarisse Thorn: Do you feel like this has given you any new insight into gender
roles?

Olivia: Hmm.... It's made me feel more powerful. I definitely feel like I am the one with
the power in this situation. When I show up, I don't feel like -- here is this rich, powerful
person who is about to bestow wealth upon me. I feel like -- here is this person who is a

bit sad and lonely, and maybe I can make their day better.

A lot of the men who are on this site want to feel appreciated, so it's important to them
that the woman they're with give off the appearance of appreciating them. So for
example, on the website there's a lot of talk about sugar daddies being mentors or
“benefactors” rather than clients. They seem to want some combination of me asking
them about their day, and they also want to feel like they're bestowing knowledge upon
me about the world. One of the men I see will always talk about his opinions about
money. He has complicated feelings about himself having money because he doesn't
come from money, so he's trying to work those out. But he also keeps telling me in a very
serious voice that money will not make me happy, that nothing I can buy will make me
happy. I tell him that I can buy security and he says yes, that is one thing I can buy.

                              AIPAC SPEECH 2013 – MINISTER OF DEFENSE - EHUD BARAK
     •  Thank you for such a warm welcome. 
•  What an indescribable feeling to be surrounded by so many true friends in the capital of the world's greatest democracy.
•  Members of the Administration, Members of Congress, distinguished ambassadors, especially our ambassador Michael Oren…. Michael, Rosey, Bob, David, Howard and Richard, AIPAC members… older and young…
•  Good evening to you all.
•  It is your toil and your graft – your unwavering support – that keep us safe.
•   I have six humble words for all of you:  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
•  I would like to express my personal appreciation to President Obama and Secretary Panetta for their resolute backing of Israel.
•  History will surely record your immeasurable contribution to the strength of Israel, and the maintenance of the truly special relationship between our peoples. 
•   On behalf of the people of Israel, I wish Secretary Hagel all the best in his new role.  
•  As Secretary of Defense he will, no doubt, serve his country with the same pride and honor with which he served, both on the battlefield and in Congress. 
•  It is great to see so many young activists here. Thank you for your energetic commitment to Israel! 
•   A commitment which is so lucidly dictated by the head… yet so deeply underpinned by the heart…
•  Keep it up – you are the future! 

************************************

•  It is thanks to the rock solid US-Israel relationship, alongside the devotion of the young men and women of the IDF, that our capacity to defend ourselves, has been guaranteed for years to come!
•   With US support, combined with the ingenuity of our scientists; Israel finds itself at the cutting edge of missile defense technology.
•  The ‘Iron Dome’ recently intercepted over 400 incoming terrorist rockets.  Practically – this is like hitting a bullet… with a bullet!
•  Just last week, we – the US and Israel – conducted a successful exo-atmospheric test of the Arrow 3 interceptor. 
•  The State of Israel simply would not be the strong island of stability it is, without one crucial constant. 
•  You! The United States of America. Its people. Its leadership.  Its Congress. Its Jewish community. 

***********************************

•  It is no secret, and I'll repeat it again, that we live in a tough neighborhood, where there is no mercy for the weak.  And no second chance for those who cannot defend themselves.
•  Israel is the strongest country in the region and the only genuinely open democracy.
•  An unprecedented geopolitical earthquake in the last three years has shattered the generations’ old regional order.
•   There are two clear lessons and one insight which I have drawn from this period:
•  # 1: Be modest with predictions……. especially about the future!  Take Egypt as an example; Mubarak was unable to predict it… who did?  Who thinks he could?

•  #2:  When friends tell me: Don’t worry…  If worse comes to worst … the world will step forward and act!
•   My answer is: Do not take this for granted.
•  Look at Syria – you don't need classified intelligence; it’s on your screens.  Assad’s jet fighters, tanks and artillery are slaughtering his own citizens.  Over 70,000 Syrians killed. 
•  Yet still… there is no sense of direction and no political will to act.
•  There is an extremely relevant lesson here… especially for all of us in Israel. 
•  And an insight…
•  Many believe that the root cause for all the problems in the Middle East… is our inability to solve the conflict with the Palestinians. 
•  Well, I say… That’s not true!
•   Recent developments in the Middle East have been far beyond our control… and independent of our deeds.
•  Even if a peace agreement with the Palestinians had been signed and sealed a long time ago:
     o  The Muslim Brotherhood would still have come to power in Egypt
     o  Syria would still be mired in a bloody civil war
     o  And Iran would still be pursuing nuclear capabilities and a hegemonic role in the Gulf 

•  And ladies and gentlemen,
•   It is Iran's pursuit of nuclear capabilities which is the greatest challenge facing Israel, the region and the world today… 
•  A nuclear Iran spells the end of any conceivable non-proliferation regime. 
•   Saudi Arabia, Turkey and later Egypt will follow suit.   In the future, even terrorist groups may try.  
•  Diplomatic efforts continue.  Sanctions are unprecedented and hurting, but frankly – while exhausting all diplomatic means is understandable – I do not believe it will lead to a “moment of truth”, where the Ayatollahs will give up their nuclear aspirations.

•  Therefore, all options must remain on the table.

•  We have stated this time and again.

•  And we expect all those who say it… to mean it… 

•  Ladies and gentlemen… We mean it.

•  And let me repeat it: we… mean it.

**************************************

•  A nuclear Iran is the most imminent and acute danger to the stability of the entire region.  But it is not the only one:
•  Radical Islamist terror is spreading rapidly.
•   And the accumulation of missiles and rockets will necessitate regional missile defense. 

•  So what is to be done?
•  It is an interregnum right now in Israel, and the new Netanyahu government will have to shape its approach.
•   But allow me, just before I leave my post, to share with you my positions:
•  The Middle East is a Gestalt – everything depends on everything else.  
•  Facing this array of threats, we have to:
•  Firstly, start building a ‘Regional Security Framework’… 
•  This should be built around the common challenges of radical Islamist terror, border security, missile defense… and of course, Iran.
•  And being led by the United States, it could provide a variety of synergies for all its regional participants.
•  Secondly, we need a daring peace initiative vis-à-vis the Palestinians.
•  A two-state solution is the only viable long-term solution.
•  It is a compelling imperative for us, in order to secure our identity and our future as a Jewish and democratic state; it’s not a favor for the Palestinians… 
•  Believe me, I tried hard as Prime Minister, together with President Clinton.  So I know, from personal experience, that the Palestinians are not easy partners for peace.
•  Prime Minister Netanyahu has taken courageous steps, to renew the process including an unprecedented settlement freeze.
•  But still – from the Palestinian side… no proper response.
•  They clearly bear most of the responsibility for past failures.
•  And I know, a fully fledged agreement is probably not feasible today,  But if this is the case – and only a sincere effort can determine this – we have to try and achieve a reasonable, fair, interim agreement.
•  I strongly believe this is possible, while guaranteeing all our security and vital interests.
•  But if even an interim agreement is unobtainable, then we should consider unilateral steps, in order to place a wedge on this extremely dangerous slippery slope towards a binational state.  
•  It involves demarcating a line within the land of Israel… Within which we will have the settlement blocs and a solid Jewish majority for generations to come.
•  As well as setting security arrangements, and a solid Israeli, long-term military presence along the River Jordan.
•  Rest assured… our security should not – and will not – be compromised under any of these alternatives.
•  Tough decisions must be taken; but it is possible.
•  And as our sages teach us: “If not now… when?”

•  I strongly believe that this intertwined strategic triangle: 
•  First, The Regional Security Framework 
•   Second, a reinvigorated political process with the Palestinians… 
•  And third: tackling Iran.
     •  This triangle, is the most effective approach to deal with the challenges on our horizon.

*************************************
•  Israel, has also been experiencing its own tremors of change.
•  In the summer of 2011, the people of Israel took to the streets… demanding a more equal allocation of the burden. 
•  Just last month, 53 new, fresh members of the Knesset were sworn in, about half the serving members of Knesset … (Present company included!)… were out. 
•  That is what I call democracy in action.
•   A democracy I am proud of. 
•   A democracy you can be proud of.
•  I am confident that Prime Minister Netanyahu will lead his new government with the same dedication and responsibility which he led the last.

•  Ladies and gentlemen,
•   I was born 71 years ago, at the height of World War II; the Nazi crematoria in Europe were working day and night.
•  And now… in 2013, I am ending my tenure as the Minister of Defense of a strong, independent Jewish state. 
•   Look at what we – as a nation – have achieved… Who would have believed it then?
     o  Today we have an agile and adaptive high-tech and export oriented economy. 
     o  A start-up culture flourishes on an eruption of talent and an underlying entrepreneurial spirit.

•  I am optimistic, and my vision for Israel is clear:
•  A strong, self-confident, thriving Jewish, democratic state, living in peace and security with its neighbors.
•  An exemplary state and world leader in science, technology, education and culture.
•  A country in which our children will want to live, and your children will be proud of. 

•  Ladies and gentlemen,
•   We are at a decisive juncture in our history… 
•  As President Kennedy noted during the Cuban Missile Crisis:
     o  The path we have chosen for the present is full of hazards, as all paths are.  But it is the one most consistent with our character and courage as a nation…
•  I believe we possess the character and courage as a nation to make those tough decisions for the future, peace and security of the State of Israel.  
•  Please allow me to end with the millennia old blessing:
     o  השם עוז לעמו ייתן, השם יברך את עמו בשלום
•  May the Lord bestow his people with courage; may the Lord bless his people with peace. 
•  Thank you…

by Vicky Ward <http://www.vanityfair.com/contributors/vicky-  ward> 
March 8, 2011, 2:30 PM 
I've got a story idea for you. The rebuilding of Indonesia. Or New Orleans. Or both. Go there. I've just been. You will 
never think the same way about anything again. 
So spoke not Bill or Melinda Gates, but Ghislaine Maxwell, the 48-year-old woman being written up everywhere at 
the moment as the alleged procurer of young women for billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. 
Epstein, 57, is the financier who spent a year in jail on charges of soliciting prostitutes —and now there is talk of 
another investigation because various women, now in their twenties and thirties, have come forward with allegations 
that he molested them when they were under-age. The allegations first surfaced in British newspapers, which have 
zeroed in on Epstein's friendship with Prince Andrew, who has recently tried to publicly disassociate himself from his 
old pal. 
I wrote a piece for Vanity Fair in 2003 called The Talented Mr. Epstein. It was largely a business piece that focused 
on his mysterious exit from Bear Stearns in 1981, his close relationships with Jimmy Cayne, Les Wexner, the 
chairman of Limited Brands, and above all, the man who claimed to be his mentor, Steven Jude Hoffenberg, who is 
currently serving a 20-year-jail sentence for bilking investors in Towers Financial out of $450 million. 
The piece alluded to Epstein's great friendship with Maxwell, and how she introduced him to young women with 
whom he had sexual relationships. But, in the end, the story didn't really go there, focusing instead on the issue that 
remains a mystery—how Jeffrey made his money, and how Ghislaine made hers. 
This is not to say I didn't hear stories about the girls. I did. But, not knowing quite who to believe, I concentrated on 
the intriguing financial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the same ones, different ones. And 
their stories are bone-chilling. Journalists from England have phoned—and, in one case, flown—to ask me about 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030575 
Epstein and Maxwell. Who is he? And the British, especially, want to know: Who is she? At this point, I am so bored 
of repeating myself to others—it was, after all, my 2003 Vanity Fairstory that really brought him into the limelight 
—that I have decided to write about this myself. 
Bizarrely, perhaps, I have gotten to know Jeffrey and Ghislaine far better after my piece than before it. I kept running 
into both of them, separately, at parties. Jeffrey is not a social animal so he usually has a couple of young women with 
him who stand two feet behind him, as if serving a monarch. Do they speak? I remember asking him once, nodding 
at his lookalike blondes. He laughed. Not like you,Vicky, was his riposte. 
I remembered that when we'd once discussed math—in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed I hadn't 
studied math since I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a package at home 
via messenger. It was a book: Math for idiots. 
So he is not without humor, even though he doesn't drink or smoke, and hates restaurants. 
Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects, newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He was 
certainly preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few moments 
in his company and you know this to be true. 
When I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that Andy 
—as Jeffrey calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his strange title is. 
Because if one thing's for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what he's talking about far 
more than Andy does. Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other financiers hang out with him. 
And Ghislaine? 
Full disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It's almost impossible not to. 
She is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I've spent hours talking 
to her about the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is curious. She has 
spent weeks at the bottom of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent me a DVD of the fish 
there. Her rolodex would blow away almost anyone else's I can think of—probably even Rupert Murdochs'. She is 
very well-read and can talk about most things for hours. She is passionate about Bill Clinton with whom she is close 
friends. 
Yet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-Platero, 
(known fondly to her close friends as the Tennis Goddess) Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When it comes 
down to things she really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her vulnerability. 
And that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey. 
He saved her, I remember a close friend of mine telling me. When her father died, she was a wreck; inconsolable. 
And then Jeffrey took her in. She's never forgotten that—and never will. 
In many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect replacement 
for her father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his sexual pecadillos, but 
then Ghislaine's father was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving a massive black hole he'd 
fraudulently created. To Ghislaine, Jeffrey's habits may not have seemed that strange. 
In fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful people 
in the end either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl issues, and moved 
countries to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You don't tend to get to the top 
by being the world's most balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett didn't quite manage a normal life 
—whatever that is. He had a second wife for many years whose existence he has been open about. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030576 
So what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven't spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her loyalty 
to friends like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she'll be out and about as always. Look at Waksal 
and Stewart. No one sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up for all sorts of 
blemishes.

would be in each place. We then asked them to select one destination
from two choices that they had rated exactly the same. Would you
choose Paris over Brazil? Finally, we asked them to imagine and rate
all the destinations again. Seconds after picking between two
destinations, people rated their selected destination higher than
before and rated the discarded choice lower than before.

The brain-imaging data revealed that these changes were happening
in the caudate nucleus, a cluster of nerve cells that is part of the
striatum. The caudate has been shown to process rewards and signal
their expectation. If we believe we are about to be given a paycheck
or eat a scrumptious chocolate cake, the caudate acts as an announcer
broadcasting to other parts of the brain, Be ready for something
good. After we receive the reward, the value is quickly updated. If
there is a bonus in the paycheck, this higher value will be reflected in
striatal activity. If the cake is disappointing, the decreased value will
be tracked so that next time our expectations will be lower.

In our experiment, after a decision was made between two
destinations, the caudate nucleus rapidly updated its signal. Before
choosing, it might signal thinking of something great while
imagining both Greece and Thailand. But after choosing Greece, it
now broadcast thinking of something remarkable! for Greece and
merely thinking of something good for Thailand. True, sometimes
we regret our decisions; our choices can turn out to be disappointing.
But on balance, when you make a decision — even if it is a
hypothetical choice — you will value it more and expect it to bring
you pleasure.

This affirmation of our decisions helps us derive heightened pleasure
from choices that might actually be neutral. Without this, our lives
might well be filled with second-guessing. Have we done the right
thing? Should we change our mind? We would find ourselves stuck,
overcome by indecision and unable to move forward.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013225.txt,"17.2 Measuring Incremental Progress Toward Human-Level AGI 309

about how to measure incremental progress. How do you tell when you’re 25% or 50% of the way
to having an AGI that can pass the Turing Test, or get an online university degree. Fooling 50%
of the Turing Test judges is not a good measure of being 50% of the way to passing the Turing
Test (that’s too easy); and passing 50% of university classes is not a good measure of being 50%
of the way to getting an online university degree (it’s too hard — if one had an AGI capable
of doing that, one would almost surely be very close to achieving the end goal). Measuring
incremental progress toward human-level AGI is a subtle thing, and we argue that the best way
to do it is to focus on particular scenarios and the achievement of specific competencies therein.

As we argued in Chapter 8 there are some theoretical reasons to doubt the possibility of
creating a rigorous objective test for partial progress toward AGI — a test that would be con-
vincing to skeptics, and impossible to game via engineering a system specialized to the test.
Fortunately, though we don’t need a test of this nature for the purposes of assessing our own
incremental progress toward advanced AGI, based on our knowledge about our own approach.

Based on the nature of the grand goals articulated above, there seems to be a very natural
approach to creating a set of incremental capabilities building toward AGI: to draw on our
copious knowledge about human cognitive development. This is by no means the only possible
path; one can envision alternatives that have nothing to do with human development (and those
might also be better suited to non-human AGIs). However, so much detailed knowledge about
human development is available — as well as solid knowledge that the human developmental
trajectory does lead to human-level AI — that the motivation to draw on human cognitive
development is quite strong.

The main problem with the human development inspired approach is that cognitive devel-
opmental psychology is not as systematic as it would need to be for AGI to be able to translate
it directly into architectural principles and requirements. As noted above, while early thinkers
like Piaget and Vygotsky outlined systematic theories of child cognitive development, these
are no longer considered fully accurate, and one currently faces a mass of detailed theories of
various aspects of cognitive development, but without an unified understanding. Nevertheless
we believe it is viable to work from the human-development data and understanding currently
available, and craft a workable AGI roadmap therefrom.

With this in mind, what we give next is a fairly comprehensive list of the competencies that
we feel AI systems should be expected to display in one or more of these scenarios in order
to be considered as full-fledged human level AGI systems. These competency areas have
been assembled somewhat opportunistically via a review of the cognitive and developmental
psychology literature as well as the scope of the current AI field. We are not claiming this as
a precise or exhaustive list of the competencies characterizing human-level general intelligence,
and will be happy to accept additions to the list, or mergers of existing list items, etc. What
we are advocating is not this specific list, but rather the approach of enumerating competency
areas, and then generating tasks by combining competency areas with scenarios.

We also give, with each competency, an example task illustrating the competency. The tasks
are expressed in the robot preschool context for concreteness, but they all apply to the virtual
preschool as well. Of course, these are only examples, and ideally to teach an AGI in a structured
way one would like to

e associate several tasks with each competency
e present each task in a graded way, with multiple subtasks of increasing complexity
® associate a quantitative metric with each task

Chirac, but the understanding was that Madeleine would be in charge. Far from
showing any willingness to end the violence, Arafat at first simply lied. He said the
Palestinian violence was in response to an unprovoked assault by Israeli troops,
and demanded an international “protection” force. There was a particularly bizarre
moment when I read out the names of individual Tanzim leaders whom we had
intercepted organizing the attacks. Arafat pretended he’d never heard of any of
them, almost as if I was reading from a zoology textbook about species of polar
bears. This was a man who had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. What he
really deserved was an Oscar.

But people were dying. Needlessly. We ended up agreeing to a US-led fact-
finding commission, as well as a number of steps to separate the Palestinian
attackers and Israeli units. I reaffirmed our policy of insisting that Israeli soldiers
use live fire only if they felt their lives were under threat. Arafat undertook to order
his security forces and Tanzim not to launch further attacks. He even phoned Gaza
with what we were given to understand were explicit orders. But it was all for
show, as we discovered when we were invited to the Elysée Palace to meet Chirac.
The French President had clearly received advance word from Arafat about his
demand for an international “protection” force, presumably with a role for the
French. To my surprise and frustration, and Secretary Albright’s as well, Chirac
insisted that no agreement was acceptable without that happening. Then, he turned
to me, demanding to know why the violence had left nearly 400 Palestinians dead,
but barely two dozen Israelis, if the Palestinians were the aggressors. “Mr
President,” I said, “just several weeks ago we were prepared to go very far in order
to put this entire conflict behind us. It is Mr Arafat who rejected the proposal, even
as a basis for negotiations. Just a basis to seek peace. He then deliberately turned to
terror. We are protecting ourselves, and our soldiers. Are you really saying that
you'll be happy for us to sign an agreement to end it only when another 350
Israelis are killed? I’m not playing that game. Arafat started this. He has to stop it.
We know he can, and we hold him responsible if that does not happen.”

It did not happen. We tried all we could to prevent a further deterioration. I
approved moves, in co-ordination with the Palestinian police, to lower our security
profile where possible. We made sure Israeli police were not visible from the
mosques on the Haram al-Sharif. But after the next Friday prayers, a crowd made
its way to a police post at the edge of the Old City and attacked it. In Nablus, the

law enforcement substantially overlap for many categories of crime. Much of this enforcement redundancy, as considered in
detail below, has been a deliberate federal response to diverse problems of underenforcement in state criminal justice. The
point for now, however, is the functional equivalence of duplicative federal-state jurisdiction, nation-state jurisdiction, and
agency jurisdiction. All represent a common strategy to reduce underenforcement by empowering redundant enforcement
authorities: independent entities with equivalent institutional capacity and expertise share jurisdiction. If one neglects to
enforce, the other may. Functionally, each backstops, or provides oversight of, failures to enforce by the other.

A second model for minimizing unjustified failures to prosecute relies on private actors to create redundancy with public
prosecutors’ authority. Empowering private actors to file and litigate public law claims is familiar in many civil law contexts;
numerous federal statutes authorize private rights of action that enable private individuals or groups to supplement public
agencies’ law enforcement efforts. '*° Through much of the nineteenth century, this kind of duplicative public-private
enforcement authority was a familiar feature in the criminal justice systems of many states, which permitted private parties -
victims - to prosecute alleged criminal wrongdoing.

Redundant charging authority takes other forms as well. In large hierarchical agencies such as the U.S. Department of Justice,
internal administrative review of front-line prosecutors’ charging or declination decisions by higher-ups creates a version of
redundant enforcement authority; supervisors can make independent determinations and reverse front-line prosecutors. 1°
[*848] This kind of redundancy through administrative review now exists in English, Irish, and many European criminal
justice systems. !7
More ambitiously from a U.S. perspective - because it is rare here - judicial power to review prosecutorial charging decisions is
another means to create some degree of redundant charging authority between the executive and judicial branches. Although
criminal charging is a core function of the executive branch, state and federal courts have modest authority to review and bar
executive officials’ decisions to file criminal charges. It is only as a matter of policy that courts - with a few exceptions - are not
empowered to address underenforcement by reviewing the executive's noncharging decisions. (This power is somewhat broader
for courts in England and Wales as well as in the law of a few states.) !% This model of redundancy separates charging
authority - for courts as for Department of Justice supervisors, the power to order prosecutors to prosecute - from enforcement
authority, which includes the institutional capacity to file and litigate charges. Courts (with rare exceptions) have no
administrative capacity to litigate a prosecution; but they could provide some redundancy in charging authority. !?

In sum, charging redundancy can occur between equivalent agencies in separate governments, between public and private
actors, or between agencies or branches of the same government. Criminal justice systems in Europe and the common law
world have adopted or strengthened one or more of these mechanisms in recent decades. In the United States, choices among
these strategies have changed over time and between jurisdictions. Nearly all states that once authorized private prosecution
have long since prohibited it. Federal prosecutors are organized in a centralized hierarchical agency that makes administrative
review possible, but few state prosecutors are similarly organized. For these reasons and others, the primary means of
enforcement redundancy to combat underenforcement is overlapping federal- [*849] state authority made possible by the
distinctive U.S. model of federalism.

‘5 Examples of federal statutes authorizing private rights of action include the Clayton Act, 75 U.S.C. § 15 (2006) (granting a private right of
action for antitrust violations); Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2680(h) (1994); Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 ULS.C. §
2000e-5(f) (1994); Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12/33 (1994). For an overview, see Pamela H. Bucy, Private Justice, 76 S.
Cal. L. Rev. 1, 12-54 (2002).

16 See 18 U.S.C. § 3771(f) (2012) (mandating review of federal prosecutor decisions within the Justice Department upon victim's request).
7 See infra Part IT.A.1.
18 See infra Parts II.B.3-B.4.

19 Note that this conception of redundant authority intersects with, but is distinct from, constitutional separation of powers. In a standard
account (briefly put), separation of powers describes branches of government having distinct roles, authority, and competencies. In the main,
branches do not do the same things; they do different, rival, and complementary things. But if so empowered by the legislature, courts can
exercise some degree of charging authority, creating limited redundancy in charging authority between the executive and judicial branches.

e Social Welfare Program — Created in 1965 to provide health insurance to low-income
population (2% of Americans under coverage then and 16% now’).

e No Dedicated Funding — Federal funding comes from general revenue (all forms of tax
receipts).

e Ever-Growing Expenses — $273 billion in F2010, up 2x from 10 years ago.

e Rising Healthcare Costs — Owing to aging population + unhealthy life styles +
technology advances.

e Growing Beneficiary + Benefits — Covered beneficiaries expanded beyond low-
income group in 1980s to include additional groups (like individuals who have high
medical expenses and have spent down their assets, and some of those who lost
their employer-sponsored healthcare insurance coverage in recession), while
covered benefits expanded to include prescription drugs / dental services. Total
expenditures on these new groups and benefits represented ~60% of Medicaid
program’s spending in 2001, per Kaiser Family Foundation estimates. See
slide 319-322 for more details.

e Moral Hazard — As a “free good,” Medicaid reduced demand for private long-term
insurance’ while regulation loopholes + need-based benefit policies created
incentives to abuse the Medicaid reimbursement system.

campaign team and a pledge to serve only four years with an apartisan agenda, money and campaign
expertise would certainly follow. And 50 state ballot access is a function of time (starting in the fall of
2019 would be prudential) and hard work as we have discussed and many of you have exhaustively war-

gamed.

Part and parcel of this effort would be motivating the often politically lackadaisical middle to vote. The
raft of new technologies in data targeting and biometric mobile voting technology could transform the
electorate in the next few, amping voter participation and injecting the voices of moderates (both in
political views and level of political interest) into the process. And any third-party effort must
incorporate advocacy for accelerated adaption of these all but inevitable voter verification tools. I believe

Silicon Valley could be game-changing allies in this effort.

I am sure none of us doubt that chaos could potentially be unleashed by jamming three viable candidates
into a two-party system. An election that ends up in the House of Representatives is an uncontrollable,
murky and ancient process. But might that be a less scary prospect than relying on the Democrats to

nominate a candidate who can beat Trump in 2020?

I look forward to talking more about all of our ideas on this hopeful project in coming weeks. Please feel

free to call me to discuss. Thank you for taking time to review this note.

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012383.txt,"The language of subsection (d){5} must be changed from “shall ensure.” This implies a
legal obligation on the Federal government to provide counsel and a concomitant right on behalf
of victims to government-funded counsel, which is inappropriate and would subject the
government to litigation over the nature and scope of the purported obligation and right.

The Department also opposes subsection (d)(6), which creates a guardian‘ad litem
program. Such program raises serious conflict of interest concerns, and DOJ has opposed similar
language in the past. Establishment of a guardian ad litem program is also unnecessary in that 18
U.S.C. §3509(h) already sets forth detailed pracedures which provide for court appointed
guardians ad litem for children who are victims of or witnesses to crimes involving abuse or
exploitation.

Subsection (d)(7) may result in pnintended consequences due to this confidentiality
section. To effectively combat trafficking, relevant information must be transmitted to law
enforcement. Law enforcement is well-equipped to preserve confidentiality concerns,

The Department believes that subsection (e) undermines the 1997 Special Immigrant ij
Juvenile reforms and opposes turning this back over to the states, where it was inherently flawed.

In section 236(j), the effect of the apparent retroactivity of the general applicability of
these amendments to “all aliens in the United States before, an, or after the date of enactment of
this Act” raises serious concerns about the provision of benefits and services and has the
potential to create serious problems for the Department ix its implementation of the programs

( described im this section.

26. Section 301

DOJ recommends striking the 2 percent cap on funding for training and technical
assistance that is in 22 U.S.C, 7105(b)(2)(B). The unique’ complexity of the trafficking issue and
the level of coordination necessary to effectively serve trafficking victims requires much more 4
training and technical assistance than a typical OJP program. Striking the cap on training and
technical assistance will allow OJP to better allocate the trafficking funds it receives. The
change could be implemented by the following statutory language:

“Paragraph 107(b)(2)(B)of Pub. L. 106-386 is amended by:

“{1) inserting ‘and’ after the first semicolon;

“(2) striking ‘(ii)’ through *;and’; and

“(3) striking ‘(iii)’ and inserting ‘{ii).””
27. Section 302

Section 302 re-authorizes the $5,000,000 appropriation for the Pilot Program that was
first authorized by Section 203 of the 2005 version of this Act. The 2007 version, therefore,
should add language amending section 203 of the 2005 version to provide that HHS does not

have the exclusive authority for development of the pilot program. DOJ and DHS must be
included in the development of this program to ensure that the ability of Federal prosecutors and

of those lucky people who look better—or at least not worse—with
age.

All of this is relevant politically because it means that in 2016, when
she’s 68, she is unlikely to be written off as too old to run for
president. Since the beginning of the year, Hillary has said repeatedly
that she will leave office no later than early 2013 and retire from
public life. In Bahrain, just before the Middle East upheaval, I heard
her be more direct than ever before on the subject: “I’ve had a
fascinating and rewarding public career .... I think I will serve as
secretary of state as my last public position and then I’Il probably go
back to advocacy work, particularly on behalf of women and
children, and probably around the world.”

Hillary isn’t as calculating as her public image. The 2000 Senate race,
for instance, was practically serendipitous. But it’s hard to believe
“Clinton” and “ambition” have been fully sundered. In 2016, the
Democrats are unlikely to have anyone better or more acceptable to
different parts of the party. The nearer-term options are far-fetched.
When Bob Woodward said on CNN last fall that Hillary’s switching
jobs with Joe Biden was “on the table,” the reaction inside both the
White House and State Department was to scoff. Neither has an
incentive to switch. With the Iraq portfolio already in his pocket,
Biden gets plenty of foreign-policy action. His bigger concern is
staying on good terms with Hillary. In late 2009, he worried that their
long and friendly relationship was in jeopardy over Af-Pak policy. He
wanted few troops and heavy reliance on Predator drones; she wanted
an open-ended, hugely expensive counter-insurgency commitment.
The president ended up sending many more troops than Biden wanted—
a total commitment of 100,000—but with withdrawal deadlines
beginning this year that Clinton, siding with the Pentagon, opposed.
To ease the tensions, Biden and Hillary stepped up their breakfasts
and lunches where they call each other “dear.”

Topic: The quixotic search for energy solutions

Wind should play an important role, but unless there is a high-voltage, high-capacity, high-density grid to accompany it (as in
Northern Europe), or electricity storage, the variability of wind means that co-located natural gas peaking plants are
needed as well. The cost of such natural gas plants are rarely factored into the all-in costs of wind, but perhaps they should be.

These exercises are important, since unfounded expectations might lead to suboptimal policy choices. One example: the
Keystone Pipeline extension, which the President has opted not to consider until after 2012. The US imports more oil from
Canada than from any other country. With the extension, the Keystone system would account for 13% of US petroleum
imports. The pipeline has been opposed on environmental grounds, but the extension itself would only add 1% to the entire
network of crude oil and refined product pipelines already criss-crossing the US. Moving petroleum products by rail or truck
instead is more expensive and riskier. If the US does not provide a market for the Alberta tar sands oil, it could end up on
tankers to China; and the US will end up importing more of its energy needs from the Persian Gulf and Venezuela. Could
misperceptions about wind, solar and biofuel® feasibility explain why some people are opposed to this extension? Unclear.

The art of the possible

Now let’s take a (desperately needed) look at some good news. Over the last 3 decades, the oil intensity of the developed world
has been falling, followed by non-OECD countries (see first chart). This is not meant to suggest that declining availability of
cheap crude oil isn’t a problem, since it is. There are lots of studies showing rapid declines in the production rate of existing
crude oil fields, and that the discovery of new fields is (a) not keeping up, and (b) are located where marginal costs of extraction
are considerably higher. No need to repeat them here. But oil’s importance to economic growth has been declining over time,
and there is no reason to believe that these improvements have completely run their course.

There is also room for reduced fuel consumption, although here’s another case where energy fairy tales might have postponed
smart policy choices. While waiting for a holy grail, the US left fuel efficiency standards unchanged from 1983 (light trucks)
and 1987 (cars) until 2010. Chrysler head Lee Iacocca said this in 1986 when Ford/GM lobbied the Reagan Administration to
lower (“CAFE”) fuel efficiency standards: We are about to put up a tombstone that says, 'Here lies America's energy
policy’. CAFE protects American jobs. If CAFE is weakened now, come the next energy crunch, American car makers
will not be able to meet demand for fuel-efficient cars. Well, the rest of the world kept on truckin’ as he suggested, and
have more efficient fleets (see chart). Ifthe US fleet were 30% more efficient, US gasoline consumption could fall by 40 billion
gallons per year (~1 billion barrels). For context, the US imports 0.36 billion barrels of crude per year from Venezuela, and
0.62 billion from the Persian Gulf. The US just increased fuel efficiency standards, but it will take time to make an impact.

Other possible good news includes ongoing research by Daimler Engine Research Labs on improving gasoline engines,
something the world should not give up on just yet. Prototypes with fewer cylinders and smaller displacement may yield a car
with both lower fuel consumption and lower emissions, eventually at fuel efficiencies greater than hybrids like the Prius. The
US Recovery Act included $100 million for Advanced Combustion Engine Research and Development; it could be money well
spent. One example the DoE is working on: semiconductors, powered by the heat exiting the car in its exhaust pipe, used to
create electricity and power the car’s accessories, which are usually powered by belts driven by the car’s engine.

* Here’s one view on biodesel from Giampetro (Barcelona) and Mayumi (Tokushima), authors of “Zhe Biofiiel Delusion” [2009]: “The
promise of biofuels as a replacement to fossil fuels is in fact a mirage that, if followed, risks leaving us short of power, short of food,
destroying biodiversity and doing as much damage to the climate as ever.”

CAPITA CHAPTER VI U.S. and International Cannabis Market Estimates

= International Legal Cannabis Market Forecast

As previously discussed, cannabis is the most widely consumed drug worldwide: an estimated 183 mil-
lion people between the ages of 15 and 64 consumed cannabis in 2017. Cannabis legalization is gain-
ing momentum around the world. At least 20 countries now have medical laws that facilitate patient
access to cannabis or concentrates for treating specified medical conditions. Select countries with such
laws include Australia, Canada, Colombia and Germany; countries without such laws include China,
Japan, Russia and the United States. While the merits of medical cannabis are currently driving legal-
ization, we believe that—like Uruguay and numerous U.S. states—other countries will ultimately
enact and implement recreational laws.

Canada’s legal cannabis market (presently limited to medical cannabis) is currently the largest fed-
erally legal cannabis market in the world, estimated at $1.5 billion in 2017. We anticipate that Canada
will enact and implement its proposed recreational Cannabis Act in mid-2018 and that implementa-
tion will significantly expand the size of Canada’s overall market.

International Market Size Estimate Methodology

Similar to the methodology for our U.S. estimates, the primary factors for our international legal can-
nabis market estimates are the estimated number of eligible consumers, penetration rates and monthly
spending. Of course, these and other factors affecting market size vary considerably across continents
and regions because each country has its own unique market characteristics, including laws, culture,
religions, consumer preferences and disposable income.

We do not attempt to estimate the timing of legal changes that affect consumer penetration rates.
Rather, we estimate the size of potential international markets at maturity when penetration rates have
stabilized. The time required for markets in particular countries to reach maturity will vary widely and,
like the U.S. market, could be 10 years or more.

To estimate average monthly consumer spending, we analyzed a country’s per capita average
monthly income and assumed a certain percentage was spent on cannabis products. The resulting
estimates of monthly spending in developed countries differs vastly from that in developing countries.

International Market Size Estimates

Our estimates for the international legal cannabis market include estimates for select countries with
medical or recreational laws and certain countries we believe may develop into legal markets for can-
nabis in the foreseeable future. The following table lists each identified country, ranked by Gross
Domestic Product (GDP), with its estimated adult population, monthly cannabis consumer spending
and potential market value.

young. And this is true moving forward. Some men in the White
House are on the “society” side; some women in the State
Department are on the “government to government” side. And many
officials switch sides (and can switch back again) amid the long hours
of debate. The most common sentiment among foreign-policy
veterans reflects another familiar Bill Clinton line: “It sure was
simpler during the Cold War.”

For Hillary, the crisis mentality must eventually give way to the more
mundane realities of running the department. She is midway through
a five-year plan to increase the size of the State Department’s foreign-
service staff by 25 percent and double USAID. And she’s taken a leaf
from the Pentagon playbook and launched a “Q.D.D.R.”—
Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. The idea is to ask
all the agencies housed at Foggy Bottom the larger questions—like
whether they are even focused on the right things. It’s a huge
structural project.

Hillary prides herself on sweating the small stuff, too. She’s big on
feedback—an intranet “Secretary’s Sounding Board” is bringing the
suggestion box into the modern age. She gets high marks from the
high-tech community for “21st-century statecraft” like using texting
to raise money for Haiti-earthquake victims and an Internet freedom
agenda she is pushing aggressively. She’s popular with State
Department employees for practical changes like providing full
benefits for same-sex partners (“Fix it!” she scolded bureaucrats who
were dragging their feet) and building showers to accommodate
people who cycle or run to work. In the past, meetings with foreign
ministers featured nothing more than bottled water. Hillary was
incredulous: “You can get coffee, tea, nuts all over the world, and in
Washington you get a bottle of water?” She was told, “That’s the way
we do it here.” Her chilly retort: “Not anymore.”

that most courts ... have declined to extend enforceable rights under the CVRA to alleged victims of conduct that did not lead
to criminal proceedings. !!> All the courts that have actually reached the issue have concluded exactly the opposite. !!°

B. OLC'S DISTORTION OF THE CVRA'S STRUCTURE AND LEGISLATIVE HISTORY

The next section of OLC’s memorandum maintains that the CVRA's structure and legislative history lead to the conclusion that
the CVRA is best understood as extending rights after charges have been filed. Here again, OLC's analysis is truncated at best
and misleading at worst.

OLC begins this part of its analysis by observing that some of the rights in the CVRA are limited to court proceedings. OLC
notes, for example, that the CVRA gives victims the right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court
proceeding ... involving the crime. !!7 But the fact that some of the rights listed in the CVRA apply to court proceedings
hardly means that all of the rights are to be so restricted. The federal criminal justice process includes stages that are pre-
charging, post-charging, and post-conviction. It would hardly be surprising to find that a statute that Congress intended to be

n 118

broad and encompassing covered events occurring after the filing of charges.

Indeed, OLC appears to recognize that at least three of the rights listed in the CVRA could easily apply before charges are filed:
(1) the right to be reasonably protected from the accused; (2) the reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the
Government in the case; and (3) the right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy.
119 None of these rights explicitly refer to court proceedings or other events (such as parole hearings) that necessarily occur
after the filing of formal charges. !7°

[*81] For purposes of this Article, it is appropriate to focus on the last two of these three rights: the right to confer and the
right to fair treatment. The first of these three rights - the right to be reasonably protected - is already clearly extended by
another statute to crime victims before the filing of charges. While OLC does not acknowledge this fact, the VRRA extends the
first right to crime victims, directing that a responsible official shall arrange for a victim to receive reasonable protection from
a suspected offender and persons acting in concert with or at the behest of the suspected offender. !7! Because a suspected
offender obviously exists before the filing of criminal charges, the VRRA envisions the right to protection being provided as
soon as is practical after a victim suffers from the commission of a crime. Additionally, the sections of the Attorney General
Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance addressing the VRRA direct that Justice Department components must provide
reasonable protection even before the filing of criminal charges. !?* So, under the VRRA, the Justice Department should

> OLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 5-6. Notably, the Department does not embrace the language from Huff found within the
Skinner and Paletz decisions because presumably such an approach would be contrary to many of the rights found in the CVRA.

8 150 Cong. Rec. 7295 (2004) (statement of Sen. Dianne Feinstein).

° OLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 7-8, 10 (quoting 78 U.S.C. § 3771 (a)(1), (5), (8)).

20 OLC appears to have overlooked another right that could well apply before charges are filed: the right to be notified of one's rights under
the CVRA. See 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1) (requiring prosecutors to make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and
accorded, the rights described in [the CVRA]); United States v. Rubin, 558 F. Supp. 2d 411, 428 (E.D.N.Y. 2008) (discussing potential
application of the right to notification of rights before charges are filed). For purposes of this Article, it is not necessary to explore this right
in detail. If other CVRA rights apply before charges are filed, a fortiori this right does as well. If a victim has a right, presumably the victim
should be notified of the existence of that right.

PL 42 U.S.C. § 10607(c)(2) (2006) (emphasis added).
222 See Attorney General Guidelines, supra note 52, at 7-8, 26-28.

doctor. You might think that imagining a future haircut would be
pretty dull. Not at all. Here is what one of my participants pictured:

I was getting my hair cut to donate to Locks of Love [a charity that
fashions wigs for young cancer patients]. It had taken me years to
grow it out, and my friends were all there to help celebrate. We went
to my favorite hair place in Brooklyn and then went to lunch at our
favorite restaurant.

I asked another participant to imagine a plane ride. I imagined the
takeoff — my favorite! — and then the eight-hour-long nap in
between and then finally landing in Krakow and clapping for the pilot
for providing the safe voyage, she responded. No tarmac delays, no
screaming babies. The world, only a year or two into the future, was a
wonderful place to live in.

If all our participants insisted on thinking positively when it came to
what lay in store for them personally, what does that tell us about
how our brains are wired? Is the human tendency for optimism a
consequence of the architecture of our brains?

The Human Time Machine

To think positively about our prospects, we must first be able to
imagine ourselves in the future. Optimism starts with what may be
the most extraordinary of human talents: mental time travel, the
ability to move back and forth through time and space in one's mind.
Although most of us take this ability for granted, our capacity to
envision a different time and place is in fact critical to our survival.

It is easy to see why cognitive time travel was naturally selected for
over the course of evolution. It allows us to plan ahead, to save food
and resources for times of scarcity and to endure hard work in
anticipation of a future reward. It also lets us forecast how our current
behavior may influence future generations. If we were not able to
picture the world in a hundred years or more, would we be concerned

17.3 Conclusion

In this chapter, we have sketched a roadmap for AGI development in the context of robot or
virtual preschool scenarios, to a moderate but nowhere near complete level of detail. Completing
the roadmap as sketched here is a tractable but significant project, involving creating more tasks
comparable to those listed above and then precise metrics corresponding to each task.

Such a roadmap does not give a highly rigorous, objective way of assessing the percentage
of progress toward the end-goal of human-level AGI. However, it gives a much better sense
of progress than one would have otherwise. For instance, if an AGI system performed well on
diverse metrics corresponding to 50% of the competency areas listed above, one would seem
justified in claiming to have made very substantial progress toward human-level AGI. If an AGI
system performed well on diverse metrics corresponding to 90% of these competency areas, one
would seem justified in claiming to be almost there. Achieving, say, 25% of the metrics would
give one a reasonable claim to interesting AGI progress. This kind of qualitative assessment of
progress is not the most one could hope for, but again, it is better than the progress indications
one could get without this sort of roadmap.

Part 2 of the book moves on to explaining, in detail, the specific structures and algorithms
constituting the CogPrime design, one AGI approach that we believe to ultimately be capable
of moving all the way along the roadmap outlined here.

The next chapter, intervening between this one and Part 2, explores some more speculative
territory, looking at potential pathways for AGI beyond the preschool-inspired roadmap given
here — exploring the possibility of more advanced AGI systems that modify their own code in
a thoroughgoing way, going beyond the smartest human adults, let alone human preschoolers.
While this sort of thing may seem a far way off, compared to current real-world AI systems,
we believe a roadmap such as the one in this chapter stands a reasonable chance of ultimately
bringing us there.

question of Jerusalem — than any Israeli leader in the search for peace. Even before
I'd left for Camp David, the defections from our coalition meant we’d been left
with only 42 seats in the Knesset, nineteen short of a majority. Amid the first,
sketchy media reports that we were even talking about sharing control of parts of
Jerusalem with the Palestinians, there was a chorus of denunciation from right-
wing politicians back home. Bibi Netanyahu had largely kept out of the public eye
since his resignation after the election. Now, he issued a statement accusing me of
having “broken all the red lines held by all Israeli governments.” During the
President’s final push to save the prospects for a summit agreement, Bibi called a
news conference. He said he was determined to prevent what he called an
impending disintegration of Israeli society. “What we hear from most of the reports
out of Camp David does not answer our hopes,” he said.

It hadn’t answered my hopes either. But I had gone into the summit with my
eyes open. Frustrated though I was by the way the summit had ended, I had no
regrets about going as far as I had in trying to reach, at the minimum, a framework
agreement. In that sense, it is true the summit had failed. But when I’d urged
President Clinton to convene it, I made the argument that if genuine peace was
ever going to be possible, we at least had to know whether Arafat was interested in,
or capable of, playing his part. That question had, for now, been answered. At least
as importantly for Israel, the President of the United States and almost the entire
international community recognized we’d done everything realistically possible to
reach an accommodation. Diplomatically, the ball was in the Palestinians’ court.

There was a final achievement as well — little noticed or remarked upon in the
days immediately after Camp David, but hugely significant. A taboo had been
broken. For the first time, all Israelis recognized what their political leaders, both
Labor and Likud, had long known: a formal, final peace with the Palestinians, if
and when it came, would require us not just to withdraw from the great majority of
the West Bank, but to find a formula for sharing power in Jerusalem. Many Israelis
still believed that was a price too high, and not just Likudniks. A couple of weeks
after the summit, Leah Rabin told an Israeli newspaper that her late husband would
be “turning in his grave” if he’d known the concessions I’d been ready to consider
on Jerusalem. I found the remarks hurtful, but I understood them. In a way, they
drove home the point I’d made to Clinton during the summit: a@// Israelis had a
deep, emotional attachment to our historic capital. “Yitzhak would never have
agreed to compromise on the Old City and the Temple Mount,” Leah said,

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012891.txt,"but — in the millions of years that encompass their evolutionary history, bonobos have remained virtually
unchanged. They are still hairy, quadrupedal, bitsy-brained and barking. They still live in the jungles of
Africa. Not a single bonobo, or its close relative the chimpanzee, has ever taken a step out of Africa the
way that members of our species did some 60-100,000 years ago. In fact, not a single bonobo or
chimpanzee has ever ventured across national borders within the continent to explore new opportunities
or develop new cultures. Not a single bonobo or chimpanzee has even moved out of the forests and on to
the beaches or deserts or alpine environments of Africa. Not one. When we took our steps out of Africa,
we did so with confidence, ready to tackle new environments, create novel tools, engage in rituals to
commemorate the dead, build fires to cook food and keep warm, join hands with unrelated strangers in
the service of cooperation, and create oral histories that could be passed on to generations of children.
What enabled this celebratory migration was a cerebral migration. Not only did our brain get much
bigger than the one housed within bonobo and chimpanzee skulls, it evolved into an engine that generates
an unlimited combination of thoughts and feelings. We uniquely evolved a promiscuous brain.

What does promiscuity buy? In a word: “creativity.” It enables regions of the brain that evolved
for highly specialized functions to intermingle with other regions of the brain to create new ways of
thinking and new ways of experiencing what we see, hear, touch, taste and feel. A promiscuous brain
paved the way for awe-inspiring bursts of creativity in art, music, literature and science. A promiscuous
brain enabled Bach and Bono, Picasso and Pollock, Shakespeare and Shaw, and Descartes and Darwin. A
promiscuous brain enables us to imagine things we have never directly experienced, to create once
unimaginable worlds, including blissful heavens and living hells. My focus in this book has been the
infernos we create for other human beings, here on this earth. What I have argued is that we got here by
accident.

When our brains allowed us to combine familiar thoughts and feelings to create virgin ideas, it
enabled us to feel good about doing bad. It enabled us to incur the costs of punishing others while reaping
the rewards of marching to the moral high ground. It enabled us to solve the problem of large scale
cooperation with unrelated strangers. This was a fundamental breakthrough in mental life, a spectacular
benefit, and the target of strong selection. But benefits often carry hidden costs. When punishment
triggered a honey hit to the brain, violence and reward formed an eternal bond. We now carry the burden
of a brain that engages in denial in order to satisfy our desires. When these concepts couple, the odds of
conceiving excessive harms is virtually guaranteed. Sometimes this malicious offspring is intended and
at other times it is foreseen. Either way, the world has been populated with evildoers in waiting. Either
way, our world hosts a species that has the creative capacity to financially ruin, mutilate, rape, burn,
torture, and extinguish millions of lives. Often, this potential is realized.

My aim in this book has been to explain evil to better understand its origins, not to justify or
promote it. My aim has been to explain evil to clarify its root cause, to alert others to its early warning
signs, and to pave the way to a more humane existence. I have suggested that evil, expressed in the form
of excessive harms, is caused by two ingredients: desire and denial. These are psychological states. On
their own, they are often inert. When combined, they are often explosive.

Desires. We all have them, from birth till death, from a desire for perpetual maternal warmth to a
desire for eternal life. Some of our desires change over the course of our lives while others stay the same.
We all desire good health and happiness. We differ, however, in what counts as good health and
happiness. Many of us experience, at least once in our life, the desire to harm another. Our desire to harm
ranges from the mundane — uttering a sarcastic comment about someone’s looks or telling a racist joke
— to the horrific — creating corrupt corporate schemes or policies of ethnic cleansing. Sometimes what
we desire is rather benign, but linked to foreseeable atrocities. Sometimes our desires are toxic, as when
we plot to extinguish a culturally distinctive group. On one reading, President George W. Bush may well
have initiated the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as retaliatory attacks on terrorists, designed to protect
American interests and well-being. But he brought much of our nation on board by weaving a web of lies
and feeding a cowboy mentality of revenge rather than nurturing compassion and understanding. The
consequences, clearly foreseen at the time, have been excessive. As a nation, we did not pursue an eye-
for-an-eye revenge. We had a different algorithm in mind, on the order of 30,000 eyes for an eye.

are not considered. If they do, the two dynamical objects being compared are
topologically equivalent. The test of this equivalence requires the mapping one set
onto the other with, at most, smooth distortions of either or both surfaces.

In the context of catastrophe-related bifurcation theory, if a 5 converts a
steady valued fixed point to an oscillating cycle on a manifold of potential actions,
also called a state space, then the fixed point system was not structurally stable. In
phase space, this is seen as a change-in-causal-parameter induced transformation
of a dot to a circle. If the one frequency circle is perturbed to a manifold of the
system’s actions consisting of two independent frequencies, the circle takes the
topological form of the crust of a doughnut, one frequency graphed spiral winding
around the doughnut, the other winding along the doughnut around its orifice, the
circle is not structurally stable. If 5 distorts the frequency-amplitude relations on a
surface such that the manifold of possible actions is distorted from a doughnut to a
tea cup, both topological manifolds being one holed surfaces and therefore
topologically equivalent, the system is structurally stable. Perturbed systems that
maintain the sequence of points in time in sequential order (though the distances
between the points may be different), are generally structurally stable.

The seductive possibility, one which Thom realized so successfully, was
that in the language of distance-independent differential topological forms, there
would exist a small, finite set of shapes categorically describing the causes and
result parameter spaces from which, even without specific quantities, universal
qualitative (including discontinuous) behavior could be described and sometimes
predicted. A formal yet general categorical system within which a small set of
universal discontinuous changes in global qualities could be rationalized seemed
seductively applicable to the enlightenment transitions, spiritual transformations,
appearing suddenly after months and years of disciplined spiritual practice. The
Platonic view is that the universal forms of discontinuous change existed before
they could be about anything specific, before the universe was born.

In this era of nonlinear dynamics and dynamical system, common dynamical

scenarios give accounts of smooth changes in causes leading to discontinuous

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018604.txt,"arises in response to a genuine emotional threat... or deliberate manipulation.

There's another reason, though... I've also noticed that some switch in my brain has
flipped, and I've started to eroticize jealousy. I occasionally find myself fantasizing about
men I care about sleeping with other women, and sometimes the fantasy is hot because I
feel mildly jealous. I cannot explain how this happened. It surprised me the first time it
happened, believe me. What's really fascinating is that I think the same part of me that
eroticizes jealousy, is the part that used to make me feel sick at the thought of my partner
sleeping with someone else. Masochism: the gift that never stops giving!

I think it's important to note here that I didn't become less jealous because I felt like I
should, or because I was told not to be jealous. In fact, I had an early boyfriend who
acted like I was a hysterical bitch every time I got jealous... and he made things much
worse. With him, I just felt awful when I got jealous; I couldn't get past it. I felt like he
was judging me for something I couldn't help; I felt like my mind was fragmenting as I
tried to force myself to think better without any outside support; and worst of all, I felt
like I couldn't rely on him to respect my feelings.

It was the men who treated my emotions like they were reasonable and understandable
who decreased my jealousy. It's much harder to be jealous when your partner is saying, I
totally understand, than it is when your partner is saying, What the hell is the matter
with you? Maybe that's what makes monogamy such an effective jealousy-management
tactic: monogamy can be like a great big sign or sticker or button you can give to your
partner that says, I respect your jealousy. Which is not to say that monogamy is always
effective for this -- we all know that monogamous people get jealous all the time! (Which
only adds to my point that monogamy might be viewed as just one of many tactics, rather
than an answer, when jealousy is a problem.)

+ Focus. There's an oft-repeated joke among polyamorists that while love may be
infinite, time is not. And sometimes, I've found it a little difficult to switch gears to a
different partner. New Relationship Energy can be a little harder to manage in the
polyamorous context than it is in serial monogamy.

I've heard of polyamorous couples who specifically take periods of monogamy when one
partner really wants one. This seems like it could be problematic -- for example, if my
hypothetical primary partner wanted a period of monogamy, and I had a secondary
partner (or partners) with a serious emotional connection, then I probably would not be
cool with straight-up ignoring my secondary for weeks or months. There'd have to be
more of a conversation about it. But regardless, this whole line of thinking makes an
interesting showcase of how sometimes, people feel like they just have to focus on one
relationship.

Personally, I'm quite interested in S&M games of orgasm denial, though I've never had a
chance to mess around with it as much as I'd like. I'm also interested in long-term lust
management strategies like karezza, where the partners involved choose not to have
orgasms -- instead, they maintain a low level of mutual arousal at all times. I have no
moral problem with my partners looking at porn or having orgasms on their own, but
sometimes when I hear about the effects of choosing not to do those things, it sounds like
there's really powerful bonding potential there. Something to keep in mind for the next

case of ending the Israeli occupation of Arab lands. I hoped to see demands
include US non-interference in the affairs of the region, especially in Syria, Iraq,
Yemen and Libya. I hoped to see Arabic demands to compensate Iraq for its
devastation out of US invasion, compensate Syria for the damages resulted by the

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016937.txt,"Alex “Sandy” Pentland, an exponent of what he has termed “social physics,” is
interested in building powerful human-Al ecologies. He is concerned at the same time
about the potential dangers of decision-making systems in which the data in effect take
over and human creativity is relegated to the background.

The advent of Big Data, he believes, has given us the opportunity to reinvent our
civilization: “We can now begin to actually look at the details of social interaction and
how those play out, and we re no longer limited to averages like market indices or
election results. This is an astounding change. The ability to see the details of the
market, of political revolutions, and to be able to predict and control them is definitely a
case of Promethean fire—it could be used for good or for ill. Big Data brings us to
interesting times.”

At our group meeting in Washington, Connecticut, he confessed that reading
Norbert Wiener on the concept of feedback “felt like reading my own thoughts.”

“After Wiener, people discovered or focused on the fact that there are genuinely
chaotic systems that are just not predictable,” he said, “but if you look at human
socioeconomic systems, there is a large percentage of variance you can account for and
predict. ... Today there is data from all sorts of digital devices, and from all of our
transactions. The fact that everything is datafied means you can measure things in real
time in most aspects of human life—and increasingly in every aspect of human life. The
fact that we have interesting computers and machine-learning techniques means that you
can build predictive models of human systems in ways you could never do before.”

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011477.txt,"Jordan River from the West Bank, from which a fledgling group called Fatah,
under the command of Arafat, had been staging a series of raids. In one of their
most recent attacks, they’d planted land mines, one of which destroyed an
Israeli schoolbus, killing the driver and one of the teachers and injuring nearly a
dozen children. The so-called Battle of Karameh was our single most significant
operation since the 1967 war. In pure military terms, it succeeded. But at a
price: more than two dozen Israeli soldiers dead. It also had a major political
impact. It caused shock among many Israelis, still wrapped in a sense of
invincibility from the Six-Day War, as well as a feeling in the Arab world,
actively encouraged by Arafat and his comrades, that compared to the great
armies Israel had defeated in 1967, Fatah had at least shown fight. Fatah had
drawn blood.

I had just turned 26 years old. I was finishing my studies in math, physics
and economics at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and had joined my
Sayeret Matkal comrades the night before the assault. It was a huge operation:
ten battalions, including crack infantry units. Our own role was relatively minor.
We were to seal the southern entrance to the town. But it proved a tough slog
just to get there. Our vehicles got bogged down in mud. By the time we arrived,
Fatah fighters, although many were in civilian clothes so we couldn’t be sure,
were racing past us in the other direction. One of them, we were later told, was
Yasir Arafat. On a motorcycle.

It would be nearly three decades before the two of us actually met — shortly
after the assassination of my longtime comrade and friend Yitzhak Rabin, when
I had become Foreign Minister under Shimon Peres. But in the intervening
years, Arafat was rarely off of my radar. By the early 1970s, he and his fighters
had been expelled by King Hussein’s army from Jordan and were re-based in
Lebanon. Arafat was becoming a significant figure on the Arab and world
political stage, and an increasingly uncomfortable thorn in Israel’s side. I was
head of Sayeret Matkal by then. Over a period of months, I drew up a carefully
constructed plan — a raid by helicopter into a Fatah-dominated area in
southeastern Lebanon, during one of Arafat’s intermittent, morale-boosting
visits from Beirut — to assassinate him. My immediate superior, the army’s head
of operations, was all for our doing it. But the chief of military intelligence said
no. Arafat, he insisted when we met to discuss the plan, was no longer the lean,
mean fighter we had encountered in Karameh. “He’s fat. He’s a politician. He is
not a target.”

Subject: Jawbone/Mort 
Hi Darren, 
Just checking back in on the Jawbone investment. Thanks for sending across your comments. If possible, we 
would like to avoid a situation where we recirculate the investment agreements in place with Jawbone's 
other investors, and our hope is that we can accommodate as many of your comments as possible short of 
taking that step. 
We think that the best way to address your comments would be to have Jawbone enter into a new purchase 
agreement covering both the preferred and the common stock being sold to Mort. Jawbone would make its 
representations and warranties anew upon the closing of the purchase agreement, so Mort would not be 
relying on the reps made back in June 2011, nor on the schedule of exceptions prepared in connection with 
the initial closing. The new purchase agreement would have the same closing conditions that applied to the 
initial closing of the JP Morgan investment. 
Given the affiliation between Mort, Hedosophia and Apoletto and their collective investment in preferred 
and common stock, we also want to propose that Mort (along with the other two parties) be treated as a 
Major Investor under the Investor Rights Agreement so long as their collective holdings of preferred and 
common stock remains at least equal to 2,000,000 shares. We intend to do this with a side letter that would 
not require the signature of the other parties to those documents. You have already seen the draft 
amendment that would expand the definition of Registrable Securities in the investor rights agreement to 
include the common stock being purchased by Mort, and we do anticipate that our principal investors will 
quickly sign that document once we circulate it. 
You had indicated a desire to have JP Morgan approve the sale of Series 5 Preferred outside of the existing 
purchase agreement. As I indicated to you on the phone, we do not think that this is necessary, but we are 
willing to obtain from them an acknowledgement to that effect prior to the closing of Mort's investment. 
We do believe, however, that various of your other requests for change in the investor documents would 
require a broader amendment and restatement of the applicable documents, and some of them concern 
business points that were the subject of specific negotiation with JP Morgan and others of our investors in 
prior rounds. These points include your comments to the drag along rights, the registration rights, the 
information rights and the venue provisions. We would like those terms to remain as we had negotiated 
them with JP Morgan. 
If you are comfortable with the approach outlined in this email, we can get you draft documents, including a 
draft updated Schedule of Exceptions, tomorrow for your review and approval. Please let me know.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013966.txt,"It is fatal to know too much at the outcome: boredom comes as quickly to the traveler who
knows his route as to the novelist who is overcertain of his plot.

—PAUL THEROUX, To the Ends of the Earth

L, this is your first time considering a commitment to the mobile lifestyle and long-term adventuring, I

envy you! Making the jump and entering the new worlds that await is like upgrading your role in life
from passenger to pilot.

The bulk of this Q&A will focus on the precise steps that you should take—and the countdown
timeline you can use—when preparing for your first mini-retirement. Most steps can be eliminated or
condensed once you get one trip under your belt. Some of the steps are one-time events, after which
subsequent mini-retirements will require a maximum of two to three weeks of preparation. It now takes
me three afternoons.

Grab a pencil and paper—this will be fun.

1. Take an asset and cash-flow snapshot.

Set two sheets of paper on a table. Use one to record all assets and corresponding values, including bank
accounts, retirement accounts, stocks, bonds, home, and so forth. On the second, draw a line down the
middle and write down all incoming cash flow (salary, muse income, investment income, etc.) and
outgoing expenses (mortgage, rent, car payments, etc.). What can you eliminate that is either seldom used
or that creates stress or distraction without adding a lot of value?

2. Fear-set a one-year mini-retirement in a dream location in Europe.
Use the questions from chapter 3 to evaluate your worst-case-scenario fears and evaluate the real
potential consequences. Except in rare cases, most will be avoidable and the rest will be reversible.

3. Choose a location for your actual mini-retirement. Where to start?
This is the big question. There are two options that I advocate:

1. Choose a starting point and then wander until you find your second home. This is what I did with a
one-way ticket to London, vagabonding throughout Europe until I fell in love with Berlin, where I
remained for three months.

2. Scout a region and then settle in your favorite spot. This is what I did with a tour of Central and
South America, where I spent one to four weeks in each of several cities, after which I returned to
my favorite— Buenos Aires—for six months.

It is possible to take a mini-retirement in your own country, but the transformative effect is hampered if
you are surrounded by people who carry the same socially reinforced baggage.

I recommend choosing an overseas location that will seem foreign but that isn’t dangerous. I box, race

motorcycles, and do all sorts of macho things, but I draw the line at favelas ~ civilians with machine
guns, pedestrians with machetes, and social strife. Cheap is good, but bullet holes are bad. Check the
U.S. Department of State for travel warnings before booking tickets (http:// travel.state.gov).

Here are just a few of my favorite starting points. Feel free to choose other locations. The most
lifestyle for the dollar is underlined: Argentina (Buenos Aires, Cordoba), China (Shanghai, Hong Kong,
Taipei), Japan (Tokyo, Osaka), England (London), Ireland (Galway), Thailand (Bangkok, Chiang Mai),
Germany (Berlin, Munich), Norway (Oslo), Australia (Sydney), New Zealand (Queenstown), Italy

warrant and the PRISM slides, few of the other documents that Snowden had given Poitras and
Greenwald for publication had little to do with either domestic surveillance or the infringements
on the privacy of Americans. By the Lawfare Institute’s count, 32 of Snowden’s leaks to these
journalists concerned the NSA’s overseas sources and method, nine identified overseas locations
of the NSA’s intelligence bases, 25 of them revealed the identities of foreign officials of interest to
US intelligence agencies, 14 of them disclosed information about Internet companies legally
cooperating with the NSA, and 19 of them concerned technology products that the NSA had been
using or researching. In addition, a considerable number of the published documents did not
even belong to the NSA but were copies of reports sent to the NSA by its allies, including the
British, Australian, Canadian, French, Norwegian and Israeli intelligence services. For example,
he provided journalists with secret documents from the British cyber service GCHQ describing its
own plans to obtain a legal warrant to penetrate the Russian computer security firm Kaspersky to
expand its “computer network exploitation capability. All the GCHQ was revealing in this
document was its own capabilities to monitor a Russian target of interest to it. While the release
of these foreign documents may have embarrassed foreign allies of the United States, they
exposed no violations of US law by the NSA. It was a legitimate part of the NSA’s job to share
information with its allies. This raises the question: what constitutes whistle-blowing?

To the general public no doubt, a whistle-blower is simply a person who exposes government
misdeeds from inside that government. But in the eyes of the law someone who discloses
classified information to an unauthorized person, even as an act of personal conscience, is not
exempt from punitive consequences of his act. Indeed, if a person deliberately reveals secret US
operations, especially ones that compromise the sources and methods of US intelligence services,
he or she may run afoul of American espionage laws.

In the past when government employees have disclosed classified information to journalist to
redress perceived government misconduct, they almost always received prison sentences, Just
during Obama’s presidency, there were six government employees who, as a matter of personal
conscience, shared classified information they obtained from the FBI, CIA, State Department and
US Army with journalists. They were Shamai Leibowitz in 2010, Chelsea Manning in 2013, John
Kiriakou in 2013, Donald Sachtleben in 2013, Stephen Kim in 2014 and Jeffrey Sterling in 2014.
Like Snowden, they claimed to be whistle-blowers informing the public of abuses of the
government. But since they disclosed classified documents, they were dealt with as law-breakers.
All six men were indicted, tried, convicted and received prison sentences. Sterling, a CIA officer
who allegedly turned over a document to James Risen, a Pulitzer Prize winning reporter for the
New York Times, was sentenced to 42 months, for example. The most severe sentence was meted
out to Private Bradley/Chelsea Manning, who an Army court sentenced to 35 years in a military
stockade.

The prison time that others received did not go unnoticed by Snowden. He had been following
the Manning case since 2012. In fact, he posted about it shortly before he began stealing far more

there. Although no allegations of trafficking or anything of
that nature, just that she was there. And they are seeking to
introduce evidence through Louie Freeh, who we'll discuss ina
moment, they've proposed, and he's clearly an expert that was
undisclosed, and through a FOIA record, and through the
articles to allege that he wasn't on the island.

And so in your Honor's order in 264-1, which is one of

the sealed orders, you did not allow us to depose him because
you said it was irrelevant.

So we're now in a position where at trial they want to

put forth that information against my client, and I don't have

an under-oath statement from that individual saying whether or

not he actually was.

Now, what we know is he flew with Jeffrey Epstein at

the same time 19 different times internationally and

nationally, but we don't have him with respect to this

particular allegation under oath. So we would say it would be
highly prejudicial for them to be able introduce evidence
saying that he wasn't there or that they have some proof or
some expert saying he wasn't there when, in fact, we weren't
able to ask him directly, the person who is at issue, under

oath, whether or not he did, in fact, go there.

So one of the streamlining of this case is that

allegation has nothing to do with sexual abuse, it doesn't have

to do with the statements

Justice O’Connor was not, of course, the first (or the last) public office to use Christianity in the
of partisan politics. The issue got so bad during the 1984 presidential race that Walter Mondale
found it necessary to remind Ronald Reagan that in the United States the president, unlike the
queen of England, is “not the defender of the faith” but rather the “defender of the Constitution.”

In 2012, A Republican candidate for President, Rick Santorum, said that the concept of an
absolute separation of church and state, as articulated by John Kennedy when he was running for
president, “makes me want to throw up.” Other candidates, though expressly themselves less
graphically, have also railed against the separation of church and state. “Faith” has become
synonymous with “values” in the minds of many although there is absolutely no correlation.
Indeed, the “values” espoused by people who would impose their faith on others are highly
questionable. They include denying gays the equal protection of the law, denying women (and
young girls) the right to choose abortion, and sometimes contraception, even in compelling cases;
and, often, other conservative political “values” that have nothing to do with religion, such as low
taxes, the right to bear arms, the death penalty and widespread censorship. The debates over
these issues, especially gay rights and the right to choose abortion, have become wedge
controversies that are unduly influenced by the churches in violation of the spirit, if not the letter,
of our Constitution.

The rights of gays to absolute equality

When I was growing up, it was impermissible to use any words that were demeaning to African
Americans (who we called Negroes or colored), to other religions or ethnic minorities (except for
the Germans and Japanese during World War IJ) or to women. But insulting gay boys (we had no
idea there even were lesbians) was perfectly acceptable. Indeed, we commonly used “the F word”
to insult non-athletic classmates or effeminate-looking boys. We never actually met a real live
homosexual (at least to our knowledge) but we knew there was “something wrong” with anybody
who was sexually attracted to people of the same gender.

Our bigotry was not religiously based, though we knew that the Bible prohibited sex between men
(perhaps the Bible’s authors, like us, had no idea there were lesbians). We just didn’t like
“homos.” It was as simple as that. You really do have to be taught to hate (as said the words of
a song from a show popular back in the day.) And we were taught to treat all people, except

gays, equally.

It’s very different among today’s youth, at least in parts of the world that I frequent. Most young
people I encounter can’t even understand why anyone would discriminate against someone based
on his or her sexual orientation or preference.

Today, the discrimination does seem religiously based, at least to a significant degree. The Bible
is frequently cited as the authoritative source for condemning homosexuality, and the sanctity (a

religious term) of marriage between a man and a woman serves as the primary basis for
opposition to gay marriage.

At the bottom end of the spectrum is infrared light. Pit vipers have
evolved special organs on the sides of their heads to ‘see’ in this spectrum
and they use this sense to hunt prey in the dark. I use the word see with
some caution. We have no idea what their sensation of ‘heat-sight
involves, but their organs are very precise, able to detect things only 0.2
degrees warmer than the background.

Infrared cues help several species of snakes, bats and insects locate
things in the dark, but the animal that excels at the task, albeit using
technology, is mankind. Special cameras allow us to use infrared to see
in the dark or detect where our houses lose heat.

X-rays are much higher in frequency — about one hundred times
that of the ultraviolet light that affects our T-shirts. The high frequency
corresponds to a small wavelength that allows the rays to pass through
our bodies. Later on in the book we will understand that frequency is not
a proper explanation for light, as it is not a wave but rather a particle that
obeys the laws of a wave. But for now we will ignore this detail.

The first use of X-ray images was to see broken bones. Bones block
the rays as they are dense, but the soft parts of our bodies are almost
completely transparent to X-rays. We can see the soft tissues if we turn
the contrast up, but there are problems when using X-rays to view the
brain. Our skull completely encases the brain and however much we turn
the contrast up, all we see is bone. The solution to this problem is to
perform sophisticated mathematical tricks using a computer to enhance
the contrast ratio and make image ‘slices’ through the living head.

The slicing technique was invented independently in the 1970s
by Sir Godfrey Hounsfield, working for EMI in England, and Allan
Cormack, of Tufts University in America, and they shared the 1979
Nobel Prize for Medicine for their work. Legend has it that EMI was
making so much money from The Beatles they could fund the enormous
development cost of the CAT scanner from the profits; true or not, it’s a
great invention.

The best way to understand the mathematics is to picture yourself
in an episode of ‘CSI, the American television crime drama. An intruder
has attacked someone with a knife and there are blood spatters all over
the walls of the room. Enter the brilliant pathologist who reconstructs
the scene of the crime from the pattern of blood on the wall. She can map
the trajectory of the blood spatters and back-calculate that the attacker
must have been 5’ 4”, left-handed and wielding a 6” blade. In a CAT scan,
our head is hit with billions of rays that bounce and scatter over the walls
of the machine. Sensors detect the rays and a mathematical algorithm
calculates an image of the body that would produce such a pattern. To

concern and interest in the broader community by political activity or volunteer work
among the sick or underprivileged; and whether he had manifested leadership, industry,
perseverance, self-discipline and intense motivation.

Moreover, if petitioner were to conclude that the medical profession as presently
composed fails to serve the disadvantaged elements in society, then it could also consider
whether applicants for admission, irrespective of race or ethnicity, manifest a genuine
commitment to serve those groups currently lacking adequate service. Indeed, it could
expressly offer special consideration in the admissions process to those who enter into a
binding commitment to serve for a specified period in an urban ghetto, barrio or Indian
reservation.

All of these procedures would result in greater educational opportunities for members of
our society's historically deprived minorities, as well as other applicants who are
economically and culturally deprived; none of them would offend the Constitution. But
what the school may not do, we submit, is to classify applicants for admission on the basis
of race or ethnicity and so structure its selection process as to admit an essentially
predetermined proportion of members of certain groups.

The Supreme Court’s decision in Bakke accepted our argument against the sort of racial quotas
employed by the medical school at issue, but it approved affirmative action programs, such as the
one used by Harvard College, that vested enormous discretion in the Admissions Committee. A
five person majority ruled that the type of admissions program used by Davis Medical School did
not pass constitutional muster, while the type used by Harvard College does. Justice Powell,
whose opinion contained the judgment of the Court, expressly singled out Harvard College for
approval. He quoted extensively from the description of the Harvard program contained in the
amicus curiae brief submitted by Harvard, Columbia, Stanford and Pennsylvania universities.
Powell apparently found it easier to point to an existing system than to define the factors that
would satisfy the constitutional and statutory standard (This reminded me of Justice Steward’s “I
know it when I see it” quip about hard core pornography.)

Powell’s selection of Harvard College as a model for Davis Medical School was inapt, both
because medical school admission is vastly different from college admission and because Harvard,
with its vast applicant pool, is vastly different from Davis. But Powell had a good reason for
pointing to the Harvard undergraduate admissions program: it is so vague and discretionary as to
defy description. It reposes all decision making with a group of Platonic guardians whose task is
to shape an entering class so as to maximize its diversity in certain unspecified ways. A Harvard
admissions officer may be unable to define the factors that make a good candidate for admission,
but is supposed to know a Harvard man or woman when he sees one.

The Bakke decision was thus a triumph of ambiguity and discretion over clarity and candor.
Powell condemned Davis Medical School for reserving a discrete number of places in each class
for disadvantaged members of specified minority groups, but he applauded Harvard College for
employing a process that eschews “target-quotas for the number of blacks” but allows “the race

More good news. Even if you permanently relocate to another country, you will have to pay U.S. taxes as
long as you have a U.S. passport! Not to fret—there are some creative legal sidesteps, such as form
2555-EZ, which can provide up to an $85,700 income exemption if you spend at least 330 days of a
consecutive 365 days off U.S. soil. This means you have 35 days in a given 12-month period to spend in
the U.S. as you like, but no more. That’s part of the reason my 2004 trip extended to 15 months. Get a
good accountant and let them do the detail work to keep yourself out of trouble.

» U.S.-Sponsored Overseas Schools (www:state.gov/m/a/os)

If the idea of pulling your children out of school for a year or two isn’t appealing, stick them in one of
more than 190 elementary and secondary schools sponsored by the U.S. Department of State in 135
countries. Kids love home work.

This subsection of http://homeschooling.about.com/provides a step-by-step process for considering
homeschooling options that can be applied to education during extended travel. Children can often return
to traditional public or private schools ahead of their classmates.

» Home Education Magazine (www.homeedmag.com) Rich collection of resources for homeschoolers,
traveling families, and unschoolers. Links include curriculum, virtual support groups, legal resources,
and archives. Good reasons to learn the law: Some U‘S. states offer up to $1,600 of funding per year for
qualified homeschooling expenditures, as it saves the state money to not educate your child in the public
school system.

Before you get caught up in the excitement and forget that five British pounds does not equal five U.S.
dollars, use this to translate local costs into numbers you understand. Try not to have too many “Those
coins are each worth four dollars?” moments.

» Universal Plug Adapter ( www.franzus.com )

Carrying bulky cables and connectors is irritating—get a Travel Smart all-in-one adapter with surge
protection. The size of a pack of cards folded in half, it is the only adapter that ve used everywhere
without problems. Note that it is an adapter (helps you plug things in), but it is not a transformer. If the
foreign wall outlet has twice as much voltage as in the U'S., your gadgets will self-destruct. Yet another
reason to purchase necessities abroad instead of taking them all with you.

of the night thinking about this case. I would like to see if

I can clarify my understanding.

In the motion to dismiss, I concluded, I think, that

what was at issue was the truth or falsity of the plaintiff's

allegations concerning sexual abuse and the activities of the

defendant. I think that's my sense of my own opinion.
Yesterday, we were discussing the redactions of the

intervention motion. I got the sense, perhaps wrongly, that

the plaintiff's position was that the defamation was the truth

or falsity of the statements relating to the defendant.
Period. Am I correct?

MS. McCAWLEY: You are, your Honor, in that the

statements about the defendant to be clear, because one of

the allegations is, of course, she was a madam and a

The Fusion of Civilizations 
The Case for Global Optimism

May/June 2016 issue

The mood of much of the world is grim these days. Turmoil in the Middle 
East, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of refugees; 
random terrorist attacks across the globe; geopolitical tensions in eastern 
Europe and Asia; the end of the commodity supercycle; slowing growth in 
China; and economic stagnation in many countries-all have combined to 
feed a deep pessimism about the present and, worse, the future. 
Historians looking back on this age from the vantage point of later 
generations, however, are likely to be puzzled by the widespread 
contemporary feelings of gloom and doom. By most objective measures of 
human well-being, the past three decades have been the best in history. 
More and more people in more and more places are enjoying better lives 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026840 
than ever before. Nor is this an accident-because despite Samuel 
Huntington's foreboding, what has occurred over recent generations is not a 
clash of civilizations but a fusion of civilizations. 
To put it simply, the great world civilizations, which used to have detached 
and separate identities, now have increasingly overlapping areas of 
commonality. Most people around the world now have the same aspirations 
as the Western middle classes: they want their children to get good 
educations, land good jobs, and live happy, productive lives as members of 
stable, peaceful communities. Instead of feeling depressed, the West should 
be celebrating its phenomenal success at injecting the key elements of its 
worldview into other great civilizations. 
The march of reason, triggered in the West by the Enlightenment, is 
spreading globally, leading to the emergence of pragmatic problem-solving 
cultures in every region and making it possible to envisage the emergence of 
a stable and sustainable rules-based order. There is every reason to believe, 
moreover, that the next few decades can be even better for humanity than 
the last few-so long as the West does not lose confidence in its core values 
and retreat from global engagement. The greatest danger of the current 
pessimism, therefore, is that it might become a self-fulfilling prophecy, 
leading to fear and withdrawal rather than attempts to reinvigorate the 
existing global system. 
The origins of the contemporary era lie in the West's transformation during 
the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and the Industrial Revolution. No 
other civilization can take credit for giving birth to modernity. This was not 
done with some benign intent to uplift humanity in general; there were 
many problems along the way, and the explosion of Western power across 
the globe had some terrible consequences for other cultures and regions. Yet 
the ultimate result was the diffusion of a modern outlook that relies on 
science and rationality to solve problems, much to the ultimate benefit of 
the planet's population. 
As recently as half a century ago, for example, there was a global clash of 
economic ideologies. Nikita Khrushchev, the former leader of the Soviet 
Union, could claim that the state was better at delivering basic goods to 
citizens than free markets were, but today such a view would be laughed at. 
The market economy has made Chinese and Indian workers today far more 
productive than they were under Mao Zedong or Jawaharlal Nehru, India's 
first prime minister. Societies now accept the simple fact that workers need 
material incentives to be productive, which has led to increased dignity and 
self-worth. The vast majority of humanity is literate, is at least somewhat 
mobile, and has access to the world's store of existing knowledge. Around 
half of the adults in the world own a smartphone, and there are now more 
connected mobile devices in total than there are people on the planet. 
The spread of science and technology, meanwhile, has also improved human 
dignity and well-being. Most people used to experience lives that were nasty, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026841 
brutish, and short. Today, life expectancy has increased by leaps and bounds 
virtually everywhere. Infant and maternal mortality have dropped sharply, 
thanks in part to the spread of clear hygiene standards and the construction 
of modern hospitals. According to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, as 
recently as 1988, polio was rampant in 125 countries; today that number is 
down to two. Aside from among the Taliban and a few pockets of upscale 
communities in the United States, the virtues of vaccines are accepted by all, 
part of a general consensus on the virtues of Western science and 
technology. 
And reason is replacing superstition more generally. People around the 
world now routinely do basic cost-benefit analyses when looking for 
solutions to problems, leading to a gradual improvement in outcomes 
everywhere, from agriculture and construction to social and political life. 
This helps explain the dramatic long-term decline in the rates of most kinds 
of conflict and violence that the Harvard scholar Steven Pinker has 
documented. 
After slavery and imprisonment, the most degrading condition a human 
being can experience is poverty. In 2000, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan 
announced as one of the ambitious Millennium Development Goals halving 
extreme global poverty by 2015. That goal was far exceeded, and the U.S. 
National Intelligence Council has predicted that extreme poverty will be 
reduced even further by 203o-which would constitute one of the most 
remarkable developments in human history. The global middle class, 
meanwhile, is projected to rise from 1.8 billion in 2009 to 3.2 billion in 
2020 and 4.9 billion in 2030. The world's infant mortality rate decreased 
from an estimated 63 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 32 in 2015. This 
translates into more than four million fewer infant deaths each year. 
Instead of optimism based on this recent progress, however, these days in 
the West, one more often encounters pessimism related to three current 
challenges: turbulence in the Islamic world, the rise of China, and intra-
Western economic and political sclerosis. But the pessimism is 
unwarranted, because none of these three challenges is insurmountable. 
MODERNIZING MUSLIMS 
The Islamic world, from Morocco to Indonesia, comprises 1.6 billion 
citizens-more than one in five people on the planet. The vast majority of 
them share the common global aspirations to modernize their societies, 
achieve middle-class living standards, and lead peaceful, productive, and 
fulfilling lives. 
Contrary to what some assert, Islam is fully compatible with modernization. 
When Malaysia built the Petronas Towers and Dubai built Burj Khalifa, they 
were not just erecting physical structures but also sending a metaphysical 
message: we want to be part of the modern world in all dimensions. Many 
Islamic societies have educated their women. In Malaysian universities, the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026842 
women outnumber the men 65 percent to 35 percent. Even some Islamic 
countries that were initially reluctant to embrace modernization have begun 
to do so. For example, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates 
now feature satellite campuses of major Western universities. One reason 
for the shift is that the experience of other regions, such as Asia, has shown 
that modernization does not simply equal westernization-that it is possible 
to pursue, say, economic and social development while still retaining 
distinctive cultural characteristics. 
It is true that a certain number of young Muslims will continue to choose 
rebellion against the modern world rather than integration into it, joining 
radical Islamist groups and trying to wreak havoc where they can. About 
30,000 Muslim fighters from all over the world, including the West, have 
joined the Islamic State (also known as ISIS). But however much they 
constitute a major global security problem, they are dwarfed by, say, the 200 
million nonradical Muslims who live peacefully in Indonesia alone. 
Indonesia has elected two consecutive leaders committed to integrating the 
country into the modern world, and its largest Muslim organization, the 50-
million-plus-member Nandlatul Ulama, has publicly challenged ISIS' 
actions and ideology. 
The real challenge, therefore, is not the Islamic world per se but figuring out 
how to bolster the pro-modernization trends in that world while containing 
the radical trend. In retrospect, it was a mistake for the West to have 
remained silent when Saudi funding dramatically increased the number of 
radical madrasahs around the world. A comparable investment today in 
building a good modern school next to each radical one would create a 
contest for legitimacy that would likely spread Enlightenment values far and 
wide. Such a program could be undertaken by the UN agencies UNESCO 
and UNICEF at relatively modest cost, and it is only one of many possible 
lines of advance in attacking the problem. 
CHALLENGING CHINESE 
The second great challenge many worry about is the rise of China. China's 
success, however, can also be seen as the ultimate triumph of the West. The 
emperor Qianlong famously wrote to Great Britain's King George III in 1793 
saying, Our Celestial Empire possesses all things in prolific abundance and 
lacks no product within its own borders. There [is] therefore no need to 
import the manufactures of outside barbarians in exchange for our own 
produce. Two centuries later, the Chinese understand that absorbing 
Western modernity into their society has been crucial to their country's 
reemergence. It has led to rapid economic growth, new and gleaming 
infrastructure, triumphs in space exploration, the spectacular 2008 Olympic 
Games in Beijing, and much more. 
Even as Chinese society has accepted modernity with great enthusiasm, 
however, it has not abandoned its Chinese cultural roots. The Chinese look 
at their modern Chinese civilization and emphasize its Chineseness, seeing 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026843 
no contradiction. Indeed, China is now experiencing its own cultural 
renaissance, fueled by its new affluence. 
The duality of the Chinese story is reflected in the West's schizophrenic 
response to it. The Nixon administration eagerly sought better relations with 
China under Mao, and when Deng Xiaoping doubled down by opening up 
the country, the West applauded the change. The United States generously 
accepted Chinese products into its markets, allowed massive trade 
surpluses, welcomed China into the World Trade Organization in 2001, and 
kept global sea-lanes open so that China could trade freely. All of this 
enabled China to emerge as the world's number one trading power by 2013. 
The United States also generously allowed more than a million Chinese 
students to study in its universities. 
Yet the rise of China has also led to deep fears. China continues to be run by 
a communist party that has no desire to embrace liberal democracy. China 
has displayed a belligerent side in some of its dealings with Japan and some 
members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations over territorial 
disputes in the East China and South China Seas. The possibility of an 
aggressive, militaristic China cannot be ruled out. 
But we have come a vast distance since the days when Mao openly talked 
about the possibility of winning a nuclear war, and Chinese history suggests 
that Beijing will ultimately prefer to join, rather than replace or reject, the 
current rules-based order that the West has created. As the world's number 
one trading power, China has the most to lose from a breakdown of the 
global economic system. Historically, moreover, what the Chinese have 
feared most is luan (chaos). This might lead to heavy-handed efforts to 
preserve order domestically, but it should lead Beijing to support a rules-
based order at the global level as well. Undoubtedly, as China grows more 
powerful, it will become more assertive. This has happened. But since China 
needs a few more decades of peace to complete its modernization, it has 
strong reasons to restrain itself militarily and avoid a conflict. 
Chinese society will never become a replica of Western society. China's own 
culture is too rich to be absorbed into any other cultural universe. Yet a 
modernizing China will feature overlapping aspirations in many areas, as, 
for example, with the rapid spread of Western classical music. In 2008, 36 
million Chinese children were studying the piano (six times the number of 
U.S. children doing so), and another 50 million were studying the violin. 
Some Chinese cities can fill the halls of 15 opera houses in one evening. 
A modern China with thriving Western classical orchestras and Western-
style universities provides a powerful demonstration of the fusion of 
civilizations. Western statesmen should allow this dynamic to gain 
momentum while remaining patient on other areas of change, such as in the 
political realm. China's development will not necessarily be linear, but in the 
long run, it should continue in a positive direction. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026844 
PESSIMISTIC POPULISTS 
The third challenge today is a widespread loss of confidence in the West 
about its own systems and future potential. Sluggish growth across the 
developed world, stagnant incomes for much of the population, rising 
economic inequality, political gridlock, and the emergence of populist 
insurgencies on both sides of the political spectrum have fueled a 
widespread sense that Western models of governance and economic 
management are floundering. 
Many of these problems are real and important. But they are not beyond the 
capacity of determined leadership to solve, nor do they represent 
fundamental weaknesses of the Western model. So the pessimism strikes us 
as dramatically overdone, like previous bouts of declinism and worry that 
the West's best days were past. The greatest danger, in fact, is that the 
widespread pessimism will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Gloomy 
Western policymakers and publics are more likely to see threats than 
opportunities and to turn away from the world rather than continue to lead 
it successfully. 
This is notable in the rising opposition, for example, to the Trans-Pacific 
Partnership, a major trade deal that would help extend and deepen the 
liberal order across a broad swath of the globe. It is evident in the increasing 
suspicion of immigrants and refugees and in the growing support for closing 
borders. And it can be seen in the fraying and potential unraveling of 
international institutions such as the European Union, formerly a model of 
progressive international integration. 
It would be a terrible shame if the West walked away from the very 
international order that it created after World War II and that has facilitated 
so much security, prosperity, and development over the decades. Instead, it 
should try to reinvigorate that order, with three moves in particular: 
working with China and India, bolstering international rules, and 
accentuating the positive global trends that get lost in all the hysteria about 
the negative ones. 
Why China and India? Because they have the largest populations and 
economies in the developing world, are led by strong, reform-minded 
leaders, and are approaching the future with dynamism, optimism, and 
hope. Both understand that they need to take on greater responsibilities in 
confronting global problems, and as last fall's Paris climate agreement 
demonstrates, they are already starting to do so. 
Although China's rise has been one of the universally acknowledged 
wonders of the age, India's recent rise has been impressive as well, as India, 
too, has embraced modernization, globalization, and Enlightenment 
rationalism. Along the way, India has maintained the world's largest 
democracy, successfully accommodated an amazingly diverse cultural and 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026845 
demographic mosaic, and kept its head and its values even under repeated 
terrorist attacks. 
Although both are Asian powers, they differ so much that developing the 
capacity to work closely with both, and learning from each, would be a 
major step forward in mastering the management of a truly global order. 
The rapid spread of Western-style universities and orchestras in China will 
provide new bridges between China and the West. The exceptionally 
successful ethnic Indian community in the United States will provide 
bridges with India. And all this cooperation will accentuate the process of 
civilizational fusion. 
In contrast to China and India, Russia has held back from thoroughly 
embracing modernity, even though the Soviet Union started modernizing 
before China and India. Russia hesitated to join the World Trade 
Organization and has not yet accepted that ungrudging participation in the 
current rules-based order can facilitate its own progress. The more Beijing 
and New Delhi prosper, however, the more persuasive will be the case for 
Moscow to follow their lead. 
As it works closely with the major developing powers, the West should also 
step up its efforts to construct a robust rules-based world in general. In 
2003, former U.S. President Bill Clinton said that Americans should try to 
create a world with rules and partnerships and habits of behavior that we 
would like to live in when we're no longer the military, political, economic 
superpower in the world. If Clinton's fellow citizens could accept such 
advice, the citizens of most other countries would be willing to do the same. 
And this might be easier to achieve than many believe. 
Much of today's global multilateral architecture was a valuable gift from the 
West to the world. Yet the major Western powers have also made sure that 
these institutions have never grown strong enough or independent enough 
to make real trouble for their creators. UN secretary-generals have been 
creatures of the permanent members of the Security Council, the leaders of 
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have been drawn 
exclusively from the United States and Europe, and dominance in these 
financial institutions has occasionally been exploited to achieve extra-
financial goals. These policies should be reconsidered, for the legitimacy of 
the system depends on the perception that its rules are developed by and 
applied fairly and equally to all, rather than that they cater to the narrow 
interests of a few. Picking strong leaders for the major international 
institutions and keeping those institutions' operations from being 
undermined or politicized would be a major step forward. 
Western policymakers, finally, should work to highlight the good things that 
are happening around the world rather than harp on the bad things. 
Hundreds of millions of people have emerged from poverty in recent 
decades even as military conflicts have decreased. The convergence of global 
aspirations means that a vast majority of countries want to see evolution 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026846 
trump revolution in the reshaping of the global architecture. The 
appearance of pressing transnational problems should drive a convergence 
of interests toward cooperation in finding common solutions. And the 
presence of large, well-educated middle classes in countries around the 
globe will help keep governments on the right track. 
There is every reason to be confident that the condition of the world will 
continue to improve as pragmatism and the use of reason become universal. 
Western universities have been a crucial driver of this trend. It is not just 
that their curricula have been copied around the world; the entire ecosystem 
of a modern research university is being replicated, and it is the graduates of 
these Western-style universities who have in turn introduced modern 
methods into education, public health, economic management, and public 
policy more generally. Global management consulting firms have also 
contributed to progress, spreading best practices and good ideas from the 
West to the rest, and increasingly from the rest back to the West. As a 
result, even formerly desperate and dysfunctional countries, such as 
Bangladesh and Ethiopia, are now confidently entering the modern 
universe. 
In short, despite the daily headlines that scream doom and gloom, the world 
is actually coming together, not falling apart. So far, the fusion of 
civilizations has been driven primarily by the injection of Western DNA into 
other civilizations. Over time, the flow of culture and ideas is likely to go in 
both directions. This has already happened in cuisine, where global 
influences have thoroughly penetrated Western kitchens, and something 
similar should happen across cultural sectors. 
There will be challenges. There could even be major setbacks. The fusion of 
civilizations and the social and economic changes associated with it can 
seem threatening to some, creating opportunities for demagogues to exploit 
popular fears, even in the heart of the advanced industrial world. But 
increasingly open and enlightened societies are likely to avoid this danger. 
In the twenty-first century, the world will be governed more by the authority 
of ideas than by the idea of authority. In short, the progressive direction of 
human history, which has lifted the human condition to heights never seen 
before, is set to continue.

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028634.txt,"The charges included “IV therapy,” billed at $787 for the adult and $393 for the child, which suggests that the difference in
the amount of saline infused, typically less than a liter, could alone account for several hundred dollars.

Tricia O’Malley, a spokeswoman for the hospital, would not disclose the price it pays per IV bag or break down the therapy
charge, which she called the hospital’s “private pay rate,” or the sticker price charged to people without insurance. She said

she could not explain why patients covered by Medicaid were billed at all.

Eventually the head of the family, an electrician’s helper who speaks little English, complained to HealthFirst, the Medicaid
H.M.O. It paid $119 to settle the grandmother’s $2, 168 bill, without specifying how much of the payment was for the IV. It
paid $66.50 to the doctor, who had billed $606.

At White Plains Hospital, a patient with private insurance from Aetna was charged $91 for one unit of Hospira IV that cost the
hospital 86 cents, according to a hospital sookeswoman, Eliza O'Neill.

Ms. O’Neill defended the markup as “consistent with industry standards.” She said it reflected “not only the cost of the
solution but a variety of related services and processes,” like procurement, biomedical handling and storage, apparently not
included in a charge of $127 for administering the IV and $893 for emergency-room services.

The patient, a financial services professional in her 50s, ended up paying $100 for her visit. “Honestly, | don’t understand the
system at all,” said the woman, who shared the information on the condition that she not be named.

Dr. Frost, the anesthesiologist, spent three days in the same hospital and owed only $8, thanks to insurance coverage by
United HealthCare. Still, she was baffled by the charges: $6,844, including $546 for six liters of saline that cost the hospital
$5.16.

“It’s just absolutely absurd.” she said. “That’s saltwater.”

Last fall, | appealed to the New York State Department of Health for help in mapping the charges for rehydrating patients in
the food poisoning episode. Deploying software normally used to detect Medicaid fraud, a team compiled a chart of what

Medicaid and Medicare were billed in six of the cases.

But the department has yet to release the chart. It is under indefinite review, Bill Schwarz, a department spokesman, said,
“to ensure confidential information is not compromised.”

States scramble to get health-care law’s insurance marketplaces up and running
Sarah Kliff and Sandhya Somashekhar - Washington Post

With a key deadline approaching, state officials across the country are scrambling to get the Affordable Care Act’s complex
computer systems up and running, reviewing contingency plans and, in some places, preparing for delays.

Oct. 1 is the scheduled launch date for the health-care law’s insurance marketplaces — online sites where uninsured people
will be able to shop for coverage, sometimes using a government subsidy to purchase a plan. An estimated 7 million people
are expected to use these portals to purchase health coverage in 2014.

The task is unprecedented in its complexity, requiring state and federal data systems to transmit reams of information
between one another. Some officials in charge of setting up the systems say that the tight deadlines have forced them to
take shortcuts when it comes to testing and that some of the bells and whistles will not be ready.

“There’s a certain level of panic about how much needs to be accomplished but a general sense that the bare minimum to
get the system functional will be done,” said Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors.

“It will by no means be as smooth and as seamless as people expected.”

Oregon announced this month that it will delay consumers’ direct access to its marketplace, opening the Web site only to
brokers and consumer-assistance agents in order to shield consumers from opening-day glitches.

allegations of sexual offences with underage girls

This is the society fixer alleged to have helped find underage girls for pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein
- helping Bill Clinton celebrate his daughter's marriage.
Ghislaine Maxwell was photographed at the former First Daughter's glittering July 2010 wedding to Marc
Mezvinsky - despite Epstein having been convicted of soliciting underage girls.
Clinton had cut ties to Epstein after his arrest over allegations of sex with girls as young as 14.
But this photograph shows that he maintained close ties to Maxwell, who is accused in court papers of
procuring underage girls for Epstein, her former boyfriend, as she smiles as President Clinton walks a
beaming Chelsea down the aisle.
SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO
Friends in high places: Ghislaine Maxwell is a good friend of President Bill Clinton and can
be seen on the right at his daughter Chelsea's wedding in July 2010
Maxwell, now 50, attended the wedding in Rhinebeck, NY, on July 31, 2010, with the cream of
Washington D.C.
Described as feeling like a 'family wedding', guests included former Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, Terry McAuliffe, Governor of Virginia, and leading figure in the civil rights movement Vernon
Jordan.
For Maxwell to remain a Clinton chum is an interesting turn of events.
Just two years earlier, her former lover and friend Jeffrey Epstein was sentenced to 18 months behind bars
after pleading to a single state charge of soliciting prostitution. He served 13 months in prison.
President Clinton had been so close to both to Epstein he had joined him on his private jet and stayed on
his private Caribbean island.
Speaking to the Mail On Sunday in 2011, Virginia Roberts - who claims in court papers she was kept as
Epstein's 'sex slave' and forced to sleep with Prince Andrew three times - said she met President Clinton
twice, but was never 'lent out'.
Buckingham Palace vehemently denies the claims, as does Maxwell. Her legal team stresses she was not
involved in, or connected to the criminal proceedings against Epstein and with regards to Virginia
Roberts' claims, they stressed she denies each and every allegation.
Virginia, now a married mother of three, claimed that President Clinton traveled with Epstein to a number
of destinations, including three times on the billionaire’s private jet, and enjoyed intimate dinners with
both him and Maxwell.
On one occasion, she said that Epstein flew the former President, Hollywood actor and staunch Democrat
Kevin Spacey and another actor friend of Mr Clinton’s, Chris Tucker, to Africa, to ‘discuss AIDS policy’.
Epstein, who has donated more than £75,000 over the years to candidates from the Democratic Party,
also flew with President Clinton in November 2003 to destinations including Russia, Oslo, Hong Kong,
Shanghai and Beijing.
On one occasion, she alleged, Epstein did invite two young brunettes to a dinner which he gave on his
island for President Clinton shortly after he left office. But, as far as she knows, the ex-President did not
take the bait.
Maxwell declines to comment on Prince Andrew allegations
Mysterious: Ghislaine Maxwell beams as her ex-lover, disgraced billionaire Jeffrey Epstein
hugs her as they attend a Manhattan bash on March 15, 2005 - the same day Palm Beach
police launched an investigation into his abuse of underage girls
‘I’d have been about 17 at the time,’ she said: ‘I flew to the Caribbean with Jeffrey and then Ghislaine
Maxwell went to pick up Bill in a huge black helicopter that Jeffrey had bought her.
‘She’d always wanted to fly and Jeffrey paid for her to take lessons, and I remember she was very excited
because she got her licence around the first year we met.
'I used to get frightened flying with her but Bill had the Secret Service with him and I remember him
talking about what a good job she did.
‘I only ever met Bill twice but Jeffrey had told me that they were good friends.
'I asked, “How come?” and he laughed and said, “He owes me some favours.” Maybe he was just joking but
it constantly surprised me that people with as much to lose as Bill and [Prince] Andrew weren’t more
careful.'
She said that when dining that night, Maxwell sat at President Clinton's left, while they were joined by two
'olive-skinned brunettes' who had been flown in from New York.
Virginia claimed: 'I’d never met them before. I’d say they were no older than 17, very innocent-looking.
‘They weren’t there for me. They weren’t there for Jeffrey or Ghislaine because I was there to have sex with
Jeffrey on the trip.
‘Maybe Jeffrey thought they would entertain Bill, but I saw no evidence that he was interested in them. He
and Jeffrey and Ghislaine seemed to have a very good relationship. Bill was very funny
'He made me laugh a few times. And he and Jeffrey and Ghislaine told blokey jokes and the brunettes
listened politely and giggled.
Star of the night: Rod Stewart and his wife Penny at the Cipriani Wall Street event, where
he performed in front of a crowd including Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein

Wall Street event
Indeed, the trio were so close that DailyMail.com told last week how Epstein kept 21 numbers for
President Clinton in his contacts book, under the name of his adviser Doug Band.
As Virginia Roberts' astonishing claims have made headlines around the world, it was reported last week
that President Clinton's continuing friendship with Maxwell has caused a rift between him and his wife,
potential Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
However, the pair were pictured looking cosy together as they left the funeral of former New York
Governor Mario Cuomo.
Epstein and Maxwell met shortly after she moved to New York in the 1990s following the death of her
father, shamed newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell.
And they remained just as close even after an initial romance faded.
For Epstein, Maxwell was a useful conduit to some of the most powerful people in the world, from
PresidentClinton to Prince Andrew.
Close: Not only was Ghislaine Maxwell friends with Prince Andrew, but his ex-wife Sarah
Ferguson as well. The pair are pictured together at the opening of the Asprey Flagship
Store on 5th Avenue on December 8, 2003, in New York City
Allegations: Ghislaine Maxwell is accused of 'facilitating Prince Andrew's acts of sexual
abuse by acting as a madame for Epstein'. Above, Miss Maxwell looks on as Prince Andrew
smiles with Virginia Roberts in 2001
While Maxwell became used to the luxuries that Epstein could afford her, trips by private jet and his very
own Caribbean island.
Rarely photographed or seen out in public unlike his friend Maxwell, Esptein was however pictured with
the brunette as they partied the night away on March 15, 2005, at a Manhattan charity event featuring
singer Rod Stewart.
But as they socialized with the cream of Manhattan society, including CBS President Les Moonves, his wife
Julie Chen, Sean Lennon and Padma Lakshmi, at the Wall Street Rising event, Epstein, now 63, and
Maxwell, would have been entirely unaware of a police probe that was launched that very day.
In May 2006, a 'probable cause affidavit' revealed that Epstein was the subject of an 11-month undercover
investigation by police after a complaint in 2005 from the stepmother of a 14-year-old girl, who claimed
she was paid $300 to give him an erotic massage at his flamingo-pink villa in Palm Beach.

Sandringham in 2000. The picture shows just how close she and Epstein were with Prince
Andrew
The girl is said to have been taken there by 18-year-old student Haley Robson, who claims in a sworn
statement that she was recruited at the age of 17 to provide the billionaire with a $200 nude massage.
One of the girls ‘cried hysterically’, according to a police report, as she recalled how she was recruited to
provide services for Epstein when she was 16.
She claims in a sworn statement that he introduced her to a woman whom he said he had brought from
Yugoslavia ‘to be his sex slave’.
Epstein was convicted in 2008 of soliciting sex from a minor - a minor in the US is someone younger than
18 - and served 13 months in prison.
Now, lawyers for four of Epstein's alleged victims are fighting to get a federal non-prosecution agreement
against Epstein thrown out so he can potentially face criminal charges for allegedly sexually abusing the
women, one of whom says she was only 13 at the time of the assault.
Bizarrely, Maxwell was initially served with a subpoena in September 2009, as she was leaving the Clinton
Global Initiatives Conference in New York.

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016923.txt,"While Danny Hillis was an undergraduate at MIT, he built a computer out of Tinkertoys.
It has around 10,000 wooden parts, plays tic-tac-toe, and never loses; it’s now in the
Computer History Museum, in Mountain View, California.

As a graduate student at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory in the early 1980s, Danny designed a massively parallel computer with
64,000 processors. He named it the Connection Machine and founded what may have
been the first Al company—Thinking Machines Corporation—to produce and market it.
This was despite a lunch he had with Richard Feynman, at which the celebrated physicist
remarked, “That is positively the dopiest idea I ever heard.” Maybe “despite” is the
wrong word, since Feynman had a well-known predilection for playing with dopey ideas.
In the event, he showed up on the day the company was incorporated and stayed on, for
summer jobs and special assignments, to make invaluable contributions to its work.

Danny has since established a number of technology companies, of which the
latest is Applied Invention, which partners with commercial enterprises to develop
technological solutions to their most intractable problems. He holds hundreds of U.S.
patents, covering parallel computers, touch interfaces, disk arrays, forgery prevention
methods, and a slew of electronic and mechanical devices. His imagination is apparently
boundless, and here he sketches some possible scenarios that will result from our pursuit
of a better and better Al.

“Our thinking machines are more than metaphors,” he says. “The question is not,
‘Will they be powerful enough to hurt us?’ (they will), or whether they will always act in
our best interests (they won't), but whether over the long term they can help us find our
way—where we come out on the Panacea/Apocalypse continuum. ”

New Tariffs — Trade War
Robert Lawrence Kuhn, September 18, 2018
1
HOST: Now from Beijing, Robert
Lawrence Kuhn is a long-time
advisor to China's leaders and the
author of “How China's Leaders
Think”. Thank you so much for
joining us. We appreciate it. Your
reaction to Jack Ma's prediction and
do you agree?
RLK: The public stance of China has
to be strong. The legitimacy of the
government and of the Communist
Party is based on two primary
factors. One is the economic
development.
RLK: China is celebrating this year
40 years of reform and opening up
really having created an economic
miracle, an astonishing 50 times
increase of GDP per capita. So that
has been terrific. The second area is
national pride and national
rejuvenation. And frankly, China as
almost every other country, if the
two come into conflict, the latter
has to prevail, especially in China
with a history of 100 years of
bullying, as they say, by foreign
powers, mostly Western, and then
of course Japan.
2
RLK: This has caused a deep scar in
the Chinese psyche. So you have all
of these factors coming together —
but I can tell you the public stance
of the government, of Jack Ma we
just heard, is very strong and they
have to be.
RLK: If you look at what President
Trump said, that is not a public
posture for seeking solution. Not
just saying tariffs will go up to 25
percent in January will go up, but
then threatening if you retaliate at
all, we're going to levy tariffs on
everything else [$500+ billion
Chinese goods]. That's a very
aggressive stance and China really
has no choice.
3
RLK: But behind the scenes, I
talked to economists, the leading
economists officials, every day.
Everybody wants a solution and
they want it a lot sooner than 20
years. But number one, they have
to have a government in
Washington that are people they
can talk to, that they will have
confidence that what they say will
be implemented. And the Chinese
want a solution because many of
the problems, if we look at the
problems, solutions are consonant
with what China needs itself,
opening up markets further is one
of them.
RLK: Economists tell me all the time
that China needs to open markets.
That more competitiveness within
China — that’s good for China, but
they can't look like they're
subservient or bowing to foreign
pressures. We can go through each
of the issues that are critical: China
has made progress in intellectual
property. Is it perfect? Of course
not, but they know they really need
to improve that. They will reduce
forced technology transfer.
4
RLK: What they will not do is
change their industrial model,
which is government support for
future industries. So that's a
sticking point, but I believe that
they will open their markets further
and this is critical.
HOST: So how do you find
compromise when on the one hand,
as you've described, you've got a
country that wants to come across
as a superpower equal to that of
the United States, so any
concessions would make them look
weak. On the other hand, there's
not much love lost for China here.
HOST: In the United States, as you
know, Republicans and Democrats
alike, some that may not even
agree with most of President's
Trump's policies can't go out
necessarily and throw their arms
around China and support China
openly to the voters. So where do
you come up with a middle ground
to where both sides look like
they're walking away with
something?
5
RLK: Certainly that's the objective.
You're absolutely right: There's no
issue in American politics that the
all sides of the spectrum agree
upon more than on China. In fact,
on every other issue, one could say
from the Bernie Sanders / Elizabeth
Warren, Democrats on the left, to
Donald Trump Republicans on the
far right, they disagree on virtually
everything we can say except on
China. So that's the reality we are
dealing with.
RLK: Nobody expects this to be
resolved before the midterm
elections. That's for sure. But if we
look at the details, if the people
who really know what's going on
look at the detail, we look at the
real issues, we have the trade
deficit, sure, but most people in the
U.S recognize that it's a simplistic
number.
6
RLK: The trade deficit has a lot of
things in there that are not
accurate. You look at the iPhone,
China will get 6, 10 percent of
that, the rest are components that
go into China. Services are 40
billion dollars — what Chinese
tourists and students pay in the
US — not counted in the trade
deficit, which is a very
complicated number. It also
benefits the US because we have a
lot of good products at cheaper
prices.
RLK: But there are five real
reasons that are problematic to
the US with respect to China:
closed markets; intellectual
property protection; industrial
espionage, which includes cyber
theft; forced technology transfer
in JVs; and government support
for future industries. Those are
five real issues that the smart
people in America are focusing on.
And legitimately so.
7
RLK: But there are five real
reasons that are problematic to
the US with respect to China:
closed markets; intellectual
property protection; industrial
espionage, which includes cyber
theft; forced technology transfer
in JVs; and government support
for future industries. Those are
five real issues that the smart
people in America are focusing on.
And legitimately so.
RLK: But these are, I believe,
solvable — because intellectual
property rights, China's
improving. Industrial espionage,
they're reducing and they have
reduced. It needs to be more.
Tech transfer, I think that will be
eliminated.
RLK: The two critical issues are
government support of nascent
industries in China and the
opening of markets. I think
ultimately those two can be
traded. The US can recognize that
China can do some of those things
with certain restrictions and really
open their markets more. I think
that's the ultimate trade.
8
HOST: As you
mentioned, it's
a long-term
process, not
anything we're
going to see
resolved in the
next few
months or even
years. Though
many people
would say it
would be
easier from the
American
perspective if
the president
wasn't
approaching it
as I go it alone,
a type of
relationship
and getting out
of TPP. But
that's for
another
conversation.
Robert, we
appreciate you
joining us.

Article 7.

The Daily Star

The West still beats the rest, but 1t may
no longer be best

Robert Skidelsky

March 29, 2011 -- History has no final verdicts. Major shifts in
events and power bring about new subjects for discussion and new
interpretations.

Fifty years ago, as decolonization accelerated, no one had a good
word to say for imperialism. It was regarded as unambiguously bad,
both by ex-imperialists and by their liberated subjects.
Schoolchildren were taught about the horrors of colonialism, how it
exploited conquered peoples. There was little mention, if any, of
imperialism’s benefits.

Then, in the 1980s, a revisionist history came along. It wasn’t just
that distance lends a certain enchantment to any view. The West —
mainly the Anglo-American part of it — had recovered some of its
pride and nerve under U.S. President Ronald Reagan and British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. And there was the growing
evidence of post-colonial regimes’ failure, violence and corruption,
especially in Africa.

But the decisive event for the revisionists was the collapse of the
Soviet empire, which not only left the United States top dog globally,
but also seemed, to the more philosophically minded, to vindicate
Western civilization and values against all other civilizations and
values. With the European Union extending its frontiers to embrace
many ex-communist states, the West became again, if briefly, the
embodiment of universal reason, obliged and equipped to spread its
values to the still-benighted parts of the world. Francis Fukuyama’s

One unusual thing about Powell's appointment is that he is a lawyer, not an economist. From Yellen going back 
to Alan Greenspan, who started as chair in 1987, all Fed chairs have held a Ph.D. in economics. Alan Blinder, 
an economist at Princeton, has said that a doctorate has become more or less a prerequisite of the job—without 
one, he told Harvard Business Review, the Fed's staff will run technical rings around you. While that remains 
to be seen, it is true that there are over 300 Ph.D. economists on the Fed's staff, and Powell could end up 
needing to lean on their expertise more than a Fed chair with a doctorate in economics might.

Yitzhak Rabin's Moral Answer to the Israeli Dilemma of Peace and Survival - US News

times in your history been deserted. All Americans could take pride in President Clinton's splendid eulogy;
in the uniqueness of America's compassion and friendship that extended beyond a calculation of narrow
national interest; in the honor of the hand outstretched at a time of need to an ally and friend. The president
rose to the moment. The hundreds of thousands of people who lined the roadside and saw the American
delegation were clearly moved,

Of equal significance was the roll call of certain

Arab countries (excluding Saudi Arabia) and H l [ th ft

especially the emotional speech of King Hussein e a one, a e me,
of Jordan. His words referring to Yitzhak and e

Leah Rabin as “my brother and my sister, h d th fi

which Muslims usually reserve for one another, a e capaci O

and the tears shed by both the king and his ie a

queen, made a deep impression on the Israelis d th d d d
for their humanity and ability to overcome the persua e e wl €
past. Here, clearly, were keepers of Rabin's flame

of peace, continuing a line that began with Egypt's and wary Israelis to

late president Anwar Sadat.

Itis hard for outsiders to appreciate the effect on accept a compromise.

Israelis of the worldwide outpouring of sympathy

and condolence, with some 80 nations

represented at the funeral. The Israelis are a traumatized people. They have for so long been alone, so
long believed they could not rely on anyone but themselves, so long expected the world to stay silent in
their times of trouble, The extensive response resonates for a people who remember how the world closed
its doors to millions of Jews in the 1930s. Their deaths in the Holocaust were but an obscene multiple of the
deaths endured in the crusades and pogroms of earlier centuries when the Jews were betrayed by those
who had the power to save them.

Israel was to be the end of that vulnerable status of perpetual minority, an end to exile and alienation, and a
beginning of a normal and natural form of national existence. Israel was home, the new home in the old
country, proclaiming that the Jews had formed a self-reliant community and did not need others to fight
their battles for them. Now they had their future defined by their own family; the farmer, the kibbutznik, the
jet pilot, the shopkeeper, the schoolteacher could coalesce with a traditional language, with their own bible,
their own culture. This self-reliance is a matter of great pride. Jews could look after their own family. When
the Jews were kidnapped in Entebbe, Uganda, it was the Israelis who took care of it. A Jewish majority
could eliminate Jewish vulnerability, and with their own state, the Israelis could, they thought, be like alll
other nations and like everyone else. The passion for wanting to be normal extended to the notion that to
be accepted, Jews did nat have to justify themselves by winning the Moral Man of the Year Award every
year — at the cost of their own survival. To be 10 percent more moral than other nations would make them
a light unto the world; if they were expected to be 50 percent more moral, they would be dead.

[READ: One State Over the Status Quo]

And yet Israel cannot be just another secular country. This very land forces the Jews into a dialogue with
their religious past. The land was defined through religion, through the divine promise to Abraham, the
covenant with the Father and the covenant with the people of Israel. For many religious Zionists, the victory
of the Six-Day War, and the subsequent opening to resettlement of the greater land of Israel, were clear
signs that God was guiding the secular Zionist revolution toward the ultimate realization of the prophetic
vision of history. That is why, for some religious Jews, admitting the existence of a Palestinian nation whose
homeland is the Holy Land is tantamount to violating the integrity of the Jewish people's covenantal identity.
But the Jews faced a dilemma. They had come home to find peace and safety, only to find that their
neighbors also claimed this tiny piece of land as their home. Even worse, how do you share a home with
someone who says: You have no right to be here?

Itis the great contribution of Yitzhak Rabin that has brought a moral answer to this dilemma. There are
those Israelis who emphasize self-reliance and remember Rabbi Hillel's saying, If | am not for myself, who
is for me? Rabin understood Rabbi Hillel had a second part: “When | am for myself, what am I? He saw
that the Jews could not control 2 million Arabs without frequent resort to a violence that would erode the
moral and Jewish character of the state and, with that, its support in the world. He sought a new definition
of Israeli strength and normalcy that incorporated not just military power but also moral and economic
fortitude. He decided to end the Israeli occupation of Palestine and any pretense that Israel could become a

And the beat goes on…
Last fall’s 16-day government shutdown ended with legislation that President Obama signed in the wee
hours of October 17 th . Under that legislation, a bipartisan committee hammered out a budget agreement by
mid-December; Congress approved the agreement, and President Obama signed it into law. House and
Senate appropriations committees then began drafting spending bills – on which they compromised: H.R.
3547, the “Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014,” passed both the House and the Senate with comfortable
bipartisan majorities; it became Public Law 113-76 on January 17 th , when President Obama signed it. The
Act allocates $1.012 trillion, is over 1500 pages long and funds the government through September 30, 2014
(the end of the current 2014 fiscal year).
The Act restored some of the funding cuts otherwise dictated by the “sequester,” which was born of budget
legislation (and the debt ceiling crisis) in August 2011. It covers discretionary spending for all government
agencies, and has nothing to do with mandatory spending, such as Social Security. In other words, for
example, the Act covers national defense, commerce, the judiciary and what are referred to as “financial
services,” which includes the IRS. Although overall appropriations are up slightly for financial services from
last year’s enacted level, the $11.289 billion appropriated for the IRS is about 4% less than last year, and
continues a downward trend in IRS funding.
Under the Act, the IRS will have new quarterly reporting requirements with respect to some of its spending,
and must abide by some pointed directives, including maintaining training programs to cover items such as
“taxpayers’ rights, dealing courteously with taxpayers, cross-cultural relations, ethics and the impartial
application of tax law.” An additional $92 million is potentially available to the IRS to supplement certain
areas of its budget, but not until the IRS Commissioner first provides a spending plan for those dollars, none
of which can be used to support any provision of the Affordable Care Act (ACA, which is also known as
“Obamacare”). The IRS also cannot make a video unless it is pre-approved by the Service-Wide Video
Editorial Board, nor can the Service use any of its funds to target citizens who are exercising their First
Amendment rights or to target groups for “regulatory scrutiny based on their ideological beliefs.”
In other words, the budget takes note of recent issues that have reflected poorly on the IRS, including the
Service’s enhanced scrutiny of politically conservative groups that were seeking tax-exempt status as
501(c)(4) social welfare organizations, and the disclosure of certain training videos that spoofed several old
television shows and were deemed wasteful. John Koskinen, the new IRS Commissioner, has many
challenges ahead of him, including restoring public confidence in the agency and boosting employee morale.
National Taxpayer Advocate
Nina Olson has been the National Taxpayer Advocate since 2001. She heads up the Taxpayer Advocate
Service (TAS), which was created in 2000, and is an independent organization within the IRS. Ms. Olson
and the TAS are the taxpayer’s “voice at the IRS.” The TAS is designed to help taxpayers navigate issues
with the IRS when the usual channels have failed; in addition, Ms. Olson regularly focuses on larger issues
within the IRS and the tax system itself, and recommends solutions. Her year-end Annual Reports to
Congress are thorough and thoughtful, and in part, detail what she views as the most serious issues facing
taxpayers.
Ms. Olson’s 2013 Annual Report was released on January 9, 2014, and, as always, is interesting reading.
One of the critical issues Ms. Olson focuses on in this report is that the IRS “desperately” needs more
funding to serve taxpayers and increase voluntary compliance. Ms. Olson presents some compelling
statistics to support this statement. In fiscal year 2013, for example:
• The IRS received about 109 million phone calls; only 61% of the callers seeking a customer service
representative got through, and those who did had to wait an average of 18 minutes before speaking
with someone.
• The IRS received about 8.4 million letters from taxpayers responding to proposed adjustments to their
tax accounts; it was unable to respond to 53% of this correspondence within its target timeframes.
• The IRS continues to reduce (and sometimes eliminate) services at its nearly 400 walk-in sites; the
Service will only answer “basic” tax law questions during this current filing season (January through
April), and will not answer any of those questions beyond April.
Ms. Olson also notes that since fiscal year 2010, the IRS workforce has declined about 8%, and that its
training budget has been “slashed” from about $172 million to about $22 million, a “staggering” 87%
reduction. “Thus,” she says, “the IRS not only has fewer employees than four years ago, but those who
remain are less equipped to perform their jobs.”
Ms. Olson calls the recent IRS budget cuts “shortsighted and counterproductive” for several reasons: 1) our
system relies on voluntary compliance, and the harder it is for taxpayers to get answers, the less likely they
are to comply; 2) the IRS is a money-maker: in fiscal year 2013, it collected roughly 90% of federal revenue
– or about $2.86 trillion on an appropriated budget of about $11.2 billion (an average return on investment of
255:1); of those revenues collected, some 98% were paid timely and voluntarily, with only 2% coming from
enforcement actions. “In fiscal terms, to be blunt, the mission of the IRS trumps the missions of all other
federal agencies.”
At his confirmation hearing last December, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen voiced similar sentiments:
I don’t know any organization in my 20 years of experience in the private sector that has said “I think I’ll
take my revenue operation and starve it for funds to see how it does.” The IRS will have 11,000 fewer
people working during this upcoming filing season while processing the largest number of returns in its
history. I don’t care how efficient you become, that is not a recipe for success or improved compliance
and taxpayer service.
Tax Topics 01/29/14 2
In a nutshell…Tax collectors are never popular. Yet if the IRS lacks sufficient funds to do its job properly,
that means fewer dollars all around for all federal programs, including national defense, Social Security and
Medicare – and for reducing the deficit. Perhaps, as Ms. Olson suggests, Congress should change the way
it approaches the IRS’s budget and fund the IRS at whatever level Congress believes will “maximize tax
compliance, particularly voluntary compliance, with due regard for protecting taxpayer rights and minimizing
taxpayer burden.”
Changes afoot in New York?
On January 21, 2014, New York’s Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) introduced his comprehensive Executive Budget
for New York’s 2014-2015 fiscal year. The budget has a number of tax reform proposals, including
“modernizing” New York’s estate tax law and closing what it refers to as the resident trust “loophole.” Here
are a few highlights of this draft legislation:
• Estate Tax. For decedents dying on or after April 1, 2014, New York would begin lowering its top estate
tax rate of 16% (this currently applies to taxable estates just over $10 million), and increasing its $1
million estate tax exclusion amount; by April 1, 2017, the top estate tax rate would have dropped to 10%,
and the exclusion amount would have reached $5.25 million. As of January 1, 2019, that exclusion
amount would be indexed for inflation using the “cost of living adjustment,” defined as the percentage by
which the consumer price index (CPI) for 2018 exceeds the CPI for 2012; as of January 1, 2020, the
cost of living adjustment would be the percentage by which the CPI for 2019 exceeds the 2018 CPI; in
2021, the adjustment would be the percentage by which the 2020 CPI exceeds the 2018 CPI, and so
forth, in subsequent years. In addition, as of April 1, 2014, resident New York decedents would have to
include “adjusted taxable gifts” (see below) made on or after that date in their New York gross estates if
they were New York residents when they made the gifts; non-resident New York decedents would not
include such gifts in their New York taxable estates unless the gifts were of real or tangible property
located in New York, or of intangible property used in a New York trade or business.
Comments. The memorandum in support of this legislation states that New York’s estate tax is
“woefully out of date,” and that it gives wealthy New Yorkers an incentive to leave the state. In part, the
legislation would address this problem by lowering New York’s estate tax rate, and eventually raising its
estate tax exclusion to the federal basic exclusion amount, which it cites as $5.25 million, indexed for
inflation. Indeed, thanks to inflation-indexing, the basic exclusion amount was $5.25 million in 2013, and
in 2014, it is $5.34 million – meaning that in 2014, a married couple can protect up to $10.68 million from
federal gift or estate tax, assuming they haven’t made any prior gifts that used up some of this exclusion
(these are the “adjusted taxable gifts” referred to above). Thus, New York’s draft legislation targets a
number ($5.25 million) that is already stale. Nevertheless, the legislation would start indexing the New
York exclusion for inflation as of 2019; presumably, its CPI references would successfully match New
York’s exclusion to whatever the federal exclusion then is.
In addition, including certain lifetime gifts made on or after April 1, 2014 in the New York estate tax
computation could definitely increase a decedent’s New York estate tax, which generally doesn’t reflect
those gifts. It goes without saying that a New Yorker currently contemplating a significant lifetime gift
might want to complete that gift prior to April 1, 2014, given this draft legislation. But New Yorkers who
haven’t yet made such gifts might be reluctant to do so – they may not want to, and may not even be a
New York resident at death.
• The resident trust “loophole.” The memorandum in support of this legislation explains that it would
make two “improvements” to the taxation of trusts. First, it would tax distributions of trust income
accumulated in prior years (“accumulation distributions”) to New York beneficiaries of non-resident trusts
(generally, trusts created by someone who was not a New Yorker) and of tax-exempt resident trusts
(generally, trusts created by a New Yorker that are exempt from New York income tax because they
Tax Topics 01/29/14 3
have no New York trustees, no property located in New York, and no New York-source income).
Second, the bill would eliminate a “loophole” that allows so-called incomplete gift, non-grantor trusts
(“INGs” or “DINGs,” if the trusts are created in Delaware) to completely avoid New York income tax; it
would do so by making the trust a “grantor trust” for New York income tax purposes – meaning that the
creator of the trust would be taxable on the trust’s income for New York purposes, even though the
creator is not taxable on that income for federal purposes. Although these proposals would be
retroactive to January 1, 2014 if enacted, some transition rules would apply: accumulation distributions
paid before June 1, 2014 would be exempt, and the ING rules would not apply to income from a trust
that is liquidated before June 1, 2014.
Comments. This proposed legislation reflects recommendations from the Trusts and Estates section of
the New York Bar Association that were included in the November 2013 report from the Tax Reform and
Fairness Commission. According to the bill’s supporting memorandum, the provisions would increase
tax revenues by $75 million in fiscal year 2014-15, $225 million in fiscal year 2015-16, and $150 million
annually thereafter. In other words, these proposals are perceived as money-makers. Yet whether that
would indeed be the case remains to be seen: wealthy New Yorkers seem unlikely to view these
changes as “improvements” to the taxation of trusts, but rather, as another reason to move out of New
York.
January and February 7520 rates issued
The IRS has issued the January and February 2014 applicable federal rates: the January 7520 rate is 2.2%,
an increase of 0.20% (20 basis points) from December’s 2.0% rate. January’s mid-term rates are also up
slightly, and are: 1.75% (annual), 1.74% (semiannual and quarterly), and 1.73% (monthly). February’s 7520
rate continues to climb: it is 2.4%, and the February mid-term rates are also up: 1.97% (annual), 1.96%
(semiannual and quarterly) and 1.95% (monthly). December’s mid-term rates were: 1.65% (annual), 1.64%
(semiannual and quarterly), and 1.63% (monthly).

organize. This is not a cure for employer
intimidation, * * * but it is a step in the
right direction.

—As an employee at will, | was not aware
of my rights to form a union or any rights
that I may have had under the NLRA.®

—I worked in the construction materials
testing industry for about eight years.
During that time I had no idea I had the
right to join a union.®

—As a working class citizen, | am well aware
of just how rare it is for my fellow workers
to know their rights. For that reason, this
is arule that is extremely overdue. * * *.

A sampling of comments from labor
attorneys, workers’ organizations, and
labor organizations is consistent with
these employees’ comments:

—It is my experience that upwards of 95%
of employees have no idea what their
rights are with respect to labor unions.®

—In fact, [have had many employees over
the years tell me that their employers have
told them that they do not allow unions at
their workplace.®

—Workers today do not know what their
rights are under the NLRA. As a Union
organizer with more than 20 years of
experience, without exception, every
worker | encounter thinks that it is
perfectly legal for their employer to fire
them simply for saying the word union, or
even to speak with other employees at
work about general working conditions.
The protections afforded workers to engage
in protected concerted activity around
workplace issues is unknown to the
majority of workers today.®*

—It is the experience of [Service Employees
International Union (SEIU) Local 615] that
many employees are woefully unaware of
their rights under the NLRA and that that
lack of knowledge makes employees
vulnerable when they desire to address
their wages and working conditions with
the employers.®7

—I have participated in hundreds of
organizing campaigns involving thousands
of employees. In my experience, most
people had no idea what their rights were
to organize or join unions.®

Some unions also assert that even
unionized employees often do not have
a clear understanding of the NLRA. One
union staff representative writes that
“there seems to be a disconnect, most of
our membership does not know a thing
about NLRA.”’ 6° Another union steward
comments similarly:

unaware of their rights unless the union

problem and came to a steward for
assistance. * * *

Notice to employees, however, could
provide a starting point for those employees
to try to assert rights that they currently have
on paper but often do not have in practice.

Several immigrant workers’
organizations comment on the difficulty
that this population has in
understanding their rights and accessing
the proper help when needed.7° These
organizations note that laws in the
immigrants’ home countries may be
quite different from those of the United
States, and the high barrier that lack of
fluency in English creates in making
these persons aware of their rights
under the NLRA.”! These organizations
also contend that because guestworkers
in particular can work only for the
employer that requested their visa, they
are extremely vulnerable to labor
violations, and that these employers
routinely misrepresent the existence of
NLRA rights.”72 The National Day
Laborers Organizing Network claims
that ‘‘most workers are not aware of
their right to organize.”’

One immigrant construction worker,
commenting favorably on the proposed
rule, explains that she learned English
after coming to the United States from
Poland: “While working as a testing
technician, I had no idea I had the right
to join a union.” She writes:

I think a government written notice posted
in the workplace would be a critical source
of information for employees who want to
join a union. Especially in this industry
where many people like myself are foreign
born, there is a language barrier that adds to
the difficulty in understanding our legal
rights. I take government posted notices
seriously and believe other people do as
well.73

Significantly, the Board received
numerous comments opposing the rule
precisely because the commenters
believe that the notice will increase the
level of knowledge about the NLRA on
the part of employees. Specifically, they
predict that the rule will lead to
increased unionization and create
alleged adverse effects on employers
and the economy generally. For
example, Baker and Daniels LLP
comments that as more employees
become aware of their NLRA rights, they
will file more unfair labor practice

Law Center and Latino Justice.

charges and elect unions to serve as
their collective-bargaining
representatives. But fear that employees
may exercise their statutory rights is not
a valid reason for not informing them of
their rights.

Moreover, the NLRA protects the right
to join a union and to refrain from doing
so and the notice so states. In addition,
the NLRA confers and protects other
rights besides the right to join or refrain
from joining unions. Section 7 provides
that employees have the right “to engage
in other concerted activities for the
purpose of collective bargaining or other
mutual aid or protection[.]’’ Such
protected concerted activities include
concertedly complaining or petitioning
to management concerning their terms
and conditions of employment; 74
concertedly petitioning government
concerning matters of mutual interest in
the workplace; 75 and concertedly
refusing to work under poor working
conditions.’® Few if any of the
comments contending that employees
know about their NLRA rights assert
that employees are aware of the right to
engage in such protected concerted
activities in the nonunion setting. By
contrast, as shown above, many
comments favoring the rule report that
nonunion employees are especially
unlikely to be aware of their NLRA
rights.

Although some comments contend
that the articles cited by the Board in
support of its belief that employees are
largely unaware of the NLRA rights are
old and inadequately supported,’” they
cite no more recent or better supported
studies to the contrary. In addition, the
percentage of the private sector
workforce represented by unions has
declined from about 12 percent in 1989,
about the time the articles cited in the
NPRM were published, to 8 percent
presently; 78 thus, to the extent that lack
of contact with unions contributed to
lack of knowledge of NLRA rights 20
years ago, it probably is even more of a
factor today.’

In China, all of the organizations involved in outreach to the overseas Chinese community
are led by senior members of the Chinese Communist Party. Sun Chunlan, the former
head of the United Front Work Department, is listed as the president of the China Overseas
Friendship Association and the executive vice president of the China Council to Promote
Peaceful Reunification. The head of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, Qiu Yuanping,
also leads the China Overseas Exchange Association. Madame Qiu has a career background
with the Party’s International Liaison Department. The president of the China Council for
the Promotion of Peaceful Reunification is none other than Yu Zhengsheng, the former
chairman of the Chinese People’s Consultative Conference and a former member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party’s Central Committee.®

Goals and Methods

The key goal of the Party’s united front work with overseas Chinese is to gain support for
the Communist Party’s efforts to modernize the country by convincing members of overseas
Chinese communities that the Party is the sole representative of China and to isolate
competing forces that the Party perceives to be adversarial, or even hostile. For example,

as part of a massive campaign to monitor, control, and even intimidate China’s ethnic
minorities (no matter where in the world they are), Chinese authorities are creating a global
registry of Uighurs who live outside of China. Chinese authorities threatening to detain
Uighur relatives who remain in China if they do not provide personal information of their
relatives living abroad to the Chinese police. This campaign has particularly targeted Uighurs
living in Germany but is now reaching Uighurs in the United States as well.” Uighurs are not
alone; Tibetan exiles living in the United States have long reported similar campaigns against
members of their families and community. Chinese security officials have even been known
to travel to America on tourist visas to exert pressure on Chinese dissidents living here.’ FBI
agents have contacted prominent Chinese exiles in the United States offering them protection
from Chinese agents who might travel to the United States to menace them.’

For most Chinese Americans, however, China’s efforts to influence them are far more
anodyne. The official description of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office (OCAO) states

its purpose as: “to enhance unity and friendship in overseas Chinese communities; to
maintain contact with and support overseas Chinese media and Chinese language schools;
[and] to increase cooperation and exchanges between overseas Chinese and China related
to the economy, science, culture and education.” Over the past three decades, the OCAO
has dispatched former reporters and editors from the OCAO-run China News Service to
establish pro-Beijing Chinese media organizations in the West. (Chinese officials have
described such Chinese-language media outlets, schools, and other kinds of organizations as
the “three treasures” (=) of united front work overseas.)!°

Officials from Beijing have stated clearly that they do not view overseas Chinese as simple
citizens of foreign countries, but rather as “overseas compatriots” (44 lal#ad]) who have both

SUBMISSION TO THE OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL

IN THE MATTER OF JEFFREY E. EPSTEIN

Jeffrey Epstein, a successful businessman and noted philanthropist with no prior criminal
record, has been investigated for potential violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591, 2422(b) and 2423(b).
Since the limited review conducted by CEOS, two Supreme Court decisions—one authored by
Justice Scalia and the other by Justice Thomas—have revitalized the bedrock principles that
federal criminal statutes must be narrowly construed, that they may not be stretched to federalize
conduct not clearly covered by their prohibitions, and that whenever there are two plausible
constructions of a criminal statute, the narrower construction (hich safeguards liberty) rather than
the broader construction (which expands the federal prosecutor’s arsenal) controls under the
venerable rule of lenity.

Mr. Epstein’s conduct—including his misconduct—falls within the heartland of historic
state police and prosecutorial powers. Absent a significant federal nexus, matters involving
prostitution have always been treated as state-law crimes even when they involve minors. Mr.
Epstein’s conduct lacks any of the hallmarks that would convert this quintessential state crime
into a federal one under any of the statutes prosecutors are considering.

Mr. Epstein lived in Palm Beach, and his interstate travel was merely to go home. Any
sexual conduct that occurred after he arrived was incidental to the purposes for his travel. Even
CEOS admitted that applying § 2423(b) to a citizen traveling home would be “novel.” - In fact, it
would be both unprecedented and in conflict with Supreme Court cases that have withstood the
test of time for over 60 years.

Moreover, Mr. Epstein did not use the internet (either via email or chatrooms) to
communicate with any of the witnesses in this investigation. Indeed, he did not use any other
facility of interstate commerce, including the phone, to knowingly persuade, entice, or induce
anyone to visit his home—the “local” locus of all the incidents under investigation—much less
to persuade, entice, or induce a known minor to engage in prohibited sex acts, as § 2422(b)
requires. Nor did anyone on his behalf “persuade” or “induce” or “entice” or “coerce” anyone as
these words are ordinarily understood and as the new Supreme Court decisions mandate they be
applied: narrowly, without stretching ordinary usage to conform to a prosecutor’s case-specific
need for a broad (and in this case unprecedented) application. In addition, as will be shown
below, § 2422(b) requires that the object of the communication be a state law offense that “can
be charged.” Yet because the state of Florida’s statute of limitations is one year for the first
prostitution offense and three years for other targeted offenses, and because all or virtually all of
the offense conduct at issue in the federal investigation occurred prior to June 20, 2005, those
acts can not be charged by the State, and thus cannot meet this essential element of federal law.

Finally, Mr. Epstein neither coerced, nor enslaved, nor trafficked, nor derived any profit

from his sexual conduct. He was an ordinary “John,” not a pimp. But § 1591 is directed only
against those who engage in force or fraud or coercion or who are in the business of commercial

to stand tall for American greatness if only to anaesthetize them
against day-to-day hardship.

Republican wannabes sense all this. To judge by the early stages of
the 2012 campaign, they think foreign policy might matter after all.
They’re trying to cast Barack Obama as a president who has sold
America short, an impostor who has ditched the mystical belief in the
unique calling of the United States that is American exceptionalism.
So Mitt Romney says Obama takes his values not from the small
towns of America but from “the capitals of Europe.” Obama treats
Israel the way European countries do — with “suspicion” and
“distrust.” He’s offering “European answers to American problems.”
He’s projecting a weak United States: “We’re following the French
into Libya.” The president is a naive idealist undermined by his
“questioning as to whether America is an exceptional nation.”

For Europe, in the above characterization, read land of feckless
socialists on welfare bent on universal health care.

Not to be outdone, Newt Gingrich has decrypted in Obama a
“Kenyan, anti-colonial” worldview.

Gingrich wants a “foreign policy that is clear about the evil that we
face” — that would be Shariah law among other things — and rooted
in this universalist message: “America is still the last, best hope of
mankind on Earth.” As for Sarah Palin, she attributes most of
Obama’s problems to what she’s called his “lack of faith in American
exceptionalism.” I have several reactions to this that all fit under the
rubric: baloney! First, we’re not in 1990 any longer: America remains
dominant but cannot resolve major problems alone and will in the
next decade, by some estimates, see China overtake it as the world’s
largest economy. Second, it’s precisely Republican factionalism in
Washington that’s stopping the United States from attaining again the
greatness Republicans invoke. Remember James Madison’s

On the morning of April 1, 1991. I got up even earlier than usual, to visit the
graves of the men who had lost their lives in my battalion in the Yom Kippur
War. I also went to pay my respects to Uzi Yairi, killed when he’d rushed from
his desk in the kiryva to join the Sayeret Matkal attack at the Savoy Hotel. Then
Nava and I drove to Jerusalem. At Israel’s national military cemetery on Mount
Herzl, we stood before the resting place of Nechemia Cohen, Yoni Netanyahu,
Dado, and Avraham Arnan. From there, we went to the Prime Minister’s office.
With Dan Shomron and his wife looking on, Shamir presented me with my third
star and formally made me chief of staff.

For years, I'd developed the habit of carrying around a notebook in which
I’d jot down thoughts on things I thought that the Israeli military, and I as an
officer, could have done better: errors, oversights, and how we might fix them.
In the weeks before becoming ramatkal, I'd filled dozens of pages on issues
large and small I hoped to address as the commander of the armed forces. A lot
of them dealt with what I sensed was an erosion of cohesiveness in the army,
and, since ours was a citizen military, a fraying of the relationship between the
army and Israeli society. To some degree, this was inevitable in a country now
nearly 45 years old: developed economically and free of the kind of existential
threat we’d faced in the early years of the state. But the political divisions over
the war in Lebanon, and morale-sapping need to quell the violence on the West
Bank and in Gaza had further strained our unity of purpose.

Militarily, we were now indisputably strong enough to defeat any of the
Arab armies, even if they launched a joint attack as in 1973. Our most important
overseas ally, the United States, was committed to helping us retain that
position — what both we and they called Israel’s “qualitative edge” — in the
interest of our security and their own. But we were facing a series of new,
unconventional challenges. One of them, which had come on to Dan Shomron’s
and my radar over the past year, was Iran. Though geographically distant, it was
potentially the most serious in the longer run, as Dan himself warned Israelis in
his final interview as chief of staff. Iran was likely to become even more
assertive regionally now that the Gulf War had weakened its neighbor and rival,
Iraq. We also knew, from our intelligence sources, that the Iranians were
making preliminary efforts to develop a nuclear weapon.

Dear 
Jeffrey 
(and please see note at bottom), 
wrote: 
This end-of-the-year letter is to catch you up on developments and to report progress made in 2016 
by Poetry in America, by its associated non-profit production company, Verse Video Education, and 
by (and with) our new Harvard partner, the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning. Whether 
you are a longstanding adviser and supporter of Poetry in America, or you've more recently joined 
our circle of proponents, your contributions, thought partnership and enthusiasm have made this 
year's successes possible. 
Last fall, I knew this would be a crucial year. Goals for 2016 included moving our co-produced 
television series, Poetry in America, toward a concrete release date (now entering post-production, 
we launch nationwide in April 2018), converting our six HarvardX MOOC modules into for-credit 
courses (now complete and being offered by Harvard's Division of Continuing Education), and 
getting the word out on our first course developed especially for K-12 educators, Poetry in America  
for Teachers: The City from Whitman to Hip Hop. With a mission of creating and distributing the 
highest-quality humanities content for a wide variety of learners, our projects now rely on a salaried 
production staff of five, a rotating corps of part timers and contractors, and a growing cohort of 
Harvard graduate students, undergraduates and interns whom we train in the public-facing 
humanities. Growing fast, in 2016 we more firmly established Verse Video Education as a nimble 
and stable producer of humanities-based content (now including an archive of over 120 separate 
interviews with distinguished discussants), while also defining a forward-looking partnership and 
growth strategy with Harvard. As 2016 draws to a close, I have much progress to report. 
Verse Video Education: Independent 501c3 
In April 2016, Verse Video Education, the fledgling production company I'd founded in 2014, 
received IRS approval and became a 501c3. Now capable of accepting philanthropic contributions, 
Verse Video Education has also begun to generate revenue by producing high-quality educational 
media for other institutions. Clients within our first year included Greenwich Country Day School, 
YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, Schlesinger Library, Harvard Institute for Global Health, and 
Project Zero. While philanthropic donations remain essential, work for clients allows us to amplify the 
impact of philanthropic donations, not only permitting additional investment in our flagship 
partnerships with WGBH and Harvard, but also fostering development of new partnerships and 
projects. These include a video series on poetry and science now running with award-winning 
magazine Nautilus, a collaboration with distinguished poet Robert Pinsky and his Favorite Poem 
Project, and an expansion of our poetry film series with partners at The Nantucket Project. Advised 
by a stellar and diversely talented board, Verse Video Education is looking toward sustainability. We 
are now discussing distribution of new content with a variety of stakeholders, including media 
providers in China. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 019326 
New Harvard Partner: Bok Center for Teaching and Learning 
Meanwhile, Poetry in America has deepened its partnership and formulated a plan for growth going 
forward at Harvard. This fall, Harvard's Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Mike Smith, 
endorsed the integration and expansion of my public-facing humanities work within the Derek Bok 
Center for Teaching and Learning. As a Bok Fellow this year, and alongside Bok director Rob Lue in 
the years to come, I will be working to substantially expand Bok's capacity and resources to train 
humanists in 21st-century methods of public engagement-- developing courses, digital fellowship 
opportunities and also securing distribution outlets and partners for content produced in Bok by 
Harvard humanists. By next year at this time, I will be turning some of my attention beyond poetry 
(my favorite, but hardly the only humanistic mode of communication!) to create a wider base of 
humanities materials for use in American schools and other institutions. We will begin integrating and 
anchoring Poetry in America content (on art, sport and play; on the environment; and on health and 
well being) with content created by others. As I continue to experiment with use of digital media 
within my residential courses for undergraduates and graduates, I shall also be working with other 
faculty and graduate students. My work at Bok will also facilitate collaborations between humanists 
working across the whole university. Projects for 2017 include work with HarvardX on drama and 
Shakespeare, with Harvard's Center for the Environment, with the Arts and Humanities Initiative at 
Harvard Medical School, and with several programs within Harvard's Graduate School of Education. 
Launching in 2017: Our First Course Designed Specifically for Teachers 
Verse Video Education has allocated much of its staff time this year to bringing its first course 
designed specifically to support the American secondary classroom to completion. Poetry in America 
for Teachers: The City from Whitman to Hip Hop draws on assets created at HarvardX, along with 
footage captured with our TV partners and independently by Verse Video Education. The resulting 
course, designed for English, Social Studies, and Arts teachers, as well as for librarians, 
administrators and others, provides deep content instruction as well as pedagogical training. 
Common Core aligned, this course, the first of its kind, is now open for enrollment, and will launch 
January 23rd. We are currently discussing group enrollments with major educational systems and 
reformers across the nation, and we are also raising scholarship funds for strapped enrollees. Over 
time, we hope to play a leading role in improving literacy and in strengthening the humanities across 
the American educational landscape. 
Airing Nationwide in 2018: Poetry in America, The Television Series 
In May 2016, Verse Video Education was asked by WGBH and American Public Television to 
expand its television series in development from 8 to 13 episodes, listed below. 
The following episodes are entering post-production: 
On Edward Hirsch's Fast Break: Shaquille O'Neal, Pau Gasol, Shane Battier, Edward Hirsch, 
and an on-court pick-up basketball chorus filmed at Success Academy Charter School; On W.H. 
Auden's Musee Des Beaux Arts: Ambassador Samantha Power, David Brooks, Peter Sacks; On 
Robert Hayden's Those Winter Sundays: Vice President Joe Biden, Elizabeth Alexander, 
Angela Duckworth, Kevin Young, and a chorus of fathers and sons; On Carl Sandburg's 
Skyscraper: Frank Gehry, Robert Polito, and a chorus of Young Student Poets; On Nas's New 
York State of Mind: Nas, Russell Simmons, Salamishah Tillet, Steve Stoute, and a chorus of hip 
hop heads; On Galway Kinnell's The Grey Heron: E.O. Wilson, Robert Hass, Laura McPhee; 
On Gwendolyn Brooks's To Prisoners: Anna Deveare Smith, Reginald Dwayne Betts, Li-Young 
Lee and a chorus of exonerees from the Innocence Project; On William Carlos Williams's This Is 
Just To Say: Woody Allen, Jane Hirshfield, Rafael Campo and a chorus of couples young and old; 
On Langston Hughes's Harlem: President Bill Clinton, Herbie Hancock, Sonia Sanchez and a 
chorus of children from Promise Academy; On Allen Ginsberg's Hymmnn from Kaddish and 
Hum Bom: Bono, Juan Felipe Herrera and a chorus of clergy. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 019327 
The production of the following episodes will wrap early 2017: 
On Emily Dickinson's I cannot dance opon my Toes: Cynthia Nixon, Yo Yo Ma, Marie Howe 
and Bill T. Jones; On Marianne Moore's The Fish: Jorie Graham, Edward Norton, Conservation 
International scientists, and the passengers and crew of oceanographic vessel The Alucia; On 
Elizabeth Bishop's One Art or Edna St. Vincent Millay's Four Sonnets. 
Jeffrey, 
Just a quick note to thank you again for all the help you've given me. The generous contribution you 
made last year to Verse Video Education is now in use (we've hired our new editor!). Once he helps 
us to plow through the work of this year, we'll begin to look forward to crafting educational content on 
the literature of art, sport and play (these materials now including footage from recent shoots with 
Shaquille O'Neal, Yo Yo Ma, Cynthia Nixon, Bono and others). 100K makes so much possible. 
But, of course, you've also been a key preceptor as I've learned how --squirming all the way--the 
sausage really gets made in public television. I can't say I've been entirely successful in taming costs 
there, but I've been far better armed and more mindful of what they should be after the stern tutorial 
you administered. 
Whenever Templeton might be ready to evaluate another application, I'm ready for another proposal 
for them. I wonder if you might arrange a meeting for me with the famous Bamaby? I can't yet afford 
a grant writer, and so the time one of these suckers takes makes me think doing more advance 
reconnaissance is crucial. Would he meet with me? Kosher? I'd also love to meet with the Blacks as 
I get closer to making content on theatre. I hope that Debra is well. 
And heard there's another little Jeff in the caribbean...

MATERIAL WITNESSES

18. Tiffany Doe, a former trusted employee of the Defendant, Jeffrey E. Epstein, has agreed to
provide sworn testimony in this civil case and any other future civil or criminal proceedings, fully
verifying the authenticity of the claims of the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson. Witness Tiffany Doe was
employed by the Defendant, Jeffrey E. Epstein, for more than 10 years as a party planner for his
underage sex parties. Despite being subject to constant terroristic threats by Defendants Epstein
and Trump to never reveal the details of these underage sex parties at which scores of teenagers,
and pre-teen girls were used as sex slaves by Defendant Epstein and Defendant Trump, witness
Tiffany Doe refuses to be silent any longer. She has agreed to fully reveal the extent of the sexual
perversion and physical cruelty that she personally witnessed at these parties by Defendants Epstein
and Trump.

19. Material witness Tiffany Doe fully confirms all of Plaintiff Katie Johnson's allegations of
physical and sexual abuse by Defendants Donald J. Trump and Jeffrey E. Epstein. Tiffany Doe was
physically present at each of the four occasions of sexual abuse by Defendant Trump upon the
person of Plaintiff Johnson, as it was her job to witness all of the sexual escapades of Defendant
Epstein's guests at these underage sex parties and later reveal all of the sordid details directly to
Defendant Epstein. Defendant Epstein also demanded that Tiffany Doe tell him personally
everything she had overheard at these parties explaining to her that knowledge was king in the
financial world. As a result of these underage sex parties, Defendant Epstein was able to accumulat
inside business knowledge that he otherwise would never have been privy to in order to amass his
huge personal fortune.

20. Material witness Tiffany Doe will testify that she was also present or had direct knowledge
of each of the three instances on which Defendant Jeffrey E. Epstein physically and sexually abused
the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson. Tiffany Doe will testify to the fact that the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson,
was extremely fortunate to have survived all of the physical and sexual horrors inflicted upon her

by Defendants Epstein and Trump.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019917.txt,"and Melania. Instead of wearing a game face, going into the inaugural events, the
president-elect wore what some around him had taken to calling his golf face: angry and
pissed off, shoulders hunched, arms swinging, brow furled, lips pursed. This had become
the public Trump—truculent Trump.

An inauguration is supposed to be a love-in. The media gets a new and upbeat story.
For the party faithful, happy times are here again. For the permanent government—the
swamp—it’s a chance to curry favor and seek new advantage. For the country, it’s a
coronation. But Bannon had three messages or themes he kept trying to reinforce with his
boss: his presidency was going to be different—as different as any since Andrew
Jackson’s (he was supplying the less-than-well-read president-elect with Jackson-related
books and quotes); they knew who their enemies were and shouldn’t fall into the trap of
trying to make them their friends, because they wouldn’t be; and so, from day one, they
should consider themselves on a war footing. While this spoke to Trump’s combative
“counterpuncher” side, it was hard on his eager-to-be-liked side. Bannon saw himself as
managing these two impulses, emphasizing the former and explaining to his boss why
having enemies here created friends somewhere else.

In fact, Trump’s aggrieved mood became a perfect match for the Bannon-written
agerieved inaugural address. Much of the sixteen-minute speech was part of Bannon’s
daily joie de guerre patter—his take-back-the-country America-first, carnage-everywhere
vision for the country. But it actually became darker and more forceful when filtered
through Trump’s disappointment and delivered with his golf face. The administration
purposely began on a tone of menace—a Bannon-driven message to the other side that the
country was about to undergo profound change. Trump’s wounded feelings—his sense of
being shunned and unloved on the very day he became president—helped send that
message. When he came off the podium after delivering his address, he kept repeating,
“Nobody will forget this speech.”

George W. Bush, on the dais, supplied what seemed likely to become the historic
footnote to the Trump address: “That’s some weird shit.”

OOK Ok

Trump, despite his disappointment at Washington’s failure to properly greet and celebrate
him, was, like a good salesman, an optimist. Salesmen, whose primary characteristic and
main asset is their ability to keep selling, constantly recast the world in positive terms.
Discouragement for everyone else is merely the need to improve reality for them.

By the next morning, Trump was soliciting affirmation of his view that the
inauguration had been a great success. “That crowd went all the way back. That were
more than a million people at least, right?” He made a series of phone calls to friends who
largely yes’d him on this. Kushner confirmed a big crowd. Conway did nothing to
dissuade him. Priebus agreed. Bannon made a joke.

Hi Marty, 
Hope all is well. Noticed this Guardian story about Michael Wolff s new book, which states Donald Trump 
purchased a Palm Beach property Mr. Epstein had planned to buy, behind Mr. Epstein's back. And that Mr. 
Epstein threatened to expose Trump's shady real estate deals. Do you know anything about this? Does Mr. 
Epstein have any knowledge of illegal or suspicious dealings by President Trump?

Also, we plan on running a story this Friday about the Crime Victims' Rights Act suit, and the Jane Does' 
proposed remedies. The alleged victims want the U.S. Attorney's Office to rescind the immunity provisions in 
the NPA, and to pursue a prosecution against Mr. Epstein and his co-conspirators. Can you comment on this? 
Thanks so much!

act of obeisance, if not humiliation.

The otherworldly sense of Trump Tower helped obscure the fact that few in the thin
ranks of Trump’s inner circle, with their overnight responsibility for assembling a
government, had almost any relevant experience. Nobody had a political background.
Nobody had a policy background. Nobody had a legislative background.

Politics is a network business, a who-you-know business. But unlike other presidents-
elect—all of whom invariably suffered from their own management defects—Trump did
not have a career’s worth of political and government contacts to call on. He hardly even
had his own political organization. For most of the last eighteen months on the road, it had
been, at its core, a three-person enterprise: his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski
(until he was forced out a month before the Republican National Convention); his
spokesperson-bodyperson-intern, the campaign’s first hire, twenty-six-year-old Hope
Hicks; and Trump himself. Lean and mean and gut instincts—the more people you had to
deal with, Trump found, the harder it was to turn the plane around and get home to bed at
night.

The professional team—although in truth there was hardly a political professional
among them—that had joined the campaign in August was a last-ditch bid to avoid
hopeless humiliation. But these were people he’d worked with for just a few months.

Reince Priebus, getting ready to shift over from the RNC to the White House, noted,
with alarm, how often Trump offered people jobs on the spot, many of whom he had never
met before, for positions whose importance Trump did not particularly understand.

Ailes, a veteran of the Nixon, Reagan, and Bush 41 White Houses, was growing
worried by the president-elect’s lack of immediate focus on a White House structure that
could serve and protect him. He tried to impress on Trump the ferocity of the opposition
that would greet him.

“You need a son of a bitch as your chief of staff. And you need a son of a bitch who
knows Washington,” Ailes told Trump not long after the election. “You’ll want to be your
own son of a bitch, but you don’t know Washington.” Ailes had a suggestion: “Speaker
Boehner.” (John Boehner had been the Speaker of the House until he was forced out in a
Tea Party putsch in 2011.)

“Who’s that?” asked Trump.

Everybody in Trump’s billionaire circle, concerned about his contempt for other
people’s expertise, tried to impress upon him the importance of the people, the many
people, he would need with him in the White House, people who understood Washington.
Your people are more important than your policies. Your people are your policies.

And let me make clear that I emphasize the narrowness

of our motion here. We seek to preclud vidence involving
that litigation. Your Honor has already heard from my

colleague, Ms. McCawley, who has presented our argument for why

Dershowitz should not be in this case at all, and of course, if

we prevail on point 1, this point becomes irrelevant.

But in addition to point 1, we don't need to be
getting into the details of the separate lawsuit. It's not
relevant to the case of Giuffre versus Maxwell. Defendants, in
their responsive brief, if I understand correctly what they say
is, oh, well look. Why didn't Ms. Giuffre join the lawsuit or

why hasn't she filed a lawsuit against Dershowitz? What's

going on there?
Well, of course, your Honor is aware, there are a

variety of statutes of limitation around the country, and

indeed around the world. Ms. Giuffre has not -—- those statutes

have not all run at this point. There are varying

considerations that go into whether or not someone like

Ms. Giuffre would file a lawsuit, and these issues shouldn't be

discussed in front of the jury. That's nothing to do with this

particular lawsuit.

Daily Beast recently defending Jeffrey Epstein:

Can you confirm if the following quote is accurate?

If anything, the unfortunate period he suffered has caused him to really think about what he wants to do
with his money and his time, and support knowledge,” says Krauss. Jeffrey has surrounded himself with
beautiful women and young women but they're not as young as the ones that were claimed. As a scientist I
always judge things on empirical evidence and he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I've
never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my presumption is that whatever the problems were I would
believe him over other people. Though colleagues have criticized him over his relationship with Epstein,
Krauss insists, I don't feel tarnished in any way by my relationship with Jeffrey; I feel raised by it.”

Important Information Division

Options. Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. The purchase of options can result in the loss of an entire investment and the risk of uncovered options
is potentially unlimited. Please ensure that you have read and understood the current options disclosure document before entering into any standardized options
transactions. The booklet entitled Characteristic and Risk of Standardized Options can be obtained from our sales representatives or at
http:/Avww.theocc.com/components/docs/riskstoc.pdf. Transaction costs may be significant in option strategies that require multiple purchases and sales of options, such
as spreads. Supporting documentation for any comparisons, recommendations, statistics, technical data, or other information will be supplied upon request.

e Buying Options - Investors who buy call (put) options risk loss of the entire premium paid if the underlying security finishes below (above) the strike price at
expiration.
e Selling Options - Investors who sell puts risk loss of the strike price less the premium received for selling the put.

OTC Derivatives. To understand clearly the terms and conditions of any OTC derivative transaction you may enter into, you should carefully review the Master Agreement,
including any related schedules, credit support documents, addenda and exhibits. You may be requested to post margin or collateral at levels consistent with the internal
policies of Goldman Sachs to support written OTC derivatives.

Prior to entering into an OTC derivative transaction you should be aware of the below general risks associated with OTC derivative transactions:

— Liquidity Risk: There is no public market for OTC derivative transactions and, therefore, it may be difficult or impossible to liquidate an existing position on
favorable terms.

— Risk of Inability to Assign: OTC derivative transactions entered into with one or more affiliates of Goldman Sachs cannot be assigned or otherwise transferred
without Goldman Sachs’ prior written consent and, therefore, it may be impossible for you to transfer any OTC derivative transaction to a third party.

— Counterparty Credit Risk: Because Goldman Sachs may be obligated to make substantial payments to you as a condition of an OTC derivative transaction, you
must evaluate the credit risk of doing business with Goldman Sachs. Depending on the type of transaction, your counterparty may be Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, a
registered U.S. broker-dealer, or other affiliate of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. As a broker dealer regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”), Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC is subject to net capital, financial responsibility rules, and other regulatory requirements designed to protect customer assets.
Other subsidiaries of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. may not be registered as a U.S. broker dealer and therefore are not be subject to similar SEC regulation.

— Pricing and Valuation: The price of each OTC derivative transaction is individually negotiated between Goldman Sachs and each counterparty and Goldman Sachs
does not represent or warrant that the prices for which it offers OTC derivative transactions are the best prices available. You may therefore have trouble establishing
whether the price you have been offered for a particular OTC derivative transaction is fair. OTC derivatives may trade at a value that is different from the level
inferred from interest rates, dividends and the underlyer. The difference may be due to factors including, but not limited to, expectations of future levels of interest
rates and dividends, and the volatility of the underlyer prior to maturity. The market price of the OTC derivative transaction may be influenced by many unpredictable
factors, including economic conditions, the creditworthiness of Goldman Sachs, the value of any underlyers, and certain actions taken by Goldman Sachs.

— Early Termination Payments: The provisions of an OTC derivative transaction may allow for early termination and, in such cases, either you or Goldman Sachs
may be required to make a potentially significant termination payment depending upon whether the OTC derivative transaction is in-the-money at the time of
termination.

— Indexes: Goldman Sachs does not warrant, and takes no responsibility for, the structure, method of computation or publication of any currency exchange rates,
interest rates, indexes of such rates, or credit, equity or other indexes, unless Goldman Sachs specifically advises you otherwise.

A. Okay.
Q. In your mind, if you have a witness who is

has a four-factor test that says, look, you can't just
draw an adverse inference against someone in every

And so you have to look at the relationship
between the parties and things like that, the degree of
control that one person has over another party.
Different factors that you would look at.

practices for cooperating with China in ways that do not undermine national

interests should be a regular topic at annual meetings.

¢ Meet with stakeholders across sectors—local leaders of industry, academia,
the arts, religious groups, Chinese American organizations, and professional
associations—to discuss issues emerging from cooperation with China, because a

community-wide approach is required.

e Celebrate successes and share best practices. In the era of US-China competition,
there is more reason than ever to publicize cooperative projects that enrich local
communities, build understanding, and solve common problems, while always

being mindful of the larger framework of China’s goal and American interests.

Promote Integrity

Sub-national governments should:

e Educate themselves and other stakeholders on the goals and methods of
Chinese influence operations. While Americans are quick to label any
wariness of communist parties as McCarthyism, and while the potential for
racial stereotyping is real, the Chinese Communist Party’s United Front Work
Department and International Liaison Department—two of the main bodies
overseeing such exchanges—are in fact active and well resourced and determined.
No mainland Chinese organization in the United States—corporate, academic, or
people-to-people—is free of Beijing’s control, even if it is not formally part of the
United Front.

e Keep abreast of Washington’s China policies and improve political risk
analysis capabilities. American China policy is evolving rapidly and cannot be
incorporated into local practice without expert counsel and advice. China’s
responses to US actions are also fast-moving, as are Chinese domestic events
that have an impact on local American interests. The 2018 sell-off of Chinese-
owned properties in the United States was instructive in this regard.'* State and
municipal governments should therefore improve their political risk analysis
capabilities and continually reassess their cooperative relationships with China.
In effect, to successfully play in the China arena, sub-nationals need to develop

their own sources of expertise.

Start with simplicity. Imagine a changeless world where people and things replicate
themselves exactly. Chapter 3 showed that in total capital terms including human
capital, although neither Mill nor Keynes used them, depreciation of both factors
together, net of transfers from one to the other, equals exhaust in taste satisfaction.
“Replacement investment,” or “depreciation investment,” is just enough to turn the
generations over as new (net) output makes up the loss to consumption exactly.
Ideas hold unchanged. That wouldn't be too far from the truth for our million years
as homo erectus, or our millennia after as homo sapiens until some 50,000 years ago,
or our centuries in the dark ages after Rome fell. Most of the new norms we

innovated, although not all, eventually regressed to the old ones.

Next imagine growth of everything at a constant rate. Capital, consumption and
output all grow in constant proportion. Economists now call this “balanced” growth.
Mill had described that possibility in 1844. Balanced growth isn’t driven by
consumption restraint, as consumption never lags. And it isn’t driven by
productivity gain, meaning more output per unit capital, since output grows no

faster. What drives it?

Suppose first that there are still no new ideas. If we are pioneers in a new world or
empty niche, we might be able to increase numbers of exactly the same things and
skill sets until we reach niche limits. Then what would pay for capital growth in that
case? Zeno the Eleatic might insist that depreciation investment is never enough
because it chases a moving target. But depreciation moves just as fast. Identical
capital means identical in depreciation rates. That means the ratio of depreciation
(pure consumption) to capital. The two racers hold neck and neck indefinitely.
Depreciation investment is still enough, just as it was in the growthlessness before.

In balanced growth, as in standing still, it is the only need for of capital replacement.

Now comes a tougher problem. Niches in the real world are typically more or less

full. Here old ideas alone can’t bring growth. David Ricardo, Thomas Malthus and

with the new provisions. However, announcement of the changes was
postponed until after the referendum. The SCAF is expected to issue
those laws, which will likely be designed to make elections freer and
fairer, by decree. The SCAF has suggested that it will change the law
on political parties, making it much easier for new parties to register.
The Muslim Brotherhood is one of the many groups that would likely
take advantage of such a change. The SCAF might also move from
the current electoral system of individual parliamentary districts to a
proportional representation system in which at least some of the seats
would be allocated by a party’s share of the national vote instead of
giving all of them to the winning candidates in each district. But if
the SCAF is planning on such a move, it has not tipped its hand.

The SCAF has also suggested that parliamentary elections will be
held before presidential elections. Last week, one of its members
argued forcefully that attempts to reverse the sequence and have the
president elected first (as some have suggested would be preferable
because parliamentary elections will be much more complicated than
presidential elections) might simply deliver another dictator. But the
generals have also suggested that they may push parliamentary
elections back from May or June (when they originally suggested
they might be held) until September. This is likely a response to those
who claim that Egypt’s party system is simply not sufficiently
organized for elections in two or three months.

The SCAF initially suggested that it might hold the presidential
election in the late summer or early fall; if parliamentary elections are
postponed until September, then the presidential election might be
pushed back until the end of the year.

Under new nomination procedures contained in the constitutional
amendments, a party that gains at least a single seat in the upcoming
parliamentary elections will be able to nominate a candidate. (If the
Muslim Brotherhood is able to form a party and does gain seats, it

were so kind to make it happen.

into the NPA entered into between the government and Mr. Epstein. Again, this argument makes
no sense in the context of this case.” The inclusion of certain provisions in the agreement simply
has nothing to do with whether the government complied with its obligations under the Crime
Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”). If anything, it is the government’s motive that would be at
issue—although even that point is doubtful—not the defense attorneys’. Moreover, because the
first time Jane Doe #3 made these contemptible allegations against Prof. Dershowitz was in her
Motion for Joinder in December 2014, those allegations are irrelevant as to the inquiry of
whether Jane Doe #3’s rights under the CVRA were violated at the time the NPA was entered.
The government confirms that when Jane Doe #3 was contacted by the FBI about this
investigation, she clearly “stated that she did not want to be involved in the federal
investigation.” (DE 290 at 6.) She was not “kept in the dark” as she alleges in her Response.
(DE 291 at 25.) Instead, she apparently chose to stay in the dark. Moreover, she did not make
any allegations against Prof. Dershowitz at the time the NPA was entered, nor did she made any
allegations against Prof. Dershowitz in her action for civil damages in 2009, nor did she make
any allegations against Prof. Dershowitz in her tape recorded interview with her attorney in
2011, nor did she make any allegations against Prof. Dershowitz in her interview with the British
press in 2011. The first time these allegations surfaced were in connection with Jane Doe #3’s
Motion for Joinder in this action. The allegations have absolutely no relevance to the underlying
issue of whether Jane Doe #3 was “treated with fairness” when the NPA was entered, as the

allegations against Prof. Dershowitz did not surface until approximately eight years later.

* Prof. Dershowitz, along with many other lawyers, was involved in negotiating the plea bargain
under which Epstein agreed to plead guilty to State charges in exchange for an agreement not to
prosecute him federally. However, he was not involved in drafting the text of the NPA. In fact,
two other lawyers did the drafting.

Federal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations

II, subsection B, “Statutory Authority,”
above.)

The contention that the right to
refrain from engaging in union activity
is ‘‘buried”’ in the list of other
affirmative rights or that the Board is
biased in favor of unionization because
of the choice of placement is without
merit. The list of rights in the proposed
notice is patterned after the list of rights
in Section 7 of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. 157.
Section 7 lists the right to refrain last,
after stating several other affirmative
rights before it. In addition, the Board’s
remedial notices list the right to refrain
last. See Ishikawa Gasket America, Inc.,
above. So does the Board’s Notice of
Election. In addition, the notice
required by this rule states that it is
illegal for an employer to take adverse
action against an employee ‘‘because
[the employee] choose[s] not to engage
in any such [union-related] activity.”
The Board has revised the introduction
of the notice to include the right to
refrain—this addition further highlights
an employee’s right to refrain from
union activity. Finally, the Board
believes that people understand a right
as different from an obligation and thus
will, for example, understand that the
right to organize a union includes the
right not to do so. Accordingly, the
Board concludes that the notice
sufficiently addresses the right to refrain
among the list of statutory rights. In
addressing the numerous comments
questioning the Board’s neutrality, the
Board points out that in Section 1 of the
NLRA, Congress declared that it is the
policy of the United States to mitigate
or eliminate obstructions to the free
flow of commerce “‘by encouraging the
practice and procedure of collective
bargaining and by protecting the
exercise by workers of full freedom of
association, self-organization, and
designation of representatives of their
own choosing, for the purpose of
negotiating the terms and conditions of
their employment or other mutual aid or
protection.” 29 U.S.C. 151. Thus, by its
own terms, the NLRA encourages
collective bargaining and the exercise of
the other affirmative rights guaranteed
by the statute. In doing so, however, the
NLRA seeks to ensure employee choice
both to participate in union or other
protected concerted activity and to
refrain from doing so.

Turning to the issues of whether the
notice creates the impression that the
employer is encouraging unionization
and whether an employer can be
compelled to post the notice which
contains information the employer
would otherwise not share with
employees, the Board disagrees with
both arguments. First, the notice clearly

states that it is from the government.
Second, in light of the other workplace
notice employees are accustomed to
seeing, employees will understand that
the notice is a communication to
workers from the government, not from
the employer. Finally, as discussed
above, NLRA Section 8(c) protects
employers’ right to express any ‘‘views,
argument, or opinion” “if such
expression contains no threat of reprisal
or force or promise of benefit.’’ The rule
does not affect this right. Therefore, if
an employer is concerned that
employees will get the wrong
impression, it may legally express its
opinion regarding unionization as long
as it does so in a noncoercive manner.
Critics of the notice contend that the
notice should contain a number of
additional rights and also explanations
of when and how an employee may opt
out of paying union dues. Thus, most
employer groups argue that the notice
should contain a statement regarding
the right to decertify a union. A number
of those comments state that the notice
should provide detailed guidance on the
process for decertifying a union. Others
suggest that the notice should contain
instructions for deauthorizing a union
security clause. A majority of employers
and individuals who filed comments on
the content of the notice urge the Board
to include a notice of employee rights
under Communications Workers v.
Beck. Baker & McKenzie suggests
adding a provision informing employees
that for religious purposes an employee
may opt out of paying dues to a
union.1°7 A few comments also suggest
that the notice add any rights that
employees may have in “right-to-work”’
states. As indicated previously,
numerous comments suggest the
inclusion of other rights of employees
who do not desire union representation.
Baker & McKenzie suggests a list of 26
additional affirmative rights, most of
which only affect employees in a
unionized setting and are derived from
the Labor-Management Reporting and
Disclosure Act, the Labor-Management
Relations Act, or other Federal labor
statutes enforced by the Department of
Labor. The proposed list also includes

107 NLRA Section 19 provides that “Any
employee who is a member of and adheres to
established and traditional tenets or teachings of a
bona fide religion, body, or sect which has
historically held conscientious objections to joining
or financially supporting labor organizations shall
not be required to join or financially support any
labor organization as a condition of employment;
except that such employee may be required ina
contract between such employee’s employer and a
labor organization in lieu of periodic dues and
initiation fees, to pay sums equal to such dues and
initiation fees to a nonreligious, nonlabor
organization charitable fund exempt from
taxation[.]’’ 29 U.S.C. 169.

some rights covered by the NLRA such
as “the right to sign or refuse to sign an
authorization card,” ‘‘the right to
discuss the advantages and
disadvantages of union representation
or membership with the employer,’ and
“the right to receive information from
the employer regarding the advantages
and disadvantages of union
representation.”’

The Board has determined that the
inclusion of these additional items is
unnecessary. As discussed above, the
NLRA itself contains only a general
statement that employees have the right
not to participate in union and/or other
protected concerted activities. Section
19 does specifically set forth the right of
certain religious objectors to pay the
equivalent of union dues to a tax-
exempt charity; however, this right is
implicated only when an employer and
union have entered into a union-
security arrangement. Because the
notice does not mention or explain such
arrangements, the Board finds no reason
to list this narrow exception to union-
security requirements. In sum, the
Board is not persuaded that the notice
needs to expand further on the right to
refrain by including a list of specific
ways in which employees can elect not
to participate or opt out of paying union
dues. Employees who desire more
information regarding the right not to
participate can contact the Board.

The Board does not believe that
further explication of this point is
necessary. However, because so many
comments argue that the notice should
include the right to decertify a union
and rights under Communication
Workers v. Beck, the Board has decided
to explain specifically why it disagrees
with each contention.

Concerning the right to decertify, the
notice states that employees have the
right not to engage in union activity,
“including joining or remaining a
member of a union.” Moreover, the
notice does not mention the right to
seek Board certification of a union.
Indeed, contrary to the numerous
comments suggesting that the proposed
notice is a “roadmap” for union
organizing, the notice does not even
mention the right to petition for a union
representation election, possibly leading
to union certification; rather, it merely
states that employees have the right to
“organize a union” and “form, join or
assist a union.”’ The notice does not give
any further instructions on how an
employee can exercise those rights.
Similarly, the notice states that
employees may choose not to remain a
member of a union without further
instructions on how to exercise that
right. To include instructions for

Russia Says IMF Chief Jailed For Discovering All US Gold is 
Gone 
A new report prepared for Prime Minister Putin by the Federal Security Service (FSB) says that former 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) Chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn was charged and jailed in the US for sex 
crimes on May 14th after his discovery that all of the gold held in the United States Bullion Depository located 
at Fort Knox was 'missing and / or unaccounted' for. 
According to this FSB secret report, Strauss-Kahn had become increasingly concerned earlier this month 
after the United States began stalling its pledged delivery to the IMF of 191.3 tons of gold agreed to under 
the Second Amendment of the Articles of Agreement signed by the Executive Board in April 1978 that were to 
be sold to fund what are called Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) as an alternative to what are called reserve 
currencies. 
This FSB report further states that upon Strauss-Kahn raising his concerns with American government officials 
close to President Obama he was 'contacted' by 'rogue elements' within the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) 
who providedhim 'firm evidence' that all of the gold reported to be held by the US 'was gone'. 
Upon Strauss-Kahn receiving the CIA evidence, this report continues, he made immediate arrangements to 
leave the US for Paris, but when contacted by agents working for France's General Directorate for External 
Security (DGSE) that American authorities were seeking his capture he fled to New York City's JFK airport 
following these agents directive not to take his cell-phone because US police could track his exact location. 
Once Strauss-Kahn was safely boarded on an Air France flight to Paris, however, this FSB report says he made 
a 'fatal mistake' by calling the hotel from a phone on the plane and asking them to forwarded the cell-phone 
he had been told to leave behind to his French residence, after which US agents were able to track and 
apprehend him. 
Within the past fortnight, this report continues, Strauss-Kahn reached out to his close friend and top Egyptian 
banker Mahmoud Abdel Salam Omar to retrieve from the US the evidence given to him by the CIA. Omar, 
however, and exactly like Strauss-Kahn before him, was charged yesterday by the US with a sex crime against 
a luxury hotel maid, a charge the FSB labels as 'beyond belief' due to Omar being 74-years-old and a devout 
Muslim. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031333 
II 
In an astounding move puzzling many in Moscow, Putin after reading this secret FSB report today ordered 
posted to the Kremlin's official website a defense of Strauss-Khan becoming the first world leader to state that 
the former IMF chief was a victim of a US conspiracy. Putin further stated, It's hard for me to evaluate the 
hidden political motives but I cannot believe that it looks the way it was initially introduced. It doesn't sit right 
in my head. 
Interesting to note about all of these events is that one of the United States top Congressman, and 2012 
Presidential candidate, Ron Paul has long stated his belief that the US government has lied about its gold 
reserves held at Fort Knox. So concerned had Congressman Paul become about the US government and the 
Federal Reserve hiding the truth about American gold reserves he put forward a bill in late 2010 to force an 
audit of them, but which was subsequently defeated by Obama regime forces. 
When directly asked by reporters if he believed there was no gold in Fort Knox or the Federal Reserve, 
Congressman Paul gave the incredible reply, I think it is a possibility. 
Also interesting to note is that barely 3 days after the arrest of Strauss-Kahn, Congressman Paul made a new 
call for the US to sell its gold reserves by stating, Given the high price it is now, and the tremendous debt 
problem we now have, by all means, sell at the peak. 
Bizarre reports emanating from the US for years, however, suggest there is no gold to sell, and as we can read 
as posted in 2009 on the ViewZone.Com news site: 
In October of 2009 the Chinese received a shipment of gold bars. Gold is regularly exchanged between 
countries to pay debts and to settle the so-called balance of trade. 
Most gold is exchanged and stored in vaults under the supervision of a special organization based in London, 
the London Bullion Market Association (or LBMA). When the shipment was received, the Chinese government 
asked that special tests be performed to guarantee the purity and weight of the gold bars. In this test, four 
small holes are drilled into the gold bars and the metal is then analyzed. 
Officials were shocked to learn that the bars were fake. They contained cores of tungsten with only a outer 
coating of real gold. What's more, these gold bars, containing serial numbers for tracking, originated in the US 
and had been stored in Fort Knox for years. There were reportedly between 5,600 to 5,700 bars, weighing 400 
oz. each, in the shipment! 
To the final fate of Strauss-Kahn it is not in our knowing, but new reports coming from the United States show 
his determination not to go down without a fight as he has hired what is described as a 'crack team' of former 
CIA spies, private investigators and media advisers to defend him. 
To the practical effects on the global economy should it be proved that the US, indeed, has been lying about 
its gold reserves, Russia's Central Bank yesterday ordered the interest rate raised from 0.25 to 3.5 percent and 
Putin ordered the export ban on wheat and grain crops lifted by July 1st in a move designed to fill the 
Motherlands coffers with money that normally would have flowed to the US. 
The American peoples ability to know the truth of these things, and as always, has been shouted out by their 
propaganda media organs leaving them in danger of not being prepared for the horrific economic collapse of 
their nation now believed will much sooner than later.

Federal labor and employment laws in
not requiring employers routinely to
post notices at their workplaces
informing employees of their statutory
rights.6 Given this common practice of
workplace notice-posting, it is
reasonable for the Board to infer that a
posting requirement will increase
employees’ awareness of their rights
under the NLRA.’ Further support for
that position is President Obama’s
recent Executive Order 13496, issued on
January 30, 2009, which stressed the
need for employees to be informed of
their NLRA rights. Executive Order
13496 requires Federal contractors and
subcontractors to include in their
Government contracts specific
provisions requiring them to post
notices of employees’ NLRA rights. On
May 20, 2010, the Department of Labor
issued a Final Rule implementing the
order effective June 21, 2010. 75 FR
28368, 29 CFR part 471.

After due consideration, the Board
has decided to require that employees of
all employers subject to the NLRA be
informed of their NLRA rights.
Informing employees of their statutory
rights is central to advancing the
NLRA’s promise of “full freedom of
association, self-organization, and
designation of representatives of their
own choosing.” NLRA Section 1, 29
U.S.C. 151. It is fundamental to
employees’ exercise of their rights that
the employees know both their basic
rights and where they can go to seek
help in understanding those rights.
Notice of the right of self-organization,
to form, join, or assist labor
organizations, to bargain collectively, to
engage in other concerted activities, and
to refrain from such activities, and of
the Board’s role in protecting those
statutory rights is necessary to effectuate
the provisions of the NLRA.

The Board believes that the workplace
itself is the most appropriate place for
communicating with employees about
their basic statutory rights as employees.
Cf. Eastex, Inc. v. NLRB, 437 U.S. 556,
574 (1978) (“[T]he plant is a particularly
appropriate place for the distribution of
[NLRA] material.’’).

Accordingly, and pursuant to its
rulemaking authority under Section 6 of
the NLRA, the Board proposed a new
rule requiring all employers subject to
the NLRA to post a copy of a notice
advising employees of their rights under

6 See, e.g., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-10(a); Age Discrimination in
Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. 627; Family and
Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. 2601, 2619(a); Fair
Labor Standards Act, 29 CFR 516.4 (implementing
29 U.S.C. 211). 75 FR 80411.

7 As set forth in the NPRM, two petitions were
filed to address this anomaly. 75 FR 80411.

the NLRA and providing information
pertaining to the enforcement of those
rights. 75 FR 80411. For the reasons
discussed more fully below, the Board
tentatively determined that the content
of the notice should be the same as that
of the notice required under the
Department of Labor’s notice posting
rule, 29 CFR part 471. Id. at 80412. Also,
as discussed at length below, the Board
proposed that failure to post the notice
would be found to be an unfair labor
practice—i.e., to interfere with, restrain,
or coerce employees in the exercise of
their NLRA rights, in violation of
Section 8(a)(1) of the NLRA. Id. at
80414. The Board also proposed that
failure to post the notice could lead to
tolling of the 6-month statute of
limitations for filing unfair labor
practice charges, and that knowing and
willful failure to post the notice could
be considered as evidence of unlawful
motive in unfair labor practice cases. Id.
The Board explained that the burden of
compliance would be minimal—the
notices would be made available at no
charge by the Board (both electronically
and in hard copy), and employers
would only be required to post the
notices in places where they
customarily post notices to employees;
the rule would contain no reporting or
recordkeeping requirements. Id. at
80412. Finally, the Board expressed its
position that it was not required to
prepare an initial regulatory flexibility
analysis of the proposed rule under the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601
et seq., and that the notice posting
requirement was not subject to the
Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C.
3501 et seq. Id. at 80415-80416.

The Board invited comments on its
legal authority to issue the rule, the
content of the notice, the requirements
for posting the notice, the proposed
enforcement scheme, the definitions of
terms in the proposed rule, and on its
positions concerning the Regulatory
Flexibility Act and the Paperwork
Reduction Act. The Board stated that
comments would be accepted for 60
days following the publication of the
NPRM in the Federal Register, or until
February 22, 2011. The Board received
6,560 comments by February 22.
However, many late-filed comments
were also submitted, and the Board
decided to accept all comments that it
received on or before March 23.8

8 March 23, 2011 was the date that the Board
downloaded all of the electronic and (pdf. versions
of} hard copy comments it had received from
http://www.regulations.gov and subsequently
uploaded into a text analytics tool for coding and
review.

A few commenters submitted their comments in
both electronic and hard copy form. Because all

In all, 7,034 comments were received
from employers, employees, unions,
employer organizations, worker
assistance organizations, and other
concerned organizations and
individuals, including two members of
Congress. The majority of comments, as
well as Board Member Hayes’ dissent,
oppose the rule or aspects of it; many
opposing comments contain suggestions
for improvement in the event the Board
issues a final rule. Many comments,
however, support the rule; a few of
those suggest changes to clarify or
strengthen the rule. The Board wishes to
express its appreciation to all those who
took the time to submit thoughtful and
helpful comments and suggestions
concerning the proposed rule.®

After careful consideration of the
comments received, the Board has
decided to issue a final rule that is
similar to that proposed in the NPRM,
but with some changes suggested by
commenters. The most significant
change in the final rule is the deletion
of the requirement that employers
distribute the notice via email, voice
mail, text messaging or related
electronic communications if they
customarily communicate with their
employees in that manner. Other
significant changes include
clarifications of the employee notice
detailing employee rights protected by
the NLRA and unlawful conduct on the
part of unions; clarification of the rule’s
requirements for posting notices in
foreign languages; allowing employers
to post notices in black and white as
well as in color; and exemption of the
U.S. Postal Service from coverage of the
rule. The Board’s responses to the
comments, and the changes in the rule
and in the wording of the required
notice of employee rights occasioned by
the comments, are explained below. (In
his dissent, Board Member Hayes raises
a number of points that are also made
in some of the comments. The Board’s
responses to those comments should be
understood as responding to the dissent
as well.) 1°

comments received are included in the numbers
cited in text above, those numbers overstate
somewhat the number of individuals, organizations,
etc. that submitted comments.

®° Many comments charge that the Board is issuing
the rule for political reasons, to encourage and
spread unionism, to discourage employers and
employees from engaging in direct communication
and problem solving, to drive up union
membership in order to retain agency staff, and
even to “line [its] pockets.” The Board responds
that its reasons for issuing the rule are set forth in
this preamble.

10 The Board majority’s reasoning stands on its
own. By its silence, the majority does not adopt any
characterization made by the dissent of the
majority’s rationale or motives.

Author's Note 
Shortly after Donald Trump's inauguration as the forty-fifth president of 
the United States, I was allowed into the West Wing as a sideline observer. 
My book Fire and Fury was the resulting account of the organizational 
chaos and constant drama—more psychodrama than political drama—of 
Trump's first seven months in office. Here was a volatile and uncertain 
president, releasing, almost on a daily basis, his strange furies on the world, 
and, at the same time, on his own staff. This first phase of the most abnor-
mal White House in American history ended in August 2017, with the 
departure of chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and the appointment of 
retired general John Kelly as chief of staff 
This new account begins in February 2018 at the outset of Trump's 
second year in office, with the situation now profoundly altered. The pres-
ident's capricious furies have been met by an increasingly organized and 
methodical institutional response. The wheels of justice are inexorably 
turning against him. In many ways, his own government, even his own 
White House, has begun to turn on him. Virtually every power center left 
of the far-right wing has deemed him unfit. Even some among his own 
base find him undependable, hopelessly distracted, and in over his head. 
Never before has a president been under such concerted attack with such 
a limited capacity to defend himself. 
His enemies surround him, dedicated to bringing him down.

* * * 
I am joined in my train-wreck fascination with Trump—that certain 
knowledge that in the end he will destroy himself—by, I believe, almost 
everyone who has encountered him since he was elected president. 
To have worked anywhere near him is to be confronted with the most 
extreme and disorienting behavior possible. That is hardly an overstate-
ment. Not only is Trump not like other presidents, he is not like anyone 
most of us have ever known. Hence, everyone who has been close to him 
feels compelled to try to explain him and to dine out on his head-smacking 
peculiarities. It is yet one more of his handicaps: all the people around 
him, however much they are bound by promises of confidentiality or 
nondisclosure agreements or even friendship, cannot stop talking about 
their experience with him. In this sense, he is more exposed than any 
president in history. 
Many of the people in the White House who helped me during the 
writing of Fire and Fury are now outside of the administration, yet they are 
as engaged as ever by the Trump saga. I am grateful to be part of this sub-
stantial network. Many of Trump's pre-White House cronies continue to 
both listen to him and support him; at the same time, as an expression both 
of their concern and of their incredulity, they report among one another, 
and to others as well, on his temper, mood, and impulses. In general, I 
have found that the closer people are to him, the more alarmed they have 
found themselves at various points about his mental state. They all spec-
ulate about how this will end—badly for him, they almost all conclude. 
Indeed, Trump is probably a much better subject for writers interested in 
human capacities and failings than for most of the reporters and writers 
who regularly cover Washington and who are primarily interested in the 
pursuit of success and power. 
My primary goal in Siege is to create a readable and intuitive narrative—
that is its nature. Another goal is to write the near equivalent of a real-time 
history of this extraordinary moment, since understanding it well after 
the fact might be too late. A final goal is pure portraiture: Donald Trump 
as an extreme, almost hallucinatory, and certainly cautionary, Amer-
ican character. To accomplish this, to gain the perspective and to find 
the voices necessary to tell the larger story, I provided anonymity to any 
source who requested it. In cases where I have been told—on the prom-
ise of no attribution—about an unreported event or private conversation 
or remark, I have made every effort to confirm it with other sources or 
documents. In some cases, I have witnessed the events or conversations 
described herein. With regard to the Mueller investigation, the narrative 
I provide is based on internal documents given to me by sources close to 
the Office of the Special Counsel. 
Dealing with sources in the Trump White House has continued to 
offer its own set of unique issues. A basic requirement of working there 
is, surely, the willingness to infinitely rationalize or delegitimize the truth, 
and, when necessary, to outright lie. In fact, I believe this has caused some 
of the same people who have undermined the public trust to become pri-
vate truth-tellers. This is their devil's bargain. But for the writer, interview-
ing such Janus-faced sources creates a dilemma, for it requires depending 
on people who lie to also tell the truth—and who might later disavow the 
truth they have told. Indeed, the extraordinary nature of much of what 
has happened in the Trump White House is often baldly denied by its 
spokespeople, as well as by the president himself. Yet in each successive 
account of this administration, the level of its preposterousness—even as 
that bar has been consistently raised—has almost invariably been con-
firmed. 
In an atmosphere that promotes, and frequently demands, hyperbole, 
tone itself becomes a key part of accuracy. For instance, most crucially, 
the president, by a wide range of the people in close contact with him, is 
often described in maximal terms of mental instability. I have never met 
anyone crazier than Donald Trump is the wording of one staff member 
who has spent almost countless hours with the president. Something like 
this has been expressed to me by a dozen others with firsthand experience. 
How do you translate that into a responsible evaluation of this singular 
White House? My strategy is to try to show and not tell, to describe the 
broadest context, to communicate the experience, to make it real enough 
for a reader to evaluate for him- or herself where Donald Trump falls on a 
vertiginous sliding scale of human behavior. It is that condition, an emo-
tional state rather than a political state, that is at the heart of this book. 
1 
BULLSEYE 
The president made his familiar stink-in-the-room face, then way 
his hands as though to ward off a bug. 
Don't tell me this, he said. Why are you telling me this? 
His personal lawyer John Dowd, in late February 2018, little mo 
than a year into Trump's tenure, was trying to explain that prosecutc 
were likely to issue a subpoena for some of the Trump Organizatio: 
business records. 
Trump seemed to respond less to the implications of such a deep di 
into his affairs than to having to hear about it at all. His annoyance set ( 
a small rant. It was not so much about people out to get him—and pe 
pie were surely out to get him—but that nobody was defending him. T 
problem was his own people. Especially his lawyers. 
Trump wanted his lawyers to fix things. Don't bring me problen 
bring me solutions:' was a favorite CEO bromide that he often repeat€ 
He judged his lawyers by their under-the-table or sleight-of-hand ski 
and held them accountable when they could not make problems disa 
pear. His problems became their fault. Make it go away was one of I-
frequent orders. It was often said in triplicate: Make it go away, make 
go away, make it go away. 
The White House counsel Don McGahn—representing the Whi 
2 MICHAEL WOLFF 
SIEGE 
House rather than, in a distinction Trump could never firmly grasp, the 
president himself—demonstrated little ability to make problems disap-
pear and became a constant brunt of Trump's rages and invective. His legal 
interpretation of proper executive branch function too often thwarted his 
boss's wishes. 
Dowd and his colleagues, Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow—the trio of law-
yers charged with navigating the president through his personal legal 
problems—had, on the other hand, become highly skilled in avoiding 
their client's bad humor, which was often accompanied by menacing, 
barely controlled personal attacks. All three men understood that to-be a 
successful lawyer for Donald Trump was to tell the client what he wanted 
to hear. 
Trump harbored a myth about the ideal lawyer that had almost noth-
ing to do with the practice of law. He invariably cited Roy Cohn, his old 
New York friend, attorney, and tough-guy mentor, and Robert Kennedy, 
John F. Kennedy's brother. He was always on my ass about Roy Cohn 
and Bobby Kennedy, said Steve Bannon, the political strategist who, 
perhaps more than anyone else, was responsible for Trump's victory. 
'Roy Cohn and Bobby Kennedy,' he would say. 'Where's my Roy Cohn 
and Bobby Kennedy? Cohn, to his own benefit and legend, built the 
myth that Trump continued to embrace: with enough juice and mus-
cle, the legal system could always be gamed. Bobby Kennedy had been 
his brother's attorney general and hatchet man; he protected JFK and 
worked the back channels of power for the benefit of the family. 
This was the constant Trump theme: beating the system. I'm the guy 
who gets away with it:' he had often bragged to friends in New York. 
At the same time, he did not want to know details. He merely wanted 
his lawyers to assure him that he was winning. We're killing it, right? 
That's what I want to know. That's all I want to know. If we're not killing 
it, you screwed up, he shouted one afternoon at members of his ad hoc 
legal staff. 
From the start, it had become a particular challenge to find top law-
yers to take on what, in the past, had always been one of the most vaunted 
of legal assignments: representing the president of the United States. One 
high-profile Washington white-collar litigator gave Trump a list of twenty 
issues that would immediately need to be addressed if he were to ta 
on the case. Trump refused to consider any of them. More than a doz 
major firms had turned down his business. In the end, Trump was left wi 
a ragtag group of solo practitioners without the heft and resources oft 
firms. Now, thirteen months after his inauguration, he was facing p( 
sonal legal trouble at least as great as that faced by Richard Nixon and I 
Clinton, and doing so with what seemed like, at best, a Court Street lei 
team. But Trump appeared to be oblivious to this exposed flank. Ratchi 
ing up his level of denial about the legal threats around him, he breez 
rationalized: If I had good lawyers, I'd look guilty 
Dowd, at seventy-seven, had had a long, successful legal career, bc 
in government and in Washington law firms. But that was in the past. 
was on his own now, eager to postpone retirement. He knew the imp( 
tance, certainly to his own position in Trump's legal circle, of und( 
standing his client's needs. He was forced to agree with the presider 
assessment of the investigation into his campaign's contact with Russi 
state interests: it would not reach him. To that end, Dowd, and the otk 
members of Trump's legal team, recommended that the president coo 
erate with the Mueller investigation. 
I'm not a target, right? Trump constantly prodded them. 
This wasn't a rhetorical question. He insisted on an answer, and 
affirmative one: Mr. President, you're not a target:' Early in his tenu 
Trump had pushed FBI director James Comey to provide precisely ti 
reassurance. In one of the signature moves of his presidency, he had fir 
Comey in May 2017 in part because he wasn't satisfied with the enth 
siasm of the affirmation and therefore assumed Comey was plotti 
against him. 
Whether the president was indeed a target—and it would surely ha 
taken a through-the-looking-glass exercise not to see him as the bulls€ 
of the Mueller investigation—seemed to occupy a separate reality fn 
Trump's need to be reassured that he was not a target. 
Trump's trained me:' Ty Cobb told Steve Bannon. Even if it's tx 
it's great:' 
Trump imagined—indeed, with a preternatural confidence, nothi 
appeared to dissuade him—that sometime in the very near future he ww.

hear directly from the special counsel, who would send him a compre-
hensive and even apologetic letter of exoneration. 
Where, he kept demanding to know, is my fucking letter? 
* * * 
The grand jury empanelled by Special Counsel Robert Mueller met on 
Thursdays and Fridays in federal district court in Washington. Its busi-
ness was conducted on the fifth floor of an unremarkable building at 333 
Constitution Avenue. The grand jurors gathered in a nondescript space 
that looked less like a courtroom than a classroom, with prosecutors at a 
podium and witnesses sitting at a desk in the front of the room. The Mueller 
grand jurors were more female than male, more white than black, older 
rather than younger; they were distinguished most of all by their focus 
and intensity. They listened to the proceedings with a scary sort of atten-
tion, as though they already know everything, said one witness. 
In a grand jury inquiry, you fall into one of three categories. You are 
a witness of fact:' meaning the prosecutor believes you have information 
about an investigation at hand. Or you are a subject:' meaning you are 
regarded as having personal involvement with the crime under investiga-
tion. Or, most worrisome, you are a target:' meaning the prosecutor is 
seeking to have the grand jury indict you. Witnesses often became sub-
jects, and subjects often became targets. 
In early 2018, with the Mueller investigation and its grand jury main-
taining a historic level of secrecy, no one in the White House could be sure 
who was what. Or who was saying what to whom. Anyone and everyone 
working for the president or one of his senior aides could be talking to the 
special counsel. The investigation's code of silence extended into the West 
Wing. Nobody knew, and nobody was saying, who was spilling the beans. 
Almost every White House senior staffer—the collection of advisers 
who had firsthand dealings with the president—had retained a lawyer. 
Indeed, from the president's first days in the White House, Trump's tangled 
legal past and evident lack of legal concern had cast a shadow on those 
who worked for him. Senior people were looking for lawyers even as they 
were still learning how to navigate the rabbit warren that is the West Wing. 
In February 2017, mere weeks after the inauguration, and not long 
after the FBI had first raised questions about National Security AdN 
Michael Flynn, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus had walked into Steve I 
non's office and said, I'm going to do you a big favor. Give me your ci 
card. Don't ask me why, just give it to me. You'll be thanking me fol 
rest of your life:' 
Bannon opened his wallet and gave Priebus his American Exr 
card. Priebus shortly returned, handed the card back, and said, You 
have legal insurance' 
Over the next year, Bannon—a witness of fact—spent hundrec 
hours with his lawyers preparing for his testimony before the spi 
counsel and before Congress. His lawyers in turn spent ever moun 
hours talking to Mueller's team and to congressional committee coun 
Bannon's legal costs at the end of the year came to $2 million. 
Every lawyer's first piece of advice to his or her client was blunt 
unequivocal: talk to no one, lest it become necessary to testify aboutI 
you said. Before long, a constant preoccupation of senior staffers in 
Trump White House was to know as little as possible. It was a wr( 
side-up world: where being in the room was traditionally the 
sought-after status, now you wanted to stay out of meetings. You wa: 
to avoid being a witness to conversations; you wanted to avoid b 
witnessed being a witness to conversations, at least if you were sn 
Certainly, nobody was your friend. It was impossible to know wilt 
colleague stood in the investigation; hence, you had no way of knoN 
how likely it was that they might need to offer testimony about som( 
else—you, perhaps—as the bargaining chip to save themselves by a 
erating with the special counsel, a.k.a. flipping. 
The White House, it rapidly dawned on almost everyone who wol 
there—even as it became one more reason not to work there—was 
scene of an ongoing criminal investigation, one that could potent 
ensnare anyone who was anywhere near it. 
* * * 
The ultimate keeper of the secrets from the campaign, the transition, 
through the first year in the White House was Hope Hicks, the AN 
House communications director. She had witnessed most everyth 
6 MICHAEL WOLFF SIEGE 7 
She saw what the president saw: she knew what the president, a man 
unable to control his own running monologue, knew. 
On February 27, 2018, testifying before the House Intelligence 
Committee—she had already appeared before the special counsel—she 
was pressed about whether she had ever lied for the president. Perhaps a 
more accomplished communications professional could have escaped the 
corner here, but Hicks, who had scant experience other than working as 
Donald Trump's spokesperson, which, as often as not, meant dealing with 
his disregard of empirical truth, found herself as though in a sudden and 
unexpected moral void trying to publicly parse the relative importance 
of her boss's lies. She admitted to telling white lies:' as in, somehow, less 
than the biggest lies. This was enough of a forward admission to require 
a nearly twenty-minute mid-testimony conference with her lawyers, dis-
tressed by what she might be admitting and by where any deconstruction 
of the president's constant inversions might lead. 
Not long after she testified, another witness before the Mueller grand 
jury was asked how far Hicks might go to lie for the president. The witness 
answered: I think when it comes to doing anything as a 'yes man' for 
Trump, she'll do it—but she won't take a bullet for him?' The statement 
could be taken as both a backhanded compliment and an estimate of how 
far loyalty in the Trump White House might extend—probably not too far. 
Almost no one in Trump's administration, it could be argued, was con-
ventionally suited to his or her job. But with the possible exception of the 
president himself, no one provided a better illustration of this unprepared 
and uninformed presidency than Hicks. She did not have substantial media 
or political experience, nor did she have a temperament annealed by years 
of high-pressure work. Always dressed in the short skirts that Trump 
favored, she seemed invariably caught in the headlights. Trump admired 
her not because she had the political skills to protect him, but for her pliant 
dutifulness. Her job was to devote herself to his care and feeding. 
When you speak to him, open with positive feedback:' counseled 
Hicks, understanding Trump's need for constant affirmation and his 
almost complete inability to talk about anything but himself. Her atten-
tiveness to Trump and tractable nature had elevated her, at age twenty-nine, 
to the top White House communications job. And practically speaking, 
she acted as his de facto chief of staff. Trump did not want his administra-
tion to be staffed by professionals; he wanted it to be staffed by people who 
attended and catered to him. 
Hicks—Hope-y, to Trump—was both the president's gatekeeper 
and his comfort blanket. She was also a frequent subject of his pruri-
ent interest: Trump preferred business, even in the White House, to be 
personal. Who's fucking Hope? he would demand to know. The topic 
also interested his son Don Jr., who often professed his intention to fuck 
Hope The president's daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, 
both White House senior advisers, expressed a gentler type of concern for 
Hicks; sometimes they would even try to suggest eligible men. 
But Hicks, seeming to understand the insular nature of Trumpworld, 
dated exclusively inside the bubble, picking the baddest boys in it: cam-
paign manager Corey Lewandowslci during the campaign and presiden-
tial aide Rob Porter in the White House. As the relationship between 
Hicks and Porter unfolded in the fall of 2017, knowing about the affair 
became an emblem of Trump insiderness, with special care taken to keep 
this development from the proprietary president. Or not: other people, 
assuming that Porter's involvement with Hicks would not at all please 
Trump, were less than discreet about it. 
* * * 
In the heightened enmity of the Trump White House, Rob Porter may have 
succeeded in becoming the most disliked person by everyone except per-
haps the president himself A square-jawed, 1950s-looking guy who could 
have been a model for Brylcreem, he was almost a laughable figure of 
betrayal and perfidy: if he hadn't stabbed you in the back, you would be 
forced to acknowledge how unworthy he considered you to be. A sitcom 
sort of suck-up—Eddie Haskell, cracked Bannon, citing the early televi-
sion icon of insincerity and brownnosing featured in Leave It to Beaver—he 
embraced Chief of Staff John Kelly, while at the same time poisoning him 
with the president. Porter's estimation of his own high responsibilities in 
the White House, together with the senior-most jobs that the president, 
he let it be known, was promising him, seemed to put the administration 
and the nation squarely on his shoulders. 
8 MICHAEL WOLFF 
SIEGE 
Porter had, before the age of forty, two bitter ex-wives, at least one 
of whom he had beaten, and both of whom he had cheated on at talk-
of-the-town levels. During a stint as a Senate staffer, the married Porter 
had an affair with an intern, costing him his job. His girlfriend Samantha 
Dravis had moved in with Porter in the summer of 2017, while, quite 
unbeknownst to her, he was seeing Hicks. I cheated on you because you're 
not attractive enough:' he later told Dravis. 
In a potentially criminal break of protocol, Porter had gained access 
to his raw FBI clearance reports and seen the statements of his ex-wives. 
His most recent ex-wife had also written a blog about his alleged abuse, 
which, while it did not name him, clearly fingered him. Concerned about 
the damaging impact his former wives could have on his security review, 
he recruited Dravis to help him smooth his relationship with both women. 
Lewandowski, Hicks's former boyfriend, caught wind of the Hicks-
Porter relationship and began working to expose it; by some reports, 
he got paparazzi to follow Hicks. Though Porter's history of abuse was 
slowly making its way to the surface as a result of the FBI investigation, 
the Lewandowski campaign against Hicks cut through many other efforts 
to cover up Porter's transgressions. 
Dravis, in the autumn of 2017, heard the Lewandowski-pushed 
rumors of the Hicks-Porter relationship. After finding Hicks's number 
listed under a man's name in Porter's contacts, Dravis confronted Porter, 
who promptly threw her out. Moving back in with her parents, she began 
her own revenge campaign, openly talking about Porter's security clear-
ance issues, including to people inside the White House counsel's office, 
saying he had protection at the highest levels in the White House. Then, 
along with Lewandowski, Dravis helped leak the details of the Hicks-
Porter romance to the Daily Mail, which published a story about it on 
February 1. 
But Dravis, joined by Porter's former wives, decided that, outra-
geously, he had come out looking good in the Daily Mail account—he 
was part of a glam power couple! Porter called Dravis to taunt her: You 
thought you could get me! Dravis and his former wives all then publicly 
revealed their abuse at his hand. His first wife said he kicked and punched 
her; she even produced a photograph of her black eye. His second wife 
informed the media that she had filed an emergency protective orC 
against him. 
The White House, or at least Kelly—and likely Hicks—had been am 
of many of these claims and, effectively, covered them up. (You usua 
have enough competent people for White House positions to weed out 
wife beaters, but you couldn't be so choosy in the Trump White House, 
one Republican acquaintance of Porter's.) The furor that erupted arou 
Porter and his troubling gross-guy history not only annoyed Trump 
He stinks of bad press—it further weakened Kelly. On February 7, af 
both of his former wives gave interviews to CNN, Porter resigned. 
A publicity-shy Hicks—Donald Trump put a high value on associa 
who did not steal his press opportunities—suddenly found her love 1 
in the glare of intense international press scrutiny. Her affair with the d 
credited Porter highlighted her own odd relationship with the presid( 
and his family, as well as the haphazard management, interpersonal •:1 
functions, and general lack of political savvy in the Trump court. 
* * * 
The affair was, curiously, among the least of Hicks's problems. Indeed, i 
Hicks the Porter scandal became perhaps a better cloud under which 
leave the administration than what almost everybody in the West Wi 
assumed was the real cloud. 
On February 27, a reporter at the Washington insider newsletter Axi 
Jonathan Swan, a favorite conduit for White House leaks, reported ti 
Josh Raffel was leaving the White House. In a novel arrangement, Rai 
had come into the White House in April 2017 as the exclusive spokespers 
for the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner, and his wife, Ivanka, bypa 
ing the White House communications team. Raffel, who, like Kushn 
was a Democrat, had worked for Hiltzik Strategies, the New York pub 
relations firm that represented Ivanka's clothing line. 
Hope Hicks, who had also worked for the Hiltzik firm—perhaps 1), 
known for having long represented the film producer Harvey Weinste 
caught, in the fall of 2017, in an epochal harassment and abuse scan( 
and cover-up—had originally had the same role as Raffel but at a hie 
level: she was the personal spokesperson for the president. In Septemb 
10 MICHAEL WOLFF 
SIEGE 
Hicks had been elevated to White House communications director, with 
Raffel as her number two. 
The trouble had arisen the previous summer. Both Hicks and Raffel 
had been on Air Force One in July 2017 as the news broke about Donald 
Trump Jr.'s meeting in Trump Tower during the campaign with Russian 
government go-betweens offering dirt on Hillary Clinton. During the 
flight back to the United States after the G20 summit in Germany, Hicks 
and Raffel aided the president in his efforts to issue a largely false story 
about the Trump Tower meeting, thus becoming part of the cover-up. 
Even though Raffel had been at the White House for a little more than 
nine months, the Axios report said that his departure had been under dis-
cussion for several months. That was untrue. It was an abrupt exit. 
The next day, just as abruptly, Hope Hicks—the person in the White 
House closest to the president—resigned as well. 
The one person who perhaps knew more than anyone else about the 
workings of the Trump campaign and the Trump White House was sud-
denly out the door. The profound concern inside the White House was 
the reasonable supposition that Hicks and Raffel, both witnesses to and 
participants in the president's efforts to cover up the details of his son and 
son-in-law's meeting with the Russians, were subjects or targets of the 
Mueller investigation—or, worse, had already cut a deal. 
The president, effusive in his public praise for Hicks, did not try to 
talk her out of leaving. In the weeks to come he would mope about her 
absence—Where's my Hope-y?—but, in fact, as soon as he got wind 
that she might be talking, he wanted to cut her loose and began, in a 
significant rewrite, downgrading her status and importance on the cam-
paign and in the White House. 
Yet here, from Trump's point of view, was a hopeful point about Hicks: 
as central as she was to his presidency, her duties really only consisted of 
pleasing him. She was an unlikely agent of grand strategy and great con-
spiracies. Trump's team was made up of only bit players. 
* * * 
John Dowd may have been reluctant to give his client bad news, but 
he well understood the danger of a thorough prosecutor with virtually 
unlimited resources. The more a determined team of G-men sifts, strir 
and inspects, the greater the chance that both methodical and cast 
crimes will be revealed. The more comprehensive the search, the mc 
inevitable the outcome. The case of Donald Trump—with his history 
bankruptcies, financial legerdemain, dubious associations, and gene] 
sense of impunity—certainly seemed to offer prosecutors something 
an embarrassment of riches. 
For his part, however, Donald Trump yet seemed to believe that I 
skills and instincts were at least a match for all the thoroughness a] 
resources of the United States Department of Justice. He even believ 
their exhaustive approach would work in his favor. Boring. Confusi 
for everybody:' he said, dismissing the reports of the investigation pi 
vided by Dowd and others. You can't follow any of this. No hook:' 
One of the many odd aspects of Trump's presidency was that 
did not see being president, either the responsibilities or the exposu 
as being all that different from his pre-presidential life. He had endur 
almost countless investigations in his long career. He had been involv 
in various kinds of litigation for the better part of forty-five years. He 
a fighter who, with brazenness and aggression, got out of fixes that wot 
have ruined a weaker, less wily player. That was his essential busint 
strategy: what doesn't kill me strengthens me. Though he was wound 
again and again, he never bled out. 
It's playing the game, he explained in one of his frequent mor 
logues about his own superiority and everyone else's stupidity. I'm go 
at the game. Maybe I'm the best. Really, I could be the best. I think I 
the best. I'm very good. Very cool. Most people are afraid that the wo 
might happen. But it doesn't, unless you're stupid. And I'm not stupid: 
In the weeks after his first anniversary in office, with the Mudl 
investigation in its eighth month, Trump continued to regard the si 
cial counsel's inquiry as a contest of wills. He did not see it as a war 
attrition—a gradual reduction of the strength and credibility of the t 
get through sustained scrutiny and increasing pressure. Instead, he saN 
situation to confront, a spurious government undertaking that was v 
nerable to his attacks. He was confident he could jawbone this wii 
hunt—often tweeted in all-caps—to at least a partisan draw. 
12 MICHAEL WOLFF

He remained irritated by efforts to persuade him to play the game in 
the usual Washington way—mounting a disciplined legal defense, negoti-
ating, trying to cut his losses—rather than his way. This was disconcerting 
to many of the people closest to him, but it alarmed them more to see that 
as Trump's indignation and sense of personal insult rose, so did his belief 
in his own innocence. 
* * * 
By the end of February, in addition to the Mueller grand jury indictments 
of a group of Russian nationals for illegal activities involved with efforts 
by the Russian government to influence the U.S. election, Mueller had 
reached several levels into the Trump circle. Among those who were 
indicted or who had pled guilty to felonies were his former campaign man-
ager Paul Manafort, his former national security advisor Michael Flynn, 
the eager-beaver junior adviser George Papadopoulos, and Manafort's 
business partner and campaign official Rick Gates. This series of legal 
moves could be classically read as a methodical, step-by-step approach to 
the president's door. Or, from the Trump camp's point of view, it could be 
seen as a roundup of the sorts of opportunists and hangers-on who had 
always trailed Trump. 
The doubts about the usefulness of Trump's hangers-on was an implicit 
part of their usefulness: they could be shrugged off and disavowed at any 
time, which is what promptly happened at the least sign of trouble. The 
Trumpers swept up by Mueller were all declared wannabe and marginal 
players. The president had never met them, could not remember them, or 
had a limited acquaintance with them. I know Mr. Manafort—I haven't 
spoken to him in a long time, but I know him:' declared a dismissive 
Trump, pulling a line from the who dat? page of his playbook. 
The difficulty in proving a conspiracy is proving intent. Many of the 
president's inner circle believed that Trump, and the Trump Organiza-
tion, and by extension the Trump campaign, operated in such a diffuse, 
haphazard, gang-that-couldn't-shoot-straight manner that intent would 
be very difficult to establish. What's more, the Trump hangers-on were 
so demonstrably subpar players that stupidity could well be a reasonable 
defense against intent. 
Many in the Trump circle agreed with their boss: they believed tha 
whatever idiotic moves had been made by idiotic Trump hands, the Rus. 
sia investigation was too abstruse and nickel-and-dime to ultimately stick 
At the same time, many, and perhaps all, were privately convinced tha 
a deep dive—or, for that matter, even a cursory inspection—of Trump' 
financial past would yield a trove of overt offenses, and likely a pattern o 
career corruption. 
It was hardly surprising, then, that ever since the beginning of th 
special counsel's investigation, Trump had tried to draw a line in the sani 
between Mueller and Trump family finances, openly threatening Muelle 
if he went there. Trump's operating assumption remained that the speck 
counsel was afraid of him, conscious of where and how his toleranc 
might end. Trump was confident that the Mueller team could be made t 
understand its limits, by either wink-wink or unsubtle threat. 
They know they can't get me, he told one member of his circl 
of after-dinner callers, because I was never involved. I'm not a targe 
There's nothing. I'm not a target. They've told me, I'm not a target. An 
they know what would happen if they made me a target. Everybod 
understands everybody:'

Books and newspaper stories about Trump's forty-five years in busine; 
were full of his shady dealings, and his arrival in the White House on: 
helped to highlight them and surface even juicier ones. Real estate 3,4g 
the world's favorite money-laundering currency, and Trump's B-level re 
estate business—relentlessly marketed by Trump as triple A—was qui 
explicitly designed to appeal to money launderers. What's more, Trumi 
own financial woes, and desperate efforts to maintain his billionaire lif 
style, cachet, and market viability, forced him into constant and unsubt 
schemes. In the high irony department, Jared Kushner, when he was: 
law school, and before he met Ivanka, identified, in a paper he wrot 
possible claims of fraud against the Trump Organization in a particul 
real estate deal he was studying—a subject now of quite some amuseme 
among his acquaintances at the time. Practically speaking, Trump hid 
plain sight, as the prosecutors appeared to be finding. 
14 MICHAEL WOLFF 
SIEGE 15 
In November 2004, for instance, Jeffrey Epstein, the financier later 
caught in a scandal involving underage prostitutes, agreed to purchase 
from bankruptcy a house in Palm Beach, Florida, for $36 million, a prop-
erty that had been on the market for two years. Epstein and Trump had 
been close friends—playboys in arms, as it were—for more than a decade, 
with Trump often seeking Epstein's help with his chaotic financial affairs. 
Soon after negotiating the deal for the house in Palm Beach, Epstein took 
Trump to see it, looking for advice on construction issues involved with 
moving the swimming pool. But as he prepared to finalize his purchase 
for the house, Epstein discovered that Trump, who was severely cash-
constrained at the time, had bid $41 million for the property and bought 
it out from under Epstein through an entity called Trump Properties 
LLC, entirely financed by Deutsche Bank, which was already carrying a 
substantial number of troubled loans to the Trump Organization and to 
Trump personally. 
Trump, Epstein knew, had been loaning out his name in real estate 
deals—that is, for an ample fee, Trump would serve as a front man to 
disguise the actual ownership in a real estate transaction. (This was, in 
a sense, another variation of Trump's basic business model of licensing 
his name for commercial properties owned by someone else.) A furi-
ous Epstein, certain that Trump was merely fronting for the real owners, 
threatened to expose the deal, which was getting extensive coverage in 
Florida papers. The fight became all the more bitter when, not long after 
the purchase, Trump put the house on the market for $125 million. 
But if Epstein knew some of Trump's secrets, Trump knew some of 
Epstein's. Trump often saw the financier at Epstein's current Palm Beach 
house, and Trump knew that Epstein was visited almost every day, and 
had been for many years, by girls he'd hired to give him massages that 
often had happy endings—girls recruited from local restaurants, strip clubs, 
and, also, Trump's own Mar-a-Lago. Just as the enmity between the two 
friends increased over the house purchase, Epstein found himself under 
investigation by the Palm Beach police. And as Epstein's legal prob-
lems escalated, the house, with only minor improvements, was acquired 
for $96 million by Dmitry Rybolovlev, an oligarch who was part of the 
close Putin circle of government-aligned industrialists in Russia, and who, 
in fact, never moved into the house. Trump had, miraculously, earned 
$55 million without putting up a dime. Or, more likely, Trump merely 
earned a fee for hiding the real owner—a shadow owner quite possibly 
being funneled cash by Rybolovlev for other reasons beyond the value 
of the house. Or, possibly, the real owner and real buyer were one and 
the same. Rybolovlev might have, in effect, paid himself for the house, 
thereby cleansing the additional $55 million for the second purchase 
of the house. 
This was Donald Trump's world of real estate. 
* * * 
As though using mind-control tricks, Jared Kushner had become highly 
skilled at containing his deep frustration with his father-in-law. He stayed 
expressionless—sometimes he seemed almost immobile—when Trump 
went off the rails, unleashing tantrums or proposing dopey political or 
policy moves. Kushner, a courtier in a crazy court, was possessed of an 
eerie calmness and composure. He was also very worried. It seemed 
astounding and ludicrous that this fig-leaf technicality—You're not a 
target, Mr. President—could offer his father-in-law such comfort. 
Kushner understood that Trump was surrounded by a set of mortal 
arrows, any of which might kill him: the case for obstruction; the case 
for collusion; any close look at his long, dubious financial history; the 
always-lurking issues with women; the prospects of a midterm rout and 
the impeachment threat if the midterm elections went against them; the 
fickleness of the Republicans, who might at any time turn on him; and the 
senior staffers who had been pushed out of the administration (Kushner 
had urged the ouster of many of them), any of whom might testify against 
him. In March alone, Gary Cohn, the president's chief economic adviser, 
Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, and Andrew McCabe, the deputy 
director of the FBI—each man bearing the president deep contempt—
were pushed from the administration. 
But the president was in no mood to hear Kushner's counsel. Never 
entirely trusted by his father-in-law—in truth, Trump trusted no one 
except, arguably, his daughter Ivanka, Kushner's wife—Kushner now found 
himself decidedly on the wrong side of Trump's red line of loyalty. 
16 MICHAEL WOLFF 
SIEGE 
As a family insider, Kushner, in a game of court politics so vicious 
that, in another time, it might have yielded murder plots, had appeared to 
triumph over his early White House rivals. But Trump invariably soured 
on the people who worked for him, just as they soured on him, not least 
because he nearly always came to believe that his staff was profiting at his 
expense. He was convinced that everyone was greedy, and that sooner or 
later they would try to take what was more rightfully his. Increasingly, it 
seemed that Kushner, too, might be just another staff member trying to 
take advantage of Donald Trump. 
Trump had recently learned that a prominent New York investment 
fund, Apollo Global Management, led by the financier Leon Black, had 
provided the Kushner Companies—the family real estate group that had 
been managed by Kushner himself while his father, Charlie, was in federal 
prison—with $184 million in financing. 
This was troubling on many levels, and it left a vulnerable Kushner 
open to more questions about the conflicts between his business and his 
position in the White House. During the transition, Kushner had offered 
Apollo's cofounder Marc Rowan, the job of director of the Office of Man-
agement and Budget. Rowan initially accepted the job, declining it only 
after Apollo chairman Leon Black objected to what would have to be dis-
closed about Rowan's and the firm's investments. 
But the president-elect's concerns were elsewhere: he was more keenly 
and furiously focused on the fact that, in the constant search for financings 
that occur in mid-tier real estate companies like Trump's, Apollo had never 
extended itself for the Trump Organization. Now, it seemed baldly appar-
ent, Apollo was backing the Kushners solely because of the family's con-
nection to the administration. The constant accounting in Trump's head 
of who was profiting from whom, and his sense of what he was therefore 
owed for creating the circumstances by which everyone could profit, was 
one of the things that reliably kept him up at night. 
You think I don't know what's going on? Trump sneered at his 
daughter, one of the few people he usually went out of his way to try to 
mollify. You think I don't know what's going on? 
The Kushners had gained. He had not. 
The president's daughter pleaded her husband's case. She spoke of the 
incredible sacrifice the couple had made by coming to Washington. Al 
for what? Our lives have been destroyed, she said melodramatically 
and yet with some considerable truth. The former New York socialii 
had been reduced to potential criminal defendants and media laughir 
stocks. 
After a year of friends and advisers whispering that his daughter a 
son-in-law were at the root of the disarray in the White House, Trur 
once again was thinking they should never have come. Revising histo 
he told various of his late-night callers that he had always thought tl-
never should have come. Over his daughter's bitter protests, he declin 
to intercede in his son-in-law's security clearance issues. The FBI ii 
continued to hold up Kushner's clearance—which the president, at 
discretion, could approve, his daughter reminded him. But Trump ( 
nothing, letting his son-in-law dangle in the wind. 
Kushner, with superhuman patience and resolve, waited for his opp 
tunity. The trick among Trump whisperers was how to focus Trun 
attention, since Trump could never be counted on to participate in ai 
thing like a normal conversation with reasonable back-and-forth. Spc 
and women were reliable subjects; both would immediately engage h: 
Disloyalty also got Trump's attention. So did conspiracies. And mone,. 
always money. 
* * * 
Kushner's own lawyer was Abbe Lowell, a well-known showboat of 
D.C. criminal bar who prided himself on, and managed his clients' exp 
tations and attention with, an up-to-the-minute menu of rumors 
insights about what gambit or strategy prosecutors were about to dish 
The true edge provided by a high-profile litigator was perhaps not col 
room skill but backroom intelligence. 
Lowell, adding to the reports Dowd had received, told Kushner I 
prosecutors were about to substantially deepen the president's—and 
Trump family's—jeopardy. Dowd had continued to try to mollify the ix 
dent, but Kushner, with intel supplied by Lowell, went to his father-in-law v 
reports about this new front in the legal war against him. Sure enough. 
March 15 the news broke that the special counsel had issued a subpo 
yvki.urr 
SIEGE 19 
for the Trump Organization records: it was a deep and encompassing order, 
reaching many years back. 
Kushner also warned his father-in-law that the investigation was about 
to spill over from the Mueller team, with its narrow focus on Russian collu-
sion, to the Southern District of New York—that is, the federal prosecutor's 
office in Manhattan—which would not be restricted to the Russia probe. This 
was a work-around intended to circumvent the special counsel's restriction 
to Russia-related matters, but also an effort by the Mueller team to short-
circuit any attempt by the president to disband or curtail its investiga-
tion. By moving parts of the investigation to the Southern District, Mueller, 
as Kushner explained to Trump, was ensuring that the investigation of the 
president would continue even without the special counsel. Mueller was 
playing a canny, or ass-protecting, game, while also following precise pro-
cedures: even as he focused on the limited area of his investigation, he was 
divvying up evidence of other possible crimes and sending it out to other 
jurisdictions, all of which were eager to be part of the hunt. 
It gets worse, Kushner told Trump. 
The Southern District was once run by Trump's friend Rudy Giuliani, 
the former mayor of New York. In the 1980s, when Giuliani was the federal 
prosecutor—and when, curiously, James Comey had worked for him—
the Southern District became the premier prosecutor of the Mafia and of 
Wall Street. Giuliani had pioneered using a draconian, and many believed 
unconstitutional, interpretation of the RICO (Racketeer Influenced and 
Corrupt Organizations) Act against the Mob. He used the same interpre-
tation against big finance, and in 1990 the threat of a RICO indictment, 
under which the government could almost indiscriminately seize assets, 
brought down the investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert. 
The Southern District had long been worrisome to Trump. After his 
election, he had an unseemly meeting with Preet Bharara, the federal pros-
ecutor there, a move whose optics were alarming to all of his advisers, 
including Don McGahn and the incoming attorney general, Jeff Sessions. 
(The meeting foreshadowed the one Trump would shortly have with 
Comey, during which he sought a pledge of loyalty in return for job secu-
rity.) His meeting with Bharara was unsatisfactory: Bharara was unwill-
ing to humor him—or, shortly, even to return his calls. In March 2017, 
Trump fired him. 
Now, said Kushner, even without Bharara, the Southern District was 
looking to treat the Trump Organization as a Mob-like enterprise; its law-
yers would use the RICO laws against it and go after the president as if he 
were a drug lord or Mob don. Kushner pointed out that corporations had 
no Fifth Amendment privilege, and that you couldn't pardon a corpora-
tion. As well, assets used in or derived from the commission of a crime 
could be seized by the government. 
In other words, of the more than five hundred companies and separate 
entities in which Donald Trump had been an officer, up until he became 
president, many might be subject to forfeiture. One potential casualty of 
a successful forfeiture action was the president's signature piece of real 
estate: the government could seize Trump Tower. 
* * * 
In mid-March, a witness with considerable knowledge of the Trump 
Organization's operations traveled by train to Washington to appear before 
the Mueller grand jury. Picked up at Union Station by the FBI, the wit-
ness was driven to the federal district court. From 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., 
two prosecutors on the Mueller team, Aaron Zelinsky and Jeannie 
Rhee, reviewed with the witness, among other issues, the structure of the 
Trump Organization. 
The prosecutors asked the witness about the people who regularly 
talked to Trump, how often they met with him, and for what purposes. 
They also asked how meetings with Trump were arranged and where they 
took place. The witness's testimony yielded, among other useful pieces of 
information, a signal fact: all checks issued by the Trump Organization 
were personally signed by Donald Trump himself. 
The Trump Organization's activities in Atlantic City were a particular 
subject of interest that day. The witness was asked about Trump's rela-
tionship with known Mafia members—not if he had such relationships, 
but the nature of the relationships prosecutors already knew existed. The 
prosecutors also wanted to know about Trump Tower Moscow, a project 
20 MICHAEL WOLFF 
pursued by Trump for many years—pursued, in fact, well into the 2016 
campaign—albeit never brought to fruition. 
Michael Cohen, Trump's personal lawyer and a Trump Organization 
officer, was another significant topic. The prosecutors asked questions 
about the level of Cohen's disappointment at not being included in the 
president's White House team. They seemed to be trying to gauge how 
much resentment Cohen felt, which led the witness to infer that they 
wanted to estimate how much leverage they might have if they attempted 
to flip Michael Cohen against the president. 
Zelinsky and Rhee wanted to know about Jared Kushner. And they 
wanted to know about Hope Hicks. 
The two prosecutors also delved into the president's personal life. How 
often did he cheat on his wife? With whom? How were trysts arranged? 
What were the president's sexual interests? The Mueller investigation, and 
its grand jury, was becoming a clearing house for the details of Trump's 
long history of professional and personal perfidiousness. 
When the long day was finally over, the witness left the grand jury 
room shocked—not so much by what the prosecutors wanted to know 
but by what they already knew. 
* * * 
By the third week of March, Trump's son-in-law had the president's full 
attention. They can not only impeach you, they can bankrupt you was 
Kushner's message. 
Agitated and angry, Trump pressed Dowd for more reassurances, 
holding him accountable for the prior reassurances Trump had frequently 
demanded he be given. Dowd held firm: he yet believed that the fight was 
in its early stages and that Mueller was still on a fishing expedition. 
But Trump's patience was finally at an end. He decided that Dowd was 
a fool and should go back into the retirement from which, Trump kept 
repeating, he had rescued him. Indeed, resisting that retirement, Dowd 
pleaded his own case, assuring the president that he could continue to 
provide him with valuable help. To no avail: on March 22, Dowd reluc-
tantly resigned, sending another bitter former Trumper into the world. 
2 
THE DO-OVER 
The day John Dowd was fired, Steve Bannon was sitting at his dining 
room table trying to forestall another threat to the Trump pres 
dency. This one wasn't about a relentless prosecutor but rather a betray( 
base. It was about the Wall that wasn't. 
The town houses on Capitol Hill, middle-class remnants of the nin 
teenth century, are cramped up-and-down affairs of modest parlor floc(' 
nook-y sitting rooms, and small bedrooms. Many serve as headquarte 
for causes and organizations that can't afford Washington's vast amou 
of standard-issue office real estate. Some double as housing for th( 
organization's leaders. Many represent amateur efforts or eccentric pt 
suits, often a kind of shrine to hopes and dreams and revolutions yet 
occur. The Embassy on A Street—a house built in 1890 and the forrr 
location of Bannon's Breitbart News—was where Bannon had lived a 
worked since his exile from the White House in August 2017. It was p 
frat house, part man cave, and part pseudo-military redoubt; conspin 
literature was scattered about. Various grave and underemployed you 
men, would-be militia members, loitered on the steps. 
The Embassy's creepiness and dark heart were in quite stark contr 
to Bannon's expansive and merry countenance. He might be in exile fr. 
the Trump White House, but it was an ebullient banishment, coffee-fue 
or otherwise. 
22 MICHAEL WOLFF 
SIEGE 23 
In the last few weeks, he had helped install his allies—and first-draft 
choices during the presidential transition—in central posts in the Trump 
administration. Mike Pompeo had recently been named secretary of state, 
John Bolton would soon become the national security advisor, and Larry 
Kudlow had been appointed director of the National Economic Council. 
The president's chief political aides were Corey Lewandowski and David 
Bossie, both Bannon allies, if not acolytes; both operated outside the 
White House and were frequent visitors at the Embassy. Many of the daily 
stream of White House defenders on cable television—the surrogates—
were Bannon people carrying Bannon's message as well as the president's. 
What's more, his enemies in the White House were moving out, includ-
ing Hope Hicks, H. R. McMaster, the former national security advisor, 
and the ever shrinking circle of allies supporting the president's son-in-
law and daughter. 
Bannon was often on the road. He was in Europe meeting with the 
rising populist right-wing groups, and in the U.S. meeting with hedge 
funders desperate to understand the Trump variable. He was also looking 
for every opportunity to try to convince liberals that the populist way 
ought to be their way, too. Early in the year, Bannon went to Cambridge 
to see Larry Summers, who had been Bill Clinton's Treasury secretary, 
Barack Obama's director of the National Economic Council, and, for a 
time, president of Harvard. Summers's wife refused to allow Bannon into 
their home, so the meeting happened at Harvard instead. Summers was 
mis-shaven and wearing a shirt that was missing a button or two, while 
Bannon was sporting his double-shirt getup, cargo pants, and a hunting 
jacket. Both of them looked like Asperger guys, said one of the people 
at the meeting. 
Do you fucking realize what your fucking friend is doing? yelled 
Summers about Trump and his administration. You're fucking the 
country! 
You elite Democrats—you only care about the margins, people who 
are rich or people who are poor, returned Bannon. 
Your trade mumbo jumbo will sink the world into a depression:' 
thundered Summers. 
And you've exported U.S. jobs to China! declared a delighted Ban-
non, always enjoying the opportunity to joust with a member of thc 
establishment. 
Bannon was—or at least saw himself to be—a fixer, power broker 
and kingmaker without portfolio. He was a cockeyed sort of Clad 
Clifford, that political eminence and influence peddler of the 1960s an( 
'70s. Or a wise man of the political fringe, if that was not an ultimate kin( 
of contradiction. Or the head of an auxiliary government. Or, perhaps 
something truly sui generis: no one quite like Bannon had ever playe( 
such a central role in America's national political life, or been such a thorr 
in the side of it. As for Trump, with friends like Bannon, who neede( 
enemies? 
The two men might be essential to each other, but they reviled an( 
ridiculed each other, too. Bannon's constant public analysis of Trump 
confounding nature—both its comic and harrowing components, thi 
behavior of a crazy uncle—not to mention his indiscreet diatribes or 
the inanities of Trump's family, continued to further alienate him from thi 
president. And yet, though the two men no longer spoke, they hung or 
each other's words—each desperate to know what one was saying abou 
the other. 
Whatever current feeling Bannon might have for Trump—his moo( 
ranged from exasperation to fury to disgust to incredulity—he contin 
ued to believe that nobody in American politics could match Trump' 
midway-style showmanship. Yes, Donald Trump had restored showman 
ship to American politics—he had taken the wonk out of politics. In sum 
he knew his audience. At the same time, he couldn't walk a straight firm 
Every step forward was threatened by his next lurch. Like many grea 
actors, his innate self-destructiveness was always in conflict with his keel 
survival instincts. Some around the president merely trusted that th. 
latter would win over the former. Others, no matter the frustration o 
the effort, understood how much he needed to be led by unseen hands—
unseen being the key attribute. 
With no one to tell him otherwise, Bannon continued, unseen, t( 
conduct the president's business from his dining-room table on A Streei

SIEGE 25 
That afternoon, a bipartisan Congress with surprising ease had passed the 
$1.3 trillion 2018 appropriations bill. McConnell, Ryan, Schumer, and 
Pelosi, said Bannon about the Republican and Democratic congressional 
leadership, in their singular moment of bipartisan magnanimity, put one 
over on Trump:' 
This legislative milestone was a result of Trump's disengagement and 
everybody else's attentive efforts. Most presidents are eager to get down into 
the weeds of the budget process. Trump took little or no interest. Hence the 
Republican and Democratic leadership—here supported by the budget 
and legislative teams in the White House—were able to pass an enormous 
spending bill that failed to fund Trump's must-must item, the holy grail 
Wall, that prospective two-thousand-mile monument meant to run the 
entire length of the border between the United States and Mexico. Instead, 
the bill provided only $1.6 billion for border security. The current bill was in 
effect the same budget bill that had been pushed forward at the end of the 
previous September, when the Wall had once again not been funded. In the 
fall, Trump had agreed to have the Republican-controlled Congress vote to 
extend the September budget bill. The next time it came up, the Wall would 
be funded or, he threatened, the government would be shut down. 
Even the hardest-core Trumpers in Congress seemed content not to 
have to die on the actual battlefield of funding the Wall, since that would 
mean embracing or at least enduring an always politically risky shutdown. 
Trump, too, in his way, seemed to understand that the Wall was more 
myth than reality, more slogan than actual plan. The Wall was ever for 
another day. 
On the other hand, it was unclear what the president understood. 
We've gotten the budget, he privately told his son-in-law at the end of 
the March budget negotiations. We've gotten the Wall, totally!' 
* * * 
On Wednesday, March 21, the day before the final vote, Paul Ryan, the 
Speaker of the House, had come to the White House to receive the presi-
dent's blessings on the budget bill. 
Got $1.6 Billion to start Wall on Southern Border, rest will be forth-
coming:' the president shortly tweeted. 
The White House had originally asked for $25 billion for the Wall, 
although high-end estimates of the Wall's ultimate cost came in at $70 
billion. Even then, the $1.6 billion in the appropriations bill was not so 
much for the Wall as for better security measures. 
As the final vote neared, a gentlemen's agreement appeared to have 
been reached, one that extended to every corner of the government—
with, it even seemed, Trump's own tacit support, or at least his conve-
nient distraction. The understanding was straightforward: whatever their 
stripe, members of Congress would not blow up the appropriations pro-
cess for the Wall. 
There were, too, Republicans like Ryan—with the backing of Repub-
lican donors such as Paul Singer and Charles Koch—who were eager to 
walk back, by whatever increment possible, Trump's hard-line immigra-
tion policies and rhetoric. Ryan and others had devised a simple method 
for accomplishing this kind of objective: you agreed with him and then 
ignored him. There was happy talk, which Trump bathed in, followed by 
practical steps, which bored him. 
That Wednesday, Trump made a series of calls to praise everyone's 
work on the bill. The next morning, Ryan, in a televised news conference 
to seal the deal, said, The president supports this bill, there's no two ways 
about it:' 
Here were the twin realities. The Wall was the most concrete manifesta-
tion of Trumpian policy, attitude, belief, and personality. At the same time, 
the Wall forced every Republican politician to come to terms with his or 
her own common sense, fiscal prudence, and political flexibility. 
It was not just the expense and impracticality of the Wall, it was hav-
ing to engage in a battle for it. A government shutdown would mean a 
high-stakes face-off between the Trump world and the non-Trump world 
Should this come to pass, it would potentially be as dramatic a moment a; 
any that had occurred since the election of 2016. 
If the Democrats wanted to harden the partisan division and wen

ples—of Trump at his most extreme, a shutdown over the Wall woulc 
hand them one. If the Republicans wanted to shift the focus from a full 
barbarian Trump to, say, the tax bill the Congress had recently passed 
26 MICHAEL WOLFF SIEGE 27 
shutting down the government would sweep that approach right off the 
table. 
The White House, quite behind Trump's back, was aggressively work-
ing to pass the appropriations bill and avoid a shutdown. The vice presi-
dent gave Trump the same assurance he had been given previously when 
a budget had been passed without full funding for the Wall: Pence said the 
bill provided a down payment for the Wall, a phrase whose debt-finance 
implications seemed to amply satisfy the president and which he repeated 
with great enthusiasm. Marc Short, the White House director of legisla-
tive affairs, and Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget, in a joint appearance in the White House briefing room 
that Thursday, shifted the debate from the Wall to the military. This bill 
will provide the largest year-over-year increase in defense spending since 
World War IL said Mulvaney. It'll be the largest increase for our men 
and women in uniform in salary in the last ten years!' 
The attempt to distract the Trumpian base with these bromides utterly 
failed. The hard-core cadre insisted on forcing the issue, and Bannon was 
delighted to serve as their general. 
Within minutes of the budget bill's passage on March 22, Bannon, 
in the Embassy, began working the phones. Calling Trump's most ardent 
supporters, his goal was to light him up. The effect was nearly imme-
diate: an unsuspecting Trump started to hear from many of those on his 
noisy back bench, who were suddenly furious. 
Bannon understood what moved Trump. Details did not. Facts did not. 
But a sense that something valuable might be taken from him immediately 
brought him up on his hind legs. If you confronted him with losing, he 
would turn on a dime. Indeed, turning on a dime was his only play. It's 
not that he needs to win the week, or day, or even the hour, reflected 
Bannon. He needs to win the second. After that, he drifts. 
For the hard-core Trumpers, it was back to a fundamental through 
line of Trumpism: you had to constantly remind Trump which side he 
was on. As Bannon organized a howling protest from the president's base, 
he took stock of the Trump reality: There simply is not going to be a Wall, 
ever, if he doesn't have to pay a political price for there not being a Wall. 
If the Wall was not under way by the midterm elections in Novem-
ber, it would show Trump to be false and, worse, weak. The Wall needed 
to be real. The absence of the Wall in the spending bill was just what it 
seemed to be: Trump out to lunch. Trump's most effective message, the 
forward front of the Trump narrative—maximal aggression toward ille-
gal immigrants—had been muted. And this had happened without him 
knowing it. 
* * * 
The night of the twenty-second, the Fox News lineup—Tucker Carlson, 
Laura Ingraham, and Sean Hannity—hammered the message: betrayal. 
The battle was on. The Republican leadership on the Hill, along with 
the donor class, stood sober and pragmatic in the face of both political 
realities and the prospect of unlimited billions in government spending—
with, certainly, no illusions that Mexico was going to pay for the Wall. 
Opposing them were the Fox pundits, righteous and unyielding in their 
appeal to the true emotion of Trumpism. 
The personal transformation of Trump over the course of the evening 
was convulsive. All three Fox pundits delivered a set of electric shocks: 
each rising in current. Trump had sold out the movement. Or, worse: 
Trump had been outsmarted and outwitted. Trump, on the phone, roared 
in pain and fury. He was the victim. He had no one in his corner. He could 
trust no one. The congressional leadership: against him. The White Housc 
itself: against him. Betrayal? Almost everyone in the White House ha 
betrayed him. 
The next morning it got worse. Pete Hegseth, the most obsequious o: 
the Fox Trump lovers, seemed, on Fox & Friends, nearly brought to tear: 
by Trump's treachery. 
Then, almost simultaneously with Hegseth's wailing, Trump abruptly—
confoundingly—shifted position and tweeted that he was considering vetoini 
the appropriations bill. The same bill that, twenty-four hours before, h( 
had embraced. 
28

That Friday morning, he came down from the residence into the 
Oval Office in a full-on rage so violent that, for a moment, his hair came 
undone. To the shock of the people with him, there stood an almost 
entirely bald Donald Trump. 
The president's sudden change of heart sent the entire Republican 
Party into a panic. If Trump carried out his threat not to sign the bill, he 
would bring on what they most feared: a shutdown. And he might well 
blame the shutdown on his own party. 
Mark Meadows, the head of the House Freedom Caucus and a 
staunch Trump ally in Congress, called the president from Europe to say 
that after the vote on Thursday afternoon most members had left town for 
the congressional recess. Congress wouldn't be able to undo the previous 
day's vote, and the shutdown was due to commence in mere hours. 
Mitch McConnell rushed Defense Secretary Jim Mattis into action to 
tell the president that American soldiers would not be paid the next day if 
he didn't sign the bill. This was a repeat performance: Mattis had issued a 
similar warning during a threatened shutdown in January. 
Never . . . never . . . never . . . again, Trump shouted, pounding the 
desk after each never:' 
Once again he caved and agreed to sign the bill. But he vowed that 
next time there would be billions upon billions for the Wall or there really 
would be a shutdown. Really. Really. 
* * * 
Bannon had been here before, so many times. 
Dude, he's Donald fucking Trump, said Bannon, holding his head 
and sitting at his table in the Embassy the day after the president signed 
the bill. 
Bannon was not confused: he had a clear understanding of how great 
a liability Trump could be to Bannon's own vision and career. To the ner-
vous titters of the people around him, Bannon believed he was the man of 
populist destiny and not Donald Trump. 
The urgency here was real. Bannon believed he represented the 
workingman against the corporate-governmental-technocratic machine 
whose constituency was the college-educated. In Bannon's romantic view, 
the workingman smelled of cigarettes, crushed your hand in his, and ww 
hard as brick—and not from working out in a gym. This remembrand( 
of things past, of (if it ever existed) a leveled world where a workingmar 
was proud of his work and identity, was inspiring, Bannon believed, ; 
global anger. It was a revolution—this worldwide unease and fear an 
day-by-day upending of liberal assumptions—and it was his. The globa 
hegemon was in his sights. He was the man behind the curtain—and h, 
might as well be in front of it, too—trying to snatch the world back fron 
its postmodern anomie and restore something like the homogenized an. 
neighborly embrace of 1962. 
And China! And the coming Gotterclammerung! To Bannon, thi 
was way-of-life stuff. China was the Russia of 1962—but smarter, mor 
tenacious, and more threatening. American hedge funders, in their secr( 
support of China against the interests of the American middle class, wei 
the new fifth column. 
How much of this did Trump understand? How much was Trum 
committed to the ideas that moved Bannon and, by some emotion 
osmosis, the base? Trump was more than a year in, and not a shovelful . 
dirt had yet been dug for the Wall, nor a penny allocated. The Wall ar 
so much else that was part of Bannon's populist revolution—the detai 
of which he had once listed on whiteboards in his White House offic 
expecting to check each one off—were entirely captive to Trump's inatte 
tion and wild mood swings. Trump, Bannon had long ago learned, does] 
give a fuck about the agenda—he doesn't know what the agenda is!' 
* * * 
In late March, after the gloom of the budget bill disaster had lifted, thc 
was a brief, optimistic moment for the faithful in Trump's inner circle. 
Chief of Staff John Kelly, fed up with Trump—just as Trump was f 
up with him—seemed surely on the way out. Kelly had joined the Wh 
House, replacing Reince Priebus, Trump's first chief of staff, in Augi 
2017, charged with bringing management discipline to a chaotic W 
Wing. But by mid-fall, Trump was circumventing Kelly's new pro. 
dures. Jared and Ivanka—with many of the new rules designed to cl 
tail their open access to the president—were going over his head. 
MICHAEL WOLFF 
SIEGE 
31 
the end of the year, Trump was casually mocking his chief of staff and 
his penchant for efficiency and strict procedures. Indeed, both men were 
openly trashing each other, quite unmindful of the large audience for 
their slurs. For Trump, Kelly was a twitcher and feeble and ready to 
stroke out:' For Kelly, Trump was deranged and mad and stupid. 
The drama just got weirder. 
In February, Kelly, a retired four-star general, grabbed Trump adviser 
Corey Lewandowski outside the Oval Office and pushed him up against a 
wall. Don't look him in the eye, whispered Trump about Kelly after the 
incident, circling his finger next to his head in the crazy sign. The con-
frontation left everybody shaken, with Trump asking Lewandowski not 
to tell anyone, and Lewandowski, when talking to the people he did tell, 
saying that he had almost wet himself. 
By March, Trump and Kelly were hardly speaking. Trump ignored 
him; Kelly sulked. Or Trump would drop pointed hints that Kelly should 
resign, and Kelly would ignore him. Everyone assumed the countdown 
had begun. 
Various Republicans, from Ryan to McConnell to their right-wing 
adversary Mark Meadows, along with Bannon, had gotten behind a plan 
to push House majority leader Kevin McCarthy for chief of staff. Even 
Meadows, who hated McCarthy, was all for it. Here finally was a strat-
egy: McCarthy, a top tactician, would refocus an unfocused White House 
on one mission—the midterms. Every tweet, every speech, every action 
would be directed toward salvaging the Republican majority. 
Alas, Trump didn't want a chief of staff who would focus him. Trump, 
it was clear, didn't want a chief of staff who would tell him anything. 
Trump did not want a White House that ran by any method other than to 
satisfy his desires. Someone happened to mention that John F. Kennedy 
didn't have a chief of staff, and now Trump regularly repeated this presi-
dential factoid. 
* * * 
The Mueller team, as it pursued the Russia investigation, continued to 
bump up against Trump's unholy financial history, exactly the rabbit hole 
Trump had warned them not to go down. Mueller, careful to protect his 
own flank, took pains to reassure the president's lawyers that he wasn't 
pursuing the president's business interests; at the same time, he was pass-
ing the evidence his investigation had gathered about Trump's business 
and personal affairs to other federal prosecutors. 
On April 9, the FBI, on instructions from federal prosecutors in New 
York, raided the home and office of Michael Cohen, as well as a room he 
was using in the Regency Hotel on Park Avenue. Cohen, who billed him-
self as Trump's personal lawyer, sat handcuffed for hours in his kitchen 
while the FBI conducted its search, itemizing and hauling away every 
electronic device its agents could find. 
Bannon, coincidentally, also stayed at the Regency on his frequent 
trips to New York, and he would sometimes bump into Cohen in the 
hotel's lobby. Bannon had known Cohen during the campaign, and the 
lawyer's mysterious involvement in campaign issues often worried him. 
Now, in Washington, seeing the Cohen news, Bannon knew that another 
crucial domino had fallen. 
While we don't know where the end is, said Bannon, we can guess 
where it might begin: with Brother Cohen. 
* * * 
On April 11, three weeks after the president signed the budget bill, Paul 
Ryan—one of the government's most powerful figures given the Repub-
lican lock on Washington—announced his plan to leave the Speakership 
and depart Congress. 
Listen to what Paul Ryan is saying:' said Bannon, sitting at his table 
in the Embassy early that morning. It's over. Done. Done. And Paul Ryan 
wants the fuck off the Trump train today. 
Ryan had been telling almost anyone who would listen that as many 
as fifty or sixty House seats would be lost seven months hence in the mid-
term elections. A Ryan lieutenant, Steve Stivers, chairman of the National 
Republican Congressional Committee, was estimating a loss of ninety to 
one hundred seats. At this gloomy hour, it seemed more than possible 
that the Democrats would eliminate their twenty-three-seat deficit and 
32 MICHAEL WOLFF 
SIEGE 3: 
gain a majority greater than the one the Republicans held now. Except, 
unlike the Republicans, theirs would be a unified party—or at least one 
that was unified against Donald Trump. 
Ryan and Stivers were hardly the only ones seeing such a result. Mitch 
McConnell was telling donors not to even bother contributing to House 
races. The money should go to the Senate campaign, where prospects for 
holding the Republican majority were significantly brighter. 
This was, for Donald Trump, in Bannon's view, the most desperate 
moment in his political career, arguably even worse than the revelation 
of the Access Hollywood grab-them-by-the-pussy tape. He was already on 
the ropes legally, with Mueller and the Southern District bearing down; 
now, looking at a likely wipeout in the midterm elections, he was in seri-
ous political jeopardy as well. 
But Bannon's usual ebullience quickly returned. As he talked his 
way out of his funk, he became nearly joyful. If the establishment—
Democrats, Republicans, moderate thinkers of every sort—believed that 
Donald Trump needed to be run out of town, then Bannon relished the 
prospect of defending him. For Bannon, this was the mission, but it was 
also sport. Bannon thrived on the possibility of upset. His own leap to 
the world stage had come because the Trump campaign was so deep 
in hopelessness that he was allowed to take it over. Then, on Novem-
ber 9, 2016, against all odds and expectations, Trump, riding Bannon's 
campaign—with Bannon's primacy soon one of the bitterest pills for 
Trump to swallow—won the presidency. Now, even with almost every 
indicator for the November elections looking bleak, Bannon believed he 
could yet see how Republican losses could be held to under the twenty-
three seats needed to save the House majority. Still, it was going to be a 
grinding fight. 
When Trump calls his New York friends after dinner and whines that 
he doesn't have a friend in the world, he's kind of right, said a mordant 
Bannon. 
Bannon viewed the case against Donald Trump as both inherently 
political—his enemies willing to do whatever it took to bring him down—
and essentially true. He had little doubt that Trump was guilty of most of 
what he was accused of How did he get the dough for the primary and 
then for the general with his 'liquidity' issues? asked Bannon with hi: 
hands out and his eyebrows up. Let's not dwell. 
But for Bannon there were two sides in American politics—not s( 
much right and left, but right brain and left brain. The left brain wa 
represented by the legal system, which was empirical, evidentiary, an 
methodical; given the chance, it would inevitably and correctly convic 
Donald Trump. The right side was represented by politics, and therefor 
by voters who were emotional, volatile, febrile, and always eager to thros 
the dice. Get the deplorables fired up—he slapped his hands in thunder 
clap effect—and we'll save our man:' 
Almost a year and a half on, all of the issues of 2016 remained a 
powerful and raw as ever: immigration, white man's resentment, and th 
liberal contempt for the working—or out-of-work—white man. The yea 
2018 was, for Bannon, the real 2016: the deplorable base had become th 
deplorable nation. It's civil war:' Bannon said, a happy judgment he ofte 
repeated. 
The most resonant issue was Donald Trump himself: the people wh 
elected him would be galvanized by the effort to take him from then 
Bannon was horrified by mainstream Republican efforts to run the corn 
ing election on the strength of the recent Republican tax cut. .Are yo 
kidding? Oh my fucking god, are you kidding? This election was abot 
the fate of Donald Trump. 
Let's have a do-over election. That's what the libs want. They ca 
have it. Let's do it. Up or down, Trump or no Trump. 
Impeachment was not to be feared, it was to be embraced. That 
what you're voting for: to impeach Donald Trump or to save him froi 
impeachment:' 
The legal threat, however, might be moving faster than the electioi 
And to Bannon—who knew more about the president's hankerings, moo 
swings, and impulse-control issues than almost anyone—you could n( 
have produced a needier or more hapless defendant. 
* * * 
Since coming aboard in the summer of 2017, the president's legal team-
Dow& Cobb, and Selculow—had delivered the message their client insist( 
34 MICHAEL WOLFF 
SIEGE 35 
upon hearing, that he was not a target and would shortly be exonerated. 
But the lawyers went even further with their feel-good strategy. 
Presidents, faced with hostile investigations by the other coequal 
branches of government, Congress and the judiciary invariably cite exec-
utive privilege both as a legitimate principle and as a dilatory tactic. It's a 
built-in bargaining chip. But Trump's lawyers, hoisted by how often they 
had to assure the president that he had nothing to fear, supported their 
confident assessment, to Trump's delight, by dispensing with any claim 
of executive privilege and willingly satisfying all the special counsel's 
requests. Trump, in all his dodginess, had become an open book. What's 
more, Trump himself, ever believing in the force and charm of his own 
personality, was, with his attorneys' apparent assent, eager to testify. 
And yet, Bannon knew, it was still much worse. The president's law-
yers had sent more than 1.1 million documents to the special counsel, 
aided by only a scant document production team. It was just Dowd, 
Cobb, and two inexperienced assistants. In major litigations, docu-
ments are meticulously logged and cross-referenced into elaborate and 
efficient database systems. Here, they shipped over much of the material 
merely as attachments, and kept minimal or no records of what exactly 
had been sent. Few in the White House knew what they had given up and 
thus what the special counsel had. And the haphazard approach didn't 
stop there. Dowd and Cobb neither prepared many of the witnesses who 
had worked for the White House in advance of their testimony to Mueller's 
team nor debriefed them after they testified. 
Bannon was overcome by the hilarity and stupidity of this what-me-
worry approach to federal prosecutors whose very reputations depended 
on nailing the president. Trump needed a plan—which, of course, Ban-
non had. 
Bannon swore that he did not want to go back into the White House. 
He wouldn't ever, he said. The humiliations of working in Trump's admin-
istration had almost destroyed Bannon's satisfaction at having risen so 
miraculously to the top of the world. 
Some, however, were not convinced by his protestations. They 
believed that Bannon actively fantasized that he would be brought back 
into the West Wing to save Trump—and that, not incidentally, this would 
be his ultimate revenge on Trump, saving him yet again. Bannon certainly 
believed that he was the only one who could pull off this difficult rescue, a 
reflection of his conviction that he was the most gifted political strategist 
of his time, and of his view that Trump was surrounded by only greater 
and lesser lummoxes. 
Trump, Bannon believed, needed a wartime consigliere. And if, he 
mused, Jared and Ivanka were finally sent packing. . . But no, he insisted, 
not even then. 
Moreover, Trump would not be able to tolerate it. Bannon under-
stood that only Trump could save the day, or at least that Trump believed 
only he could save the day. No other scenario was possible. He would 
rather lose, would rather even go to jail, than have to share victory with 
someone else. He was psychologically incapable of not being the focus of 
all attention. 
In the end, it was easier and more productive to give Trump advice at 
a distance than up close. It was a safer play to do what needed to be done 
without Trump himself actually being involved with, or even aware of, 
what was being done. 
The morning Ryan announced his retirement from the House, Ban-
non was particularly eager to send some advice Trump's way. Setting up 
a deft bank shot, he invited Robert Costa, a reporter for the Washington 
Post, to visit him at the Embassy. 
Bannon spent a good part of every day talking to reporters. On some 
days, perhaps most days, his blind-quote voice—hidden behind a famil-
iar attribution such as this account is drawn from interviews with cur-
rent and former officials—crowded out most other voices on the subject 
of whatever new crisis was engulfing the Trump administration. These 
quotes functioned as something like a stage whisper that Trump could 
pretend he didn't hear. Trump, in fact, was always desperately seeking 
Bannon's advice, though only if there was the slightest pretext for believ-
ing that it came from some place other than Bannon. Indeed, Trump was 
quite willing to hear Bannon say something in this or that interview and 
then claim he had thought of it himself. 
Costa sat at Bannon's dining-room table for two hours, taking down 
Bannon's prescription for how to save Trump from himself. 
36 MICHAEL WOLFF 
SIEGE 37 
Trump's stupidity, said Bannon, could sometimes be made into a vir-
tue. Here was Bannon's idea: the president should make a retroactive claim 
of executive privilege. I didn't know. Nobody told me. I was ill-advised. 
It was hard not to see Bannon's satisfaction in a prostrate Trump 
admitting to his own lack of guile and artfulness. 
Bannon understood that this claim of retroactive executive privilege 
would have no chance of success—nor should it. But the sheer audacity 
of it could buy them four or five months of legal delay. Delay was their 
friend, possibly their only friend. They could work this claim of retroac-
tive executive privilege, no matter how loopy, all the way to the Supreme 
Court. 
For this plan to work, the president would have to get rid of his inept 
lawyers. Oh, and he would also have to fire Rod Rosenstein, the deputy 
attorney general who was overseeing the Mueller investigation. Bannon 
had been against the firing of Comey, and in the months after the appoint-
ment of the special counsel, he had fought the president's almost daily 
impulse to fire Mueller and Rosenstein, seeing this as the surest invitation 
to impeachment. (Just don't pay attention to his crazy shit, he had urged 
everyone around the president.) But now they had run out of options. 
Firing Rosenstein is our only way out of here Bannon told Costa. 
I don't come to this lightly. As soon as they went to Cohen—that's what 
they do in Mob prosecutions to get a response from the true target. So 
you can sit there and get bled out—get indicted, go to grand juries—or 
you can fight it politically. Get it out of the law-and-order system where 
we are losing and are going to lose. A new DAG will review where we 
stand on this thing, which could take a couple of months. Delay, delay, 
delay—and shift it politically. Can we win? I have no fucking idea. But I 
know on that other path I'm going to lose. It's not perfect. . . but we live 
in a world of imperfect:' 
* * * 
Costa's story, which was posted online later that day, described Bannon as 
pitching a plan to West Wing aides and congressional allies to cripple the 
federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election, according 
to four people familiar with the discussions. But however many people 
Costa had spoken to about the background machinations of Steve Ban-
non, what mattered was that he had spoken directly and at length to 
Bannon himself, who was using the Washington Post to pitch a plan to 
the president. 
Bannon's three-part plan for Trump instantly made its way to the 
Oval Office. And the next morning, the president offered Kushner his 
view that he should fire Rosenstein, reinstate a claim of executive privi-
lege, and get a tough-guy lawyer. 
Kushner, pressing his own strategies, urged his father-in-law to move 
cautiously when it came to Rosenstein. 
Jared is spooked:' said a scornful Trump later that day while on the 
phone to a confidant. What a girl!

LAWYERS 
There was a running sweepstakes or office pool for the unhappiest 
person in the White House. Many had held the title, but one of the 
most frequent winners was White House counsel Don McGahn. He was 
a constant target for his boss's belittling, mocking, falsetto-voice mimicry, 
and, as well, sweeping disparagements of his purpose and usefulness. 
This is why we can't have nice things, McGahn uttered almost obses-
sively under his breath, quoting the Taylor Swift song to comment on 
whatever egregious act Trump had just committed (. . . because you break 
them, the song continues). 
McGahn's background was largely as a federal election lawyer. Mostly 
he was on the more-money, less-transparency side—he was against, rather 
than for, aggressive enforcement of election laws. He served as the counsel 
to the Trump campaign, arguably among the most careless about election 
law compliance in recent history. Before joining the Trump administra-
tion, McGahn had no White House or executive branch experience. He 
had never worked in the Justice Department or, in fact, anywhere in gov-
ernment. Formerly an attorney for a nonprofit affiliated with the Koch 
brothers, he was known as a hyperpartisan: when Obama's White House 
counsel, Kathy Ruemmler, the previous occupant of McGahn's office, 
reached out to congratulate him and to offer to be a resource on past prac-
tices, McGahn did not respond to her email. 
One of McGahn's jobs was to navigate what was possibly the most 
complicated relationship in modern government: he was the effective 
point person between the White House and the Department of Justice. 
Part of his portfolio, then, was to endure the president's constant rage and 
bewilderment about why the DOJ was personally hounding him, and his 
incomprehension that he could do nothing about it. 
It's my Justice Department:' Trump would tell McGahn, often repeat-
ing this more than dubious declaration in his signature triad. 
Nobody could quite be certain of the number of times McGahn had 
had to threaten, with greater or lesser intention, to quit if Trump made 
good on his threat to fire the attorney general, the deputy attorney gen-
eral, or the special counsel. Curiously, one defense against the charge that 
the president had tried to fire Mueller in June 2017 in an effort to end the 
special counsel's investigation—as the New York Times claimed in a Jan-
uary 2018 scoop—was the fact that Trump was almost constantly trying 
to fire Mueller or other DOJ figures, doing so often multiple times a day. 
McGahn's steadying hand had so far helped avert an ultimate crisis. 
But he had missed or let slip by or simply ignored a number of intemper-
ate, unwise, and interfering actions by the president that might, McGahn 
feared, comprise the basis of obstruction charges. Deeply involved with the 
conservative Federalist Society and its campaign for textualist judges: 
McGahn had long dreamed himself of becoming a federal judge him-
self, but given the no-man's-land he occupied between Trump and the 
Justice Department—not to mention Trump's sometimes daily attacks or 
the DOrs independence, which McGahn had to accept or condone—he 
knew his future as a jurist was dead. 
* * * 
Fifteen months into Trump's tenure, the tensions between the administra-
tion and the Department of Justice had erupted into open conflict. Now ii 
was war—the White House against its own DOJ. 
Here was a modern, post-Watergate paradox: the independence o: 
the Justice Department. The DOJ might be, from every organizationa 
and statutory view, an instrument of the White House, and, as much a; 
any other agency, its mission might appear to be driven by whoever hele 
40 MICHAEL WOLFF 
SIEGE 41 
the presidency. That's what it looked like on paper. But the opposite was 
true, too. There was a permanent-government class in the Justice Depart-
ment that believed an election ought to have no role at all in how the 
DOJ conducted itself. The department was outside politics and ought 
to be as blind as the courts. In this view, the Justice Department, as the 
nation's preeminent investigator and prosecutor, was as much a check on 
the White House, and ought to be as independent of the White House, 
as the other branches of government. (And within the Justice Department, 
the FBI claimed its own level of independence from its DOJ masters, as 
well as from the White House itself.) 
Even among those at Justice and the FBI who had a more nuanced 
view, and who recognized the symbiotic nature of the department's rela-
tionship with the White House, there was yet a strong sense of the lines 
that cannot be crossed. The Justice Department and the FBI had, since 
Watergate, found themselves accountable to Congress and the courts. Any 
top-down effort to influence an investigation, or any evidence of having 
bowed to influence—memorialized in a memo or email—might derail a 
career. 
In February 2018, Rachel Brand, the associate attorney general, a for-
mer Bush lawyer who had been nominated for the number three DOJ 
job by Obama, resigned to take a job as a Walmart lawyer. If Trump had 
fired Rosenstein during Brand's tenure, she would have become acting 
attorney general overseeing the Mueller investigation. She told col-
leagues she wanted to get out before Trump fired Rosenstein and then 
demanded that she fire Mueller. She would take Bentonville, Arkansas, 
where Walmart had its headquarters, over Washington, D.C. 
For a generation or more, the arm's-length relationship between the 
White House and the Department of Justice often seemed more like a 
never-ending conflict between armed camps. Bill Clinton could hardly 
stomach his attorney general, Janet Reno, having to weather the blowback 
from her decisions regarding Ruby Ridge, a standoff and deadly overre-
action between survivalists and the FBI; Waco, another botched standoff 
with a Christian cult; and the investigation of Dr. Wen Ho Lee, with the 
DOJ chastised for its reckless pursuit of a suspected spy. Clinton came 
very close to firing Louis Freeh, his FBI director, who openly criticized 
him, but managed to swallow his rage. Top people from the Bush White 
House, the FBI, and the Justice Department almost came to literal blows 
at the bedside of the ailing AG John Ashcroft—James Comey himself 
standing in the way of the White House representatives trying to get Ash-
croft to renew a domestic surveillance program—with the White House 
finally having to back down. Under Obama, Comey, who by then was the 
FBI director, made a further grab for the FBI's independence from the 
Justice Department when he unilaterally decided to end and later reopen 
the Hillary Clinton email investigation—and, by doing so, arguably toss-
ing the election to her opponent. 
Enter Donald Trump, who had neither political nor bureaucratic 
experience. His entire working life was spent at the head of what was in 
essence a small family operation, one designed to do what he wanted and 
to bow to his style of doing business. At the time of his election, he was 
absent even any theoretical knowledge of modern government and its 
operating rules and customs. 
Trump was constantly being lectured about the importance of cus-
tom and tradition at the Justice Department. As reliably, he would 
respond, I don't want to hear this bullshit! 
He needed, one aide observed, a hard, black line. Without a hard, 
black line that he can't cross, he's crossing it:' 
Trump believed what to him seemed obvious: the DOJ and FBI 
worked for him. They were under his direction and control. They must do 
exactly what he demanded of them; they must jump through his hoops. 
He reports to me! an irate and uncomprehending Trump repeated early 
in his tenure about both his attorney general Jeff Sessions and his FBI 
director James Comey. I am the boss! 
I could have made my brother the attorney general, Trump insisted, 
although in fact he did not even speak to his brother (Robert, a seventy-
one-year-old retired businessman). Like Kennedy. (Six years after John 
F. Kennedy appointed his brother Robert attorney general, Congress 
passed the Federal Anti-Nepotism Statute, called the Bobby Kennedy 
law, to prevent exactly this sort of thing in the future—although that 
did not stop Trump from hiring his daughter and son-in-law as senior 
advisers.)

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010972.txt,"CHAPTER 3: FOUNDATIONS

Historically, foundations and science itself emerge at the end of centuries of
practical application. A logical place for foundations in textbooks is the beginning. So
it was with Halliday and Resnick on physics, which began with Newton’s kinetics
(motion in time and space) and then this three laws. Only in the last chapter did the
authors remind us that Einstein later put two of these three into question, and even
the kinetics. Halliday and Resnick reasoned, correctly | think, that we sometimes
learn more efficiently by learning something slightly wrong first and fixing it later. |
will do that, in a sense, by reasoning first through free growth theory as if the Y=C +
] equation were true, and then again with the two corrections. The sometimes

counterintuitive logic of teaching and learning, including that, is “heuristics”.

Building on explicit axioms was common in economics throughout the classical
period running from Petty in the 17 century through Mill in the 19th. Then came
the major shift in focus, beginning in 1871, called the marginalist revolution. What
mattered was less our goals, and more the market mechanisms that aligned supply,
demand and price. The meeting point was the margin. Axioms about goals
disappeared, including the usual one of prioritizing survival and reproduction, and
axioms kept were usually left implicit. The implicit ones, essential to marginalism in
my view, included convergent tastes and predictions. I will make those two and

others explicit, and eventually add back the goals.

This book on the whole is about second-guessing what is taught. This chapter is
different. The nearest thing to a surprise in itis the idea that economics needs
explicit foundations in the sense of axioms and basic definitions and equations. All
the ones | choose are well accepted. Why | pick which should seem obvious in
hindsight. But some mini-surprises will accumulate. Why do I take such pains to
prove every feature of what everyone accepts already? Why all the boilerplate and
bulletproofing? I need them because I will later try to shoot down other beliefs

everyone accepts. We must know what is sound to find what is not.

Faced with this dynamic, it will be difficult for Fatah to maintain its
relationship with Israel. Indeed, Fatah could be forced to initiate an
intifada, something it would greatly prefer to avoid, as this would
undermine what economic development the West Bank has
experienced.

Israel therefore conceivably could face conflict in Gaza, a conflict
along the Lebanese border and a rising in the West Bank, something
it clearly knows. In a rare move, Israel announced plans to call up
reserves in September. Though preannouncements of such things are
not common, Israel wants to signal resolution.

Israel has two strategies in the face of the potential storm. One is a
devastating attack on Gaza followed by rotating forces to the north to
deal with Hezbollah and intense suppression of an intifada. Dealing
with Gaza fast and hard is the key if the intention is to abort the
evolution I laid out. But the problem here is that the three-front
scenario I laid out is simply a possibility; there is no certainty here. If
Israel initiates conflict in Gaza and fails, it risks making a possibility
into a certainty - and Israel has not had many stunning victories for
several decades. It could also create a crisis for Egypt's military
rulers, not something the Israelis want.

Israel also simply could absorb the attacks from Hamas to make Israel
appear the victim. But seeking sympathy is not likely to work given
how Palestinians have managed to shape global opinion. Moreover,
we would expect Hamas to repeat its attacks to the point that Israel
no longer could decline combat.

War thus benefits Hamas (even if Hamas maintains plausible
deniability by having others commit the attacks), a war Hezbollah has
good reason to enter at such a stage and that Fatah does not want but
could be forced into. Such a war could shift the Egyptian dynamic
significantly to Hamas' advantage, while Iran would certainly want al-
Assad to be able to say to Syrians that a war with Israel is no time for

several sitting rooms, a chef and other appertences of wealth and glamour. I spent much of the
trip conferring with Sheldon and his wife, Dr. Miriam Adelson, who is an expert in addiction and
the psychological problems associated with drug dependency. As we were about to land, I was
invited into the cockpit where I saw the Hoover Dam and other interesting sights on the approach
to Las Vegas. Upon arriving in Las Vegas I was taken to the Dr. Miriam and Sheldon Adelson
Educational Campus and shown around the school that they built in a suburb of Las Vegas. Then
I was picked up by Larry Ruvo, who wanted me to see the brain institute that architect Frank
Grary had built in Ruvo’s father’s memory. Ruvo credits me with helping to get this project
done, after the local university ran out of money and broke its agreement with him. I wrote a
strong letter on his behalf, and the result was an arrangement with the Cleveland Clinic, one of the
great medical institutions in the world. After touring the facility, I went to the Venetian Hotel
where I spoke on behalf of the Adelson Day School and was honored with a beautiful plaque
made from Jerusalem stone. The students of the school presented me with a book of drawings
that the students had done in my honor representing their views of justice. (Later that week, I
passed the book around to the college students in my seminar on morality.) At 10PM, I was
taken to the airport where the Adelsons smaller jet—a gulfstream—was waiting to fly me back to
New York where I arrived at 5:30AM.

Following a few hours of sleep in my New York apartment, I was picked up by a paralegal and

driven to Rikers Island where I spent the morning conferring with my client Gigi Jordan, who is
accused of murder. She had killed her autistic son and tried to kill herself after learning that her
child had been repeatedly abused, both sexually and physically by his biological father, and after
unsuccessfully seeking help from numerous government and social service agencies.

After returning from Rikers Island, I was driven to Brooklyn College, where my legal and
personal papers—more than a million of them in 1600 boxes—were being opened for public
viewing. I am contributing all of my papers to my alma matter. I made a talk about the papers
and my experiences at Brooklyn College to a crowd that included my wife and sons, old friends,
classmates, current and former faculty members, and current students. It was a thrilling
experience for me to go back more than half a century to the college that meant so much to me
and to express my appreciation to people who so influenced my life.

On Tuesday I appeared in New York State Supreme Court on behalf of my client Gigi Jordan and
made arguments in preparation for her trial. Following that court appearance, I boarded the
Acela train and went home for a good long night’s sleep.

On Wednesday morning I met with the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Luis
Moreno Ocampo, for breakfast. He had invited me to discuss with him a pending application of
the Palestinian Authority to be recognized as a state by the International Criminal Court in order
to bring charges against Israel for the war in Gaza and for building settlements in the West Bank.
We had a long and fruitful discussion.

I then went back to the law school where I prepared for my first class of the day—a legal ethics
course from | to 3PM. Before class I had a short lunch in the faculty dining room where I sat

pregnancy was sabotaged. The story of this sabotage and what followed is (briefly) this:

I've long-alleged that John and Avery Gunther (whose children | used to babysit) agreed to a quid
pro quo exchange of financial compensation for help destroying my credibility on behalf of IBM
against whom I'd filed a 2010 EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) charge and a
subsequent May 2011 civil suit.

Per the May 11, 2011 Complaint, McGuire v. John and Avery Gunther:

3. On April 6, 2011 Mr. and Mrs Gunther, with uncontrolled greed and total disregard for the rights
and feelings of Ms. Nadine McGuire as well as those of their children, AFG and XWG, maliciously
and with ill-intent, wrongfully completed and executed a Complaint and Motion for Preliminary
Injunction requesting formal protection against Ms. Nadine McGuire.

4. Over the course of the previous few months, Mr. and Mrs. Gunther, colluding with persons against
whom Ms. Nadine McGuire is currently furthering litigation, including but not limited to plaintiff's
mother, Pauline Scala McGuire, and from whom they received and/or have been promised to receive
monetary incentives, hid their relationships with said individuals, further lied about having those
relationships in direct conversation with Ms. Nadine McGuire and Court testimony on May 4, 2011,
and wrongfully completed and executed a Complaint and Motion for Preliminary Injunction against
Ms. Nadine McGuire in cooperation and collaboration with said persons, resulting in the issuance of
a Temporary Restraining Order against Ms. Nadine McGuire issued on April 6, 2011.

In regards to the suit against IBM (McGuire v. IBM, 1:11CV528, US District Court of Virginia), the
only suit in which Pauline Scala McGuire was listed as a defendant, the most important claim was
one of “assault” that led to the 2007 death of my son. Per the filing:

Plaintiff, Grace Nadine McGuire, realleges the allegations of paragraphs 1-65 hereof as if fully set
forth within and further alleges:

plaintiff by defendant Palmisano, and was undertaken deliberately and with actual malice towards

powerful: it’s all insider stuff. But the conversations at
Epstein’s are the conversations, I suspect, that rich men
dream of, but in the real world, such a buttoned-down
and agenda-driven place, are actually hard to have.

“That’s Jeffrey,” says Mort Zuckerman, (whose
paper, the Daily News, is ever vitriolic in its coverage of
Epstein), with a twinkle in his eye.

On Epstein’s part, there is the wink: In his Paris
apartment, 10,000 square feet on the Avenue Foch, a
neighborhood otherwise occupied by foreign potentates,
there is a stuffed baby elephant in his living room—that
is, the elephant in the room. (Epstein says too it’s a
reminder that elephants have 23 copies of tumor
suppressor genes and humans have only 1.) The single
book on his bedside table is Lolita (he is, beyond the
joke, a great Nobokov fan).

Epstein has a yet more structural explanation as to
why, after prison and with continuing tabloid infamy, he
can maintain his valued place. It comes back, not
unexpectedly, to the nature or the needs of money: “At a
certain level of finance, almost everyone is allied with
an institutional interest. You are part of government, or
you want to be in government, or you are connected to a

Following Epstein’s indictment, Reiter referred the case to the FBI to determine whether
the super-rich, super-connected defendant had violated any federal laws. Reiter won't
discuss the case or the broadsides aimed at him. But others almost uniformly use one
word to describe the chief: professional.

I have always been impressed by Mike's professionalism and his leadership, said Rick
Lincoln, chief of the Lantana Police Department and a Palm Beach County cop for 32
years. The town of Palm Beach has a very professional police department. We all
consider Mike to be our peer and a man of integrity. Juno Beach Police Chief H.C.
Clark II agreed. Although he doesn't know Reiter well, he has met with him on
countywide law enforcement issues. I've never seen him lose his cool. I've never seen
anything but a professional demeanor from him.

Reiter joined the Palm Beach Police Department in 1981, leaving a $20,000-a-year patrol
job at the University of Pittsburgh. His personnel jacket shows consistently excellent job
evaluations. Posh Palm Beach is no hotbed of crime, and in his first year on the job, a
resident confined to his home with a sick child thanked Reiter for delivering a few Cokes
to the house. Reiter refused payment for the beverages. Another resident thanked Reiter
for shutting off his car's headlights in his driveway, saying a valet must have been at
fault. Reiter worked everything from road patrol to organized crime, vice and narcotics.
And he's no novice at investigations involving the island's rich and famous. He was the
lead detective probing the drug overdose death of David Kennedy in 1984. He also was
one of the officers who worked the investigation of William Kennedy Smith, who was
charged in 1991 — and later acquitted — with raping a woman at the Kennedy family
compound in Palm Beach.

Reiter, who has a master's degree in human resource development from Palm Beach
Atlantic University, also has attended the FBI National Academy in Quantico, Va., and
management courses at Harvard. He's been active in countywide interagency law
enforcement organizations and has a top secret national security clearance.

He has a perspective that's broader than just addressing the needs of the town, said
Town Manager Peter

Elwell, who promoted Reiter from assistant chief to chief in March 2001. Reiter makes
more than $144,000 as the town's top cop. Elwell thinks he's worth it. He's very
businesslike, very straightforward. He's not easily agitated or flamboyant. He's about the
work, Elwell said. I think that his service as chief has been outstanding in five-plus
years.

time. The local population had, after all, been under other occupation powers
before 1967: Jordan in the West Bank, and Egypt in Gaza. Assuming our
administration was less onerous, most Israelis believed a way to coexist could
be found. And that sooner or later, there would be a land-for-peace agreement
and we would withdraw from at least most of the territory. But as the years
passed, with no sign of a willingness by the PLO to consider any kind of peace
talks, we made the cardinal error of assuming the occupation was sustainable.
Yes, there might be periods of violence, but nothing that a combination of
political resolve, arrests, detention and, where necessary, military force could
not hold in check. For us, and certainly for me, the Palestinians became
essentially a security issue. As one of Israel’s finest novelists, David Grossman,
would lay bare in a bestselling book of reportage called The Yellow Wind, about
a year into the intifada, we had ceased to see the human effects of 20 years of
occupation, not only on the Palestinians but on Israeli society as well.

Yet the power of Professor Shamir’s presentation lay not so much 1n its
novelty as its succinctness, clarity and, above all, its timing. The rioting had
already gone on for longer than any of us had expected. It seemed to be
gathering strength. But until our meeting, we were still looking at it essentially
as a civil disturbance. 7hat was what began to change, for all of us.

What didn’t change was the need to try to bring the violence to an end. Dan
immediately put me in charge of looking for alternatives to live ammunition. I
began with our own research and development engineers. We also asked military
attachés in our embassies to talk to law-enforcement agencies, academics, or
anyone else with knowledge of non-lethal methods of crowd control overseas.
Some of the more far-flung examples seemed promising, at least until further
investigation. South Korea had years of experience in confronting student
protests — generally, though not always, managing to avoid fatalities. But it
turned out this typically involved sending in serried rows of up to 25,000 riot
police against a few thousand campus protesters. Besides the fact we’d have
needed an army the size of the Americans’ to field enough soldiers, it was absurd
to imagine dealing with dozens of far-flung confrontations on any given day with
parade-ground formations of troops.

We looked at anything that seemed it might work. In the early stages, most
of the attacks involved rocks and bottles. Our R&D engineers developed a Jeep-
mounted “gravel gun” that fired stones at a distance of up to 250 feet. They
could cause injuries, but weren’t lethal. We acquired launchers for pepper spray

morality emerged, a different structure to society. Of course all the other
parts of society remained the same. People paid their taxes and went
about their lives normally; only the traffic behavior was affected.

Afghanistan has had most of its social structures removed over the
last forty or so years. First the Soviets, and then the Taliban, took apart
much of the fabric until finally the Allied Forces swept the Taliban out,
leaving very little behind. There were no police or courts, and few laws

— or at least none enforced by the rule of law. The Allied Forces have
spent a decade rebuilding these structures. Before we examine Masters’
presentation, let’s look at the daily life of an Afghan farmer.

If you are an Afghan farmer you have a dilemma. Your most reliable
crop is opium. It grows well in the arid soil, does not require irrigation, and
is resistant to most pests. For this crop there is a financial infrastructure
to rival the Chicago Commodities Exchange. You get interest free loans
secured against the crop, and you can forward sell your product on a
futures market. Your investors can ‘add value’ by dealing with the major
pest — the US military. They do this through the simple expedience of
taking pot shots at them if they get too close to the crop. Since a field of
opium is worth $30,000 and a militia wage for the year is $350, you can
easily employ a few men to protect your investment. Of course, you are
indebted to thugs and criminals, but they are at least reliable thugs and
criminals.

On the other hand, the traditional products of the Himalayas -
walnuts, pomegranates and vines — need years to cultivate. There is no
forward market and the timescales over which you must take risks are
far greater. If you believe your American protectors will leave before the
crops mature, you will be loath to plant and care for them. But, if you
make the decision to take this risk, you have a strong incentive to foster
stability and reap the rewards of your effort. There is a feedback effect:
the balance of power between all the different parties is important to the
decisions you make, and the decisions you make affect your desire to
invest in future stability.

Masters’ team built a slide pack to demonstrate the complex
interactions between the groups: farmers, security, stability, markets,
military power, and emerging institutions. The COIN - COunter
INsurgency — dynamics slide shows just how hard it is to communicate
complex topics between human beings. The presentation is beautifully
crafted but it was a public relations disaster. At the end of the presentation
General McChrystal said jokingly, “When we understand that slide, we
will have won the war.” The slide was paraded in the press as, “the most
complicated PowerPoint slide in history.”

brad, leon.

After I spoke to you both, I excused myself from a dinner with some heads of state to walk into the
bathroom to make some calls re 8865. I wondered whether any group that we could assert had control
had filed in the past years. I called Fenn and he told me- yes.???!! he said that on friday , for the first
time he learned that AGM was not delinquent at all. and had filed. !!_| I asked why no one had ever told
me or given me the purported justification for no filings in the past for the founders. and he said Well,
sorry , it was discussed on fridays call. ? the calli was not on . not invited to ,the call wechsler didnt
listen in and joslin didnt transmit , if itis true. Im also now told there is a note from Deloitte re 13 and
14 that says the founders DO NOT have to file. but fenn could not tell me who wrote it and said
Deloitte says to ignore it. , that s why they are pushing now.

steps 1 8865 has many exemptions for filing. let see if we can find one . ( an elegant position might be
josh and agm if he is panicked and leave us out ). The requirments are FACT specific , so without the
facts we still have nothing. fenn said he has now put someone on it

2 leon, I suggest need to focus on 1040 , 2015. , we may even consider filing the minimum
8865 , and wait until we are sure of our specific requirements, and file an amendment for 15 as well as

I concluded my article with the following words:

President Clinton’s visit was entirely in keeping with President George Washington’s letter
to the Jews of Newport, Rhode Island, in which he wrote that mere “toleration” is not
good enough in America. Here, Jews as well as others, must be treated as equals. The
attendance of our president and first lady at a Jewish service made many Jews feel like
first-class citizens, rather than tolerated guests.

I sent the President a copy of my article. He sent back a handwritten note expressing his
appreciation for being invited to the services and for the article, and included a signed photograph
of the dinner.

During the subsequent summers, the Clintons vacationed in Martha’s Vineyard and lived right
near us. We frequently dined, partied and even square danced with them and became their
friends. We were invited to the White House on several occasions and the President sought my
advice from time to time.

Sometimes, I offered unsolicited advice, such as when I repeatedly urged him to commute the life
sentence of Jonathan Pollard to time served. I pestered him so much about Pollard that he finally
told me he didn’t want to hear anything more about it. I replied, “You can choose not to listen,
but I’m not going to stay quiet.” In the end, he wanted to commute the sentence, but he got push-
back not only from the intelligence community but also from several Jewish senators. He told me
that if I can’t even get the Jewish senators to support commutation, how could he justify it to the
intelligence community, which was adamantly opposed to it.

Another issue on which I initially offered my unsolicited advice involved the Monica Lewinsky
matter. As I watched the Lewinsky drama unfold, I saw a familiar pattern that had had gotten
many other celebrities into trouble: opting for short term gratification without considering the

longer term consequences.

At every decision point, the President and his advisors opted for a political tactic that helped them
get good headlines and poll results in the short term, rather than focusing on the longer term
strategy that might have prevented an entirely lawful sexual indiscretion from turning into a
possible crime.

The first — and most important — point was the President’s foolhardy decision to engage in a
surreptitious sexual relationship with a White House intern at a time when he knew he was under
intense investigation by Kenneth Starr, a somewhat puritanical prosecutor and was subject to a
lawsuit for sexual harassment by a vindictive woman who was represented by politically
motivated lawyers.

If there was indeed a “right wing conspiracy” out there waiting to “get” the President, as Hillary

Clinton had alleged in a television interview, it is difficult to imagine any action more reckless
than oval office sex with a young blabbermouth whose goal was probably as much to brag about

any interview that he ever gave in Moscow under Russian protec-
tion, but he had similar access to NSA operations against Russia in
his job at the NSA’s Threat Operations Center.

The enormous power of the NSA rested in its ability to keep its
sources and methods secret from its foes. A queen on the chess-
board could be captured by a lowly pawn if it was well-placed. In
this case, the person who had it in his power to expose the NSA’s
critical sources and methods would no doubt be considered fair game
by America’s adversaries, including the Chinese and Russian cyber
services. Indeed, how could they resist such a prize?

Snowden might have believed that he was in control, but the CIA
believed that confidence was misinformed. “Snowden thinks he is
smart,” Morell said, after reviewing the case on a panel appointed
by President Obama, “but he was never in a position in his previous
jobs to fully understand the immense capabilities of our Russian and
Chinese counterparts.” He could adopt a cocky tone in his postmor-
tem conversations with journalists in Moscow, but in truth he had
no means to block the efforts of the Chinese or Russian services in

© Hong Kong. Even before Snowden contacted its diplomats in Hong ©
Kong, the Russian intelligence service would swing into action to
determine his intelligence value.

How many days he planned to be in Hong Kong depended on how
speedily he could arrange a meeting with journalists. “The purpose of
my [Hong Kong] mission was to get the information to journalists,”
he told the editor of The Guardian after he was safely ensconced in
Moscow. He indicates that he was working under a tight clock. The
time pressure resulted in his e-mailing an ultimatum to Gellman on
May 24: either Gellman would publish the selected documents in
The Washington Post within seventy-two hours, or he would lose
the exclusive scoop. Snowden wanted the story to break on May 27,
without his true identity (which Gellman did not know) attached to
it. His identity would be known to a foreign mission in Hong Kong if
Gellman acceded to his demands, because, as previously mentioned,
Gellman’s story would enclose an encoded signal he planned to use
as proof of his bona fides. So even before the Guardian reporters had
agreed to come to Hong Kong, Snowden had plans to deal with a
foreign mission. If the Post had accepted his terms, Snowden would

If I decline someone and they persist, give them one more reply —“Tim appreciates the persistence,
but he really can’t...” etc.—and then archive future requests. Use your judgment, of course, but
that’s the general rule. Some people don’t know when persistent turns into plain irritating.

Please also create a rule to respond with “scheduled” for all items I send to be put in the calendar
(when they’re put in the calendar). Missing calendar items can cause big problems, so this is a
check and balance to confirm.

No need to follow up with someone after a call has taken place unless Tim instructs otherwise, or
they request something from us.

Send all speaking requests to XX XX and ensure that he confirms receipt. (However, also see items
38 and 39).

Foreign language requests (i.e., purchasing rights, if the book is available in a particular language,
etc.) send to [the appropriate person at my publisher].

XXXX’s replacement at Random House is XXXX.
Inquire with Tim first before booking any speaking gigs on a specific date, as he may be traveling.

When booking appointments in the calendar, be sure to also ask which topics they would like to
discuss, and put them in the calendar description for Tim so he can prepare. Also be sure to ask for
a backup phone number in case they are not able to reach Tim. [I almost always have people call
me unless I am abroad, as this is another safeguard against missing appointments. ]

Put initials in the subject line of calendar events so we know who (which virtual assistant) put the
item in the calendar.

Prepare inquiries for Tim before sending to him for his review, i.e., get their Alexa ranking,
possible dates of the event, a link to past events they have held, their budget, other confirmed
speakers, etc. Then send this info to Tim for his review.

Respond to PX Method inquiries with the following response:
Hi [name],

Thanks for your inquiry about the PX Method, however the PX Method page is designed as just
a template others can look at as a reference for testing their own product ideas.

We are not sure if or when Tim will offer the PX Method for sale, but there are no plans at this
time. We appreciate your inquiry nonetheless. Thanks!

up page and thus attempt to order a product that isn’t ready to ship.]

the event is April X and X, 20XX in Portland, Oregon [for example]. Before I present this to Tim,

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016258.txt,"In analog computing, complexity resides in network topology, not in code.
Information is processed as continuous functions of values such as voltage and relative
pulse frequency rather than by logical operations on discrete strings of bits. Digital
computing, intolerant of error or ambiguity, depends upon error correction at every step
along the way. Analog computing tolerates errors, allowing you to live with them.

Nature uses digital coding for the storage, replication, and recombination of
sequences of nucleotides, but relies on analog computing, running on nervous systems,
for intelligence and control. The genetic system in every living cell is a stored-program
computer. Brains aren’t.

Digital computers execute transformations between two species of bits: bits
representing differences in space and bits representing differences in time. The
transformations between these two forms of information, sequence and structure, are
governed by the computer’s programming, and as long as computers require human
programmers, we retain control.

Analog computers also mediate transformations between two forms of
information: structure in space and behavior in time. There is no code and no
programming. Somehow—and we don’t fully understand how—Nature evolved analog
computers known as nervous systems, which embody information absorbed from the
world. They learn. One of the things they learn is control. They learn to control their
own behavior, and they learn to control their environment to the extent that they can.

Computer science has a long history—going back to before there even was
computer science—of implementing neural networks, but for the most part these have
been simulations of neural networks by digital computers, not neural networks as evolved
in the wild by Nature herself. This is starting to change: from the bottom up, as the
threefold drivers of drone warfare, autonomous vehicles, and cell phones push the
development of neuromorphic microprocessors that implement actual neural networks,
rather than simulations of neural networks, directly in silicon (and other potential
substrates); and from the top down, as our largest and most successful enterprises
increasingly turn to analog computation in their infiltration and control of the world.

While we argue about the intelligence of digital computers, analog computing 1s
quietly supervening upon the digital, in the same way that analog components like
vacuum tubes were repurposed to build digital computers in the aftermath of World War
II. Individually deterministic finite-state processors, running finite codes, are forming
large-scale, nondeterministic, non-finite-state metazoan organisms running wild in the
real world. The resulting hybrid analog/digital systems treat streams of bits collectively,
the way the flow of electrons is treated in a vacuum tube, rather than individually, as bits
are treated by the discrete-state devices generating the flow. Bits are the new electrons.
Analog is back, and its nature is to assume control.

Governing everything from the flow of goods to the flow of traffic to the flow of
ideas, these systems operate statistically, as pulse-frequency coded information is
processed in a neuron or a brain. The emergence of intelligence gets the attention of
Homo sapiens, but what we should be worried about is the emergence of control.

Books and newspaper accounts of Trump's 45 years in business were full of his 
shady dealings, and the presidency had only helped to highlight them and to surface even 
juicier ones. Real estate was the world's favorite money laundering currency and Trump's 
B-level real estate business was quite explicitly designed to appeal to money launderers. 
What's more, Trump's own financial woes, and desperate efforts to maintain billionaire 
lifestyle, cache, and market viability, forced him into constant and unsubtle 
schemes. Practically speaking, you couldn't miss him, as the Mueller investigation 
appeared to be finding. 
In November 2004, for instance, Jeffrey Epstein, the financier later caught in a scandal 
involving under-age prostitutes, agreed to buy out of bankruptcy a house in Palm Beach, 
Florida for $30 million—a house that had been on the market for two years. Epstein and 
Trump had been close friends—playboys in arms, as it were—for more than a decade, 
with Epstein often counseling Trump on his chaotic financial affairs. Epstein took Trump 
to see the Palm Beach house to advise him on construction issues involved with moving a 
swimming pool. As he prepared to finalize his deal for the house, an incredulous Epstein 
saw a severely cash-constrained Trump bid $41 million for the property, buying it through 
an entity called Trump Properties LLC, financed by Deutsche Bank. Trump, Epstein knew, 
had been renting his name, telling Epstein he ought to do the same—that is, for an ample 
fee, Trump was willing to serve as a front man to disguise the actual ownership in a real 
estate transaction. (This was, in effect, just another variation of Trump's basic business 
model of licensing his name for commercial properties owned by someone else.) A furious 
Epstein, suspecting that the real owner was a Russian oligarch, who Trump knew, Dmitry 
Rybolovlev—part of the close Putin circle of government-aligned industrialists in Russia—
threatened to expose the deal, then getting extensive scrutiny in Florida papers. The fight 
became all the more bitter when, two months later, the house was put on the market for 
$125 million. Well known to Trump, who often saw Epstein at his current Palm Beach 
house, Epstein was visited almost every day, and had been for many years, by girls who he 
paid for massages with happy endings—girls recruited from local restaurants, strip clubs, 
and, also, Trump's Mar-a-Lago. Just as the threats and enmity of the two friends increased 
over the house sale, Epstein found himself under investigation by local Palm Beach police. 
Epstein's legal problems vastly escalated as the house, with only minor improvements, 
was bought for $96 million by Dmitry Rybolovlev. That is, Trump had either miraculously 
earned $55 million, without putting up a dime, or Rybolovlev, or someone such as 
Rybolovlev, paid Trump Properties, LLC—actual owner unknown—$96 million, thereby 
providing a clean payment of $55 million to someone. Rybolovlev might have, in effect, 
paid himself for the house, thereby cleansing the money. Epstein, on his part, would spend 
12 months in jail on a prostitution charge.

After the election, when Bannon was introduced to Epstein, Bannon told him, You were 
the one person I was truly afraid of coming forward during the campaign. 
And rightly so, said Epstein.

on the campuses of its universities. Its hierarchy is also obscure.
Few traces have been uncovered of any conventional espionage net-
works in the United States, and no major Chinese spy has ever been
arrested. Part of the reason that Chinese espionage has proved so elu-
sive to the eyes of Western counterintelligence is that, unlike Russia,
it did not ordinarily rely on intelligence officers in its embassies to
recruit penetration agents to steal secrets. It did not even have an
embassy in the United States during most of the Cold War. Instead,
its services specialize in mosaics of intelligence assembled from a
wide variety of sources, including nonclassified documents, return-
ing graduate students, scientific conferences, exchanges with allies,
and a vast operation of hacking into computers, or cyber espionage.

Such espionage is indeed a vast enterprise in China. Graduating
over 150,000 computer science engineers in the 1990s, it had no
shortage of personnel. It had also developed the cyber tool kit to gain
access to the computer networks of U.S. government contractors and
consultants in the private sector and government agencies, planting
“sleeper” bugs in networked computers. Like human sleeper agents,

© these hidden programs can be activated when needed for operational ©
purposes. Chinese controllers can often retrieve e-mails and docu-
ments and can turn on the cameras and microphones of personal
computers, tablets, and smart phones.

By 2007, Paul Strassmann, a top U.S. defense expert on cyber
espionage, reported that China had inserted “zombie” programs in
some 700,000 computers in the United States, which could be used to
mount cyber attacks to retrieve e-mails from other computers. The
Chinese service also reportedly penetrated companies that provide
Internet services, including Google, Yahoo!, Symantec, and Adobe,
which allowed it to track e-mails and enclosures of individuals. With
such an invisible army of zombie computers, it is not entirely sur-
prising that China finds little need to employ human sleeper agents.

Chinese cyber specialists used this capability to hack into the
computers of outside contractors, including Booz Allen and other
companies that supplied technologists to the NSA. It also had nota-
ble successes in obtaining the dossiers of U.S. employees and inde-
pendent contractors at the NSA, the CIA, and other intelligence
services. Its intrusions, as previously noted, into computer networks

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014006.txt,"mail Again

y hat if you never had to check e-mail again? If you could hire someone else to spend countless

hours in your inbox instead of you?

This isn’t pure fantasy. For the last 12 months, I’ve experimented with removing myself from the
inbox entirely by training other people to behave like me. Not to imitate me, but to think like me.

Here’s the upshot: I get more than 1,000 e-mails a day from various accounts.®2 Rather than spending
6-8 hours per day checking e-mail, which I used to do, I can skip reading e-mail altogether for days or
even weeks at a time ... all within 4-10 minutes a night.

Let me explain the basics, followed by tips and exact templates for outsourcing your own inbox.

1. I have multiple e-mail addresses for specific types of e-mail (blog readers vs. media vs.
friends/family, etc.). tim@ ... is the default I give to new acquaintances, which goes to my assistant.

2. 99% of e-mail falls into predetermined categories of inquiries with set questions or responses (my
“rules” document is at the bottom of this post—feel free to steal, adapt, and use). My assistant(s) checks
and clears the inbox at 11 A.M. and 3 P.M. pst.

3. For the 1% of e-mail that might require my input for next actions, I have a once-daily phone call of
4—10 minutes at 4 P.M. pst with my assistant.

4. If ’'m busy or traveling abroad, my assistant leaves the action items in numerical order on my
voicemail, which I can respond to in a bullet-point e-mail. These days, I actually prefer the voice-mail
option and find that it forces my assistant to be more prepared and more concise.

Each night (or early the next morning), [Il listen to my assistant’s voicemail via Skype and
simultaneously write out the next actions (1. Bob: Tell him that ... 2. Jose in Peru: Ask him for ... 3.
Speaking in NC: Confirm ..., etc.) in a Skype chat or quick e-mail. How long does the new system take?
4—10 minutes instead of 6-8 hours of filtering and repetitive responses.

If you only have one e-mail account, I recommend using a desktop program like Outlook or Mail
instead of a web-based program like Gmail for a simple reason: If you see new items in your inbox,
you'll check them. Like they say in AA: If you don’t want to slip, don’t go where it’s slippery. This is
why I have a private personal account that I use for sending e-mail to my assistant and communicating
with friends. It’s almost always empty.

E-mail is the last thing people let go of. Fortune 500 CEOs, best-selling authors, celebrities —I know
dozens of top performers who delegate everything but e-mail, which they latch onto as something only
they can do. “No one can check my e-mail for me” is the unquestioned assumption, or “I answer every
e-mail I receive” is the unquestioned bragging right that keeps them in front of a computer for 8-12
hours at a stretch. It’s not fun, and it keeps them from higher-impact or more rewarding activities.

Get over yourself. I had to. Checking e-mail isn’t some amazing skill that you alone possess.

In fact, checking e-mail is like everything else: a process.

How you evaluate and handle (delete vs. archive vs. forward vs. respond) e-mail is just a series of
questions you ask yourself, whether consciously or subconsciously. I have a document called “Tim
Ferriss Processing Rules,” to which my assistants add rules when I send them a note via e-mail with
“ADD TO RULES” in the subject. Over the course of a week or two with a virtual assistant (VA), you
will end up with an externalized set of rules that reflect how your brain processes e-mail. It often shows
you how haphazard your processing is. I’ve included my “rules” here to save you some time. A few tips:

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015989.txt,"Creativity 299
ANSWER WITHOUT READING ON

This is the classic test of creativity developed by J.P. Guilford in 1967.
It is called the Alternative Uses Task. You can try the task with many
objects: bricks, chairs, even water. How did you do on your first attempt?
8 to 10 uses is about average, 20 is extremely good. It’s possible to teach
most people to get near twenty and [ll show you how to do this in a
moment.

Another test of idea generation is to draw 30 things in 30 circles.
Thirty is such a large number it forces us to come up with some nutty
ideas and break our natural tendency to self-censor.

For example, I'd like you to create logos or logo ideas, for a new
coffee company in your circles. The test is best done without a time limit
so now is the time to break off reading and make yourself a coffee. Then
come back and draw 30 circles on a piece of paper. Fill in the circles.

MAKE A COFFEE, THEN START DRAWING.

The aim of brainstorming is to remove our inhibitions and get us
to generate a mass of ideas. In normal life, we tend to suppress ideas
even before we are consciously aware of them. Sir Ken Robinson has
researched creativity in children and found the ability to brainstorm
reduces linearly with age. At five or six, children given one of these
divergent thinking tasks come up with many creative solutions: fold the
paper clip into a dinosaur, and use it to attack your friends, get two and
use them as chop sticks. As adults, we tend to disqualify ideas. You could
never fold a paperclip that tightly or accurately, we said, “a” paper clip
not two. But, you can fold a paper clip tightly, and the room you are
doing the test in has thirty paper clips and thirty people in it so just team
up with a friend. I never said this was a solo task!

Do you see how you impose nonexistent rules on your thinking,
particularly the implied rule of not working with others? I did not say
this test was subject to examination conditions. The first twenty years of
our lives teaches us to work alone on intellectual tasks, yet when we get
to the workplace we can, and indeed must collaborate to succeed. Now
you have an idea how to ace the paper clip test: don’t censor yourself and
don't imply rules I have not imposed!

several dozen remained inside.

I was in Europe at the time, on one of my periodic trips to discuss Middle
East issues with a fellow intelligence chief. Yet an aide called me with the news.
I was several thousand miles away from what happening. But I knew there was
every possibility Sayeret Matkal might be called in, and my instincts told me we
should proceed with caution. The situation we were facing felt nothing like
Sabena, much less Entebbe. Here, we had a single bus. Our troops, and in fact
everyone from ministers and officials to reporters and photographers, were in a
loose cordon a couple of dozen yards away. That said to me there was no sense
that the hijackers posed an immediate danger. Nor did they seem to have come
equipped for a major confrontation. In place of the AK-47s and grenades we’d
seen in previous terror attacks, these guys had knives, and, if they were to be
believed, a couple of shells with no obvious way to detonate them.

I phoned a friend in the command post set up near the stranded bus. He told
me that Misha and Moshe Vechetzi were there. There was a standoff with the
terrorists and, for now, it was quiet. The defense minister and the chief-of-staff,
of course, did not need my presence, much less my agreement, to order the
sayeret into action. But I said: why not wait? Though the last flights back to
Israel had already left, I could be at the command post by mid-morning. Beyond
wanting to be present if the sayeret was ordered in, I believed the crisis might
even be brought to an end without another shot being fired. “III tell them what
you said,” my friend replied. “But I doubt it’Il be allowed to drag on much past
daybreak.”

He was right. With my Chinese Farm comrade Yitzhik Mordechai in overall
command, Sayeret Matkal stormed the bus at about seven in the morning. They
shot and killed two of the hijackers immediately, through the vehicle’s windows.
Sadly one of the passengers, a young woman soldier, died in the assault, but the
rest of the hostages were freed, none with serious injuries.

A controversy soon erupted over what came next. The sayeret commandos
had captured the other two terrorists alive and uninjured. Yet barely a week later,
first in an American newspaper and then the Israeli media, reports emerged that
the two surviving Palestinians had been killed after the hijacking was over. A
year later, Yitzhik Mordechai was — wrongly — put on trial for his alleged part in
what had amounted to a summary execution. And, rightly, exonerated. Though
the full details never became public, the people responsible turned out to be from
the Shin Bet, our equivalent of the FBI.

Too Young To Consent?

Under the law, can a rape occur even when both parties consent and even when the alleged victim
is eager to engage in the sexual activity? The answer to this question is also yes. This is so
because every state has a statutory age of consent, and anyone below that age (girl or boy) is
irrefutably deemed incapable of consenting even if she initiated the encounter and was sexually
experienced. The age of consent varies from state to state and from country to country. In some
places, it is as low as fourteen; in other places, it is as high as eighteen. In some states, the age of
the alleged rapist is also relevant. Under these “Romeo and Juliet” statutes, consensual sex
between people of approximately the same age is not rape even if one of them is below the age of
consent.

May contemporary commentators believe that the age of consent statutes in states that place it as
high as 17 or 18 are unrealistic, since a large percentage of teenagers become sexually active at
lower ages. Setting the age of consent higher than the norm accords prosecutors enormous
discretion to pick and choose whom to prosecute among the many violators. I worked on such a
case recently

My client in this case lived in a state in which the age of consent was seventeen, had a home in a
country where the age of consent was fourteen, and also had a home in a state where the age of
consent was eighteen. Unfortunately for him the sexual encounter for which he was charged took
place in the state where the age of consent was 18. It was also a state in which the age when
most teenagers became sexually active was far lower than 18.

My client was a wealthy businessman and philanthropist, who was single, middle-aged, and had
many young girlfriends. He loved receiving massages, and his preference was to be massaged by
young women in their late teen years. (He was not a pedophile, and had absolutely no interest in
prepubescent girls).

My client had a large home with a swimming pool at which he liked to entertain willing young
women who often sunbathed and swam topless. No crime there. His assistant arranged for the
young women who would come and give him massages, which sometimes ended happily. The
young women were paid for the services they rendered, which sometimes included some
touching, but nothing beyond that. The assistant was instructed to ask for ID for each of the
masseuses and to be certain they were all over eighteen. Because he paid handsomely for services
— $200 for half an hour — young women were eager to provide them, and a few of them presented
false IDs to conceal the fact that they were not quite 18. Some of them already worked as
masseuses in what were euphemistically called “jack shacks,” where they were paid to provide
happy endings to massage customers. Others worked as strippers. And several were prostitutes
who paid for their drug habits by selling their bodies for sex. None was sexually inexperienced.

One day, the wife of a policeman overheard their seventeen-year-old daughter talking on the
phone about giving a massage to a middle-aged man. The policeman reported the incident to his
chief, who then began a full-scale investigation.

‘holocausts.’ Adding insult to injury, the same delegates requested that the phrase ‘and
the ethnic cleansing of the Arab population in historic Palestine’ be inserted after the
appearance of ‘holocausts.’

Each time...language on anti-Semitism and the need to combat it was raised in the
plenary, the OIC states intervened to couple anti-Semitism with the phrase ‘racist
practices of Zionism,’ or even more outlandish ‘Zionist practices against Semitism’”—a
deliberate move to confuse the real meaning of anti-Semitism.

A second “Durban Conference” was held in Geneva in 2009. Although the U.S., Canada, Italy
and several other countries boycotted what had by this time become clear would be another hate
conference, I decided to travel to Geneva in an effort to restore the human rights agenda to its
proper priorities, or if that wasn’t possible, to expose the UN Human Rights Council for what it
has become—an enemy of neutral and universal human rights. It would be an uphill fight because
the primary speaker invited to address the second Durban Conference was Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad, the Holocaust-denying President of Iran.

I worked with several genuine human rights organizations in an effort to shame the Human Rights
Council into broadening its agenda to include the genocides in Africa and other serious human
rights abuses around the globe. We brought real victims of human rights abuses from Rwanda,
Darfur and other locations where genocides had been ignored, or even facilitated, by the U.N.

We conducted a parallel human rights conference in which we took testimony from these ignored
victims and witnesses, to whom the U.N. had refused to listen. I also delivered an address on the
inversion of “human rights” and “human wrongs.”

As it turned out, I was staying in the same hotel as Ahmadinejad. My wife and I were having a
pleasant drink in the lobby bar, when Ahmadinejad and his entourage paraded through the lobby.
He looked at us and smiled. I approached one of his handlers and introduced myself. I told him
that I would like to challenge the President to a debate about the Holocaust. He asked, “where,
at Harvard?” Ahmadinejad had previously spoken at Columbia University and I suspected that he
might welcome an invitation from Harvard and the platform such as an event would accord him. I
replied, “No, the debate should be at Auschwitz; that’s where the evidence is.” He said he would
communicate my offer to the president, who, he told me, was on the way to a press conference on
the Mezzanine floor of the hotel. I went to the press conference and tried to ask Ahmadinejad
whether he would debate me at Auschwitz. I was immediately hauled off by the Swiss police,
removed from the hotel and told I would not be allowed to return “for security reasons.” I
insisted that “security reasons” did not justify protecting the President from a hostile question, but
they told me that my belongings would be removed from my room and my key changed. I

match, if not outdo, the impact of 9/11. Zawahiri, by contrast, favored
an opportunistic strategy of smaller strikes.

e Bin Laden was a hands-on chief executive, with a role in operations
planning and personnel decisions, rather than the detached senior
leader that U.S. analysts had hypothesized. Zawahiri, whom the
analysts had imagined as the day-to-day leader, was actually quite
isolated — and remains so, despite a dozen communications this
year. Zawahiri suffers from mistrust between his Egyptian faction of
al-Qaeda and other operatives, such as Atiyah.

eBin Laden was suffering badly from drone attacks on al-Qaeda’s
base in the tribal areas of Pakistan. He called this the “intelligence
war,” and said it was “the only weapon that’s hurting us.” His cadres
complained that they couldn’t train in the tribal areas, couldn’t
communicate, couldn’t travel easily and couldn’t draw new recruits
to what amounted to a free-fire zone. Bin Laden discussed moving al-
Qaeda’s base to another location, but he never took action.

Analysts did not find in the material any smoking gun to suggest
Pakistani government complicity in bin Laden’s presence in
Abbottabad. And it’s clear he was paranoid about being found and
killed: He ordered his subordinates to restrict movements to help
preserve what remained of al-Qaeda in Pakistan. Fear of being
discovered was a subject of regular conversation between bin Laden,
Atiyah, Zawahiri and others.

Bin Laden also worried that al-

Qaeda’s status among Muslims was dwindling, and that the West had
at least partially succeeded in distancing al-Qaeda’s message from
core Islamic values. Concerned about this eroding base, bin Laden
counseled affiliates in North Africa and Yemen to hold back on their
efforts to develop a local Islamic extremist state in favor of attacking
the United States and its interests.

MTV, VH1, CMT, BET, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr, Comedy Central, TV Land, SPIKE, and more. Do these sound
like brands that are likely to suffer? No. Viacom, Inc. (VIA) is a profitable company that pays a small dividend.
On the other hand, a debt-to-equity ratio of 3.88 isn’t comforting.

Time Warner

Time Warner Inc. (TWX) has 165 channels across 200 countries. This includes HBO. In FY2014, revenue

increased 3%. That’s not spectacular, but adjusted EPS jumped 18%, which now represents six consecutive
years of adjusted EPS growth in the high teens. Time Warner also returned $6.6 billion to shareholders via

dividends and buybacks throughout the year. Over the long haul, cable companies will have a difficult time
competing against streaming services, but all is okay for right now.

Scripps Networks Interactive

Among Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.'s (SNI) properties are Home and Garden Television, Food Network,
Travel Channel, DIY Network, Cooking Channel and Great American Country. These are strong brands. Strong
enough that Scripps Networks expects FY2015 revenue to increase approximately 4%. The company also
expects selling, general, and administrative expenses to come in between flat and down 2%. Either way, it’s a
positive when revenue is outpacing SG&A expenses. Furthermore, Scripps Networks has announced that it’s
adding $1 billion to its share buyback program and increasing its dividend by 15%. The risk here is the stock’s
sensitivity to broader market corrections. (For a look back to 2009, see: Scripps Network Interactive Worth a
Look.)

Performance Comparisons

Another reason why some stocks made the top list and others did not is performance. If a stock can’t appreciate
in a bull market, then how would you expect it to perform when the trend reverses? Capital preservation should
be the number one priority for a savvy investor. Below are total return numbers for each company as of
3/18/2015).

Prosecutors did not pursue charges against Mr. Epstein reflecting the age of the victims
because they assumed a jury would view the girls not as victims but as promiscuous,
untrustworthy, willing participants. The presumption is offensive.

Mr. Epstein, a 53-year-old Manhattan money manager who has hired Harvard law
professor Alan Dershowitz and defense attorney Jack Goldberger, has denied knowing
how old the girls were. But police interviews with five alleged victims and 17 witnesses
under oath, as well as phone messages, a high school transcript and other items that
police found from searching Mr. Epstein's trash and 7,234-square-foot waterfront home,
provide evidence that he knew the girls were teenagers.

One girl couldn't show up when Mr. Epstein wanted because she had soccer. Another
time, Mr. Epstein had to wait for his massage session because the girl he wanted was
still in class.

Why didn't State Attorney Barry Krischer let a jury decide whether to believe the
teenagers - including a 16-year-old who went to Mr. Epstein's house to work in
December 2004 after being asked whether she needed to make money for Christmas
gifts?

Prosecutors gave greater weight to the details Mr. Dershowitz provided about the girls in
an apparent effort to assail their character. Mr. Dershowitz pointed out to prosecutors that
some of the teenagers had talked on myspace.com about marijuana and alcohol use.

The 20-year-old Royal Palm Beach woman who told police she recruited girls for Mr.
Epstein has a Web page on myspace.com that features one girl using the name Pimpin'
Made EZ.

Although no charges of witness tampering have been filed, the parents of at least one of
the teenage victims complained to police of being followed and intimidated by two men.
Police determined that their vehicles were registered to two private investigators. Mr.
Goldberger denied knowing anything about it.

Police also note in their reports that the state attorney's office offered Mr. Epstein a plea
deal that would have placed him on probation for five years, allowing him ultimately to
walk away with no criminal record at all.

I asked Mr. Krischer's spokesman, Mike Edmondson, why the case was referred to a
grand jury instead of Mr. Epstein being charged and facing a trial before a jury. And
shouldn't the victims' credibility be a factor to determine whether a crime's been
committed, not whether a jury will convict? (After all, as Mr. Goldberger told The Palm
Beach Post of Mr. Epstein, He's never denied girls came to the house.)

Especially, I asked Mr. Edmondson to explain: Why shouldn't the public look at this case
and think there are two kinds of justice - one for the wealthy and one for the rest of us?
Mr. Edmondson said he could not comment on the case because it is active, but on the
latter point, he offered, for the sake of philosophical debate: Whether wealth buys a
different standard of justice across the country ... the answer to that would, of course, be

yes.

But in this case, he said, regardless of the battery of attorneys, the outcome would be the



same. Every issue that was debated in public was debated in our office before this case

excess of cash distributions, Partners shall be required to contribute to KUE cash in an amount by which
such required withholding exceeds any such distributions.

Gain on Sale. A Limited Partner that is a non-U.S. Person will be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon
the sale or exchange of its Common LP Units to the extent that such Limited Partner recognizes gain
Upon such sale or exchange and such gain is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business.

U.S. Real Property Holding Corporation. lf a direct U.S. subsidiary of KUE is or were to become a
United States Real Property Holding Corporation, or USRPHC (as defined below), certain disposition
of Common LP Units by a Limited Partner that is a non-U.S. Person would result in such Limited Partner
being subject to U.S. federal income tax in respect of the portion of the gain recognized on such
disposition that is attributable to such subsidiary. in addition, if a direct U.S. subsidiary of KUE is or were
to become a USRPHC, certain dispositions of such subsidiary by KUE would result in Limited Partners
who are non-U.S. Persons being subject to U.S. federal income tax in respect of their allocable share of
the gain recognized by KUE on such disposition. Generally, a corporation is a USRPHC if the fair market
value of its U.S. real property interests equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its
worldwide real property interests and its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business. KUE
believes that each of its direct U.S. subsidiaries is not currently a USRPHC for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. However, no assurances can be given in this regard. Furthermore, it is possible that in the
future one of KUE’s subsidiaries may become a USRPHC if, for example, the value of the U.S. real estate
holdings of such subsidiary increases sufficiently. Limited Partners that are non-U.S. Parsons are urged
to consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of the USRPHC rules to their investment in
KUE.

Administrative Matters

Backup Withholding. For each calendar year, KUE will report to its U.S. Partners and to the Internal
Revenue Service the amount of distributions that it pays, and the amount of tax (if any) that it withholds
on these distributions. Under the backup withholding rules, a U.S. Limited Partner may be subject to
backup withholding tax with respect to distributions uniess a Limited Partner: (i) is a corporation or comes
within another exempt category and demonstrates this fact when required or (ii} provides a taxpayer
identification number, certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding tax and otherwise
complies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding tax rules. Exempt Limited Partners
who are U.S. Persons should indicate their exempt status on a properly completed IRS Form W-8BEN.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax, the amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a
Limited Partner will be allowed as a credit against such Limited Partner's U.S. federal income tax liability.

Nominee Reporting. Persons who hold an interest in KUE as a nominee for another Person are required
to furnish to KUE:
(a) the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the beneficial owner and the
nominee,
(b) whether the beneficial owner is:

I'm under the impression that checks will be exceptional (they are more cumbersome to handle), and we will 
use mostly wires. 
Considering the time difference, my heavy travel and my own propension to do things at night and on week-
ends I would much prefer having an internet code and be able to organize everything online when I need to. 
When I use Interaudi (my US bank), they can do that, store the recurring beneficiaries, and do wires in 
multiple currencies, but I am not familiar with DB. 
Of course, you could also have the same access and help me when needed. 
Also, your point about bookkeeping is mitigated by the fact that, in any case, I will also need to have 
someone keeping track of the receipts and inventory, before shipping proofs to you. In any case there will be 
need for some work on my side before final filing is done. 
On the other hand, if there is a checks and balances control issue, there could be a cap to my wiring powers 
(like the 10 K we discussed), that would be absolutely fine for me if this is the intent. 
Please do let me know. 
We can also talk about it (in Hawai now, free after 2 PM your time) 
In any case, this is good and happy news. I'll review the first list of payments over the week-end.

Hi Jeffrey 
Happy to talk to you almost anytime today until around 3PM. Just tell me what number I should reach. 
Not sure what got lost in translation here: never had the intention to go to any art fair or art show or 
anything of the kind. 
All the artists we have in mind or send to you are people we have direct connections with. Not just their 
studio, but also their home. They are people the work of whom we follow, and many of them are already 
friendly (Arianna, Cali have had dinner or stayed home). 
The idea is absolutely to have an impact on the ecosystem and to make a difference by supporting great 
artists when they need it. 
Galleries references are important, because galleries allow artist to reach a broader audience. We would go 
directly to the source. 
This is why it's important for me to go to LA or Berlin (or elsewhere) because those artists are not rich yet, 
they dont travel so much. They belong to a scene, and it does make a big difference to them if you connect 
in person. 
The spirit is to have an impact on young, talented folks, and absolutely to stay at the source. 
Once again, not sure was drifted away from this in communication

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010966.txt,"There is another useful inference. Adults own assets in the business and housing
sectors. Older adults tend more to own debt claims on these sectors, and younger
adults to own equity claims. But all adult ages collectively own both sectors
collectively. It does not follow that the sectors are equal in risk, as older individuals
might tend to own one sector predominantly, and younger ones the other. As a

layman, I don’t really know.

What I happen to know is that the publicly traded corporate sector, meaning stocks
particularly but also bonds, is far more liquid than the housing sector, and that the
rest of the business sector is far less liquid than either. Risk in general includes
liquidity risk. This leads me to the hypothesis or hunch that the housing sector in
general should be safer than the business sector, ceteris paribus, but that the
publicly traded corporate sector, cap-weighting debt and equity claims on it, may be

safest of all.

The idea that stocks and bonds cap-weighted are safer than houses might have been
laughed to scorn a few years ago. It doesn’t seem so funny after 2008. I view it as an
idea to be tested, not trusted, until more is known. If it holds up, it will rank as

another surprise.

The effect of individual wealth on risk tolerance is less understood. Here I judge
more from hunch and impression than from data. Given that human needs are fairly
uniform, as with the private and the general, more wealth gives more insulation
from want. Talent is wealth in human capital, and gives the same. Less, in either
factor, gives less margin for error. My hunch and impression is that the wealthier in
either factor should tend to be more risk tolerant so long as human capital itself is
not put in harm’s way. Human capital operates physical capital, and gives the means
of recovery. The wealthier, in talent or net worth, should prove the least tempted

toward sky diving and Russian roulette.

Roger Cohen

April 16, 2011 -- ve always had a soft spot for Nicolas Sarkozy. He
was the guy with the wrong name and the wrong background who
took on the smug talkers with names like Dominique de Villepin and
vanquished them. He was the outsider from the wrong schools who
believed in energy and talent and had the audacity to smash the taboo
that said a French politician can’t love America and prosper.

Sarkozy was a doer. He thought Francois Mitterrand’s seductive
phrase (in French at least) — “Il faut laisser le temps au temps” (You
must let time take its course) — was baloney that left you with
disasters like the Bosnian genocide. He thought work and reward
should be linked, a Gallic heresy, and he worked hard.

He hated the dependency culture of an overdeveloped French state,
which entrenched rights and enfeebled responsibility. That he was
elected president showed that France, deep in its soul, knew it had to
escape the Mitterrand-Chirac rut with its glut of erudition and its glob
of inaction. That was heartening.

The sanctimonious attacks on him from the left oozed the paralyzing
conservatism that had blinded France to change. The attacks on
Sarkozy from a blue-blooded or petit-bourgeois right often betrayed
the same quasiracist disdain evident in rightist attacks on President
Obama.

Yes, I liked Sarkozy — and still do. Then there was his rudeness; his
taste for his rich friends’ yachts; his need for adulation that helped
reduce a good newspaper, Le Figaro, to a fawning mouthpiece; his
authoritarian itch from which gypsies most conspicuously suffered;
his petulant impatience, his petty vanities and his peevish jealousies —

Home market investment allows for greater
internalisation and reduced hedging costs

Given recent increases in the likelinood of outflows,
figure 13 shows how sovereigns are growing their
focus on home market allocations to reduce foreign
currency exposure. While home market investment
aligns to greater internalisation, it also grows
correlations between sovereign portfolio performance
and local economic performance. Since sovereign
funding is also heavily dependent on the local market,
sovereigns are at risk of increasing cashflow strains
(from both investment returns and new funding) when
the local economy underperforms.

Sovereigns may need to revert to greater
geographic diversification, at the cost of short-
term returns

The combination of continuing home market tilts,
along with a concentration in a small number of ‘safe
havens’, threatens to squeeze allocations to markets
that lack clear growth or stability attributes. As the
granularity of geopolitical risk models increases,
sovereigns are at risk of being overly selective in their
geographic investments and becoming dependent
on single markets within geographic regions.

However, many of the driving forces behind
concentrated geographic allocations are unlikely
to last. Interest rate disparity in developed markets
is expected to reduce if European and Japanese
quantitative tightening begins, suggesting that
increased fixed income allocations to the US are
tactical. Similarly, while growing emerging market
allocations is a strategic initiative, India has been
targeted due to its recent economic growth, relative
to other major emerging markets.

While sovereigns are willing to be overweight
individual countries to capture additional returns
(either through short-term tactical allocations or
greater internalisation), they may shift their focus
back to managing risk across diverse geographic
allocations, fulfilling their aim to make government
reserves independent of local economic performance.

I’m writing about the Iran deal. So far have only sent a form paragraph in response to requests. Below.

Noam

On Iran, as usual, I’m a gloomy contrarian. I’m glad the treaty was signed, and it’s kind of fun to watch the
Republican lunatics shrieking hysterically as they try to kill it (as they may). And Israeli hypocrisy has gone
well beyond being comical. But in fact the whole thing is farcical, in my opinon. In the US, Iran is “the
greatest threat to world peace”, intoned constantly from on high, in the media, everywhere. There is also such
a thing as world opinion, as measured by such ultra-radicals as Gallup. It turns out that the greatest threat to
world peace is the US, by a very wide margin, no one else even close, and Iran barely mentioned. The
American population is protected from these unwanted facts by the Free Press: not reported. There is an
organization called US intelligence. They brief Congress regularly on the international security situation, all
quite public. On Iran, they point out that it has very limited military power, even by regional standards (a
small fraction of Saudi Arabia, for example). Its strategic doctrine is defensive. If — a big If— it has plans for
nuclear weapons, that would be part of its deterrent strategy. Now who would be opposed to Iran having a
deterrent strategy? Answer is clear: the rogue states that rampage violently in the region and don’t want any
impediment: the US and Israel, also lesser ones like UK and France. One simple way to reduce the threat of
nuclear weapons would be to establish a nuclear-weapons free zone in the region, as has been done elsewhere
(over US objections). That’s been advocated by the Arab states for 20 years, with very wide global support,
including Iran. It comes up regularly at the 5-year review meetings of the Nonproliferation Treaty, at the UN,
again a few months ago, when, again, it was blocked by the US to protect its Israeli client, which has a huge
nuclear weapons arsenal and wants to keep it. Again, the population is protected from such facts by the Free
Press (though in this case there are some fringe exceptions, and of course the Arms Control literature). Same
with the rest of the litany. Reading the US and UK press is like living in some lunatic asylum. I’m wondering
whether to write about it — again; have done so repeatedly. It’s like talking to a wall. Iran has an awful
government, though by the standards of such US allies as Saudi Arabia, it’s practically heaven.

Nevertheless, better to have the treaty than not to, given the nature of the asylum.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013027.txt,"6.4 Memory Types and Associated Cognitive Processes in CogPrime 111

CogPrime’s memory types are the declarative, procedural, sensory, and episodic memory
types that are widely discussed in cognitive neuroscience [TCO05], plus attentional memory for
allocating system resources generically, and intentional memory for allocating system resources
in a goal-directed way. Table 6.2 overviews these memory types, giving key references and indi-
cating the corresponding cognitive processes, and also indicating which of the generic patternist
cognitive dynamics each cognitive process corresponds to (pattern creation, association, etc.).
Figure 6.7 illustrates the relationships between several of the key memory types in the context
of a simple situation involving an OpenCogPrime-controlled agent in a virtual world.

In terms of patternist cognitive theory, the multiple types of memory in CogPrime should be
considered as specialized ways of storing particular types of patterns, optimized for spacetime
efficiency. The cognitive processes associated with a certain type of memory deal with creating
and recognizing patterns of the type for which the memory is specialized. While in principle all
the different sorts of pattern could be handled in a unified memory and processing architecture,
the sort of specialization used in CogPrime is necessary in order to achieve acceptable efficient
general intelligence using currently available computational resources. And as we have argued
in detail in Chapter 7, efficiency is not a side-issue but rather the essence of real-world AGI
(since as Hutter has shown, if one casts efficiency aside, arbitrary levels of general intelligence
can be achieved via a trivially simple program).

The essence of the CogPrime design lies in the way the structures and processes associated
with each type of memory are designed to work together in a closely coupled way, yielding coop-
erative intelligence going beyond what could be achieved by an architecture merely containing
the same structures and processes in separate “black boxes.”

The inter-cognitive-process interactions in OpenCog are designed so that

e conversion between different types of memory is possible, though sometimes computation-
ally costly (e.g. an item of declarative knowledge may with some effort be interpreted
procedurally or episodically, etc.)

e when a learning process concerned centrally with one type of memory encounters a situation
where it learns very slowly, it can often resolve the issue by converting some of the relevant
knowledge into a different type of memory: i.e. cognitive synergy

6.4.1 Cognitive Synergy in PLN

To put a little meat on the bones of the cognitive synergy idea, discussed repeatedly in prior
chapters and more extensively in latter chapters, we now elaborate a little on the role it plays
in the interaction between procedural and declarative learning.

While MOSES handles much of CogPrime’s procedural learning, and CogPrime’s internal
simulation engine handles most episodic knowledge, CogPrime’s primary tool for handling
declarative knowledge is an uncertain inference framework called Probabilistic Logic Networks
(PLN). The complexities of PLN are the topic of a lengthy technical monograph [GMIT08], and
are summarized in Chapter 34; here we will eschew most details and focus mainly on pointing
out how PLN seeks to achieve efficient inference control via integration with other cognitive
processes.

Asa logic, PLN is broadly integrative: it combines certain term logic rules with more standard
predicate logic rules, and utilizes both fuzzy truth values and a variant of imprecise probabilities
called indefinite probabilities. PLN mathematics tells how these uncertain truth values propagate

finally taking control of their own destiny. It was a message that took on an
even greater power and poignancy after the mass murder of the Jews of Europe
during the Holocaust.

Even for many Israelis nowadays, the all-consuming collectivism of life on
an early kibbutz, and the physical challenges, are hard to imagine. Among the
few dozen families in Mishmar Hasharon when I was born, there was no private
property. Everything was communally owned and allocated. Every penny — or
Israeli pound — earned from what we produced went into a communal kitty,
from which each one of the 150-or-so families in Mishmar Hasharon when I
was a child got a small weekly allowance. By “small”, I mean tiny. For my
parents and others, even the idea of an ice cream cone for their children was a
matter of keen financial planning. More often, they would save each weekly
pittance with the aim of pooling them at birthday time, where they might stretch
to the price of a picture book, or a small toy.

Decisions on any issue of importance were taken at the aseifa, the weekly
meeting of kibbutz members held on Saturday nights in our dining hall. The
agenda would be tacked up on the wall the day before, and the session would
usually focus on one issue, ranging from major items like the kibbutz’s finances
to the question, for instance, of whether our small platoon of delivery drivers
should be given pocket money to buy a sandwich or a coffee on their days
outside the kibbutz or be limited to wrapping up bits of the modest fare on offer
at breakfast time. That debate ended in a classic compromise: a bit of money,
but very little, so as to avoid violating the egalitarian ethos of the kibbutz.

But perhaps the aspect of life on the kibbutz most difficult for outsiders to
understand, especially nowadays, is that we children were raised collectively.
We lived in dormitories, organized by age-group and overseen by a caregiver:
in Hebrew, a metapelet, usually a woman in her 20s or 30s. For a few hours
each afternoon and on the Jewish Sabbath, we were with our parents. But
otherwise, we lived and learned in a world consisting almost entirely of other
children.

Everything around us was geared towards making us feel like a band of
brothers and sisters, and as part of the guiding spirit of the kibbutz. Until our
teenage years, we weren’t even graded in school. And though we didn’t actually
study how to till the land, some of my fondest early memories are of our
“children’s farm” — the vegetables we grew, the cows we milked, the hens and
chickens that gave us our first experience of how life was created. And the

¢ The granting of independence to Syria...constitutes a good example
of the socialist principles in Syria.... [But] as to the presence of a
parliament and a constitutional government, that does not represent
individual freedom. This parliamentary rule is no more than false
appearances without any value. In truth, it covers up a regime
dominated by religious fanaticism against the minorities. Do French
leaders want the Muslims to have control over the Alawi people in
order to throw them into misery?

¢ We can sense today how the Muslim citizens of Damascus force the
Jews who live among them to sign a document pledging that they will
not send provisions to their ill-fated brethren in Palestine. The
condition of the Jews in Palestine is the strongest and most explicit
evidence of the militancy of the Islamic issue vis-a-vis those who do
not belong to Islam. These good Jews contributed to the Arabs with
civilization and peace, scattered gold, and established prosperity in
Palestine without harming anyone or taking anything by force, yet the
Muslims declare holy war against them and never hesitated in
slaughtering their women and children, despite the presence of
England in Palestine and France in Syria. Therefore a dark fate awaits
the Jews and other minorities in case the Mandate is abolished and
Muslim Syria is united with Muslim Palestine...the ultimate goal of
the Muslim Arabs.

One of the signatories to this document was Sulayman al-Assad, a
minor chief of the Kalbiya clan and father of Hafez al-Assad.

The ‘asabiyya of the Alawis was carefully exploited by the French,
who polished the Khaldunian model by giving them military training
as members of the Troupes Spéciales du Levant. In the turbulent
years that followed full independence in 1946, their military know-
how proved valuable. Bright members of the sect such as Hafez al-
Assad, whose families could not afford to send them to university,
joined the armed forces and were drawn to secular parties, such as the

The Choice-Minimal Lifestyle: 6 Formulas for More Output and
Less Overwhelm

I was stressed out... over dog cartoons.

It was 9:47 P.M. at Barnes and Noble on a recent Saturday night, and I had 13 minutes to find a
suitable exchange for The New Yorker Dog Cartoons, $22 of expensive paper. Bestsellers? Staff
recommends? New arrivals or classics? I'd already been there 30 minutes.

Beginning to feel overwhelmed with a ridiculous errand I’d expected to take five minutes, I stumbled
across the psychology section. One tome jumped out at me as all too appropriate—The Paradox of
Choice: Why More Is Less. It wasn’t the first time I’d seen or read Barry Schwartz’s 2004 classic, but it
seemed like a good time to revisit the principles, among them, that:

e+ The more options you consider, the more buyer’s regret you'll
have.

e » The more options you encounter, the less fulfilling your ultimate
outcome will be.

This raises a difficult question: Is it better to have the best outcome but be less satisfied, or have an
acceptable outcome and be satisfied?

For example, would you rather deliberate for months and get the 1 of 20 houses that’s the best
investment but second-guess yourself until you sell it five years later, or would you rather get a house
that is 80% of the investment potential of the former (still to be sold at a profit) but never second-guess
it?

Tough call.

Schwartz also recommends making nonreturnable purchases. I decided to keep the stupid pooch
cartoons. Why? Because it’s not just about being satisfied, it’s about being practical.

Income is renewable, but some other resources—like attention—are not. [I’ve talked before about
attention as a currency and how it determines the value of time.

For example: Is your weekend really free if you find a crisis in the inbox Saturday morning that you
can’t address until Monday morning?

Even if the inbox scan lasts 30 seconds, the preoccupation and forward projection for the subsequent
48 hours effectively deletes that experience from your life. You had time but you didn’t have attention,
so the time had no practical value.

The choice-minimal lifestyle becomes an attractive tool when we consider two truths.

1. Considering options costs attention that then can’t be spent on action or present-state
awareness.

Rodney Brooks

Rodney Brooks is a computer scientist; Panasonic Professor of Robotics, emeritus, MIT;
former director, MIT Computer Science Lab; and founder, chairman, and CTO of
Rethink Robotics. He is the author of Flesh and Machines.

Mathematicians and scientists are often limited in how they see the big picture, beyond
their particular field, by the tools and metaphors they use in their work. Norbert Wiener
is no exception, and I might guess that neither am I.

When he wrote The Human Use of Human Beings, Wiener was straddling the end
of the era of understanding machines and animals simply as physical processes and the
beginning of our current era of understanding machines and animals as computational
processes. I suspect there will be future eras whose tools will look as distinct from the
tools of the two eras Wiener straddled as those tools did from each other.

Wiener was a giant of the earlier era and built on the tools developed since the
time of Newton and Leibniz to describe and analyze continuous processes in the physical
world. In 1948 he published Cybernetics, a word he coined to describe the science of
communication and control in both machines and animals. Today we would refer to the
ideas in this book as control theory, an indispensable discipline for the design and
analysis of physical machines, while mostly neglecting Wiener’s claims about the science
of communication. Wiener’s innovations were largely driven by his work during the
Second World War on mechanisms to aim and fire anti-aircraft guns. He brought
mathematical rigor to the design of the sorts of technology whose design processes had
been largely heuristic in nature: from the Roman waterworks through Watt’s steam
engine to the early development of automobiles.

One can imagine a different contingent version of our intellectual and
technological history had Alan Turing and John von Neumann, both of whom made
major contributions to the foundations of computing, not appeared on the scene. Turing
contributed a fundamental model of computation—now known as a Turing Machine—in
his paper “On Computable Numbers with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem,”
written and revised in 1936 and published in 1937. In these machines, a linear tape of
symbols from a finite alphabet encodes the input for a computational problem and also
provides the working space for the computation. A different machine was required for
each separate computational problem; later work by others would show that in one
particular machine, now known as a Universal Turing Machine, an arbitrary set of
computing instructions could be encoded on that same tape.

In the 1940s, von Neumann developed an abstract self-reproducing machine
called a cellular automaton. In this case it occupied a finite subset of an infinite two-
dimensional array of squares each containing a single symbol from a finite alphabet of
twenty-nine distinct symbols—the rest of the infinite array starts out blank. The single
symbols in each square change in lockstep, based on a complex but finite rule about the
current symbol in that square and its immediate neighbors. Under the complex rule that
von Neumann developed, most of the symbols in most of the squares stay the same and a
few change at each step. So when one looks at the non-blank squares, it appears that

systems that are sensitive to initial conditions, yield parameter sensitive entropies of
two (mathematically) fundamental kinds called topological and metric entropies, hr
and hw, proven to be the upper and lower bounds of any estimate of the entropy ina
uniformly expanding and/or equidistributed system (Adler and Weiss, 1965).
Measures of entropy, as “missing information related to the number of alternatives
which remain possible to a physical system” (Boltzmann, 1909), “index of
probability” (Gibbs, 1902) or the “amount of uncertainty associated with a finite
scheme” (Khinchin,1957) are obviously sensitive to the partition rules and its
fineness of the grain. The most theoretically defensible partition is called the
“generating partition” in which no box contains more than one point. Comparisons of
control and experimental data can be differentially sensitive to partition construction,
so that if a generating partition is not practicable due to sample length or dense
curdling in the point distribution, some arbitrary choices have to be made. These
have included naturally renormalized variational partitions, such that in one
dimension the boxes are defined by +1, +2, +3,...standard deviations, or quartiles or
quintile, above and below the mean and in n dimensions. Partitions have also been
constructed and used to described drug effects on rat exploratory behavior by
sequential partitioning along the dimension of the highest remaining variation (after
the previous partition) called the “KD” partition (Paulus et al, 1991). Partition
strategies to capture entropic measures on serial ordering (Klemm and Sherry,
1981; Strong et al, 1998) can grow from knowledge or hypotheses about the
physiological sources of temporal irregularities and discontinuities in brain dynamics
including characteristic interval(s) of refractoriness, relaxation times of the inhibitory
surround, correlation time in dendritic tree summation, the time course of reciprocal
inhibition and its decay and chemical influences such as the synaptic half-life and

time of action of inhibitory influences such as GABA on cell firing.

The logarithmic growth rates of occupancy of new symbolically indexed
boxes or, equivalently, the growth rates of visitations to old ones generating
unstable periodic orbits, are called topological entropies, hy . They record new

happenings, the growth rate of the diversity of orbits, and not how likely with respect

simplified Chinese. Take a look and normally you will find them to be
quite different. Each example in the figure is my best attempt to translate
the phrase “Hello Reader” into a script and the corresponding language.

Symbols of the World

English is one of the most irritating script languages of all. It commonly
uses etymological elements, showing the history or origin of the word
that has nothing to do with the sound of the word. A word like school
has the ‘k sound spelt ‘ch, showing its historical derivation from the
Greek, but confusing for pronunciation. English has 53 sounds derived
from only 26 letters, so there are plenty of letter combinations, many of
which are irregular. Because the language favors historical convention
over simplicity, sugar is pronounced “shu-gar” whereas sand is strictly
phonetic. As for Leicestershire I'll leave that as a test for the American
readers amongst you. If you're British, try Mattapoisett, a town in
Massachusetts named in Native American.

Yet English is also a ‘lovely’ language. Because of its richness there
are often twenty different ways to say something, and a dozen words
to choose on any topic. One of my own favorite words is ‘jump% It is
phonetic, but also onomatopoeic and even pictographic. Jump both
sounds like a jump and looks like a jump.

Two scripts that puzzled scholars for many years are Linear-b and
Hieroglyphics. Linear-b — found on clay tablets on the Island of Crete -
turned out to be a coded form of ancient Greek with some slight quirks,
such as dropping the letter ‘s’ from the ends of words. The ‘s is superfluous
in most Greek words, and dropping it saved precious clay space!

Hieroglyphics was a real puzzle. It looks so like a pictographic
language that it fooled many people for centuries. The Rosetta Stone was
discovered in 1799 and became the key to their deciphering. This stone
had the same edict written out in 3 languages —- Greek, Egyptian and
Demotic. The French adventurer Jean-Francois Champollion decoded
hieroglyphics in 1822 and although it Jooks pictographic, it was found to
be predominantly phonetic. Linear-a, another script found on the Island
of Crete has yet to be decoded and remains one of the world’s great-
unsolved mysteries.

All these different ways to code ideas into symbols present the
children of the world a great learning challenge. Because written language
is so young, in evolutionary terms, our brains have not had enough time
to evolve to master it. Instead words co-opt parts of our brains originally

I understand your frustrations and appreciate your willingness to figure out a solution. I have some ideas 
which I will send you over the weekend if that is OK. 
Re Broadcom: the stock is up $1.20 at $211.50. After the initial shock reaction of yesterday, there has been 
a lot of focus on the cost synergies etc. but very little conviction in revenue opportunities. However until we 
hear from management as to the overall intentions of the deal, uncertainty will linger. 
This morning the pricing is as follows: 
Aug 200 Puts cost $4.10 
Sept 200 Puts cost $7.90 
Earning are on 08/30. So worst case is the uncertainty lingers until then which would argue to buy the Sept 
puts. However I still prefer buying the Aug puts as I would fully expect more clarity from management before 
August expiry.

Im not angry, sorry, it is sad. it is apparent that you have no experience trading. we both made a 
mistake. . the spy trades were the results of a rank amatuer. . you took a postion on the direction of the 
market. ok. you decided to play it extra short time and short. . why? becaue the options are cheaper. 
? knowing full well that time premium was running. . first silly move. . I allowed as promised to 
give you authority. . you set a target. . it hit the traget, you moved in back. based on media reporting on 
trump visit? you didnt act. the market dipped and you panicked. . AMATEUR. wrong options wrong 
timing , no discipline and as a percentaage of investment, a one day dip fof 25%. wanting to buy the 
highter strike , is ok. but why the same month? why the same moment. why the same index. . sorry. I 
have taught this for many years. and your grade is an F. not one good move in many. . re 
broadcom. the crack happend in the morning, options were higher. no alternative presented. no 
analysis. , this is no way to manage money. I have lost a great deal of money hoping you would be able to 
do as you promised you could . would. . Had you told me, jeffrey I d like to try a new job as a 
manager lets start slow I can learn. i would be less annoyed. you told me you had great confidence knew 
the risks and truly believed you would be able to raise money .do well and prosper. . If it were not 
you, this would have ended months ago.. we should work on a solution. not sure yet what shape it takes.

I know that both you and I heard brads’. 1m out of here if i dont get a coo. . sorry,. 1 know that neither of
us have stood in the way of his finding/ gettting one.. JPM account DB account GS account, ??? its
MAY 1. nothing in the first quarter and these are only papers that need signing.

I suggest your thinking on my role and compensation for my work might benefit , from a mental shift -
think mark and josh, without the mutual resentment ( HAHA) only in terms of sharing ,thanks, Iam and
have been your financial partner i.. rectifying circumstances that appear in hind sight unexplainable. I
wish you woudl have asked me earllier to review your things , but i understand. I do know that soley asa
result of my actions your personal bottom line has increased dramatically, if you had thought of me as
your partner in this endeavor , instead of an employee, i think your reaction to sharing t benefits would be
different.

If you recall, you wanted me to be paid , unlike others at the END of my work. we discussed this ad
nauseum, and agreed OCT 15, last year was the end. You had wanted more comfort initially on the art
partnership so that date was delayed. It has now been six monhts since then, your concept of aftercare .
. for free. was already unique , in your words this has to have an end.( weaned ) if the actions of josh
and mark led to one hundred million dollars , what would be their share. Im not sure why it is different
in your mind. but i respect the fact that it is, Is it because their work seems harder. it cannot be simply
because they devote more time to you .or it appears to involve more effort. I am happy to continue to
play a partnership role. as I have been in many areas of your life. . I am also happy to move on and have
no more of these emails. I find them as tedious as you do . if you prefer a partnership structure , ok with
me, I tried to minimize the amount of money i would recieve by making it a flat fee . as i wanted you to
feel good and have no second thoguths somehow if the payment comes from a partnership structure you
seem relaxed as opposed to writing a check, I focus on trust and friendship first, and the fact that you
don't include josh and mark in that category, gives me great pause . I proposed 33 percent of money
made for you. . in the past you agreed that amount. it will be huge, but ok with me, I can talk today at
945 as you suggested. or if you woudl rather over the weekend ok

perceived a possible conflict of interest, and didn’t make the call. Several years later, I was
approached by Monica’s mother at a Jewish event. She said, “I wish you had called Monica.” I
have often wondered whether the case would have turned out differently if I had called and
agreed to represent her.

Although I helped defend Clinton before Congress and in the court of public opinion, I was
critical of his sexual misconduct while in office. In my book Sexual McCarthyism, I argue:

“At bottom this is a story of how two men who are obsessed about forbidden
sex—Clinton about engaging in it and Starr about exposing it—managed to turn a tawdry
series of Oval Office sexual encounters into a constitutional crisis. Clinton and his
advisers made mistake after mistake in a futile effort to keep his embarrassing little secret
from becoming public. Starr and his staff overreached, overreacted, exaggerated and
pressed every issue to the limits of its logic to expose the secret and embarrass the
President. The result was a highly unlikely combination of factors that led the nation to
where almost no one wanted to go—to the brink of a constitutional crisis with
international implications.

Some critics believe that Bill Clinton and Kenneth Starr deserve each other. But we the
people do not deserve to see our delicate system of checks and balances endangered by
the reckless actions of two obsessed men.”

Remarkably, I have remained on friendly terms with both Clinton and Starr after writing these
harsh words. Most celebrities I have encountered have extremely thin skins. They never forgive
even small slights because they are accustomed to being universally adored. Both Clinton and
Starr have thick skin. They accept criticism, especially when they know it is well intentioned. The
same cannot be said about the next celebrity (and his lawyers) in whose case I played a major
role.

Mark was here this morning , the proposed transactions are extremely complex . and would take a great
deal of detailed time. I do not know how, and if ,jto move forward - our last transaction. a transaction
which you saved 600 million in tax. even if 20 years away ,( ihope longer) even discounted is a 300
million savings . for that you ignored our agreements , verbal written and emailed -and decided that it
was only worth 8 million dollars. ( assuming phaidon srichard happens. 24 m savings not including
artspace and debt benefits certain to come later) FYI the phaidon transaction cannot happen as
currently comtemplated IT will not work . NOT

When we had our meeting in your home in Bedford. You asked me for my help. I told you multiple
times that i thought it was a very bad idea, in that I preferred to have no financial interactions. I dont
have many friends and didnt want money in any way to interfere with our unique relationship. Reminder ,
For five years you had the kind but goofy Eileen Alexandersson as the sole manager of your accounting ,
legal, investments. reporting, trusts etc. When I first told you in no uncertain terms that I firmly believed
she was incompetent you admonished me for  speaking out of both sides of my mouth. With regard
Brad Wechsler , there has never been a  both sides. . I have consistantly maintained since day one that
he was highly unsuited for the job. When you initially asked me to help convince him to take the role ,
promising him a position to manage mirage investments I sent you a note saying that instead of hiring him
you should pay up and get first class people. I have reiterated the same message for over a year now. .
Brad , not me ,was tasked with hiring new people , according to his org chart.(nauseating ) and as you
wanted him to take ownership of the staff,he conducted many interviews alone. . you may recall that as late
as may, you told him in my presence that though six months had passed he had not hired anyone. since
then I have rectified errors in sales tax, use tax, income tax, fbar reporting, 1031 reporting, 8 million of

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016264.txt,"the long run, there is no distinction between arming ourselves and arming our enemies.”
(p. 129) The Information Age is also the Dysinformation Age.

What can we do? We need to rethink our priorities with the help of the passionate
but flawed analyses of Wiener, Weizenbaum, and the other serious critics of our
technophilia. A key phrase, it seems to me, is Wiener’s almost offhand observation,
above, that “these machines” are “helpless by themselves.” As I have been arguing
recently, we’re making tools, not colleagues, and the great danger is not appreciating the
difference, which we should strive to accentuate, marking and defending it with political
and legal innovations.

Perhaps the best way to see what is being missed 1s to note that Alan Turing
himself suffered an entirely understandable failure of imagination in his formulation of
the famous Turing Test. As everyone knows, it is an adaptation of his “imitation game,”
in which a man, hidden from view and communicating verbally with a judge, tries to
convince the judge that he is in fact a woman, while a woman, also hidden and
communicating with the judge, tries to convince the judge that she is the woman. Turing
reasoned that this would be a demanding challenge for a man (or for a woman pretending
to be a man), exploiting a wealth of knowledge about how the other sex thinks and acts,
what they tend to favor or ignore. Surely (ding!)?, any man who could beat a woman at
being perceived to be a woman would be an intelligent agent. What Turing did not
foresee is the power of deep-learning AI to acquire this wealth of information in an
exploitable form without having to understand it. Turing imagined an astute and
imaginative (and hence conscious) agent who cunningly designed his responses based on
his detailed “theory” of what women are likely to do and say. Top-down intelligent
design, in short. He certainly didn’t think that a man, winning the imitation game, would
somehow become a woman; he imagined that there would still be a man’s consciousness
guiding the show. The hidden premise in Turing’s almost-argument was: Only a
conscious, intelligent agent could devise and control a winning strategy in the imitation
game. And so it was persuasive to Turing (and others, including me, still a stalwart
defender of the Turing Test) to argue that a “computing machine” that could pass as
human in a contest with a human might not be conscious in just the way a human being
is, but would nevertheless have to be a conscious agent of some kind. I think this is still a
defensible position—the only defensible position—but you have to understand how
resourceful and ingenious a judge would have to be to expose the shallowness of the
facade that a deep-learning AI (a tool, not a colleague) could present.

What Turing didn’t foresee is the uncanny ability of superfast computers to sift
mindlessly through Big Data, of which the Internet provides an inexhaustible supply,
finding probabilistic patterns in human activity that could be used to pop “authentic’-
seeming responses into the output for almost any probe a judge would think to offer.
Wiener also underestimates this possibility, seeing the tell-tale weakness of a machine in
not being able to

take into account the vast range of probability that characterizes the human
situation. (p.181)

° The surely alarm (the habit of having a bell ring in your head whenever you sce the word in an argument)
is described and defended by me in Jntuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking (2013).

He had ambitions of becoming a male model. He did not seem overly concerned about his
privacy, posting pictures of himself “mooning” for the camera. He also posted provocative
modeling pictures of himself on the Ars Technica website. He commented on his own beefcake-
style pictures “So sexxxy it hurts” and “I like my girlish figure that attracts girls.” He approached
a model agency called Model Mania. He had some concern about the photographer who “shoots
mostly guys.” Snowden said in a post he was “a little worried he might, you know, try to pull my
pants off and choke me to death with them, but he turned out to be legit and is a pretty damn
good model photographer.” He posted the photographs on the Internet, commenting: “ I think I
look pretty good in the shots, so it's kind of hard to get used to thinking of yourself in terms of
being an element in a picture as opposed to just a picture of X. Despite his enthusiasm, the lack
of any paid job offers dashed any hopes he had of a modeling career.

He also began dating Lindsay Mills around this time. She was an extremely attractive 19-year
old art student at the Maryland Institute College of Art. Jonathan Mills, Lindsay’s father, was an
applications developer at the Oracle Corporation. According to him, she met Snowden on an
Internet dating site. However they met, Snowden and Mills had much in common. They both had
divorced parents who gave them a great deal of latitude in conducting their personal lives. Both
of them were keenly interested in perfecting their bodies through exercise and diet regimes, Mills’
only paid employment over the next 8 years would be as a fitness and Yoga instructor in
Maryland. They both also had ambitions to be models and neither of them had inhibitions about
posing provocatively for photographers. They both also had a desire to travel to exotic places,
including cities in Asia. Mills had spent four month in Guilin, China before meeting Snowden.

As bleak as his prospects as a high school dropout may have seemed, he had an unexpected
stroke of good fortune in the spring of 2006. The CIA, out-of-the-blue, offered Snowden a
$66,000 a year job as a CIA communications officer. “I don’t have a degree of ANY type. In fact,
I don’t even have a high school diploma,” Snowden boasted in May 2006 on the website Ars
Technica under his alias The TrueHooHa. He added, with only a slight exaggeration, “I make
70K.”

But how did Snowden get the job? The CIA’s minimum requirements in 2006 for a job in its
clandestine division included a bachelor's or master's degree and a strong academic record, with a
preferred GPA of 3.0 or better. Snowden had only completed one year of high school. He had
never attended college. He said himself that he had “no degree.” So he had none of the requisite
degrees for the job he got.

CIA deputy director Ledgett said the CIA needed technical workers in 2006. But even if
Snowden only applied in this capacity, which entailed a 5-year contract-term employment
agreement, the minimum requirements for an intelligence technology job were a minimum of an
Associates’ Degree awarded by a two-year Community college in Electronics and
Communications Engineering Technology Computer Network Systems, or Electronics
Engineering Technology. Candidates further must have a final GPA of at least 3.0 on a 4.0 scale

and software on the Internet, all of which fell under the rubric of
“freedom of the Internet.” They also vocally objected to the NSA’s
using built-in back doors in its software to read their encrypted
messages. Such people were not difficult to find on the Internet.
The donors to Ron Paul’s libertarian election campaign (including
Snowden) were a matter of public record.

Even if there was no shortage of hacktivists who believed the sur-
veillance of the Internet by the NSA was an evil worth fighting, the
SVR still had to find a plausible way of approaching members of
this counterculture without offending them. Clearly, the SVR could
no longer use out-of-date Communist and anti-capitalist ideology
as a lure. Russia was far more authoritarian than the United States
when it came to the Internet. One viable alternative for the SVR was
custom-tailoring false flags to appeal to hacktivists.

For this purpose, the Internet provided a near-perfect realm.
Because it is a place where true identities cannot easily be veri-
fied, intelligence services could employ a protean kit of disguises to
assume false identities to entice potential dissidents into communi-

© cating with them. The KGB’s earlier efforts to use hacktivist groups ®
in Germany had produced little if any intelligence about the NSA
because of the stovepiping it used to isolate its computers from net-
works that could be hacked into from the outside. It will be recalled
that the NSA threat officer had cited these failures in his 1996 report
on NSA vulnerability. He also said that efforts of the Russian intel-
ligence services to use false flag recruitments provided the KGB with
“a learning experience.” The KGB had learned that hacking by itself
could not breach the NSA’s protective stovepiping. He predicted that
its next logical move would be to “target insider computer person-
nel.” This false flag recruitment would aim at, in his view, system
administrators, computer engineers, and cyber-service workers who
either were already inside the NSA or had a security clearance that
would facilitate getting jobs with NSA contractors.

Even with an appropriate false flag, the task of finding such a
“Prometheus” required obtaining a database of those working at
the NSA. There were some five thousand civilian technicians at the
NSA of all political stripes. Hacking into the personnel records of
the intelligence workers seeking to renew their security clearance

various sorts. The hexagonal boxes at the bottom denote various hierarchies devoted to recog-
nition and generation of patterns: perception, action and linguistic. Intervening between these
recognition/generation hierarchies and the Atomspace, we have a pattern mining/imprinting
component (that recognizes patterns in the hierarchies and passes them to the Atomspace; and
imprints patterns from the Atomspace on the hierarchies); and also OpenPsi, a special dynam-

struggle is showing ominous sectarian overtones. At Baniyas, where
the army moved scores of tanks and armored vehicles into the city’s
southern outskirts, paramilitary groups were said to have massed in
Alawi-populated northern suburbs. The city centers of Damascus and
Aleppo, however, remained relatively quiet, as the government
appeared to be organizing rallies of its own supporters, with activists
claiming that efforts were being made to bus pro-government
demonstrators from Alawi-dominated regions. Grainy cell-phone
images sent in clandestinely from Homs to the al-Jazeera TV network
showed a speech by a senior defector from the ruling Baath party
being greeted with shouts of Allahu Akbar (God Is Greater), often
regarded as the jihadist war cry.

At first sight the defection of more than three hundred members of
the ruling Baath party in protest at the crackdown would suggest that
Syria’s one-party state, in place since 1963, is beginning to unravel.
What some people are calling the Facebook Revolution, an
unprecedented wave of visible public protest, is led by a generation
of media-savvy young people, more aware of the outside world than
their parents were, who are demanding an end to the system of
repression, corruption, and privilege that has been the hallmark of the
authoritarian Arab regimes lying between the Atlas Mountains and
the Persian Gulf.

Yet unlike the Muslim Brotherhood’s rebellion in Hama, which
shook the government of Bashar al-Assad’s father Hafez in 1982, the
Facebook rebellion seems curiously faceless. There are some signs of
opposition violence with “plausible reports of security forces being
ambushed by unidentified armed groups, as well as of protesters
firing back when attacked,” according to the International Crisis
Group. But these appear to be small and random incidents. The vast
majority of casualties are the consequence of the regime’s brutality.
The protests are largely spontaneous. There seem to be no controlling

NYT
Al Qaeda Stirs Again

Juan C. Zarate

April 17, 2011 -- MANY in the West had taken comfort in Al
Qaeda’s silence in the wake of the uprisings in the Muslim world this
year, as secular, nonviolent protests, led by educated youth focused
on redressing longstanding local grievances, showcased democracy’s
promise and seemed to leave Al Qaeda behind.

Indeed, the pristine spirit of the Arab Spring does represent an
existential threat to Al Qaeda’s extremist ideology. But Al Qaeda’s
leaders also know that this is a strategic moment. They are banking
on the disillusionment that inevitably follows revolutions to reassert
their prominence in the region. And now AI Qaeda is silent no more —
and is taking the rhetorical offensive.

In recent statements, Ayman al-Zawahri, Osama bin Laden’s second-
in-command, and Qaeda surrogates have aligned themselves with the
protesters in Libya, Egypt and elsewhere, while painting the West as
an enemy of the Arab people.

In North Africa, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb claimed that while
protesters flooded the streets of Tunis and Cairo, it had been fighting
in the mountains against the same enemies. Anwar al-Awlaki, a
Yemeni-American cleric affiliated with Al Qaeda in the Arabian
Peninsula, declared that in the wake of the revolutions, “our
mujahedeen brothers ... will get a chance to breathe again after three
decades of suffocation” and that “the great doors of opportunity
would open up for the mujahedeen all over the world.”

Mr. Zawahri has denounced democracy, arguing that toppling
dictators is insufficient and that “justice, freedom, and independence”

The tensions between free vs. proprietary software help focus us on foundational questions of
governance that are threaded through the course. To what extent should new technologies be
shaped and shared by anyone without gatekeeping? 2017 may find the Internet in middle age.
Do its puzzles suggest anything about whether and how to resolve governance questions for
more newly mainstreamed technologies like machine learning and other Al?

In addition to the challenges that the Internet has provided in regulation and governance, the
inability to really understand what many “learned” algorithms do, and their ability to have
properties and abilities beyond the capabilities of their initial designers, presents additional
challenges when thinking about whether and how to regulate the research, as well as the
deployment, of Al. Phenomena like digital currencies and distributed Al systems reprises the
ideas and challenges of Barlow’s declaration of independence of cyberspace.

While non-adopters wait on the evidence of ESG
investment outcomes, leading adopters are moving
further down the path of integrating ESG principles
into investment allocation and management
decisions, including through active engagement with
or participation in investee company decision-making.
Larger sovereigns with internal asset management
capability were most confident in their ability to
execute their ESG strategies, due to their higher levels
of engagement with their investments (figure 25).
These larger sovereigns noted that direct engagement
benefits substantially outweighed the cost of external
advisers and representation; notably
- The largest sovereigns drew a clear line from long-
term investor influence on corporate structure
and executive remuneration to ‘active’ investment
performance through the cycle
- Sovereigns felt able to better represent the interest
of government or non-government stakeholders
through direct engagement
- Finally, for sovereigns committed to ESG, direct
governance engagement provided a mechanism
to proactively drive an ESG agenda in future

performance data, while growth in active ownership
requires third-party assistance

The adoption of negative screens is encouraging

for ESG advocates; however, the majority of current

non-adopters are unwilling to move further in the

absence of strong objective evidence of positive
investment risk/return outcomes from ESG investing
relative to cost. ESG adopters overwhelmingly
observe a positive differential in long-term returns

(with 70% of respondents perceiving an increase

in returns from ESG as seen in figure 26), and

many adopters explained that they were seeking to

integrate systematic ESG risk measurement into the

investment process. However, ESG user and non-user
respondents acknowledge that there is a need for
robust data on integrated ESG strategies, which can
only be addressed through continued measurement
of the impact on performance.

Despite uncertainties around the impact of ESG
integration, there is a growing consensus among all
respondents on the positive effect of governance
on investment returns. However, there are many
challenges to developing and managing an active
ownership strategy:

- Many sovereigns have not defined their governance
principles and were wary of demanding levels of
transparency from their investees that the sovereign
fund itself did not provide

- The adoption of active ownership requires hiring
subject matter experts, and many investment
sovereign respondents were intent on using
recruitment budget to expand internal investment
teams

- Certain sovereigns did not hold shareholder voting
rights across the majority of their securities and
were wary of the costs involved in switching these
investments for those with voting rights

- Many respondents stated that they were challenged
by lack of engagement from consultants and asset
managers

While smaller sovereigns have been dissuaded from

investment engagement by these cost restraints,

evidence of benefits in returns and representation

of sovereign interests will be key in driving greater

uptake of sovereign active ownership. With some

sovereigns looking internally to invest, based on the
ability to embed government-based engagement,
asset managers must respond by offering sovereigns
the opportunity participate in the stewardship of
companies by means of voting rights.

had attained the requisite legal age. Finally, although 18 U.S.C. §2423(f)(2) also defines “illicit
sexual conduct” as any commercial sex act with a person under the age of 18, 18 U.S.C. §2423(g)
also provides a specific affirmative defense as to that age element if proven by a preponderance of
the evidence that Mr. Epstein reasonably believed that the young women had attained the requisite
legal age. As we have demonstrated, time and again the women involved lied to Mr. Epstein as to
their true age, representing that they were, in fact, over the age of 18. Many of them also represented
that they worked at local massage parlors, which presumably would have imposed a legal age
requirement.

Lastly, in contrast to 18 U.S.C. §1591, Mr. Epstein’s conduct did not involve trafficking of
women or children in the sex industry, and was not part of any phenomenon that, in the aggregate,
had an economic impact on interstate or foreign commerce. Additionally, Mr. Epstein did not
benefit financially from the alleged conduct. Therefore, as the SAO determined, and still believes,
Mr. Epstein was a customer, a “John” for whom prosecutions are best left to the State to address.
Indeed, there is no reported precedent extending federal law to a local “John” who does not violate
the child exploitation statutes. Indeed, CEOS does not point to a single case where federal
prosecutors have used § 1591 ina case involving facts like these. Instead, every § 1591 prosecution
has involved national or international sex trafficking and/or for-profit prostitution rings, involving
the knowing use of minors and/or forcible coercion, or forcible rape, physical abuse or intimidation.
These are the elements required by the statute, and they are not met here.

Although CEOS could, perhaps, point to United States v. Evans, 476 F.3d 1176 (11 Cir.
2007) as a case that, standing alone, involved wholly intrastate conduct, the facts of that case are far
different in key respects than this one. The Evans case involved both the commercial and coercive
components that Congress, and administration policy statements intended in 18 U.S.C. § 1591
prosecutions. Evans, and his co-conspirators (Madison and Yearby) were not “Johns.” They
operated a for profit prostitution ring marked by control of, and extreme violence toward, the
victims, who they knew were underage. Indeed, Evans forced one such victim, age 14 years old, to
continue to work even after she had been hospitalized with AIDS. As part of their business, Evans
and his co-conspirators provided the victims with cell phones, hotels, and condoms, and the victims
were forced to give all of their money from this prostitution ring to Evans and his co-conspirators.
None of this type of activity comes close to the facts regarding Mr. Epstein. Finally, but significantly,
the prostitution ring in Evans was not, in fact, entirely intrastate as the companion case of one of the
Evans co-defendants makes clear. See, United States v. Madison, 477 F.3d 1312, 1313-1314 (1 14
Cir. 2007) (Jane Doe #2 stated that she traveled to Atlanta, Georgia with Madison to work as a
prostitute).

Thus, courts, including the Eleventh Circuit in Evans, have underscored the point that § 1591
simply is not intended to cover the kind of alleged conduct at issue here. “Section 1591 does not
criminalize all acts of prostitution (a vice traditionally governed by state regulation). Rather, its
reach is limited to sex trafficking that involves children or is accomplished by force, fraud, or
coercion.” United States v. Evans, 476 F.3d at 1179 n. 1; See also United States v. Sims, 171 Fed.

The Third Law offers comfort to those who believe that until we understand

But there is a loophole in the Third Law. It is entirely possible to build something

existing nuclear states to advance toward that goal, will do more to
spread than contain nuclear weapons—directly, by encouraging some
current non-nuclear states to consider developing nuclear weapons,
and indirectly, by displacing and undermining other more effective
strategies. At the heart of the case for global zero is an argument—
that reductions (on the way to zero) in our nuclear force will lead
others to reduce theirs or curtail or abandon plans to acquire them
altogether—that ignores history, logic, and politics.

One important reason why most friends and allies of the United
States (Britain and France being the exceptions) have not sought
nuclear weapons of their own has been our readiness to extend the
protection of our nuclear deterrent to cover them. Germany, Japan,
and South Korea, all quite capable of building nuclear weapons, went
through even the precarious periods of the Cold War confident that
our nuclear force made it unnecessary for them to have nuclear forces
of their own. Where the United States was unwilling or unable to
offer protection to countries that believed themselves threatened—
India and Pakistan, for example—those countries did build
independent nuclear capabilities. If the United States is seen to be
heading toward eliminating its nuclear capabilities, countries that
have relied on us may decide that they must acquire their own nuclear
weapons. This is especially true in a region where another state, like
Iran, is pursuing nuclear weapons and is likely to obtain them, thus
alarming and frightening its neighbors into an arms race they would
rather avoid. The sad history of the nuclearization of the Indian
subcontinent, for instance, appears to have begun with India
responding to China’s nuclearization, followed by Pakistan
responding to India’s. If the United States is seen to be on a path to
relinquishing nuclear weapons, is it reasonable to expect the Japanese
and the South Koreans, long sheltered by our deterrent, to remain
indifferent to the nuclear forces of China and North Korea?

Nobody has ever had to balance transformational and conservative
roles on a global scale before.

From an American point of view, the Arab Spring is just another
complication of this global task — a sudden thunderstorm with
flashes of lightening, driving rain and unpredictable gusts of wind as
we hop one-legged on the tightrope changing our pants. The Islamic
world is entering new territory as it struggles to integrate religious
and liberal political values; as the United States tries to juggle its
geopolitical interests with its values at a volatile moment in world
history, we are almost certain to get the balance wrong much of the
time.

Here, however, history offers some hope. As I wrote at the beginning
of this post, the United States has been doing two things for more
than 200 years: getting foreign revolutions wrong, but somehow still
pushing its global revolution forward. America’s success as a
conservative revolutionary power on a global scale depends less on
the clever policies of our presidents and our secretaries of state, and
more on the creativity and dynamism of American society as a whole.
It is power of a free people more than the brilliance of our intellectual
and social establishment that has brought the United States this far; in
that truth lies the secret of our revolution and of our success.

something like this there had to be some sign of who had done it. But they
looked the same as before, eating and talking as if nothing had happened.

The Yemenis also needed jobs. This led to a challenge for Mishmar
Hasharon. The core of the kibbutz ethos was that we would live from our own
labor. Yet Ben-Gurion insisted we and other kibbutzim provide work for the
Yemenis and other new arrivals from the Arab states. We began hiring Yemeni
workers when I was about ten, the age when we kids started working for an
hour or so each day in the fields. We worked alongside several dozen Yemeni
women who lived a few miles north in a maabarah, a transit settlement which
later evolved into a village called Elyakhin. Each morning, the Yemenis arrived
in a bus, and they left at the end of their day’s work.

I don’t know whether I expected to feel a Gordonian sense of joy at the
redemptive value of physical labor when I began working in the fields. Our first
assignment was to plant long rows of flower bulbs — gladioli — spaced at
intervals of four inches or so. But as I joined the other children and the Yemeni
women, what I felt was more mundane. Heat. Fatigue. Boredom. To make the
time pass, I thought of it as a competition. Each of us began together, planting
the bulbs in furrows stretching to the end of the field. The point was obviously
to do it right. But I found it interesting to see who finished first, and how much
longer it took the rest of us.

The same worker always led the way. She was a Yemeni in her early thirties.
Her name was Baddura. Short and stocky, with dark curly hair, she was nearly
always smiling, whether we were planting bulbs, sowing seeds or picking
oranges and grapefruit and lemons, potatoes or peppers and tomatoes. When I
remarked to her how much better and faster she was than the rest of us, she
laughed. Still years away from growing into my adult body, I looked more like a
eight- or a nine-year-old. She took me under her wing. The next day, we were
picking tomatoes. “Do the row next to mine,” she said. Watching the almost
balletic grace with which she moved made it easier. I decided it was like
mastering a new piece on the piano. The secret was to achieve a kind of
unthinking fluidity, by focusing on the passage one or two ahead of the one you
were playing. Physically, Baddura was far stronger than me. Before long,
however, I was finishing my sowing or reaping a good ten yards ahead of the
other kids, and not too far behind her.

Though the Yemenis worked in our fields, they were not members of the
kibbutz. They were paid a day-rate. Though they were by far the most

It didn’t exactly surprise Bannon when Trump flipped; Bannon understood how easy it
was to bullshit a bullshitter. Bannon also recognized that the Ryan rapprochement spoke to
Trump’s new appreciation of where he found himself. It was not just that Ryan had been
willing to bow to Trump, but that Trump was willing to bow to his own fears about how
little he actually knew about being president. If Ryan could be counted on to handle
Congress, thought the president, well, phew, that takes care of that.

7 OK Ok

Trump had little or no interest in the central Republican goal of repealing Obamacare. An
overweight seventy-year-old man with various physical phobias (for instance, he lied
about his height to keep from having a body mass index that would label him as obese), he
personally found health care and medical treatments of all kinds a distasteful subject. The
details of the contested legislation were, to him, particularly boring; his attention would
begin wandering from the first words of a policy discussion. He would have been able to
enumerate few of the particulars of Obamacare—other than expressing glee about the silly
Obama pledge that everyone could keep his or her doctor—and he certainly could not
make any kind of meaningful distinction, positive or negative, between the health care
system before Obamacare and the one after.

Prior to his presidency, he had likely never had a meaningful discussion in his life
about health insurance. “No one in the country, or on earth, has given less thought to
health insurance than Donald,” said Roger Ailes. Pressed in a campaign interview about
the importance of Obamacare repeal and reform, Trump was, to say the least, quite unsure
of its place on the agenda: “This is an important subject but there are a lot of important
subjects. Maybe it is in the top ten. Probably is. But there is heavy competition. So you
can’t be certain. Could be twelve. Or could be fifteen. Definitely top twenty for sure.”

It was another one of his counterintuitive connections to many voters: Obama and
Hillary Clinton seemed actually to want to talk about health care plans, whereas Trump,
like most everybody else, absolutely did not.

All things considered, he probably preferred the notion of more people having health
insurance than fewer people having it. He was even, when push came to shove, rather
more for Obamacare than for repealing Obamacare. As well, he had made a set of rash
Obama-like promises, going so far as to say that under a forthcoming Trumpcare plan (he
had to be strongly discouraged from using this kind of rebranding—political wise men
told him that this was one instance where he might not want to claim ownership with his
name), no one would lose their health insurance, and that preexisting conditions would
continue to be covered. In fact, he probably favored government-funded health care more
than any other Republican. “Why can’t Medicare simply cover everybody?” he had
impatiently wondered aloud during one discussion with aides, all of whom were careful

Kickass Vegan Chocolate Chip Cookies

This is a modified version of a recipe that I originally found here, and some of the text
comes from that recipe.

+ 1 and 1/2 cups of FLOUR

+ | teaspoon BAKING SODA

+ 1 teaspoon SALT

+ 3/4 cup of OIL

+ 2 tablespoons COCONUT MILK (or ALMOND MILK or SOY MILK)
+ 1 & 1/3 cups of UNREFINED SUGAR

+ HALF A BANANA

+ 1 1/2 tablespoons VANILLA EXTRACT (I've occasionally used RUM as a
replacement; when I do that, I like to add some CINNAMON)

+ 2 1/2 cups OATMEAL
+ 12 oz. of DARK CHOCOLATE CHIPS

Heat your oven to 350 degrees.
Mix FLOUR, BAKING SODA and SALT together. Set aside.

Mix together the OIL and SUGAR. Mix until creamy. Thoroughly mash the BANANA
into the mixture.

Add the COCONUT MILK.

Add the VANILLA.

Stir this mixture until it is a uniform color (this will not take long).
Slowly stir in the FLOUR mixture. Mix this well.

Stir in OATMEAL and CHOCOLATE-CHIPS.

Preheat oven to baking temperature (usually 350 F).

Place large tablespoons full of the batter onto an ungreased cookie sheet (an air filled
cookie sheet works best, as the air between the two layers of the sheet keeps the bottom
of baked items from burning).

Bake the cookies for about 9 to 13 minutes (ovens vary in temperature). Check them by
gently pressing on the top of one of the cookies. If the inside looks moist, but not too wet,
they are probably done. It might take you a couple of tries to get the time down, so bake
only a few at a time when starting out. Do not, I repeat, do not expect to see them turn

diamond ring appeared from the ether as his fingers crossed under my reading light.

Mark was a legitimate magnate. He had, at different times, run practically all the gas stations,
convenience stores, and gambling in South Carolina. He confessed with a half smile that, in an average
trip to Sin City, he and his fellow weekend warriors might lose an average of $500,000 to $1,000,000—
each. Nice.

He sat up in his seat as the conversation drifted to my travels, but I was more interested in his
astounding record of printing money.

“So, of all your businesses, which did you like the most?”
The answer took less than a second of thought.
“None of them.”

He explained that he had spent more than 30 years with people he didn’t like to buy things he didn’t
need. Life had become a succession of trophy wives—he was on lucky number three—expensive cars,
and other empty bragging rights. Mark was one of the living dead.

This is exactly where we don’t want to end up.

Europe, President Franklin D. Roosevelt reactivated the operation
as the Signal Security Agency. It proved its value in breaking the
Japanese machine-generated cipher “Purple.” In June 1942, using
deciphered Japanese messages to pinpoint the location of the Japa-
nese fleet at Midway, America won a decisive naval victory in the
Pacific. Germany’s Enigma encoding machines, with three encoding
wheels, proved more of a challenge. Initially, British cryptanalysts
led by the brilliant mathematician Alan Turing succeeded in build-
ing a rudimentary computer to decipher Germany’s messages to its
submarines and bombers, but in 1942 Germany added a fourth set of
encoding wheels, escalating what was essentially a battle of machine
intelligence. The U.S. Navy then contracted with the National Cash
Register Company to build a computing machine capable of break-
ing the improved Enigma, and in May 1943 it succeeded.

By the time the war ended in 1945, the United States had over
one hundred giant decryption machines in operation. This unrivaled
capability to read the communications of foreign nations, which
remained one of America’s most closely guarded secrets, was trans-

© ferred to the Army Security Agency based at Fort Meade, Mary- ©
land. Then, on October 24, 1952, President Harry S. Truman greatly
expanded its purview and changed its name to the National Security
Agency.

The NSA was given two missions. The first one was protecting
the communications of the U.S. government. The main risk was that
the Soviets would find a way of breaching U.S. government chan-
nels of communications. The second mission was intercepting all the
relevant communications and signals of foreign governments. This
latter mandate included the governments of allies as well as enemies.
The president, the other intelligence services, and the Department
of Defense deemed what was relevant for national security. Even
though the NSA remained part of the Department of Defense, its
job went far beyond providing military intelligence. It also acted as
a service agency to other American intelligence services. They pre-
pared shopping lists of foreign communications intelligence targets
for the NSA to pursue.

As the Cold War heated up in the 1960s, the NSA provided intel-
ligence not only to the Pentagon but to the Department of State, the

Mr. Tarek El Sayed,
| hope this email finds you well, and believe worth communicating my thoughts to you.

| was surprised to hear that you decided against the purchase of our Super Boeing 727.1 personally thought it was a great match for
your business needs in Qatar. If for any reason your decision was based on crew issues and charter needs in the Middle East, I'd like
to share some information that might prove beneficial to making you reconsider this purchase.

The pilot candidates | have lined up for your interview along with the possibility of David Rodgers joining your flight department
were as follows:

(at no time did | disclose location or persons to the following pilot candidates to protect your privacy.)

Robert Breslin, who is the former Chief Pilot of Mr. Donald Trump, Mr. Breslin flew the Boeing 727 and Boeing 757 owned by Mr
Trump. Mr Breslin is a fine man of 40 years of age estimate, with extensive VIP Boeing operations.

James Bartakowski, who has extensive flying experience in the Middle east, Africa and Europe régime. Mr. Bartakowski has also
been involved in charter operations in Africa and Middle East and has contacted me on several recent occasions with charters for
our Boeing 727, James has indicated there is the possibility of 40 —- 60 hours per month charter operations for larger transport
category aircraft in your area. | believe there is a growing need for charter in the business community in Qatar and neighboring
countries.

Bruce Jafahri, who is a current Boeing 727 captain who lived in Doha for two years, and familiar with international operations of
Boeing 727 aircraft. Mr. Jafahri currently lives in California and ready for a new opportunity. Bruce is current in the Boeing 727 and
also flew Captain on the Boeing 747. Well qualified individual and personable.

Mr. El Sayed, as you have seen during our demo flight, our Boeing 727 is in impeccable condition, quite cabin and will provide many
years of charter and business flights your company. | believe the large business jet future in Qatar is growing and you will be leading
its path, and your initial investment in this purchase will not come close with other aircraft options on the market as you may have
seen already.

We are currently completing the C2C check on the Boeing, and as we have done in the past, assure you it will be a fine aircraft
when it leaves Flight Star Maintenance repair facility.

Sincerely,

hold out, though earlier in the week Bannon had harshly ordered the Freedom Caucus to
vote for the bill—“a silly Bannon show,” according to Walsh.) At three-thirty, Ryan called
the president to say he was short fifteen to twenty votes and needed to pull the vote.
Bannon, backed by Mulvaney, who had become the White House’s Hill operative,
continued to urge an immediate vote. A defeat here would be a major defeat for the
Republican leadership. That suited Bannon just fine: let them fail.

But the president backed down. Faced with this singular opportunity to make the
Republican leadership the issue, and to name them as the problem, Trump wobbled,
provoking in Bannon a not-so-silent rage. Ryan then leaked that it was the president who
had asked him to cancel the vote.

Over the weekend, Bannon called a long list of reporters and told them—off the record,
but hardly—“T don’t see Ryan hanging around a long time.”

OOK Ok

After the bill had been pulled that Friday, Katie Walsh, feeling both angry and disgusted,
told Kushner she wanted out. Outlining what she saw as the grim debacle of the Trump
White House, she spoke with harsh candor about bitter rivalries joined to vast
incompetence and an uncertain mission. Kushner, understanding that she needed to be
discredited immediately, leaked that she had been leaking and hence had to be pushed out.

On Sunday evening, Walsh had dinner with Bannon in his Capitol Hill redoubt, the
Breitbart Embassy, during which, to no avail, he implored her to stay. On Monday she
sorted out the details with Priebus—she would leave to work part time for the RNC and
part time for the Trump (c)(4), the outside campaign group. By Thursday she was gone.

Ten weeks into the new administration, the Trump White House had lost, after Michael
Flynn, its second senior staff member—and the one whose job it was to actually get things
done.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013806.txt,"What does an igloo-dwelling millionaire do that a cubicle-dweller doesn’t? Follow an uncommon set
of rules.

How does a lifelong blue-chip employee escape to travel the world for a month without his boss even
noticing? He uses technology to hide the fact.

Gold is getting old. The New Rich (NR) are those who abandon the deferred-life plan and create
luxury lifestyles in the present using the currency of the New Rich: time and mobility. This is an art and
a science we will refer to as Lifestyle Design (LD).

I’ve spent the last three years traveling among those who live in worlds currently beyond your
imagination. Rather than hating reality, Il show you how to bend it to your will. It’s easier than it
sounds. My journey from grossly overworked and severely underpaid office worker to member of the
NR is at once stranger than fiction and—now that I’ve deciphered the code—simple to duplicate. There
is a recipe.

Life doesn’t have to be so damn hard. It really doesn’t. Most people, my past self included, have spent
too much time convincing themselves that life has to be hard, a resignation to 9-to-5 drudgery in
exchange for (sometimes) relaxing weekends and the occasional keep-it-short-or-get-fired vacation.

The truth, at least the truth I live and will share in this book, is quite different. From leveraging
currency differences to outsourcing your life and disappearing, I'll show you how a small underground
uses economic sleight-of-hand to do what most consider impossible.

If you’ve picked up this book, chances are that you don’t want to sit behind a desk until you are 62.
Whether your dream is escaping the rat race, real-life fantasy travel, long-term wandering, setting world
records, or simply a dramatic career change, this book will give you all the tools you need to make it a
reality in the here-and-now instead of in the often elusive “retirement.” There is a way to get the rewards
for a life of hard work without waiting until the end.

How? It begins with a simple distinction most people miss—one I missed for 25 years.

People don’t want to be millionaires—they want to experience what they believe only millions can
buy. Ski chalets, butlers, and exotic travel often enter the picture. Perhaps rubbing cocoa butter on your
belly in a hammock while you listen to waves rhythmically lapping against the deck of your thatched-
roof bungalow? Sounds nice.

$1,000,000 in the bank isn’t the fantasy. The fantasy is the lifestyle of complete freedom it supposedly
allows. The question is then, How can one achieve the millionaire lifestyle of complete freedom without
first having $1,000,000?

In the last five years, I have answered this question for myself, and this book will answer it for you. I
will show you exactly how I have separated income from time and created my ideal lifestyle in the
process, traveling the world and enjoying the best this planet has to offer. How on earth did I go from
14-hour days and $40,000 per year to 4-hour weeks and $40,000-plus per month?

It helps to know where it all started. Strangely enough, it was in a class of soon-to-be investment
bankers.

In 2002, I was asked by Ed Zschau, tibermentor and my former professor of High-tech
Entrepreneurship at Princeton University, to come back and speak to the same class about my business
adventures in the real world. I was stuck. There were already decamillionaires speaking to the same
class, and even though I had built a highly profitable sports supplement company, I marched to a
distinctly different drummer.

Over the ensuing days, however, I realized that everyone seemed to be discussing how to build large
and successful companies, sell out, and live the good life. Fair enough. The question no one really
seemed to be asking or answering was, Why do it all in the first place? What is the pot of gold that
justifies spending the best years of your life hoping for happiness in the last?

The lectures I ultimately developed, titled “Drug Dealing for Fun and Profit,’ began with a simple

gon belatedly created the U.S. Cyber Command in 2009. In it, the
cyber-defense units of the army, navy, marines, and air force cyber
forces were merged together and put under the command of the
NSA director. General Keith Alexander became the first director
of this new command. One problem for the Cyber Command was
separating attacks by civilians, including criminals, hacktivists, and
anarchists, from cyber warfare sponsored and supported by adver-
sary states. Because foreign intelligence services often closely imi-
tated the tools of civilian hackers, and were even known to provide
them with hacking tools, it was not easy for the Cyber Command
to unambiguously determine if the ultimate perpetrator of a cyber
attack was state sponsored. For example, the identification of North
Korea as the principal actor behind the attack on Sony in December
2014 appeared to be a rare success, but many cyber-security experts
believed that it might be a false trail used to hide the real attacker.
Clues could be fabricated in cyberspace to point to the wrong party.

The job of the Cyber Command was to prevent such an attack. To

this end, it planted viruses on hundreds of thousands of computers

© in private hands to act as sentinels to spot other suspicious viruses ®
that could mount such an attack. Private computers had become
a new battleground in the cyber wars. It also built a capability to
retaliate. Still, cyber attacks, which were launched through layers of
other countries’ computers, could not be unambiguously traced back
to the true perpetrator.

This escalation by the Cyber Command set the stage for expanded
forms of warfare in cyberspace. “The Chinese are viewed as the
source of a great many attacks on western infrastructure and just
recently, the U.S. electrical grid,” General Alexander said in explain-
ing the need for this consolidation. “If that is determined to be an
organized attack, I would want to go and take down the source of
those attacks.” The same retaliation would presumably be used
against Russia, Iran, or any other adversary. Dominance of cyber-
space itself now became part of the NSA’s mandate.

Even so, the most important job of the NSA remained intercept-
ing secret information from Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.
To this end, it had an annual budget of $12.3 billion and some thirty-
five thousand military and civilian employees. In 2013, James Clap-

the Palestinians, including Hamas, over the past months and years. There
has only been some cosmetic and tactical changes. Washington, the
European Union and the UN have not only signaled to Hamas that it
should join the “broken and paralyzed” peace process, they have also
insisted that the Palestinians explicitly recognize Israel. But this time,
those powers are armed with an “Islamic religious cloak,” which would
make a recognition of Israel more meaningful, especially since Hamas
considers its conflict with Israel to be an ideological “existential conflict,
not a border dispute.” That pressure is accompanied with a financial and
economic blockade, which is increasing the pressure on Hamas, especially
since those carrying out the blockade are blocking anything that would
alleviate Palestinian suffering. It is clear that they want to punish the
Palestinians for electing Hamas and warn them against reelecting them;
that is if the reconciliation succeeds and the elections happen on time. It
should be noted that certain Israeli and Western research institutions have
estimated the timeframe that Hamas will need to explicitly recognize
Israel. They may accept from Hamas certain rhetorical signals for a while
before the movement officially recognizes Israel. Since Hamas was
founded in late 1987, it has been conducting an ideological and political
campaign for its members and supporters against recognizing Israel.
Hamas’ constitution says that Israel is a “cancer that must be eradicated,”
and that “its demise is a Quranic inevitability.” Those and other slogans
have been a key component of Hamas’s political discourse. It is therefore
not easy for Hamas to change overnight due to political realism and
suddenly tell its supporters: We shall recognize Israel, but it’s under
duress!

months into the school year, he told the leaders of Mishmar Hasharon, and then
my parents, that I would have to leave. My father was especially upset. A
couple of years earlier, he’d had visions of my staying on in the regional high
school and going to university. Now, I’d been unable to hold my own in Rupin.
Still, both he and my mother were relieved when Mishmar Hasharon and the
school worked out a compromise which did not end my studies altogether. The
expulsion stood, but I was allowed to continue attending math and science
classes.

For my mother, the blow was softened by the fact I began working almost
full-time on the kibbutz, alongside Yigal, driving a tractor. I woke up early and
accompanied him into the fields of wheat, barley or rye. We also made a series
of trips 130 miles south into the Negev to a moshav called Patish. It had been
set up by newly arrived Moroccan Jews. Since they didn’t have the equipment
or know-how to cultivate all their fields, they were renting out some of the land.
Mishmar Hasharon had contracted to farm a parcel of 450 acres.

For ten days at a time, Yigal and I would place a tractor on the back of a
pickup and head to Patish. We worked from four in the morning until sundown.
After work, we ate at a tiny family-run restaurant a few miles away in Ofakim, a
so-called “development town” populated by Moroccan Jews who had been
moved there as soon as they arrived in Israel. Far from regretting not being in
school, I drew satisfaction, and pride, from knowing that I was functioning as an
independent adult. But it also gave me time to think. My whole life had been
circumscribed by the struggle to create and secure the state. But I again found
myself pondering issues of basic fairness in our young country, and the
challenge of reconciling our words and principles with our deeds amid the
difficult realities of building the state.

Back on the kibbutz, it was the example of the kindly and hard-working
Baddura which had caused me to question how we were treating the Jews who
had arrived from Yemen. In the Negev, I met members of the even larger post-
war influx from Morocco. One image struck me above all. It was from the place
Yigal and I ate dinner. Ofakim was a development town that had yet to develop.
It had no visible means of support, and there was no sign the government was
doing much to remedy that or integrate the new immigrants economically and
socially. The “restaurant” was a side business a family had set up in the dining
room of their tiny home. The sixth or seventh time we went there, I was startled
by sudden movement a couple of feet away from where we were sitting.

Now, how can this living New Age parable be applied to Auman
behavior? Well, whatever you do personally to help further the cause of
justice and the pursuit of ecstasy, even though you might get discouraged,
you must always remember that you might be the one who turns the
tide—you have to act as though you are the 100th monkey—and this
gives us reason to hope.

That’ s the good news.

The bad news is, those monkeys needed that dirt in their diet for
roughage. So now there were all these monkeys on this island who
weren’ t able to shit.

But it just so happened that this was one of the islands where we
shipped our surplus TV sets. Across the island, monkeys were gathered
around those TV sets, all watching a program that was sponsored by Ex-
Lax. Moreover, here was that commercial with the sign-language
translation. And, fortuitously enough, these monkeys had relatives trained
at Stanford University, where they learned how to communicate in sign
language, and had been returned to the island to teach others of their

species how to sign.

on another platform, or the dwell time on a particular advertisement, or where the user
has walked or driven with their GPS-enabled smartphone—the total systems of many
programs communicating with one another and with databases leads to a whole new loss
of privacy. The great exploitative leap made by so many West Coast companies has been
to monetize those inferences without the knowing permission of the person generating the
interactions with the computing machine platforms.

Wiener, Turing, and von Neumann could not foresee the complexity of those
platforms, wherein the legal mumbo-jumbo of the terms-of-use contracts the humans
willingly enter into, without an inkling of what they entail, leads them to give up rights
they would never concede in a one-on-one interaction with another human being. The
computation platforms have become a shield behind which some companies hide in order
to inhumanly exploit others. In certain other countries, the governments carry out these
manipulations, and there the goal 1s not profits but the suppression of dissent.

Humankind has gotten itself into a fine pickle: We are being exploited by
companies that paradoxically deliver services we crave, and at the same time our lives
depend on many software-enabled systems that are open to attack. Getting ourselves out
of this mess will be a long-term project. It will involve engineering, legislation, and most
important, moral leadership. Moral leadership is the first and biggest challenge.

Turkey’s new challenges

Stephen Kinzer

June 14, 2011 -- SUNDAY’S ELECTION in Turkey was another
reminder of the country’s astonishing rise, which has been one of the
most dramatic geopolitical stories of the last decade. For the first 80
years of its existence as a nation, Turkey was dominated by generals
and played almost no role in the world. Now it is a vibrant democracy
and a major force in the Middle East, the Caucasus, North Africa, the
Balkans, and beyond. The election was a triumph for Prime Minister
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has presided over his country’s
remarkable transformation. His party won more votes than all other
parties combined, making him the first Turkish prime minister in
more than half a century to win three consecutive terms. He will
naturally be tempted to take this victory as a mandate to charge ahead
with his own projects. Instead he should do the opposite: curb his
divisive rhetoric, adjust his authoritarian style, and seek broad
support for projects that will strengthen Turkey and help calm the
world’s most volatile region.

Syrians who are racing toward Turkey in search of refuge represent
Erdogan’s most immediate challenge. Turkey has become not just a
safe haven, but a model for what many Arabs would like to see their
countries become. This model — a government with roots in Islam
but also committed to democracy, free enterprise, and good relations
with Europe and the United States — represents the dream of
millions of Tunisians, Libyans, Egyptians, Yemenis, Syrians,
Jordanians, and Palestinians.

Finding a way to stabilize the ever-more-turbulent Middle East is
Turkey’s most urgent task. Erdogan is obsessed with his drive to

2. WTC Attack — 9/11 (2001)

3. BENGHAZ1 Attack — 9/11 (2012)

But you have to remember that H. W. Bush was planted:

AUTHOR PETER DALE SCOTT: Sometimes you have little deep events that most people don't even
notice. One of those would be the Halloween Massacre. The older people remember the Saturday
Night Massacre which happened under Nixon. I'm talking about the Halloween Massacre of October
31, 1975, and probably people watching this show have never heard of it.

That was under Ford, and Ford may have condoned it because it was trying to help restore his
popularity. He was going way down in the polls. But it was a very important series of events all on
the same night. The head of the CIA was fired, William Colby, replaced by a relatively unknown man
called George H. W. Bush who then went on to authorize something that Colby had refused to
authorize - the Team B report - the Team B to recalculate the Soviet threat and it was pre-
determined. They were going to find that it was much bigger than the professionals angled like
Raymond [inaudible] that | mentioned.

They said Russia is less of a threat now than it used to be. Well, that was terrible news for the
industrial complex so the Team B came in and said oh, no, no, no, it's much more of a threat than it
used to be, and that’s why we got this huge military build-up. It started actually under Carter but we
think of it as the Reagan build-up, and that of course is a major factor in having ended the Soviet
Union because the Soviet Union tried to match it with a weaker economy. And that arms race which
was not about threats but was about fighting economic war, that was an arms race which you could
say that the Soviet Union lost because they couldn't keep it up. Their economy went more and more
downhill because they were deflecting resources away from vital domestic functions. But really I'm
trying to talk here about the Halloween Massacre...

Just the change in the CIA was a major historical event but it wasn't very visible. The second thing
that happened was they fired Jim Schlesinger as Secretary of Defense... It was being done by
[President Ford's] Chief of Staff and his assistant who are two names barely known then but quite
famous since. Chief of staff was Donald Rumsfeld and the assistant was Dick Cheney. And that was
the first real intrusion of the Rumsfeld-Cheney team into American politics. And they became the real
heart of what | consider the Deep State in the 1980s when they were planning for Continuity of
Government which was a plan for emergency rules like warrantless surveillance and warrantless
detention and the militarization of homeland security. All those things were planned all through the
‘80s - COG planning by Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney. Even when Rumsfeld wasn't in the
government, he was authorized by Reagan to do this planning.

And why is that important to our history? Because in 2001, these two men were now in the
government - Vice President and Secretary of Defense - the two top people in Washington on
September the 11th, 2001 when Bush was down in Florida - George W. Bush - and what did they do
on that day? They implemented the plans they had been planning for 20 years. Another major event
in American history but it's not usually told that way.

We implemented - it’s in the 9/11 Commission Report that COG plans were implemented on that
day. This is a huge change in our country. We now have an ARMY command, NORTHCOM, to take
charge of America - North America, the way SOUTHCOM is in charge of South America and
CENTCOM is in charge of Central Asia.

terrorist attacks.

Although both are Asian powers, they differ so much that developing the
capacity to work closely with both, and learning from each, would be a
major step forward in mastering the management of a truly global order.
The rapid spread of Western-style universities and orchestras in China will
provide new bridges between China and the West. The exceptionally
successful ethnic Indian community in the United States will provide
bridges with India. And all this cooperation will accentuate the process of
civilizational fusion.

In contrast to China and India, Russia has held back from thoroughly
embracing modernity, even though the Soviet Union started modernizing
before China and India. Russia hesitated to join the World Trade
Organization and has not yet accepted that ungrudging participation in the
current rules-based order can facilitate its own progress. The more Beijing
and New Delhi prosper, however, the more persuasive will be the case for
Moscow to follow their lead.

As it works closely with the major developing powers, the West should also
step up its efforts to construct a robust rules-based world in general. In
2003, former U.S. President Bill Clinton said that Americans should try to
create a world with rules and partnerships and habits of behavior that we
would like to live in when we're no longer the military, political, economic
superpower in the world. If Clinton's fellow citizens could accept such
advice, the citizens of most other countries would be willing to do the same.
And this might be easier to achieve than many believe.

Much of today's global multilateral architecture was a valuable gift from the
West to the world. Yet the major Western powers have also made sure that
these institutions have never grown strong enough or independent enough
to make real trouble for their creators. UN secretary-generals have been
creatures of the permanent members of the Security Council, the leaders of
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have been drawn
exclusively from the United States and Europe, and dominance in these
financial institutions has occasionally been exploited to achieve extra-
financial goals. These policies should be reconsidered, for the legitimacy of
the system depends on the perception that its rules are developed by and
applied fairly and equally to all, rather than that they cater to the narrow
interests of a few. Picking strong leaders for the major international
institutions and keeping those institutions’ operations from being
undermined or politicized would be a major step forward.

Western policymakers, finally, should work to highlight the good things that
are happening around the world rather than harp on the bad things.
Hundreds of millions of people have emerged from poverty in recent
decades even as military conflicts have decreased. The convergence of global
aspirations means that a vast majority of countries want to see evolution

Thanks for sending. A wide area of agreement, but not total. 
On confronting dogma, I of course agree — though in my opinion the secular religions — nationalist fanaticism, etc. — are 
much more dangerous. And if some find rational discussion offensive — as, for example, mainstream academics find 
dismantling myths of American exceptionalism or Israeli self-defense or Obama's mass murder campaign, etc., 
offensive — so be it. 
But I don't see why that should extend to ridicule. That includes astrologists. Astronomers can refute astrology, while 
recognizing that perfectly honest and deluded people may believe it and should be treated with respect, while their 
beliefs are confronted with evidence. I also don't see why we should ridicule religious dogma, just as I don't think we 
should ridicule the much more pernicious secular dogmas. Rather, we should respond to irrational belief with argument 
and evidence, while recognizing that their advocates (like most of the intellectual world in the case of secular dogma) 
are people who we should be responding to but without ridiculing them. It may be hard sometimes. For example, when 
the icon and founding father of sober non-sentimental Realism in International Affairs informs us that the US, unlike 
other countries, has a transcendental purpose, and the fact that it constantly acts in contradiction to its purpose 
doesn't matter because the facts are just abuse of history while real history is the evidence of history as our minds 
reflect it, then it's hard to avoid ridicule. But we should. There's no point ridiculing virtually the entire IR profession 
and the major journals, even though such extraordinary irrationality leads to major human disasters. 
On Davis, I frankly think that's a non-issue. If she decides she cannot do her job as the conditions of employment 
require (including following the law), then she can quit and look for another job. As in any other such case.

where the <.5> denotes the probability, which is a component of the Truth Value associated
with the edge.

Next, the most basic functional edge is the Execution edge, which is ternary and denotes a
relation between a Schema, its input and its output, e.g.

Execution father_of Ben_Goertzel Ted_Goertzel

or a schema father_ of that outputs the father of its argument.
The ExecutionOutput (ExOut) edge denotes the output of a Schema in an implicit way, e.g.

ExOut say_hello

refers to a particular act of saying hello, whereas

ExOut add_numbers {3, 4)

refers to the Concept corresponding to 7. Note that this latter example involves a set of three
entities: sets are also part of the basic SMEPH knowledge representation. A set may be thought
of as a hypergraph edge that points to all its members.

In this manner we may define a set of edges and vertices modeling the habitual activity
patterns of a system when in different situations. This is called the derived hypergraph of the
system. Note that this hypergraph can in principle be constructed no matter what happens
inside the system: whether it’s a human brain, a formal neural network, Cyc, OCP, a quantum
computer, etc. Of course, constructing the hypergraph in practice is quite a different story: for
instance, we currently have no accurate way of measuring the habitual activity patterns inside
the human brain. {MRI and PET and other neuroimaging technologies give only a crude view,
though they are continually improving.

Pattern theory enters more deeply here when one thoroughly fleshes out the Inheritance
concept. Philosophers of logic have extensively debated the relationship between extensional
inheritance (inheritance between sets based on their members) and intensional inheritance (in-
heritance between entity-types based on their properties). A variety of formal mechanisms have
been proposed to capture this conceptual distinction; see (Wang, 2006, 1995 TODO make ref)
for a review along with a novel approach utilizing uncertain term logic. Pattern theory provides
a novel approach to defining intension: one may associate with each Concept Vertex in a system’s
derived hypergraph the set of patterns associated with the structural pattern underlying that
Concept Vertex. Then, one can define the strength of the IntensionalInheritanceEdge between
two ConceptVertices A and B as the percentage of A’s pattern-set that is also contained in B’s
pattern-set. According to this approach, for instance, one could have

IntInhEdge whale fish <0.6>

ExtInhEdge whale fish <0.0>

since the fish and whale sets have common properties but no common members.

14.4 Implications of Patternist Philosophy for Derived Hypergraphs
of Intelligent Systems

Patternist philosophy rears its head here and makes some definite hypotheses about the struc-
ture of derived hypergraphs. It suggests that derived hypergraphs should have a dual network

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031116.txt,"outs is politically untenable. This removes the implicit ‘cover’ that senior bonds holders have enjoyed and has increased speculation
that implementation of the bail-in proposals under the EU’s Resolution & Recovery Directive (RRD) will be brought forward to 2015
from the current 2018 time-frame.

e As such, our colleagues in European Credit have examined the implications of changing recovery rate expectations across the bank
capital structure. Assuming that covered bonds remain outside the scope of the proposals, we expect senior bank bond spreads to
widen relative to covered bonds and prefer being OW covered bonds vs senior bonds in the periphery, particularly in Spain where
covered bonds have first claim over the entire mortgage book of the bank. From a relative value point of view, we also suggest owning
subordinated bank bonds vs senior bank bonds in the core as, under the new RRD regime, there is a higher probability than before
that senior bank bond holders will lose money and this risk is, in our mind, not yet in the price (Rethinking the capital structure, R.
Henriques et al., Mar 27).

Foreign Exchange

e Today’s research note, Sacrificing Cyprus, examines several presumptions which have arisen over the past two weeks due to the
Cyprus crisis, and scores them on a scale of truths, half-truths and falsehoods. There are indeed some right conclusions to draw from
this experience, but also some wrong ones. As examples, it is true that capital controls have created a two-tier euro, but very unlikely
that Cyprus is exiting EMU. And while it is true that markets deserve a risk premium for policy uncertainty, the size of the premium
should be much lower than in previous crises due to backstops like the OMT.

e For example, during the first Greek crisis in May 2010 EUR undershot by 10% relative to cyclical conditions at that time, and
during Greek elections in May 2012 the currency undershot by 5%. The combination of Italian and Cypriot events have eliminated the
euro’s overvaluation from early 2013, when the currency spiked to the high $1.30s on a presumption that LTRO funds would be
repaid rapidly, driving European rates higher. The currency is now close to fair value, so carries no risk premium for contagion. The
message is similar in vol markets: the 1% premium for 3-mo implied versus realized vol is far less than the 5% premium witnessed
during previous crises.

e While there is no evidence that the EUR/USD cash or options market carries a risk premium, it is also true that the required
premium should probably be far less than in previous crises given that a sovereign funding backstop like the OMT is in place. We are
thus reluctant to extrapolate this mini-crisis into a systemic event which triggers broad deleveraging, or to forecast trend euro
weakness. The currency could trade down a couple of cents around an ECB rate cut, but assuming that fears around Cyprus contagion
pass in a month or two, the currency should reverse its recent decline by the summertime.

Commodities

e Commodities rallied this week, up almost 2%, led by energy. We went tactically long Brent in last week’s J.P. Morgan View as
we believed that the correction in oil markets had brought prices too far below our price forecast of $112/bbl. Since then Brent is up
around 1.5%. We stay long and expect further price appreciation over coming months. We are also short gasoline vs. Brent. Gasoline
cracks (the premium for gasoline over crude prices) spiked over the first three months of the year due to a combination of low
inventories and refinery closures that came during refinery maintenance season. As refinery maintenance comes to a close and demand
falls seasonally, gasoline prices should fall relative to Brent.

e We went long Soybean time spreads late last year (GMOS, Dec 5) on a view that much higher Brazilian supplies would find it
difficult to leave the country due to logistical constraints. Since then we have seen a record number of ships planning to load soybeans
in Brazilian ports and this number is still rising. The average waiting time before loading is also rising, now 38 days compared to 26
days a month ago. This has caused the front Soybean contract to rally while longer maturity contracts have been depressed by the
much higher than normal supply inside the country. The spread between the May-13 and Jul-13 contracts has doubled since we put the
trade on in December. We stay long as we think these logistical issues are unlikely to be resolved anytime soon.

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025090.txt,"Danin believes that Rawabi's Palestinian
and Qatari investors made a wise decision.
Housing in Ramallah is expensive, and
Danin says that there is a sizable and
highly-educated Palestinian middle class in
need of an alternative to the West Bank's
de-facto capital. He expressed little doubt
when I asked him if the West Bank
economy could support Rawabi. This is a
Palestinian national project, he said. It is
the best of what is possible in that it's
private sector-led, and it's profit-making
led.

And it has supporters in high places. When
President Barack Obama met with Israeli
officials in Washington in September of
2010, Rawabi was on the agenda.

From one perspective, Rawabi is a historic
investment in Palestine, as well as an
unusually open point of cooperation
between Israel and an Arab government. It
could improve the lives of Palestinians,
while convincing Israelis that they have
nothing to fear from their neighbors'
prosperity. But any attempts to change

the status quo in the West Bank are fraught
with difficulties.

There's Israeli bureaucracy to overcome.
In Israel, if the Minister of Defense says I
want something, it's not that the system
thwarts it. But the system is so
decentralized that ultimately it takes a lot
of steps to get it translated into action,

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029310.txt,"Ti v4 Expert Analysis

COMMENT. The Supreme Court deci-
sion will presumably trigger tie-breaker
rules and divorce settlement agreements
previously available only to opposite-sex
married couples.

Education Benefits. Access to a number of
education tax credits by same-sex couples
has been limited, both because of a student’s
status as a member or non-member of the
taxpayer's family and because lower phase-
out levels that apply to unmarried filers.

a AOTC and Lifetime Learning Credit:
A taxpayer can claim the American Op-
portunity Tax Credit (AOTC) or the
Lifetime Learning Credit for qualified
expenses paid by the taxpayer for the
education of the taxpayer, the taxpayer's
spouse, or the taxpayer’s claimed depen-
dent for the tax year for which the credit
is claimed. Because of DOMA, a taxpay-
er could not claim the AOTC or Lifetime
Learning Credit for qualified expenses
paid by his or her same-sex spouse.

u Coverdell Education Savings Ac-

A Coverdell Education Sav-

ings Account (ESA) is a savings vehicle

counts.

similar to an individual retirement
account (IRA). If a Coverdell ESA
is transferred to a surviving spouse as
the result of the beneficiary’ death,
the Coverdell ESA retains its status
and the spouse may treat the account
as his or her own and need not with-
draw the assets as a result of the trans-
fer. Because of DOMA, this treatment
had been unavailable to the surviving
spouse of a same-sex married couple.

a IRA Withdrawals For Education.
Taxpayers who own IRAs (tradi-
tional, Roth, SEP IRAs and SIMPLE
IRAs) can make penalty-free with-
drawals to pay higher education ex-
penses to the extent the distribution
does not exceed the qualified higher
education expenses of the taxpayer,
the taxpayer's spouse, or the child or
grandchild of the taxpayer or the tax-
payer's spouse. Once again, because
of DOMA, this treatment had been
unavailable to the surviving spouse of
a same-sex married couple.

CCH Tax Briefing

Post-Death IRA Payments. When a surviv-
ing spouse is the beneficiary of an individual
retirement account (IRA) he or she has cer-
tain options not granted to other beneficia-
ries, including the ability to rollover the de-
cedent’s IRA, tax free, to another retirement
plan. And, if the surviving spouse is the sole
beneficiary, he or she can elect to treat the
IRA as if it were his or her own. These op-
tions may allow the survivor to delay the
start of required minimum distributions
(RMDs) from the account and to stretch
out the payment of RMDs over a longer pe-
tiod of time. DOMA had foreclosed these
more favorable spousal benefits for same-sex
married spouses. The Supreme Court’s deci-
sion in Windsor presumably opens up these
distribution benefits to same-sex spouses.

“In the case of family
attribution rules, it is
unclear whether application

of marital status for same-
sex spouses relates back
to transactions already
completed.”

Family Stock Attribution Rules. Code Sec.
267 contains attribution rules designed to
prevent related taxpayers (including “spous-
es’ under Sec. 267(c)(4)) from recognizing
losses and other tax benefits otherwise al-
lowed in a variety of transactions. For ex-
ample, an individual is treated under Code
Sec. 318(a)(1) as constructively owning stock
owned directly or indirectly by his or her
spouse (unless legally separated), children,
grandchildren, or parents. Stock attribution
rules under Code Sec. 318 apply when de-
termining whether a redemption of stock is
treated as a sale or exchange or as a dividend.
Likewise, prohibited transactions involving
pension plans under Code Sec. 4975 are
defined, in part, upon dealing with certain
persons, including spouses of those persons.

IMPACT. The Supreme Court's grant of
Federal marital status to same-sex married

persons is apparently not only prospective
starting June 26, 2013, the date of the
Windsor decision, but also presumably
applies retroactively to all open years.
Nevertheless, in the case of attribution
rules, application of marital status for
same-sex spouses may not necessarily re-
late back to transactions already com-
pleted. The need under the tax laws to
have finality for transactions as they oc-
cur appears to be the overriding argument
in favor of not giving retroactive effect to
family attribution. Eventual IRS guid-

ance on this issue is anticipated.

Resident And Non-Resident Aliens. Pre-
sumably, the Supreme Court’s decision ap-
plies to same-sex resident or nonresident
aliens to the extent they are considered mar-
ried under the law of a foreign jurisdiction.
Further clarification of the application of
the Supreme Court’s Windsor decision to
these taxpayers may be needed.

ESTATE AND GIFT TAXATION

The Windsor case, as discussed above in this
Briefing, involved the estate tax marital de-
duction. The marital deduction is a key plan-
ning tool to defer transfer taxes until the
surviving spouse dies. Because of DOMA,
same-sex married couples could not take
advantage of the estate tax marital deduc-
tion and other provisions, such as portabil-
ity. DOMA also precluded same-sex married
couples from the benefits of special rules for
gifts between spouses and from spouses.

Marital Deduction. Code Sec. 2056 provides
an unlimited deduction from the gross estate
for property passing from a decedent to a sur-
viving spouse. Generally, the decedent must
be survived by his or her spouse who is a U.S.
citizen at the time of the decedent’s death, the
property interest must have passed from the
decedent to the spouse, and the property inter-
est must be a deductible interest. Additionally,
the property's value must be ascertainable.

IMPACT. The relatively high $5.25 mil-
lion estate tax exclusion for 2013 for
all estates makes addition of a marital

Walk to Remember? A National Academy of Sciences Study Says Yes 
February 13, 2011 - In healthy adults, the hippocampus — a part of the brain important to the 
formation of memories — begins to atrophy around 55 or 60 and even sooner to an even greater 
degree if one contracts Alzheimer's. Now psychologists are suggesting that the hippocampus can 
be modestly expanded, and memory improved, by nothing more than regular walking.

Do you know what the Most Innovative Location Device is? 
No it's not a compass or an astrolabe. It's not semaphore or a smoke signal. Not an RFID tag or a 
neon sign or phosphorous flare either. 
Give up? 
It's the GPS Smart ShoeTM recently mentioned in Forbes Magazine, developed by GTX Corp 
(OTCBB: GTX0.0B) and licensed to Aetrex Worldwide. Yes, a shoe. .well a very smart shoe as 
it can tell a caregiver the precise location, bearing, history, speed and altitude of an Alzheimer's 
victim that has eloped or wandered. No small feat — pun intended — to reduce the overwhelming 
stress on the millions of victim caregivers while potentially saving thousands from injuries and 
death owing to exposure, accidents and criminal activity. The GPS Shoe also reduces the 
manpower drain on municipal services; fire, police and welfare agencies often enlisted to locate 
the mentally ill. 
While a Finalist in the Most Innovative Location Device category of the Locations & Beyond 
Summit and the People's Choice Awards is a wonderful acknowledgment for the years GTXO 
invested in developing the solution and the promise that Aetrex has made in bringing the Shoe to 
market... the real winners are those touched by this devastating disease for which there is no cure, 
but now have a new measure of hope.

Keeping an eye on Mom and Dad 
Remote monitoring technology aims to keep seniors in their houses and out of nursing homes ____ 
Over the coming months a raft of new-and-improved remote monitoring devices will hit the _____ 
market, from GPS shoes that can track the whereabouts of wandering seniors to MedCottages, 
portable RV-like units equipped with motion and monitoring systems that allow seniors to 
maintain some independence from the backyard of their adult childrens' homes. 
As we age, this is going to be a growing trend, says Laurie Orlov, a Florida-based expert on so-
called aging-in-place technology aimed at keeping seniors in their houses and out of nursing 
homes as long as possible. 
We have to get past the fear and antagonism among the older people who need it the most. I don't 
think they're that technology-ready, but the boomers, who are their adult children, certainly are. 
Motion sensors strategically placed in the three-bedroom home where Howe has lived for 53 years 
feed information right to her daughter's laptop, detailing when she got out of bed (the Friday we 
chatted it was 9 a.m.), walked into the bathroom (9:15 a.m.) or hovered at the kitchen table where 
she keeps her pills (9:30 a.m.) 
Even her blood-pressure reading (165/76) is fed to her daughter's computer, along with her daily 
weigh-in tally, providing a detailed graph which she often takes to her doctor appointments. 
The only thing GrandCare can't tell Pierce, because her system doesn't include cameras, is if her 
mother actually swallowed her pills. 
Monitoring and in-home help technologies will be a $20 billion U.S. business in North America by 
2020, predicts Orlov, founder of Aging In Place Technology Watch. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 018171 
Already some baby boomers are able to remotely lock their parents' doors, track calls coming into 
their homes and even see who is ringing the doorbell, in many cases right from their smart phones. 
Systems such as QuietCare, WellAWARE, FineThanx and SimplyHome are already fixtures in 
some U.S. homes and seniors' communities, although Orlov estimates fewer than 10,000 units are 
in active use because the systems can be so costly. 
Next month, Paul Whyte, a Markham dealer of smart-home technology that allows ordinary 
electronics and appliances to communicate with each other, will unveil the GrandCare system at 
the Zoomer show in Toronto. 
I call it the invisible caregiver, says Whyte of Cybernetics Systems Inc. The minute I saw this 
system I thought, 'There's something that actually makes sense.' 
The key, of course, with all these technologies is that the senior be relatively able-bodied and 
sound of mind — most are of limited value if the senior is suffering from dementia, which is 
expected to become a major public health issue in the next few decades. 
But developers are also working hard on that challenging front. 
Sometime later this fall or next spring the first GPS-equipped shoe, the Aetrex Ambulator, will go 
on sale through www.gpsshoe.com orwww.foot.com. 
Originally designed for children by Los Angeles-based GTX Corp., the new shoes are expected to 
retail for about $250 U.S. They enable caregivers to track those afflicted with dementia or 
Alzheimer's thanks to GPS and cellular technology that will relay their whereabouts back to a 
monitoring centre. 
Privacy may be a talking point, but it's not really an issue, says Patrick Bertagna, chairman and 
CEO of GTX Corp. 
MEDCottage creator Dupin expects concerns around privacy will fade quickly as families and 
health-care systems here and in the U.S. become overwhelmed by aging baby boomers — more 
than 76 million in the U.S., 10 million in Canada — who start hitting 65 next year. 
I see remote monitoring becoming an integral part of health care as we all age, says Dupin. One 
of the issues around aging in place is going to be making trade-offs. Privacy may be something we 
have to give up.

A downtown L.A. company that creates GPS tracking applications for cell phones has

The deal could mean more than 40 million more downloads, which would translate to increased

Android phones, said GTX Chief Executive Patrick Bertagna. 
The LociMobile tracking applications send a GPS signal out to all of a person's cell phone 
contacts who use the app. Bertagna said the app can be used to meet up with friends or keep tabs 
on kids. 
GTX has also developed a GPS shoe for tracking Alzheimer's patients.

Resources and Technology to Help Caregivers Cope 
Kirk Johnson - NYTimes.com - May 4, 2010 - One Alzheimer's wanderer in Arizona had lost 
much of his memory, but not, apparently, his interest in fashion: he never left the house without a 
beloved baseball cap on his head. So a trick the family used to keep the man around was to hide 
his caps. 
Search-and-rescue experts who deal with dementia patients also recommend alarms on doors that 
sound when opened if a proper code is not entered, along with posters or wallpaper images that 
disguise or conceal doors. Sometimes a simple large, emphatic sign on every door saying Stop! 
will deter a wanderer.

New App craze brings back the 1990's 
World Market Media - April 9, 2010 - Every Portfolio manager I've 
ever known loves to find a sector with wind at it's back..the early 
users of the CrackBerry knew (Nasdaq: RIMM) was the stock 
he/she needed to invest in because every person on Wall Street had 
one. This phenomena doesn't occur often and RIMMs are as rare as 
Australopithecus. I observe the current app craze as the new cycle for 
lightning quick revenues based on the size of the market itself. 
Certainly anyone with an iPhone or Android phone has imagined that 
they could build an app when they got home that night. .1 know I

I can tell you from experience that when Kleiner Perkins doubles the size of its venture fund 
specific to app's you know your watching the ship turning in the harbor. This is a unique space 
with wind at it's back and certainly the app's market is a niche to watch, we found this company

found some traction with its wholly owned subsidiary LOCiMOBILE Inc. Bertagna commented

Kids Sneakers That Know Where They Are 
Castro Valley Forum - CA, USA - By : Michael Singer: 10/16/07 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 018183 
There is a trend in high-tech that recommends adding location-based services to anything and 
everything. But it has me pulled between wanting to see really cool gadgets and avoiding a Big 
Brother-like society. 
The latest is a new high-tech tennis shoe coming to the market that lets parents and guardians track 
the movements of their family using Global Positioning Systems or GPS technology. 
Called the Smart Shoe, the miniature device is inserted in the sole of the low-top sneaker. An 
antenna that runs up the back of the footwear communicates with satellites and relays a location 
back to a subscription Web site service for easy viewing. Los Angeles-based GTXC, which makes 
the devices and the service, said it is hoping to put Smart Shoes in stores by the end of the year. 
Shoes with the technology could cost between $100 and $200. The tracking service is expected to 
cost about $20 a month. 
Follow That Kid 
Today's technology makes it easier for parents to know where their kids are and what they're 
doing. 
By Joe Burris 1Baltimore Sun July 1, 2007 
Michelle Smith had been reluctant to buy a cell phone for her 7-year-old daughter, Daysha. Then 
one day in April, a substitute teacher placed the Radford, Va., girl on the wrong school bus. 
Instead of being dropped off at her older sister's after-school program as planned, Daysha was sent 
home - only to find the doors locked. 
As she sat on her front porch crying, her mother drove around town, searching frantically for the 
girl. No one at the school could tell her which bus the girl had been put on. 
Then my next-door neighbor called, said Smith, and said, 'I have your baby.' 
The scary moment had a happy ending, but Smith didn't want to take a chance on losing her 
daughter again. So she did what many other parents are doing - she bought her child a cell phone 
equipped with an electronic device that could keep track of her whereabouts.

M2M technology providers and system integrators often cite efficiency improvements and new 
revenue opportunities as common indicators of return-on-investment. However, as more and more 
customers use machine-to-machine applications to collect data, security has not only become a 
top-notch priority for end users and OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) but also a highly 
valued part of fostering a positive ROI. 
According to IDC Corp., www.idc.com, Framingham, Mass., as devices enabling a mobile 
workforce continue to shrink in size, the increased likelihood of losing devices, such as laptops, 
mobile phones, BlackBerrys, has caused growing concern over the sensitive corporate information

Where would you be without GPS? 
Perhaps carrying fewer gadgets: The technology is being added to shoes, MP3 players, dogs 
By Carolyn Y. Johnson Boston Globe 1February 19, 2007 
This month, GTX Corp. launched a line of Xplorer Smart GPS shoes that transform sneakers into 
a wearable LoJack system. 
ABI Research found that the number of people in North America who subscribe to GPS-enabled 
location-based services more than doubled between 2005 and 2006, from 1.6 to 3.9 million. The 
number of subscribers is projected to rocket to 52 million in 2011. 
That means companies working in what used to be a niche market have been enjoying explosive 
growth. Revenues at TomTom NV, a Concord-based maker of personal navigation products, have 
increased more than 500-fold since 2001, from $2.5 million to an estimated $1.7 billion last 
year. Garmin's business has exploded into the mainstream, too, and the company ran its first 
Super Bowl ad this year. Boston-based start-up Skyhook Wireless brings location awareness to

me. Trying to retract any damage done I said to him “I must look like
such a mess to you and making you listen to my saga, I am so sorry... I
shouldn’t have come to you with all of this.” He looked surprised and
sympathetic “Quite the opposite actually. I’m glad you’ve come to me for
help. I have got a lot of connections especially with the Palm Beach
County Police Department. | give them regular hundred thousand dollar
donations, and after I speak with them there will be nothing more to
worry about. To be honest I’m more in shock about how much can
happen to you in such a short time, your life is one big soap opera”

Now he was chuckling and trying to make light of my somber mood.
Laughing along too | replied, “‘ | know right? Drama just hangs around
me like a bad smell”. We did some more light-hearted catching up and
went out to the poolside for some lunch and a swim, concluding the
evening with an erotic massage upstairs. He paid me the usual two
hundred dollars and asked me to come back tomorrow. “In the meantime
I don’t want you thinking about your sticky situation, consider it dealt
with”. His attempt to brighten my spirits had worked relieved about
money and the police but now I owed myself to him feeling indebted to
him more now than ever.

Chapter 14

As was promised I never heard back from the Police Department and
Jeffrey had his favorite girl back by his side. We picked up where we left
off ever better than before, I being entirely subservient to every sexual
desire of his engaging myself in any role he wanted me to play. As he
was getting older his appetite for sex never hazed, if anything it only
increased. The orgies with other girls got larger in numbers and his
appeal to younger girls, new toys and wilder nights expanded from once
and awhile to quite an often occurrence in Jeffrey’s company. I put it
down his new friend and business investment, Jean-Luc Brunel.

A long time agent for young and upcoming models, Brunel, a French
citizen, was known for roaming the world in search of young, naive
beauties living in poverty stricken countries and willing to do just about
anything for money. He would procure them mostly from Clubs in South
America and the Former Soviet Republic. Filling their heads with
fairytales of America and large amounts of money, he would promise
them all of the finer things in life, sometimes even throwing a pill in their
drink, if that meant getting them in his bed was becoming too much of a
task. What he wanted is what he got, which is why him and Jeffrey

87

ultimately became close pals and he invested one million dollars into
Brunel’s company. In return Jeffrey now had supply of girls on tap for
him to choose from.

With the assistance of each other, Brunel obtaining the illegitimate
visas for underage-overseas girls and Jeffrey housing them at his
brother’s apartment complex on 301 E 66 St, Manhattan, they were
quite the team. Jeffrey and Brunel would charge them for rent, forcing
them to work for them selling their bodies for money, nude pictures, and
even pornography. These were what seemed like really nice people with
not so nice intentions setting an impression of how the dignified wealth
play and behind closed doors they had as much civilized manners as a
barbaric chimpanzee in heat. Giving a girl a step-up in finances by
teaching them there only worth is what lay between their legs, us girls all
were the same in the end, regardless of what country we came from, what
language we spoke or our cultural indifferences, we all were being used
for one thing alone, our youthful looks and beautiful bodies.

Being Jeffrey’s permanent sidekick, I would have to part-take in a
many of the hedonistic exploitations that went on at one of his many
residences, which meant having to be uninhibited with many girls my age
and younger. Being complete strangers was hard enough but we couldn’t
even understand each other, speaking in different tongues we were
expected to excel at preforming many acts of lovemaking and foreplay on
each other, while being observed by a man in a corner jerking off. Not
exactly what I would call an advantage in my stage of life, but in my head
I was convinced we all had to do what we had to do to get on with life
and if that meant doing all of this to keep Jeffrey happy, then I would do
that.

It didn’t take long in the accompaniment of Brunel for Jeffrey to hit an
all time low, at least one that [ knew about. Stupid enough or sick
enough, | don’t know which one it is or both but Jeffrey bragged about
his birthday present from Brunel, once accepting three, twelve year old
girls, sisters at that. He replayed the descriptive events with me telling me
how they all massaged him and finished him off orally. He was so excited
about the entire event, replaying over and over again over the next course
of weeks how cute they were and how you could tell they were really
young by the small amount of hair growth in their pubic region and non-
existent breasts. A twelve year old, are you serious? I thought to myself.

I still can’t shake the feeling of disgust when | recall the look on his face
as he told me time and time again of how his lust brought him to that
profound low. He went on to tell me how Brunel bought them in Paris,
France, from their parents. Offering them the usual sums of money, visas,
and modeling career prospects was a bribe of the worst kind, they were
just children. Laughing the whole way through, Jeffrey thought it was

The resolution of the eye is not the same across the image. High
resolution is concentrated in the center, while lower resolution black
and white vision dominates the edge. This peripheral vision helps us
detect predators or play football but it is not the focus of our attention.
When we focus our attention on something, we turn our eyes to look at
it directly. The central part of our eye is called the fovea centralis and is
composed of cones. About half our cones are concentrated in this very
small section and this gives us immense visual acuity. For a computer
display to outperform this section of the eye it would need one billion by

one billion pixels. The fovea centralis is tiny, only two degrees across, so
our eyes must dart around the image to take in all the detail. Once the
basic information is encoded in our retina and sent down the optic nerve,
it goes into a production line process in the visual cortex where all the
elements are analyzed. Our brains extract information from the image
such as texture, edges and depth perception in specialized portions of
the brain. Because of this specialization it is possible to play tricks on the
brain with images that are not easy to process. Some we find pleasurable,
while others can be a little disturbing.

It's a type of living closely associated with
the Palestinians’ neighbors in Israel. They
know very well that just a 20-minute drive
away, there's a community with a much
higher standard of living. And that
community happened to be one
representing the occupier, quote-unquote
the 'enemy.'’ But they would love to live
like that. And that's why when they come
to Rawabi some of them don't believe this
is for them initially. The first thing that
goes through their mind is that this could
be for the Israelis.

But it is for them. Rawabi's significance
could lie in something more mundane than
basic issues of sovereignty and control in
the West Bank. It lies in the common,
human desire -- powerful on either side of
the Green Line -- for a comfortable and
dignified existence.

In some quarters, this idea of working
within the present and less-than-ideal
political and economic framework to
achieve this goal is nothing short of
inflammatory. The U.S.-based, anti-peace
process website Electronic Intifada has
smeared Masri as an Israeli collaborator,
and there have been scattered accusations
that the project actually legitimizes Israeli
control over the West Bank.

Leaned on: Police chief Michael Reiter

with a lifetime’s experience in finding the balance

between patrolling the millionaire’s playground of Palm Beach, Florida, and its blue-collar neighbour

West Palm Beach, home to unglamorous social housing projects and trailer parks.

Throughout his 28-year career, he prided himself that his force treated the wealthy on his patch just the
same as the very poorest. But his investigation into the lifestyle of predatory paedophile Jeffrey Epstein

exploded his illusion that law enforcement could ever be impartial.

He soon discovered at first hand that a man such as Epstein, with almost unlimited wealth and influential
friends including former President Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew and Israeli defence minister Ehud Barak,

can effectively bend the law to his whim.

The 53-year-old police chief, who retired in 2009, was so furious at what he believed was obstruction by
state prosecutors, who he felt had downplayed charges against Epstein, that he outlined his frustrations in

an extraordinary letter to Florida state attorney Barry Krischer in May 2006.

He wrote: ‘I must urge you to examine the unusual course that your office’s handling of this matter has
taken and consider if good and sufficient reason exists to require your disqualification from the

prosecution of these cases.’

After failing to get a satisfactory response from prosecutors he believed had been ‘got at’ by Epstein, he
referred the case to the FBI.

He wrote to one of Epstein’s victims, saying: ‘I do not feel that justice has been sufficiently served by the

indictment that has been issued.’

Epstein’s conviction for solicitation of prostitution came after an unprecedented plea bargain designed to

protect him from future charges.

Mr Reiter later complained in sworn testimony connected to civil actions brought against Epstein that

prominent politicians had repeatedly leaned on him to downplay the allegations against the financier.

Mike Fisten, an ex-FBI taskforce superviser who has led the campaign for the Epstein case to be reopened,
said: ‘Reiter went up against the entire town of Palm Beach to do what was right but he is not chief any

more because of this.

‘And eventually Epstein was given an immunity from prosecution deal the like of which I have never seen

in my entire career.’

A. Sure. I mean, obviously, they are going to
be some cases that are very complicated factually. More
investigation would be appropriate there. There can be
some situations that very simple factually, less
investigation would be factually necessary there. Same

The more legal investigation would be

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013184.txt,"268 13 Local, Global and Glocal Knowledge Representation

13.6.3 Glocal Hopfield Networks

The ideas in the previous section suggest that, if one wishes to construct an AGI, it is worth
seriously considering using a memory with some sort of glocal structure. One research direction
that follows naturally from this notion is “glocal neural networks.” In order to explore the nature
of glocal neural networks in a relatively simple and tractable setting, we have formalized and
implemented simple examples of “glocal Hopfield networks”: palimpsest Hopfield nets with the
addition of neurons representing localized memories. While these specific networks are not used
in CogPrime, they are quite similar to the ECAN networks that are used in CogPrime and
described in Chapter 23 of Part 2.

Essentially, we augment the standard Hopfield net architecture by adding a set of “key
neurons.” These are a small percentage of the neurons in the network, and are intended to be
roughly equinumerous to the number of memories the network is supposed to store. When the
Hopfield net converges to an attractor A, then new links are created between the neurons that
are active in A, and one of the key neurons. Which key neuron is chosen? The one that, when
it is stimulated, gives rise to an attractor pattern maximally similar to A.

The ultimate result of this is that, in addition to the distributed memory of attractors in the
Hopfield net, one has a set of key neurons that in effect index the attractors. Each attractor
corresponds to a single key neuron. In the glocal memory model, the key neurons are the keys
and the Hopfield net attractors are the maps.

This algorithm has been tested in sparse Hopfield nets, using both standard Hopfield net
learning rules and Storkey’s modified palimpsest learning rule [SV99], which provides greater
memory capacity in a continuous learning context. The use of key neurons turns out to slightly
increase Hopfield net memory capacity, but this isn’t the main point. The main point is that
one now has a local representation of each global memory, so that if one wants to create a
link between the memory and something else, it’s extremely easy to do so — one just needs
to link to the corresponding key neuron. Or, rather, one of the corresponding key neurons:
depending on how many key neurons are allocated, one might end up with a number of key
neurons corresponding to each memory, not just one.

In order to transform a palimpsest Hopfield net into a glocal Hopfield net, the following steps
are taken:

1. Add a fixed number of “key neurons” to the network (removing other random neurons to
keep the total number of neurons constant)

2. When the network reaches an attractor, create links from the elements in the attractor to
one of the key neurons

3. The key neuron chosen for the previous step is the one that most closely matches the current
attractor (which may be determined in several ways, to be discussed below)

4, To avoid the increase of the number of links in the network, when new links are created in
Step 2, other key-neuron links are then deleted (several approaches may be taken here, but
the simplest is to remove the key-neuron links with the lowest-absolute-value weights)

In the simple implementation of the above steps that we implemented, and described in
[GPI 10], Step 3 is carried out simply by comparing the weights of a key neuron’s links to the
nodes in an attractor. A more sophisticated approach would be to select the key neuron with
the highest activation during the transient interval immediately prior to convergence to the
attractor.

Thanks for including Jefferson and von Mises, my favorite Galician, in
the list of good guys. Our economy cannot be repaired without
dismantling the Fed. As you often point out, our monetary system is

rotten at the core, as it is based on credit.

I read in one of these letters from a libertarian source that Jefferson
wrote, already in 1810 or so, that he had failed to set up a free country
as he envisioned... and that was still more than 100 years before the

Federal Reserve Act.

On the other hand, even today, I strongly believe that if we just followed
the Constitution, we would be okay — especially the 1oth amendment. I

think that is the most important of all.

The Democratic Party is electing a known criminal, and they don’t care,
as long as it’s their criminal. They just assume all politicians are
criminal, and the really good ones get their districts what they need.
Would anyone let Harry Reid babysit their children? The Republican

be as much as $20 million, he yet seems somehow to have gotten away with
it—that worst sin of all. He is the unrepentant catch all of up-to-the-minute
badness: the financier whose wealth is a product of Wall Street math rather
than work; a rich middle-age white man who not only parades his wealth and
entitlement, but has a Peter Pan complex to boot; an insistent Playboy in a
correct and prudish world; someone who somehow didn’t get the memo
about vast changes in mores and culture.

When I suggested recently that one obvious way to blunt the animus is
to get married, he said he would rather go back to jail.

He is Calvin Harris’s song, It Was Acceptable in the 80s, come to life.

Post and Daily Mail parlance would likely be a freaky financier too.

And it’s a story about the limitation of journalism, in which the most
compelling parts of the story—it would take a long running cable show to do
justice to the meaning of Epstein’s ambitions and impulses—need to be
sacrificed for not just moral certainty but for a rather preposterous fantasy of
moral certainty.

Anyway, I hope I get invited back to Jeffrey’s house.

The JASTA law allows attack survivors and relatives of attack victims to file lawsuits against foreign
countries for acts of terrorism that kill Americans on US soil. Also known as House Resolution 3815, it
creates an exception to the sovereign immunity law introduced in 1976, allowing US citizens to sue foreign
governments in US federal court and demand compensation if those governments are proven to bear some

responsibility for attacks within the US.

This exception drew concern from many countries — both in the Gulf and globally — that the legislation

will erode sovereign immunity, considered one of the founding principles of international relations.

Some British, French, and Dutch lawmakers have
threatened retaliatory legislation to allow their courts to
pursue US officials, which is why outgoing President Obama
vetoed JASTA in the first place, explaining that it would
harm American interests as it opens the United States up to

private lawsuits over its military missions abroad.

Saudi Arabia recently warned it would pull its money out of the US economy, selling up to $750 billion in
US treasury securities and other assets, before lawsuits demanding compensation start pouring in and put
these assets in jeopardy. However, responding to a question on whether Saudi Arabia was still
reconsidering its investment strategy on Sunday, Jubeir assured reporters that it plans to continue with its

investments and does not plan to decrease them.

“[The Kingdom] has tremendous investments in the United States and we review those investments on a
regular basis. There are issues associated with risk, but our objective is to increase those investments.
We won’ decrease them,” he said, as cited by Reuters. The US Treasury Department said that the

kingdom owned $116.8 billion in securities in the US as of March this year.

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016880.txt,"TECH PROPHECY AND THE UNDERAPPRECIATED CAUSAL POWER OF
IDEAS
Steven Pinker

Steven Pinker, a Johnstone Family Professor in the Department of Psychology at
Harvard University, is an experimental psychologist who conducts research in visual
cognition, psycholinguistics, and social relations. He is the author of eleven books,
including The Blank Slate, The Better Angels of Our Nature, and, most recently,
Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress.

Artificial intelligence is an existence proof of one of the great ideas in human history:
that the abstract realm of knowledge, reason, and purpose does not consist of an élan vital
or immaterial soul or miraculous powers of neural tissue. Rather, it can be linked to the
physical realm of animals and machines via the concepts of information, computation,
and control. Knowledge can be explained as patterns in matter or energy that stand in
systematic relations with states of the world, with mathematical and logical truths, and
with one another. Reasoning can be explained as transformations of that knowledge by
physical operations that are designed to preserve those relations. Purpose can be
explained as the control of operations to effect changes in the world, guided by
discrepancies between its current state and a goal state. Naturally evolved brains are just
the most familiar systems that achieve intelligence through information, computation, and
control. Humanly designed systems that achieve intelligence vindicate the notion that
information processing is sufficient to explain it—the notion that the late Jerry Fodor
dubbed the computational theory of mind.

The touchstone for this volume, Norbert Wiener’s The Human Use of Human
Beings, celebrated this intellectual accomplishment, of which Wiener himself was a
foundational contributor. A potted history of the mid-20th-century revolution that gave
the world the computational theory of mind might credit Claude Shannon and Warren
Weaver for explaining knowledge and communication in terms of information. It might
credit Alan Turing and John von Neumann for explaining intelligence and reasoning in
terms of computation. And it ought to give Wiener credit for explaining the hitherto
mysterious world of purposes, goals, and teleology in terms of the technical concepts of
feedback, control, and cybernetics (in its original sense of “governing” the operation of a
goal-directed system). “It is my thesis,” he announced, “that the physical functioning of
the living individual and the operation of some of the newer communication machines are
precisely parallel in their analogous attempts to control entropy through feedback”—the
staving off of life-sapping entropy being the ultimate goal of human beings.

Wiener applied the ideas of cybernetics to a third system: society. The laws,
norms, customs, media, forums, and institutions of a complex community could be
considered channels of information propagation and feedback that allow a society to ward
off disorder and pursue certain goals. This is a thread that runs through the book and
which Wiener himself may have seen as its principal contribution. In his explanation of
feedback, he wrote, “This complex of behavior is ignored by the average man, and in
particular does not play the role that it should in our habitual analysis of society; for just
as individual physical responses may be seen from this point of view, so may the organic
responses of society itself.”

NATIONAL DEFENSE: IS ANOTHER SPENDING
BOOM ON THE HORIZON?

+ Joseph G. Carson, US Economist and Director—Global Economic Research, joe.carson@abglobal.com

President Trump has promised to increase defense spending—and
there’s support from key members of Congress. If a large multiyear
plan is approved, it would represent a sharp reversal from what has
been the weakest trend in defense spending in the past 50 years.

And the timing and scale would have important implications for the

outlook on growth and inflation.

National Defense—The Trump Plan
President Trump has promised to deliver
an ambitious program to rebuild the US
military. It would include modernizing

US nuclear weapons systems, investing
more in cybersecurity, enlarging the navy’s
fleet and increasing the number of fighter
aircraft for the air force. Trump’s plan also
includes additional military personnel—well
over 100,000, according to some
estimates.

The details of Trump’s first Pentagon
budget will form part of the overall budget
he’ll submit to Congress in late February or
early March. The actual funding request for
the current fiscal year (which ends
September 30) must be completed by April
30—that’s when the current legislation
funding the military budget is set to expire.

More important, Trump’s blueprint for the
Pentagon budget could set the baseline
for defense spending for at least the next
four years. It’s also worth noting that
Trump’s military expenditures could be at
the low end of what some in Congress are
proposing.

For example, Senator John McCain, who
chairs the Senate Armed Services
Committee, recently released a white
paper on defense spending, Restoring
American Power. McCain argues that the
US has underinvested in the military for
several years, and that it is now vital for
the US to substantially increase funding for
the Pentagon. His plan calls for a $640
billion defense budget for fiscal year 2018,
which is $58 billion above the current
budget baseline. Moreover, the McCain
defense plan urges an additional $430
billion in military spending over the next
five fiscal years.

Defense Spending Patterns Are Unlike
Other Federal Programs

History shows that defense spending
programs are unusual in that they’re neither
cyclical nor countercyclical. Most often they
are based on military and political strate-
gies as well as ongoing readiness to
respond to or engage in global encounters.

Based on historical gross domestic
product (GDP) data, there have been three
large defense-spending programs in the
past 50 years (Display 1). The first buildup

occurred in the mid- 1960s, during
President Lyndon Johnson’s term, and ran
for five years. That was tied to the military
engagement in Southeast Asia.

The second large defense-spending boom
occurred during the first four years of the
Reagan presidency. This buildup was part
of Reagan’s political and military strategy
to rebuild the military apparatus after what
he saw as years of neglect.

The third major increase started during the
first term of President George W. Bush.
This one was linked to events surrounding
9/11 and the following events in the
Middle East.

BASE SALARY

The base salaries for the named executive officers are reviewed annually by the Compensation and Nominating Committee. Individual salaries
are determined based upon a combination of factors, including the scope of responsibilities, individual performance and experience, our company’s
performance, an individual’s potential for making contributions to future company performance, and competitive pay practices. The committee considers all
these factors in determining base salary increases and does not assign a specific weighting to any individual factor.

In February 2018, the Compensation and Nominating Committee reviewed the base salaries of our executive officers, including our named
executive officers, taking into consideration the factors described above. Following this review, the committee determined to maintain the base salary of our
CEO at its 2017 level and to increase the base salaries of the other four named executive officers to maintain the competitiveness of this compensation
element. All of the NEOs’ 2018 base salaries were approximately at or below the market median as determined by the compensation consultant.

Ernest Garcia III, our chief executive officer, had a base salary of $400,000 for both 2017 and 2018, with no increase. Mark Jenkins, our chief
financial officer, had a 2017 base salary of $350,000 and a 2018 base salary of $375,000, an increase of 7.1%. Benjamin Huston, our chief operating officer,
had a 2017 base salary of $350,000 and a 2018 base salary of $375,000, an increase of 7.1%. Ryan Keeton, our chief brand officer, had a 2017 base salary
of $315,000 and a 2018 base salary of $330,000, an increase of 4.8%. Daniel Gill, our chief product officer, had a 2017 base salary of $315,000 and a 2018
base salary of $330,000, an increase of 4.8%.

2018 ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN

Our annual incentive plan was designed to align our executive officers’ incentives with our company goals and, therefore, to be aligned with the
interests of our shareholders. The Compensation and Nominating Committee approves which executives are eligible to participate (other than the CEO) and
the level of potential awards, identifies appropriate performance measures, and determines the financial targets of each measure. The CEO makes
recommendations as to these matters, but the Compensation and Nominating Committee makes all decisions with respect to the implementation of the
annual incentive plan. For the CEO’s annual incentive plan, the Compensation and Nominating Committee makes a recommendation, with the Board
making the final decision. In establishing performance goals, the committee and the Board as a whole review industry and market conditions, alignment of
the goals with our strategy, projected general economic conditions, and both our past and forecasted performance levels.

Target Bonuses and Payout Ranges

For the 2018 annual incentive plan, the committee established a target bonus at 66.7% of base salary for each of the NEOs, with a payout range
of 0%—133% of base salary. Utilizing the same bonus target for all the NEOs promotes a culture of teamwork among the senior executives and encourages
their entrepreneurial spirit. As a result, the CEO’s target 2018 total cash, including both base salary and target annual incentive plan amount, is below the
market 25 th percentile of our compensation peer group.

Mary Catherine Jordan (born November 10, 1960) is a Pulitzer
Prize-winning American journalist for the Washington Post.
She is currently the editor of Washington Post Live, which
organizes political debates, conferences and news events

for the media company. She has written on U.S. politics,
the American education system and many other subjects.
With her husband, Post journalist Kevin Sullivan, Jordan
ran the newspaper’s bureaus in Tokyo, Mexico City and
London. Jordan has written from nearly 40 countries and
also been a frequent commentator on BBC Television.

Jordan, a daughter of Irish immigrants, was
born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio. She graduated from
Georgetown University in 1983 and earned a master’s
degree from Columbia University’s Graduate School of

a Nieman Fellowship by Harvard University.

Jordan began her Post career as an intern
for the Style section, crisscrossed the country writing
about colleges and schools as the national education
reporter, and covered Virginia and national politics.

For a year at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland, she
studied William Butler Yeats and other Irish poets. She was
given her first job in the newspaper business by legendary Irish
author and editor Tim Pat Coogan, who hired her to write a
column in the Irish Press. She enrolled in Japanese language
classes at Georgetown University before moving to Tokyo for
four years and studied Spanish on a post-graduate fellowship
at Stanford University before moving to Mexico for five years.

Currently, Jordan moderates many high-profile
forums for the Washington Post including the “The 40th
Anniversary of Watergate” in June 2012 that featured key
Watergate figures including including former White House
counsel John Dean, Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee,
and reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein.

She hosted the 2010 Maryland gubernatorial

While Ankara may answer anti-Turkish demonstrations in Libya by
closing down the Turkish embassy in Tripoli, the first ever such
action by the diplomatic service throughout its modern history, anti-
Turkish demonstrations in Damascus can be really costly for Turkey
now and in the future.

While the personal friendly relations between Assad and his
counterpart in Turkey, Erdogan, might provide Turkey a golden
opportunity to help Syria sail out of the current tumultuous situation.
Of course at a time when Erdogan himself is after converting Turkey
into his sultanate of fear under the aegis of advanced democracy it
might be absurd to expect him to advise Assad of a democratic way
out of the mess in Syria. Yet, as much as Turkey needs to see
restoration of peace, security and stability in Syria for domestic
security reasons as well as for its regional role, Syria and President
Assad need Turkey and Erdogan to walk the extra mile in reforms
advised by them, as the real-politic of the day compels him to do so if
he wants to sail out of this problem in one piece.

If, however, despite Turkey’s democracy and reform preaches, the
massacres continue in the Syrian street not only the prestige of
Erdogan in the Arab street will be seriously impaired but sooner or
later the fire in the Arab street will have a reflection on the Turkish
streets.

government interference. That’s how the marketplace of ideas is supposed to operate in a
democracy. The government must protect bad, wrong and offensive speakers from those who
would react violently. Speech, not violence, is protected by the First Amendment.

Moreover, if a violent reaction to speech is deemed to justify the censoring of that speech, then
the threat to commit violence empowers “the victims” of provocative speech to serve as censors.
This “violence veto” should not be encouraged by the law. Hard as it may be to arrest these
“victims” rather than the provokers, the First Amendment requires that the government side with
the “bad” speakers, rather than the “good” violence-threateners.

In the end, the Nazis “won” the encounter in Skokie because good and decent people in that
community decided to try to censor, rather than ridicule or respond to them.

My experience with “clear and present danger” incitement also took place in a small
community—the beautiful campus of Stanford University. Shortly after arriving at Stanford in the
fall of 1970 for what I expected would be a year of scholarly research as a fellow of the Center
for Advanced Studies in the Behavioral Sciences, I was asked to represent a tenured English
professor named Bruce Franklin, who was being fired for inciting students. He had spoken at an
anti-war rally directed against the Stanford Computation Center, which was involved in war-
related research. His speech including the following: “[W]hat we’re asking is for people to make
that little tiny gesture to show that we’re willing to inconvenience ourselves a little bit and to
begin to shut down the most obvious machinery of war, such as—and I think it is a good
target—that Computation Center.” Following shouts of “Right on,” a group of listeners marched
on the Computation Center and physically shut it down, causing some damage. Franklin did not
join the demonstrators himself; he watched from a safe and discreet distance. The police
eventually cleared the building and ordered the demonstrators to disperse. At this point, Franklin
joined the crowd and protested the order. He walked up to the police, argued with them that the
dispersal order was illegal, and urged the crowd to remain. Many did, and the police used force
to affect their order. Minor injuries were sustained by some demonstrators.

Later that night a rally was held on the campus at which Franklin gave the closing speech. In it he
advocated “the methods of people’s war.” There was some dispute about whether he explained
what he meant by this term. He claimed that he told the demonstrators that “people’s war meant
that they should go back to the dormitories, organize people into small groups, and talk with
them, or play football, or whatever, as late into the night as possible.” Within a few hours of
Franklin’s speech there was more violence and this time several people were seriously hurt.

The next day President Lyman announced that Professor Franklin would be fired from his tenured
position on grounds of “substantial and manifest neglect of duty and a substantial impairment of
his appropriate functions within the University community.”

Franklin demanded a formal hearing, and a faculty advisory committee of seven full professors

was convened to consider the charges and recommend an appropriate sanction. It was difficult to
find seven professors who did not despise Franklin—and with good cause.

U.S. conventional military capabilities, especially combined with
those of its likely allies, are of course far superior to those of Iran. In
many recent years the size of the U.S. defense supplemental alone
exceeded the entire Iranian defense budget. But a fight with Iran
would not be a fair or clean fight. Winning in any meaningful sense
might prove costly.

Escalation

If Iran’s advantage lies in broadening and widening a conflict once
begun, how might we expect its leaders to go about it? At least three
types of escalation are open to Tehran: horizontal, vertical and
domain.

Horizontal escalation involves the spread of hostilities from beyond
the immediate area of conflict to additional geographic areas and
political actors.13 Iran’s means and methods, as discussed above,
give it the ability to escalate horizontally within the Middle East
region and beyond to include Europe and the United States.

Vertical escalation involves the employment of new or increasingly
potent weapons systems, attacking new types of targets, or
introducing additional types of forces into the conflict.14 What
begins as essentially a fight between U.S. and allied air and naval
strike assets and Iranian air defense assets could be quickly expanded
by Iran to the use of offensive missile systems and naval surface and
sub-surface forces in retaliation. Iranian escalation to the employment
of WMD (if a war occurred after an Iranian breakout) seems unlikely
short of an imminent threat to the regime, but that threat would be
hanging in the air as fighting escalated.

Domain escalation refers to the expansion of the conflict from the
purely military domain to the diplomatic, economic and social
domains, in which Iran has some advantages.

In summary, an attack on Iran could produce dynamics that would
push either or both sides to escalate the conflict even if neither had an

U.S. Hones Warnings to Egypt as Military Stalls Transition

David D. Kirkpatrick and Steven Lee Myers



November 16, 2011 -- CAIRO — Brazen attempts by Egypt’s interim military rulers to hold on to power long after elections have elicited a sharp reaction domestically and for the first time have prompted Washington to warn about the potential for new unrest. 

After months of mixing gentle pressure with broad support for the ruling military council, the Obama administration has sharpened its tone, senior administration officials say, expressing concern that the failure to move to civilian control could undermine the defining revolt of the Arab Spring. 

The shift in tone is part of a difficult balancing act for Washington, which is keen to preserve its ties to the military and its interests in the region, chiefly Egypt’s role in maintaining peace with Israel. But Washington also hopes to win favor with Egypt’s newly empowered political opposition while avoiding the appearance of endorsing the militarys stalled transition to democracy. All things considered, some here have suggested, the change in tone may be intended to placate Egyptian public opinion rather than actually press the military to give up power. 

“I think they are working for their own interests, particularly regarding the slow transition of power,” said Shady el-Ghazaly Harb, a prominent liberal activist who was among the leaders of the Egyptian revolution. “The U.S. wants to guarantee that the coming government will be on good terms — I won’t say loyal, but friendly — and the support for SCAF is related to that.” SCAF is the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, Egypt’s ruling military council. 

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton underscored the shift in a speech last week that her aides later said was a deliberate warning to the military council, which assumed power after President Hosni Mubarak’s ouster. The military had initially pledged to hand over control to civilians by September, but it now says that a presidential election will not occur before 2013. And last week it laid out a blueprint for the next constitution, giving the military special political powers and protection from civilian oversight into perpetuity. 

“If, over time, the most powerful political force in Egypt remains a roomful of unelected officials, they will have planted the seeds for future unrest, and Egyptians will have missed a historic opportunity,” Mrs. Clinton warned. 

“When unelected authorities say they want to be out of the business of governing,” the United States expects them “to lay out a clear road map” and “abide by it,” she added. 

Given Washington’s long support for Mr. Mubarak, and Mrs. Clinton’s comment last month approving of the military’s extended timetable for electing a civilian president, there was suspicion over Washington’s intentions. The shift occurred at the same time as a broader effort by the Obama administration to counter anti-American sentiment and reach out to opposition leaders across the political spectrum. 

The United States “wants to have the cake and eat it, too,” said Nabil Fahmy, a former Egyptian ambassador to Washington, arguing that the United States wants to promote democracy without dealing with the pressure it would put on American interests in the region. 

The military’s attempts to protect its power and privileges indefinitely have created an awkward situation for Washington. The United States, through the Pentagon in particular, has long nurtured close ties with the Egyptian military, which still receives $1.3 billion in American aid each year. American officials hope that whatever government emerges will continue to support American policy, including maintaining ties with Israel and distance from Iran. 

At the same time, the United States’ standing in public opinion in Egypt and around the region continues to suffer because of decades of support for undemocratic governments like the military-backed system that controlled Egypt under Mr. Mubarak. Remaining aloof from the debate over the military’s future role here risks reinforcing those criticisms at a time when democratic changes are giving public opinion new weight. 

As part of its broader outreach, the Obama administration has also met with the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group whose political party is poised to win a major role in the country’s new Parliament and remains the biggest political counterweight to the military council. 

Jacob Walles, a deputy assistant secretary of state, met for the first time this week with the leaders of the Brotherhood’s newly formed Freedom and Justice Party at its new headquarters in Cairo. While American diplomats have had intermittent contacts for years with Brotherhood lawmakers in the Egyptian Parliament, officials here said Mr. Walles’s meeting appeared to underscore Mrs. Clinton’s pledges to cooperate with Islamist parties that respect democracy. 

Others said it might instead have been a sign that Washington simply realized that the Brotherhood was certain to play a crucial role in Egypt’s future and was likely to win a large bloc of seats in the parliamentary elections that begin this month. 

“They confirmed that they are keen to support the democratic process, and they will accept any results of the elections and deal with any government that respects human rights and the rights of women and minorities and the democratic process,” said Essam el-Erian, a veteran Brotherhood leader and the vice chairman of its new party, who met with Mr. Walles. “And we are keen and eager to say that we respect the democratic process and the rights of all people according to the Constitution and the law.” 

Administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private diplomatic exchanges, said they hoped that a combination of internal and external pressure on the council would persuade it to yield power and submit to civilian oversight. In addition to the public comments by Mrs. Clinton, other senior American officials have privately urged the council to revise its recent proposals to preserve power, the officials said. 

The officials noted that since Mr. Mubarak’s ouster, the council’s leaders had repeatedly offered, then backed away from, some proposals only after street protests and public pressure, in a kind of prolonged back-and-forth that some noted reflected a true, if messy, democratic process taking root. 

But administration officials and Egyptian activists note worrying signs. The military core of Mr. Mubarak’s government has “reasserted itself again,” a senior administration official said. “We don’t have great expectations that this is going to be the creation of a democratic system,” the official said, referring to the coming elections. 

At best, the official added, the elections will be “a transition to a transition,” one that could leave the military as the de facto power in Egypt for years to come, as it was under Mr. Mubarak’s rule. 

The military has said that it intends to hold ultimate political power even after the election of a Parliament in the coming months, and that it will play a role in drafting the constitution as well. It has refused to lift the Mubarak-era “emergency law” allowing arrests without trial, and it has sent as many as 12,000 civilians to military trials. 

While the administration’s changes in tone risk upsetting a pivotal ally where anti-American sentiment — and, in some quarters, support for the military — runs high, they are also drawing rare praise from activists here who say they appreciate Washington’s help. 

“I think that Secretary of State Mrs. Clinton delivered a clear-cut message to the SCAF, and I think they got that message: that the SCAF is not an elected body and must deliver the authority and turn over power,” said Emad Gad, an analyst at the government-financed Al Ahram research institute and now a leader of the Social Democratic Party. 

Mr. Gad contended that over the long term such pressure could only benefit the American relationship with a democratic Egypt. “I think more than 50 percent of the Egyptians think the SCAF is trying to kill the Egyptian revolution,” he said.

Europe’s Contagion

Editorial



November 16, 2011 -- Two years of gross mismanagement of the euro-zone debt crisis have all too predictably produced a wider crisis of market confidence that now threatens the entire 17-nation euro zone. This week’s formation of new technocrat-led governments in Greece and Italy has not calmed fears. Practically every euro zone country is paying the price in higher interest costs and ebbing economic growth. 

The only country that isn’t suffering — yet — is Germany, whose competitive export-driven economy feeds on foreign demand and an exchange rate held down by its neighbors’ troubles. But all European countries cannot be Germany and run net surpluses, especially if Berlin insists on policies that keep factories shuttered and workers unemployed. 

And German leaders are wrong if they think their country will remain unscathed as its major trading partners and neighbors unravel. 

Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has been talking a more pro-European line. But she is still insisting on growth-killing austerity as the price for European bailouts and still blocking the European Central Bank from printing more euros and acting as a lender of last resort. 

Mrs. Merkel’s advisers insist that she is doing what the German people want. That is not leadership. She needs to challenge her voters simplistic stereotypes of southern European sloth and tell them the truth: The real threat to Germany isn’t inflation; it is an economic collapse across Europe. And Germany has a huge amount to lose from a fracturing of the European Union. 

European stock and bond markets are already treating that as an ever-more-realistic possibility, shunning even moderate levels of risk and pushing interest rates to unsustainable levels. As far as they can see, Mrs. Merkel and her fellow euro-zone leaders haven’t come up with an adequate plan, sufficient political will or sufficient cash to halt the contagion. As far as we can see, they are right. 

The political changes at the top of Greece and Italy are promising. Greece’s new prime minister, Lucas Papademos, and Mario Monti of Italy are internationally credible economists, committed to making painful but much needed reforms, including liberalizing labor markets, shrinking overgrown bureaucracies, shedding state properties and rooting out corruption. 

Given their training, they surely understand that their economies are not now strong enough to absorb more austerity, including broad new taxes or further sweeping service cuts. Mr. Papademos and Mr. Monti should press their fellow European leaders for a new and better deal. Even with the best leadership, neither Greece nor Italy will be able, on their own, to restore their fiscal health and help slow the spreading financial contagion. That will require substantial and immediate help from their euro-zone partners, starting with Mrs. Merkel. 

An all-out effort by the European Central Bank to buy bonds, lower interest rates and inject new liquidity into the markets may still calm the contagion if it begins in the next few days. The bank’s new president, Mario Draghi, may be willing to play this role, if Germany stops standing in the way. 

Mrs. Merkel must make clear that she will support the central bank taking on this expanded role. And now that new, credible leaders are in office in Athens and Rome, she and other euro-zone leaders need to meet with them and negotiate more growth-friendly reform packages. There is very little time left to avoid financial catastrophe.

High stakes in Syria

Amir Taheri



November 16, 2011 -- As Arab foreign ministers met in Rabat, Morocco, yesterday to discuss Syria, one question was on every mind: Is the country already in a civil war?

Some of the facts on the ground suggest so. With more than 350 killed so far, November has been the bloodiest month since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began last spring.

Defections from the army, which started as a trickle, now look like a torrent. In October, the number was around 800. The best total now available is about 17,000. The defectors have organized themselves as the Free Syrian Army and are creating credible command-and-control structures.

Since September, the FSA has carried out a number of symbolic attacks against the regime. And now the “shadow army,” as Syrians call it, seems to be planning more spectacular operations.

On Monday, the FSA claimed an attack on an army convoy near Deraa, the southwestern town where the revolution started. Official accounts reported at least 34 soldiers killed.

Yesterday, the FSA attacked the headquarters of the Air Force Intelligence Agency at Harasta near the capital Damascus. Since Hafez al-Assad, an air-force officer and Bashar’s father, seized power in a coup in 1970, the AIA has been the nerve center of the regime’s security system.

Also this week, reports surfaced of attacks by armed tribesmen on three military outposts near the Iraqi border.

Despite all that, it may be premature to speak of civil war in Syria. 

In a civil war, a society is divided into armed camps that, initially at least, are roughly the same size. That’s not the case in Syria, where the uprising is backed by an overwhelming majority against a government that’s dominated by a small minority — the Ba’ath Party. To make matters worse, the Ba’ath is dominated by the Nusairi (Alawite) religious minority, a mere 5 percent of the population.

Thus, Syria’s is a nationwide revolution against a minority regime.

Almost all Syrians agree that the situation is untenable. Assad’s policy of rule by massacre has few supporters outside his clan. Judging by the revolution’s most popular slogan — “Assad Get Out!”— a majority may support demands for Assad to stand down, as suggested by Jordan’s King Abdullah.

Nevertheless, the Assad clan still controls enough military and financial assets to continue its rule-by-massacre strategy. 

The result could be the disintegration of the Syrian army and the emergence of armed groups beyond the control of either the government or the Syrian National Council, the opposition’s umbrella organization. That could lead to violence spilling into neighboring countries, especially Iraq and Lebanon.

Rather than speculating about a civil war, the Arab League and the international community should focus on the dangers that the Syrian situation poses for regional peace. 

A Franco-British resolution on Syria won a majority at the UN Security Council last month but was killed by Russian and Chinese vetoes. The Security Council should take up the issue again — this time to debate the threat to the region.

Last month, Russia and China tried to justify their vetoes by claiming that the Arab states were divided over Syria. This wasn’t true then and is less so now. The Arab League has suspended Syria’s membership and condemned the rule-by-massacre policy. Arab support is also building up for creating havens for Syrian refugees in Turkey, Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan.

Moscow had also expressed concern that, with Assad’s demise, a new Syrian government might “ignore Russia’s interests in the Middle East.” Since the vetoes, however, the Syrian National Council has established contact with Russia and China to offer assurances that a democratic Syria would pursue “cooperation with all nations.”

SNC sources tell me that they’ve also “opened a dialogue” with Iran, Assad’s main supporter, amid signs that it, too, may no longer be so sure about the despot’s chances of survival.

America must take the lead in mobilizing international support for the Syrian revolution. By removing one of the last regimes that still sponsors terrorism, the victory of democracy in Syria is in America’s best national interests.

Turkey has a key role in Syria – now and in the future

Simon Tisdall 



16 November 2011 -- The Arab League's unexpectedly tough action in suspending Syria, ostracising President Bashar al-Assad, and inviting opposition leaders to talks in Cairo has outraged the regime in Damascus, which suspects a US-led conspiracy to impose forcible regime change. But the increased hostility exhibited by Turkey, Syria's most powerful and best-connected neighbour, may yet prove decisive as Ankara assumes a crisis leadership role.

Until the uprising tore apart old certainties, the Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, had invested considerable capital in improved ties with Syria, with which Turkey almost went to war in the 1990s. A turning point came with the 2004 free trade agreement. This interdependence now gives Turkey significant economic leverage. Ankara has already imposed unilateral sanctions and is considering additional measures including a cut in electricity supplies.

Erdogan turned the screw again this week, accusing Assad personally of feeding on blood after he failed to honour the Arab League peace plan. No regime can survive by killing or jailing, he said. No one can build a future over the blood of the oppressed.

Turkey's motives are not difficult to discern. Chaos on its fragile southern flank, and Syria's possible descent into civil war, would be reasons enough to prompt Ankara's intervention. But Erdogan was also incensed by weekend attacks on Turkey's embassy in Damascus and regional consulates, apparently orchestrated by the regime. The government issued a formal protest and advised Turks against travel to Syria, a reversal of its proud open-borders policy.

Turkey also appears motivated by a desire to keep ahead of evolving Arab opinion. It can comfortably be said, in light of recent developments, that the countdown to the end of Syria's Assad regime has begun, said Today's Zaman columnist Bülent Kenes, reflecting official opinion.

With senior Saudi officials and King Abdullah of Jordan openly backing the revolt, and the violence escalating, Erdogan and his foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, who have long harboured regional leadership ambitions, seem to be positioning themselves for a post-Assad future.

In this push towards the Syrian endgame they plainly have the enthusiastic backing of the US, for whom they are effectively acting as a local proxy in opposition to external actors such as the pro-regime Russia. Given Erdogan's sharp differences with Washington over Israel-Palestine and the Iraq war, this coincidence of view is not lacking in irony. We very much welcome the strong stance that Turkey has taken and believe it sends a critical message to President Assad that … he should step down, said Ben Rhodes, Barack Obama's deputy national security adviser.

In a series of statements, Davutoglu has insisted it is no longer possible to trust the Syrian government. Adding provocation to insult, he underscored Ankara's support for the protesters and specifically for the Syrian National Council, an opposition umbrella group based in Turkey that is seeking recognition from Ankara. We will continue to take our place at the side of the Syrian people's rightful struggle, Davutoglu said.

As bilateral tensions rise, suggestions that Turkey may physically intervene in northern Syria to create a safe haven for civilians displaced by the violence are likely to resurface. Several thousand Syrian refugees are already sheltering inside Turkey, as are numerous Syrian army defectors. Possibly anticipating Syrian retaliation, the newspaper Hürriyet reported that President Abdullah Gül recently warned Assad would pay a heavy price for stirring up trouble in Turkey's Kurdish south-east.

Fears that a Syrian meltdown could seriously destabilise the wider neighbourhood are also driving Turkey's hardening response. Such a scenario could affect Iraq, where security concerns are rising as the US withdrawal nears completion, and even Iran, a close Assad ally.

For its part, the Syrian regime has pressing reasons to fear Ankara's animosity, as Gökhan Bacik pointed out in Today's Zaman. Unlike many Muslim countries, Turkey identifies strongly with Europe, the US and Nato. And in the past decade, Erdogan's Justice and Development party has made its brand of moderate Islamist politics acceptable to previously blinkered western eyes.

In other words, Turkey, with its majority Sunni Muslim population, furnishes a role model for the disenfranchised Sunni majority in Syria (and other Arab spring countries). Not only is Ankara encouraging revolution in Damascus, it is also living proof that Assad's politics of fear are outdated, that Syrians have before them a workable alternative paradigm, and that, after the revolution, the country's secular, Islamist and other sectarian traditions could fairly hope to co-exist peacefully, Turkish-style.

Foreign Policy

Barack Obama's Foreign Policy

November 16, 2011 


Foreign-policy credentials: As president, Obama has taken on a number of major foreign-policy initiatives, including a renewed troop surge in Afghanistan, the negotiation of the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia, the NATO intervention in Libya, the withdrawal from Iraq, ongoing trade negotiations with China, and of course, the killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. 


Overview: Obama is a much different candidate today from the senator who distinguished himself by his opposition to the dumb war on his way to the presidency in 2008. Obama has turned out, in many ways, to have pursued a fairly conventional, at times, hawkish foreign policy. He has had some notable successes, such as the bin Laden raid and this year's withdrawal from Iraq -- albeit on a timetable negotiated by his predecessor -- and the successful overthrow of Muammar al-Qaddafi. All the same, apology tours and leading from behind -- referring to an unfortunate description of Obama's diplomatic strategy by a White House staffer -- have already become buzzwords for Republican candidates. He has also faced heavy criticism on the left for a sometimes inconsistent approach to international law in counterterrorism operations. 



But with a significant economic recovery appearing unlikely and fewer domestic achievements to point to than he might have expected, coupled with the international inexperience of his opponents, Obama may make his foreign-policy wins the centerpiece of his reelection strategy. 



Advisors: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, National Security Advisor Thomas Donilon. 



On the issues: 



Afghanistan/Pakistan: We have put al Qaeda on a path to defeat, Obama announced last June, noting that the 33,000 surge troops he sent to Afghanistan in 2009 would be out of the country by the summer of 2012. Although a constant barrage of drone strikes and special operations raids have taken a harsh toll on al Qaeda, it may be difficult for Obama to make the case that Afghanistan has achieved stability or that Hamid Karzai's government can stand on its own without U.S. assistance. 



Relations with Pakistan have deteriorated significantly under Obama's tenure, particularly following the bin Laden raid. He has pledged to constantly evaluate the relationship between the two countries going forward but says he would be hesitant to cut off aid that could help the Pakistani people strengthen their own society and their own government. 



Military spending: Backed by his then current defense secretary, Robert Gates, Obama announced last April that the Pentagon will lead a fundamental review of U.S. military capabilities in order to cut $400 billion in defense spending over the next 10 years. We need to not only eliminate waste and improve efficiency and effectiveness, but conduct a fundamental review of America's missions, capabilities, and our role in a changing world, Obama said. Of course, major cuts could come sooner than that if the congressional supercommittee fails to reach an agreement on deficit reduction by Nov. 23. 



Immigration/borders: Obama insists that enacting comprehensive immigration reform, which would likely include a path to citizenship for at least some illegal immigrants already in the United States, is still a top priority, but with little congressional enthusiasm for such a measure, it has been pushed to the back burner for now. Meanwhile, deportations of illegal immigrants are continuing at a record pace, though the administration touts the fact that a higher percentage of those deported have criminal records. 



Obama has substantially increased the number of agents patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border, but has also mocked the fence-building enthusiasm of Republicans, saying they won't be happy until there's a moat with alligators. 



Israel/Palestine: Obama's engagement in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process has probably been the most frustrating foreign-policy initiative of his presidency and the one on which he is most often criticized by his Republican opponents. Obama continues to support negotiations on a two-state settlement of the conflict, but his best-remembered statement on the topic is controversial: his suggestion that Israel's pre-1967 war borders be taken as a starting point for negotiations, a position fiercely opposed by Israel. More recently, the administration has confirmed that it will veto Palestine's statehood bid in the U.N. Security Council. 



Obama's relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has seemed very strained at times. In a recently overheard conversation he told French President Nicolas Sarkozy, You're fed up with him? I have to deal with him every day. 



China: Obama has repeatedly criticized China -- most recently at the APEC summit in Honolulu -- for currency policies that he says have a distorting effect on the global economy. The president has made a few cautious statements on China's human rights record but came under criticism for delaying a White House meeting with the Dalai Lama. This year, the administration confirmed a $5.8 billion package of arms sales for Taiwan that provoked a predictable Chinese backlash. 



Foreign aid: In his 2010 address to the U.N. General Assembly, Obama announced an overhaul of U.S. foreign aid policies, which he vowed will place them at the center of U.S. foreign policy. In the speech he called aid a core pillar of American power. Nonetheless, foreign aid to a number of countries was cut by Congress in the 2012 budget. 



Iran/nukes: Early in his presidency, Obama made several overtures to Iran in an effort to improve relations. Critics say this engagement strategy went too far during the 2009 Green Movement uprising against the reelection of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, when the Obama administration was reluctant to overtly back the protesters. Since then, the administration has instituted a number of new sanctions against Iran that are aimed at halting its nuclear enrichment program. We are not taking any options off the table. Iran with nuclear weapons would pose a threat not only to the region but also to the United States, Obama said in a recent news conference in Hawaii. 



Trade: In October, Obama signed long-delayed free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. On his trip to Asia this November, Obama is working to promote a new trans-Pacific free trade agreement. We're not going to be able to put our folks back to work and grow our economy and expand opportunity unless the Asia-Pacific region is also successful, he said. Obama has indefinitely put on hold a campaign promise to renegotiate NAFTA. 



War on terror/detainees: Obama signed an executive order closing the Guantánamo Bay detention center as one of his first actions as president. The facility remains open, however, largely due to congressional opposition over where to house the remaining prisoners. Obama has put a halt to the enhanced interrogation techniques employed by George W. Bush's administration but has enraged some civil liberties advocates by authorizing the extrajudicial killing of alleged al Qaeda terrorist Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen. Obama has also disappointed some liberal supporters by resuming military trials of terrorism suspects at Guantánamo. 



Environment: Despite his stated support for environmental legislation and green energy, there has been little progress on passing major climate-change bills under Obama's watch. Thanks largely to Obama's public intervention, an agreement was reached at the 2009 Copenhagen climate summit, but in failing to impose enforceable emissions targets, the meeting was widely considered a failure. This year, Obama abandoned tough new air-quality rules, adopted early in his administration. 



Russia/reset: One of the centerpieces of Obama's first-term foreign policy was the effort to reset relations with Russia. The president successfully negotiated the New START nuclear reduction treaty, though there have been significant disagreements with both Russia and his GOP opponents over the contours of missile defense. Human rights advocates have criticized the president for ignoring the erosion of Russian democracy. Russia has also continued to stymie U.S. efforts to impose tough international sanctions on Iran and Syria. Obama seemed to have made friends with President Dmitry Medvedev, but relations with Russia may only get tougher, with Vladimir Putin's likely return to the Russian presidency. 



Arab Spring: After a slow start, the Obama administration eventually came around to calling for Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to step down, joining the NATO intervention in Libya, and supporting stricter sanctions against Syria. The president has been less outspoken about other Persian Gulf allies, including Bahrain, which hosts a key U.S. naval base. Obama has urged Egypt and Tunisia to set a strong example through free and fair elections, a vibrant civil society, accountable and effective democratic institutions, and responsible regional leadership. 



Other issues: Although he once described himself as a George H.W. Bush-school realist, in the past year Obama has learned to embrace humanitarian intervention, both in Libya and in central Africa, where military advisors have been sent to aid in the fight against the long-running insurgency by the Lord's Resistance Army. There's speculation that Nigeria may be next. It's a measure of how much things have changed in the last four years that Republicans are now attacking the Democratic president for trying to spread democracy and human rights at the barrel of a gun. 



As the European economic crisis has worsened, Obama has been speaking out more in support of strong measures to protect the common currency. Ultimately what they are going to need is a firewall that sends a clear signal we stand behind the European project and we stand behind the euro, he said during his recent trip to Australia.

America in the Asian Century

Dominique Moisi



2011-11-15 – At “ground zero” in lower Manhattan, two empty spaces will be filled by water cascades, memorializing in a serene and respectful way the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Next to them, a powerful tower, designed by the architect Daniel Libeskind and nearly completed, rises vigorously into the sky, a symbol of the triumph of life over the forces of death. One word comes to mind to characterize the impression made by this place, the site of an unprecedented crime: resilience.

In a building that houses what will one day be a memorial museum, one can buy a DVD entitled “9/12: From Chaos to Community.” Ground Zero is the architectural and human proof that, despite America’s current economic woes, it would be premature, if not dangerous, to write the country off as a declining power. America has the moral and intellectual resources that it needs in order to rebound.

But what is necessary is not sufficient. In order to reinvent itself, if not to manage its relative international decline, America must proceed toward a rebalancing of its domestic and international priorities. In the immediate aftermath of World War I, a triumphant America withdrew from global responsibility, with tragic consequences for the balance of power in a Europe that was left to face its inner demons alone.

In the aftermath of World War II, by contrast, the US managed successfully to contain Soviet ambitions. Today, unlike in 1945, Americans do not confront an imminent threat. Russia may speak loudly (using its permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council as a megaphone), but it is a greatly reduced rump of the Soviet Union. Likewise, while the nationalism of America’s principal rival, China, has become more assertive lately, the communist regime’s clear priority – indeed, the key to its stability – is domestic economic growth.

Indeed, the only obvious danger that the US faces stems from weapons of mass destruction, which could proliferate or be used by terrorist groups. But confronting this threat does not require a massive military budget or huge deployments of US troops all over the world. America has a much-needed opportunity to refocus on itself – to recover its inner strength without withdrawing from the world. As Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, puts it, America must enter a period of “restoration” of its fundamentals.

American foreign policy starts at home, and that means reining in budget deficits over the long term, reviving economic growth and job creation in the short term, and addressing the country’s deteriorating infrastructure. Indeed, America’s “aged modernity” has become a drag on its competitiveness, as well as an insult to its international image and a risk to the safety of its citizens.

Moreover, imperial fatigue has set in. Recent US history has been characterized by cycles of enthusiasm about foreign engagement. In the mid-1970’s, following the war in Vietnam, America, guided by President Jimmy Carter’s moralizing impulse, opted for “regionalization” of its engagements. But, given that the Soviet threat still existed, this effort came too early (and probably was carried out in the wrong manner).

Today, by contrast, the starting point for a reassessment of American priorities is more economic than ethical. But the reasoning is the same, for it is based on the conviction that more America in the world today implies less costly and confused interventionism tomorrow. That means that US foreign policy itself – defined in recent years by too much attention to the Middle East, and too little to Asia – must embrace a shift in priorities.

Of course, in the midst of today’s ongoing Arab revolutions, America cannot simply ignore the Middle East. Nor must the US give up hope on the Israel-Palestine front, or on its efforts to contain Iran’s nuclear ambitions. But it is in Asia that history is unfolding – and where the US must define its long-term global strategy.

Must the US, as Henry Kissinger suggests in his latest book On China, consider the prospect of a “Pacific Community” that, unlike the Cold War-era Atlantic Community, is not based on common culture and values in the face of a direct threat, but on common interests in an “age of rebalancing of world order”?

America’s resilience may contrast with Europe’s multiple weaknesses. But resilience will not be enough. The US must get back into shape to face tomorrow’s challenges, and that means restoring economic growth, reducing deficits, and improving infrastructure. Paradoxically, only a more confident America can accept a reduced global status, because reconciling oneself to change is always easier once one has taken the steps needed to adjust to it.

The following summary is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information appearing elsewhere in this
Memorandum. You should carefully consider the information set forth under “Risk Factors”. The term “KUE” refers
only to Knowledge Universe Education L.P, a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership. The terms “Knowledge
Universe Education”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” and “our” refer to KUE and, where applicable, its subsidiaries, and
do not refer to the Agents. In November 2005, KLC separated its education operations (“KLC OpCo”) from its real

estate assets (“KLC PropCo’).

1.1. Company Overview

KUE is the third largest for-profit education company in the world and the largest for-profit education
company in the pre-school to 12th grade segment (“pre-K-12”) in the world. While the Company's
operations are currently based within the U.S., the proceeds from this transaction will be used primarily to
expand KUE’s education platform both globally and across the pre-K-12 education continuum. KUE's
existing portfolio of assets consists of:

(i) KLC OpCo, the leading early childhood education
(“ECE”) company with 2,507 locations in 39 states Knowledge Universe KUE Management Inc.
and the District of Columbia and nearly two and a SCedo mae (General Partner)
half times larger than its next closest competitor in 17.9% to 40.0%
terms of revenue;

Knowledge Learning K42 Inc.
(ii) KLC PropCo, one of the largest education based cool on tele

real estate portfolios in the U.S. consisting of 845
early childhood centers located in 37 states; and

(iii) A significant interest in k12, an online curriculum
provider and kindergarten through 12th grade management company, currently serving over
25,000 students as the largest operator of online virtual schools in the U.S.

The principal owners of KUE are Michael Milken, Lowell Milken and Steven Green (collectively the
“Principals”). Michael Milken and Lowell Milken each has more than two decades of experience in the
education sector through involvement in several for-profit and not-for-profit initiatives. Steven Green,
former U.S. ambassador to Singapore, has more than two decades of experience as an international
industrialist leading major corporate restructurings and expansions in manufacturing, housing, consumer
products, retail and real estate enterprises. The Company represents the Principals’ sole vehicle for
equity investment opportunities in the pre-K-12 sector going forward.

The Principals founded the Company and its affiliated companies over the past decade based on their
vision of a world where competition for human capital? is becoming the driving force of economic
prosperity. To remain competitive in the world economy, countries will be forced to invest heavily in the
development of their human capital. The Principals believe that an investment made in an individual's
education, especially at a young age, is the most effective way to build human capital and thereby
increase that individual’s lifelong productivity. As the largest for-profit provider of ECE in the world, the
Company is well positioned to capitalize on these trends.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028102.txt,"because we were people with whom Rabin felt comfortable — a counterpoint, I
suspect, to the old Labor Party rival whom he had made Foreign Minister,
Shimon Peres. Though the two men had grown to respect each another over the
years, Rabin neither trusted, nor much liked, Shimon. In fact, though Peres’s
support inside Labor had secured him the foreign ministry, Rabin had stipulated
that all peace talks would remain under his control.

Yet as I'd discover nearly a decade later, when I was Prime Minister, even
the most carefully planned negotiating strategies were always subject to
setbacks, diversions, or simply what former British Prime Minister Harold
Macmillan once called “events, dear boy, events.” Rabin’s initial plan was not
to start with the Palestinians. He did feel it was essential to try to reach a
political settlement with them. In one respect, the prospects looked slightly
better than before. Arafat’s political position had been weakened: first by an
intifada driven as much by local insurgents as by the PLO in faraway Tunis, and
then by his decision to break with his longtime Gulf Arab financial supporters
and support Saddam Hussein the Gulf War. In 1988, as the entry price for a
formal dialogue with the Bush Administration, he had also agreed to a statement
in which he renounced terrorism and accepted the principle of a two-state peace
agreement with Israel. Still, there remained a yawning gap between the “self-
rule” envisaged in the Camp David accords of 1978 and the Madrid conference,
and the independent state the Palestinians wanted. Negotiations to bridge it were
likely to be fraught and long.

So he’d decided to begin with Syria. President Assad was obstinate, and
publicly opposed to the idea of making peace with Israel. But he’d been in
power for more than two decades and, crucially for Rabin, had lived up to the
few, indirect agreements Israel had made with him. The substance in any
agreement, though politically difficult, was also more straightforward. We knew
what Assad wanted: the recovery of the Golan Heights, in return for the
absolute minimum level of political normalization with Israel. We knew what
we wanted: security guarantees and assurances regarding water resources, and a
full and final peace treaty. For Rabin, there was an additional attraction in
beginning with Syria: if we did reach a deal with our main Arab enemy, the
pressure would intensify on the Palestinians to follow suit.

The dramatic turn of events that ultimately forced him to change tack began
in January 1993 in the sitting room of a villa outside Oslo, at an ostensible
“academic seminar” convened by the Norwegian diplomat Terje Larsen. It
included two Israeli academics with personal ties to prominent Palestinians:

Man I was coming to know.

We both undressed and J followed Jeffrey into the steam room first. He
loved feeling clean, teaching me that the steam would deplete the toxins
from your skin, which was great during a massage when your blood flow
is being replenished. I grabbed his foot out of instinct, knowing I had to
be constantly on alert to keep this man satisfied. He looked down at me
with-a nod and reclined back against the wall as the steam pored in, this
was his idea of alleviation. [ worked up to his calves and within a few
more minutes, he said he was ready for his massage on the bed. We got
out and towel dried off, both still nude, he asked me to stay undressed,
then we headed to massage bed in the middle of the room. He lay down
on the bed and told me to tum on the CD player on the wall hutch, where
all of the oils and lotions were set out, I hit play and a collection of mixed
classical symphonies began to fill the silence. I could tell he wasn’t in
one of those moods to be uplifted with idle chat, so | remained silent,
letting him enjoy my slow movements, making my way up his body. My
instincts told me I was right about his mood, as he seemed to appreciate
the quietness of moment and the leisurely of the strokes I was using to
massage him. When I got to his scalp he turned over, and grabbed my
hand to put on his erect manhood. No words spoken yet, I took the
gesture and initiated what I had been taught over the last week. While
pleasing my master his hands groped my young flesh, penetrating my
insides with his fingers, he was only concerned with what he wanted, as
If | was a new car out for a test drive and he was pressing his new
gadgets. His soft moans were soon brought to louder heaves of breath and
my job was done. No intimate kisses, or sweet pillow talk. He showed his
appreciation with money, never attachment. We concluded with a shower
and he told me he had some business to conduct. He walked me to the lift
and told me go to the next level and my room was the first one on the
right, it had an intercom in which he can contact me when needed.

I hit number 5 on the lift and took his directions to my room. I opened
the door to this massive loft, the size of an adequate house. I walked
down the long hall and my eyes took in the magnificence of my
surroundings. It was a room fit for royalty, and later would find out had
been stayed in by some. The room was trimmed in gold paint and had
another eerie tapestry on the main wall as feature. There was a T.V and a
huge king sized bed, with goose feathered comforter and pillows.

All of the glitter from Jeffrey’s lifestyle he was offering me finally
covered the last bit of sight I had left and I let go of my consciousness.
Excited by my enthralling day, not having anyone around to have to act
reserved, I jumped into the soft bed and lay looking around, thinking
about how quick life could change based upon one swift decision. Dazing

into the artistry, the intercom buzzed on the telephone next to the bed and
it was a housemaid letting me know Jeffrey wanted to see me in his office
now. “Already” I thought to myself, I was just getting settled in. I was
worried I was going to get lost in this ancient museum, but I got myself
back to his office with no trouble, it was kind of hard to miss. I knocked
at the slightly ajar door and Jeffrey called for me to enter. I walked over
to his desk, where he was just ending a phone call and he opened his
duffel bag full of money. “T’ll be out at my other office for most of the
day, so instead of being locked inside | thought you should go do some
sightseeing for the day since it is your first trip to the Big Apple” He
didn’t count how much he was giving me he just handed mea bundle out
of the banded $100 dollar bills. He knew just how pull the right strings,
making me squeal in delight and give him a kiss in the cheek, since we
were never really emotionally intimate, it would be odd to act in any
other way, but he seemed to like it.

I ran upstairs to get dressed for “City” shopping and put my make-up
on, then hit the streets of N.Y.C, looking for a place to start spending this
load of dosh. When I got to the end of 72 street on Sth Avenue, I had no
idea which way to turn, left or right. 1 thought I’d just follow the lights
past Central Park and see the local sights on my way. My eyes were once
again peeled back in splendor. I had never imagined a place so busy with
the hustle and bustle of all the walks of life. My first stop was to buy a
disposable camera and I was off taking photos of every wonder that
caught my attention. I didn’t do much shopping as I had planned too; |
was having too much fun exploring this capacious metropolitan.

When it started to hit dusk I began walking back to Jeffrey’s but not
before stopping off to enjoy a giant slice of pepperoni pizza, it was the
best | had ever had, and considering | was going back to Jeffrey’s
chickpea and tofu salad’s or such. I really hated the healthy cuisine
served by Jeffrey’s personal chef. I was a naturally skinny girl, never
watching what I ate and to eat that food I might as well have chewed on
hay. I strolled back to Jeffrey’s and was missed. Ghislane scolded me
“You shouldn’t have been gone so long young lady”, “We need to know
where you are at all times, you are on call for Jeffrey” I started to
apologize, feeling guilty, I didn’t want them to think I didn’t take my job
with them seriously. She cut off my explanation with a short conclusion
to this conversation “We will get you a cell phone tomorrow, so we can
always find you”. I thanked her for her generosity, and she dismissed me
to my room. So I wasn’t even needed after all, it was just a way for her to
place me deeper in their control. The next few days I was on call, as
Ghislane said I’d be. Venturing out to the city for only an hour or so at a
time, I looked most forward to my outings. | would return to Jeffrey’s

The allegation: Harth claimed that Trump made repeated unwanted sexual advances as she and her romantic 
partner at the time, George Houraney, pursued a business relationship with the mogul in the early 1990s. She 
said that on January 24, 1993, at Mar-a-Lago, Trump offered her a tour of the estate, then pulled her into his 
daughter Ivanka's empty bedroom. 
He pushed me up against the wall, and had his hands all over me and tried to get up my dress again, Harth 
said, and I had to physically say: 'What are you doing? Stop it.' It was a shocking thing to have him do this 
because he knew I was with George, he knew they were in the next room. And how could he be doing this when 
I'm there for business? 
In 1997 Harth and Houraney sued Trump for breach of contract, and she filed a separate sexual-harassment suit, 
accusing him of attempted rape. They reached a confidential settlement in the contract suit, and as part of the 
agreement Harth withdrew her suit.

Huang Yi
Choreographer, dancer, inventor
As a child, Huang Yi longed for a robot companion. As an adult, he created a robot to dance with: KUKA.
Taiwanese dancer, choreographer, inventor, and videographer Huang Yi’s pioneering work is steeped in his fascination with the partnership
between humans and robots. He interweaves continuous movement with mechanical and multimedia elements to create a form of dance
which corresponds with the flow of data, effectively making the performer a dancing instrument. Named by Dance Magazine as one of the
“25 to Watch,” Huang is one of Asia’s most prolific choreographers.
Harmoniously weaving together the art of dance and the science of mechanical engineering, HUANG YI & KUKA is a poetic work that
intertwines modern dance and visual arts with the realm of robotics, revealing humanity through a series of vignettes between live dancers
and KUKA, a robot conceptualized and programmed by Huang. “Dancing face to face with a robot is like looking at my own face in a
mirror...I think I have found the key to spin human emotions into robots,” Huang asserts.
HUANG YI & KUKA is an original production of Huang Yi Studio +, developed at 3LD Art & Technology Center, in association with
Sozo Artists. Commissioned by Quanta Arts Foundation.

Anab Jain
Futurist, designer
Superflux co-founder and TED Fellow Anab Jain parses uncertainties around our shared futures to create provocative experiences, tools
and tactics that we can adopt today.
In 2009, Anab Jain co-founded the design firm Superflux with Jon Ardern, inspired by influences as far-flung as avant-garde architecture
and Andrei Tarkovsky. The challenges Jain explores are some of the biggest -- climate change, biotech, intelligent machines -- and her
resulting work “navigates the entangled wilderness of our technology, politics, culture and environment to imagine new ways of seeing,
being and acting.”
In her work, Jain creates worlds, stories and tools that provoke and inspire us to engage with the precarity of our rapidly changing world.
Superflux is building tools, methods and commons that can enable us to mitigate the shock of food insecurity and climate change. Recently
they produced a series of civilian drones, and created a vision of a near-future city where these intelligent machines begin to display
increasing autonomy with civic society. Among Superflux’s previous projects is a headset allowing blind subjects injected with a lightsensitive
virus to develop a kind of “super-sight” sensitive to spectrums that ordinary vision cannot detect.

Garry Kasparov
Grandmaster, analyst
Garry Kasparov is esteemed by many as the greatest chess player of all time. Now he’s engaged in a game with far higher stakes: the
preservation of democracy.
When 22-year-old Garry Kasparov became the world’s youngest chess Grand Champion, few could predict his turbulent career in chess or
as a dissident. His chessboard wizardry was already the stuff of legend when, in 1997, he made headlines when he lost a rematch to IBM’s
Deep Blue supercomputer, ushering AI into the public sphere.
Kasparov’s book Winter Is Coming details the rise of Putin’s Russia as well as Kasparov’s persecution and self-exile, and it serves chilling
warnings of reactionary forces gathering in the West. He is the chair of the Human Rights Foundation, succeeding his predecessor Vaclav
Havel.

Tim Ferriss
Human guinea pig, author
Tim Ferriss is author of The 4-Hour Workweek, a self-improvement program of four steps: defining aspirations, managing time, creating
automatic income and escaping the trappings of the 9-to-5.
Tim Ferris brings an analytical yet accessible approach to the challenges of self-improvement and career advancement through what he
calls lifestyle design. His 2007 book, The 4-Hour Workweek, and his lectures on productivity are stuffed with moving, encouraging
anecdotes -- often from his own life -- that show how simple decisions, made despite fears or hesitation, can make for a drastically more
meaningful day-to-day experience at work, or in life.
Word-of-blog chatter in Silicon Valley may have propelled his book to bestselling success, but Ferriss himself takes a fervid stance against
the distractions of technology toys that promote unnecessary multitasking. Following the success of his book, Ferriss has become a fulltime
angel investor.
Titus Kaphar
Artist
Titus Kaphar's artworks interact with the history of art by appropriating its styles and mediums.
As Titus Kaphar says of his work: “I’ve always been fascinated by history: art history, American history, world history, individual history -
- how history is written, recorded, distorted, exploited, reimagined, and understood. In my work I explore the materiality of reconstructive
history. I paint and I sculpt, often borrowing from the historical canon, and then alter the work in some way. I cut, crumple, shroud, shred,
stitch, tar, twist, bind, erase, break, tear, and turn the paintings and sculptures I create, reconfiguring them into works that nod to hidden
narratives and begin to reveal unspoken truths about the nature of history.

work exhibited at Jack Shainman gallery December-January 2017 seeks to collapse the line of American history to inhabit a fixed point in
the present. Historical portraiture, mug shots, and YouTube stills challenge viewers to consider how we document the past, and what we

define them over time. As a whole, this exhibition explores the power of rewritten histories to question the presumption of innocence and
the mythology of the heroic.

Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks
Religious leader
In a world violently polarized by extremists, Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks is proposing and advocating solutions to mounting religious
intolerance.
Rabbi Lord Sacks is one of Judaism’s spiritual leaders, and he exercises a primary influence on the thought and philosophy of Jews and
people of all faiths worldwide. Since stepping down as Chief Rabbi of the UK and Commonwealth in 2013, Rabbi Lord Sacks has become
an increasingly well-known speaker, respected moral voice and writer; his 2015 book is Not in God's Name: Confronting Religious
Violence.
Granted a seat in the British House of Lords in 2009, Rabbi Lord Sacks is a key Jewish voice for universalism and an embrace of tolerance
between religions and cultures. He rejects the “politics of anger” brought about by the way “we have acted as if markets can function
without morals, international corporations without social responsibility and economic systems without regard to their effect on the people
left stranded by the shifting tide. He also sees, as a key idea for faith in our times, that unity in heaven creates diversity on earth.

Jack Conte
Musician, entrepreneur
With his membership platform Patreon, YouTube star Jack Conte may have solved a perennial problem of content creators -- getting paid
for digital media.
As a solo artist and member of folk-rock duo Pomplamoose, Jack Conte garnered millions of views for his offbeat “video songs,” including
his breakout hit “Yeah Yeah Yeah” and “Pedals,” a robotic tour-de-force with a set that duplicates the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon.
Despite his success, Conte noted the disconnect between page views and revenue, and realized that if you’re a widely viewed artist and you
aren’t making money, “that’s not your fault -- it’s technology’s fault.” His solution is Patreon: a membership platform built on recurring

Gabriela González
Astrophysicist
Gabriela González is part of the collaboration of more than 1,000 scientists who measured for the first time the gravitational waves that
Einstein predicted over 100 years ago.
Over 100 years after Albert Einstein predicted gravitational waves -- ripples in space-time caused by violent cosmic collision, like the
merging of two black holes -- the LIGO Scientific Collaboration confirmed their existence using large, hyper-sensitive detectors in
different parts of the world. As LIGO's former spokesperson and the person responsible for the collaboration of 90 international scientific
institutions that the project entailed, Argentine astrophysicist Gabriela González announced the extraordinary discovery to the world in
2016.
A relentless curiosity about the universe led González to astrophysics as a teenager. Over the course of her 25-year career, she has
advanced the field of gravitational wave detection, working on both improving the sensitivity of interferometers and data analysis. She is
the recipient of the E. Bouchet and the Jesse W. Beams awards from the American Physical Society, the B. Rossi prize from the American
Astronomical Society, and the 2016 Scientific Discovery Award from the US National Academy of Sciences. She was the first woman to
receive a full professorship in the physics department at Louisiana State University.

Primatologist
Isabel Behncke Izquierdo studies the social behavior of primates and the birth of human cultures.
TED Fellow Isabel Behncke Izquierdo writes: I was born and raised in Chile, and was educated in animal behaviour and evolutionary
anthropology in Cambridge and Oxford. For my PhD work, I study the social behaviour (and play behaviour in particular) of wild bonobos
in DR Congo.
Bonobos are, together with chimpanzees, our living closest relatives; however we know very little about them -- mostly through captive
work. In Wamba, a most remote jungle location, I have observed unique aspects of bonobo lives (from imaginary play and laughter to
inter-group encounters to accidents and death) that challenge and illuminate our understanding of human evolution. I aim to link the play of
adult bonobos to insights on human laughter, joy, creativity and our capacity for wonder and exploration.

Ingrid Betancourt
Writer, peace advocate
Ingrid Betancourt was a presidential candidate in Colombia in 2002 when she was kidnapped by guerilla rebels. After six years in captivity
and a high-profile rescue, she now writes about what she learned about fear, forgiveness and the divine.
In 2002, the Colombian rural guerilla movement known as the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) kidnapped Ingrid
Betancourt in the middle of her presidential campaign. For the next six years, Betancourt was held hostage in jungle prison camps where
she was ravaged by malaria, fleas, hunger, and human cruelty until her high-profile rescue by the Colombian government in 2008.
But Betancourt's captivity did not diminish her sensitivity to the world. Since her release, the would-be president has become a memoirist
and fiction writer. Her first book, Even Silence Has Its End, which lyrically recounts her six years in the impenetrable jungle, was
published in 2010. In 2016, she published a second work -- this time of fiction -- called The Blue Line, about the disappearances in
Argentina during the Dirty War from 1976 to 1983.
Betancourt has received multiple international awards for her commitment to democratic values, freedom and tolerance, including the
French National Order of the Légion d’Honneur, the Spanish Prince of Asturias Prize of Concord, and the Italian Prize Grinzane Cavour.

Raj Panjabi
Physician
A billion people around the world lack access to health care because they live too far from a clinic. Through Last Mile Health, 2017 TED
Prize winner Raj Panjabi aims to extend health services to all -- by training members of the community.
Raj Panjabi was nine years old when civil war broke out in his native country of Liberia. His family fled, eventually resettling in High
Point, North Carolina. Raj dreamed of going to medical school and, as a student in 2005, he returned to Liberia. He was shocked to find a
health care system in total devastation. Only 50 doctors remained to treat a population of four million.
With a small team of Liberian civil war survivors, American health workers and $6,000 he'd received as a wedding gift, Panjabi cofounded
Last Mile Health in 2007. Initially focused on care for HIV patients, Last Mile Health has grown into a robust organization that
partners with the government of Liberia to recruit, train, equip and employ community health care workers who provide a wide range of
services to their neighbors in Liberia's most remote regions. In 2016, Last Mile Health workers treated 50,000 patients, including nearly
22,000 cases of malaria, pneumonia and diarrhea in children. While the organization focuses on integrated primary care, its network can be
leveraged in a crisis. In the fight against Ebola, Last Mile Health supported government response by training 1,300 health workers in
southeastern Liberia.
Panjabi is a physician in the Division of Global Health Equity at Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital and an advisor
to the Clinton Global Initiative. He was ranked as one of The World’s 50 Greatest Leaders by Fortune in 2015 and named to TIME's list
of the 100 Most Influential People in the World in 2016. As the winner of the 2017 TED Prize, he has a bold wish to take his work even

Hidden under many meters of ice, a pool of meltwater lies under the Greenland Ice Sheet. Kristin Poinar studies how the meltwater forms
and flows in this dynamic glacial system. She asks: How did this water get there, and where does it go? How much water is in there? And
how is climate change affecting this system?
Using data from Operation IceBridge flights and from field instruments, she's building a numerical model of how crevasses form and
channel water. In fact, a NASA report released in February 2017 revealed a new pathway her team discovered for meltwater to reach the
ocean. Using physically based models to constrain the bounds of what is realistic has shaped Poinar's interest in glaciology.

Geoengineering researcher
Tim Kruger researches geoengineering: techniques to counteract climate change by deliberate, large-scale intervention in the earth system,
by reflecting sunlight back into space or by reducing the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
While our first priority should be to reduce global carbon emissions, research into geoengineering could prove vital in the fight to protect
our planet. At the Oxford Geoengineering Programme, Tim Kruger aims to assess the range of proposed geoengineering techniques to
determine which, if any, could be both technically feasible and benign environmentally, socially and ethically.
Kruger, an Oxford Martin Fellow, is a co-author of the Oxford Principles, a draft code of conduct for geoengineering. It calls for
geoengineering to be regulated as a public good, for public participation in decision-making and for disclosure of research and open
publication of results. He is involved in developing a process that uses natural gas to generate electricity in a way that removes carbon
dioxide from the atmosphere.

Peter Calthorpe’s 30-year design practice is informed by the idea that successful places -- whether neighborhoods, towns, urban districts or
metropolitan regions -- must be diverse in uses and users, must be scaled to the pedestrian and human interaction, and must be
environmentally sustainable.
In the early 1990s he developed the concept of Transit Oriented Development (described in his book The Next American Metropolis:
Ecology, Community and the American Dream) -- an idea that is now the foundation of many regional policies and city plans around the
world. His 2010 book is Urbanism in the Age of Climate Change. Calthorpe Associates' work in Europe, Asia and the Middle East has
demonstrated that community design with a focus on sustainability and scale can be adapted throughout the globe. His current work

Anna Heringer
Architect
Anna Heringer’s sustainable designs lend breathtaking forms to easily-available local materials while developing the skills and
consciousness of their builders.
Before she became an architect, a visit to a small village in Bangladesh immediately hooked Anna Heringer on an ancient and yet
neglected building material -- earth. With its easy availability, durability and endless recyclability, she realized, there was a reason its use
has persisted for thousands of years.
Since then, Heringer’s love affair with sustainable materials has deepened, resulting in acclaimed projects like woven bamboo hostels in
China and the METI Handmade School in Rudrapur, where, along with local workers and schoolchildren, she created a building that drew
on locally abundant materials and fostered modern, sustainable building skills in local craftsmen. In the 2014 book, The Future of
Architecture, she and her coauthors argue for a future that is low-impact and adaptable.

Robert Sapolsky
Neuroscientist, primatologist, writer
Robert Sapolsky is one of the leading neuroscientists in the world, studying stress in primates (including humans).
We all have some measure of stress, and Robert Sapolsky explores its causes as well as its effects on our bodies (his lab was among the
first to document the damage that stress can do to our hippocampus). In his research, he follows a population of wild baboons in Kenya,
who experience stress very similarly to the way humans do. By measuring hormone levels and stress-related diseases in each primate, he
determines their relative stress, looking for patterns in personality and social behavior that might contribute. These exercises have given
Sapolsky amazing insight into all primate social behavior, including our own.
He has been called one of the best scientist-writers of our time by Oliver Sacks. Sapolsky has produced, in addition to numerous
scientific papers, books for broader audiences, including A Primate’s Memoir: A Neuroscientist’s Unconventional Life Among the Baboons,
Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers: Stress Disease and Coping, and The Trouble with Testosterone.

TED2017: The future you
4/20/17, 12:07 PM
David Brenner sees the good and the bad sides of radiation for health care, and his goal is to optimize radiation for situations where the
benefits can be large and the risks small.
Radiation is very much a two-edged sword -- used in the right way it has revolutionized modern medicine -- such as through CT scans and
as a cure for many cancers. But radiation used in the wrong way can be harmful. To maximize the benefits of the many different types of
radiation, we need to understand exactly how they affect us -- from our DNA to the whole person.
Brenner directs the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University Medical Center. He started his career in theoretical physics --
applying quantum mechanics to radiation therapy. While he has no doubt forgotten everything he knew about quantum mechanics, he has
retained his love for applying hard-core physics concepts to solve biological problems. David has designed new “patient friendly”
approaches for prostate cancer radiation therapy that are now in common use worldwide, and he is currently very excited about the
prospects of beating pancreatic cancer with new types of radiation.
Over the past 6 years, Brenner has also been working towards a safe way to kill drug-resistant bacteria such as MRSA, as well as airborne
viruses such as influenza, using a unique type of ultra-violet light.

With his Microsculpture series, Levon Biss photographs the incredible details of insects.
Levon Biss is a British photographer who works across many genres, including reportage, sport and portraiture. His passion for nature and
photography have come together to create Microsculpture. For the project, a unique photographic process composites thousands of images
using multiple lighting setups to create the final insect portraits. Each specimen was mounted on an adapted microscope stage, allowing
close control over the position of the specimen in front of the camera lens. Most insects were photographed in about 30 sections, each
section lit differently with strobe lights to accentuate the microsculpture of that particular area of the body. Each insect portrait is created
from more than 8,000 separate images. In between his insect projects, Biss continues to photograph humans.

Susan Pinker
Psychologist, columnist, author
Susan Pinker reveals how in-person social interactions are not only necessary for human happiness but also could be a key to health and
longevity.
In her award-winning book The Sexual Paradox, Susan Pinker argued that biological differences could play an unexpectedly large role in
creating the workplace gender gap. With The Village Effect, she tracks another current: how social, face-to-face interactions are critical for
the survival of our species, and how technology is isolating us from these life-saving bonds. As she writes: Neglecting to keep in close
contact with people who are important to you is at least as dangerous to your health as a pack-​a-​day cigarette habit, hypertension or
obesity.
In addition to her books, Pinker writes Mind and Matter, a column for the Wall Street Journal illuminating surprising advances in human
behavior research. Pinker’s numerous writings (including her weekly columns Problem Solving and The Business Brain) have
appeared in the Guardian, the New York Times and Financial Times, among many others.

Jim Yong Kim
President of the World Bank Group
Jim Yong Kim is leading the World Bank Group in the global effort to end extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity.
Jim Yong Kim is the 12th president of the World Bank Group. Soon after he assumed his position in July 2012, the organization
established two goals to guide its work: to end extreme poverty by 2030; and to boost shared prosperity, focusing on the bottom 40 percent
of the population in developing countries. In September 2016, the World Bank Group Board unanimously reappointed Kim to a second
five-year term as president.
During his first term, the World Bank Group supported the development priorities of countries at levels never seen outside a financial crisis
and, with its partners, achieved two successive, record replenishments of the World Bank Group’s fund for the poorest. The institution also
launched several innovative financial instruments, including facilities to address infrastructure needs, prevent pandemics and help the
millions of people forcibly displaced from their homes by climate shocks, conflict, and violence.
Kim’s career has revolved around health, education and delivering services to the poor. In 1987, Kim co-founded Partners In Health, a
nonprofit medical organization that works in poor communities on four continents. He has received a MacArthur “genius” grant, was
recognized as one of America’s “25 Best Leaders” by U.S. News & World Report and was named one of TIME magazine’s “100 Most
Influential People in the World.”

Emily Esfahani Smith
Author
In her book The Power of Meaning, Emily Esfahani Smith rounds up the latest research -- and the words of great thinkers across
generations—to argue that the search for meaning is far more fulfilling than the pursuit of personal happiness.
Emily Esfahani Smith is the author of The Power of Meaning: Crafting a Life That Matters, a book that explores how we can each find
meaning in life. She says: In recent decades, there's been a rising tide of despair across the world—people feeling more depressed and
alone, and even ending their lives. To be psychologically and spiritually healthy, we need to believe that our lives are meaningful. We all
need to discover ways to feel connected to something larger than ourselves -- to feel that our lives make sense. Fortunately, we can all do
this -- we can all create meaningful lives.
Smith draws on psychology, philosophy and literature to write about the human experience -- why we are the way we are and how we can
find grace and meaning in a world that is full of suffering. Her articles There's More to Life than Being Happy and Masters of Love,
originally published in The Atlantic, have been read more than 30 million times. Her writing has also appeared in the Wall Street Journal,
New York Times and TIME. She is an instructor in positive psychology at the University of Pennsylvania. She is also a columnist for The
New Criterion, as well as an editor at the Stanford University's Hoover Institution, where she manages the Ben Franklin Circles project, a
collaboration with the 92nd Street Y and Citizen University to build meaning in local communities.

Found Sound Nation
Musical collective
Found Sound Nation (FSN) is a collective of artists who use music-making to connect people across cultural divides.
FSN believes that collaborative music creation is a deeply effective way to become aware of the beauty, trauma and hidden potential in our
communities. Their process gives voice to the underrepresented, unlocks the creative potential of youth and supports movements for social
justice.
Founded by Christopher Marianetti and Jeremy Thal in 2010, FSN began its work as part of the groundbreaking new music organization,
Bang on a Can. Over the years, FSN has led audio production workshops for Cine Institute in Haiti, worked extensively with Carnegie Hall
in New York, Indonesia and Mexico, and developed music composition workshops with incarcerated youth in theBronx and Brooklyn.
In the field of cultural diplomacy, FSN developed the Dosti Music Project with US Embassies in Pakistan and India to bring together
politically divided artists to create and tour original work. Since 2012 FSN has partnered with the US Department of State’s Bureau of
Educational and Cultural Affairs and Bang on a Can to produce OneBeat, to convene young professional musicians from around the globe
each fall to use music as a tool for the betterment of our communities, forming a growing web of interconnected musical change-makers
from around the globe.

Noah Feldman
Constitutional law scholar
Noah Feldman studies the intersection of religion, politics and law.
Noah Feldman is a professor and writer who tries to figure out how to make the government follow the rules; what the rules are that the
government has to follow; and what to do if the rules are being broken. In his work, he asks questions like: How can a 225-year-old
constitutional blueprint still work? Can you design a new and better constitution from scratch in places like Iraq and Tunisia? What rights
do we have, really?
Feldman is the Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law at Harvard Law School and a contributing writer for Bloomberg View. He served as
senior constitutional advisor to the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, and advised members of the Iraqi Governing Council on the
drafting of the Transitional Administrative Law or interim constitution. He is writing a biography on James Madison, principal author of
the Constitution and fourth president of the US; it's forthcoming in 2017.
Feldman is the author of six other books: Cool War: The Future of Global Competition (Random House, 2013); Scorpions: The Battles and
Triumphs of FDR’s Great Supreme Court Justices (Twelve Publishing, 2010); The Fall and Rise of the Islamic State (Princeton University
Press, 2008); Divided By God: America's Church-State Problem and What We Should Do About It (Farrar, Straus & Giroux 2005); What
We Owe Iraq: War and the Ethics of Nation building (Princeton University Press 2004) and After Jihad: America and the Struggle for
Islamic Democracy (Farrar, Straus & Giroux 2003. He most recently co-authored two textbooks: Constitutional Law, Eighteenth Edition
(Foundation Press, 2013) and First Amendment Law, Fifth Edition (Foundation Press, 2013).
Julia Sweeney
Actor, comedian, playwright
Julia Sweeney creates comedic works that tackle deep issues: cancer, family, faith.
Julia Sweeney is a writer, director, actress, comedian and monologist. She is known for being a cast member on Saturday Night Live from
1990 to 1995, where she created and popularized the androgynous character, Pat. She is also well known for her comedic and dramatic
monologues. God Said Ha! is a monologue about serious illness, her brother's lymphoma and her own cancer, and her family's crazy
reactions to this crisis as they soldiered their way through struggle, confusion and death. This play was performed all over the U.S. and on
Broadway at the Lyceum Theater. It was made into a film produced by Quentin Tarantino, and the comedy album from the show was
nominated for a Grammy.
Sweeney's second monologue, In the Family Way, played in theatrical runs in New York and Los Angeles. It was ultimately fashioned into
a book, a memoir titled If It's Not One Thing, It's Your Mother. Sweeney's third monologue, Letting Go of God, chronicled her journey from
Catholicism to atheism. It was made into a film that played on Showtime.

In the last report, analyzed data was of 3 days in which Clinton got a positive spike after she got clearance

time of election, monthly data and entire data which we have gathered for months. Based on this we predicted 
on our Facebook page on 30th October that Trump will be next president of US. 
Our model works but I think the important question which we failed to answer is that how much historic data 
must be analyzed to make the right decision. This could have been answered if we had a Data Scientist. Also I 
believe its a great tool to track voters and get them to vote. It can be used in French elections next year or 
elections of Brazil in 2018 but unfortunately I have to shut down this project as getting data from Twitter is 
expensive and the start up is running out of money. 
I am going to focus on cyber security again and will definitely reach out if I have a powerful investable idea.

. Matrix multiplication of Mz» by itself

repeatedly is equivalent to tracking the temporal evolution of the transition matrix’s
probabilities until the resulting matrices move toward, converge onto, a steady state;
each self matrix multiplication step represents what results from the passage of one
unit of time. The convergence to equilibrium values is continuous and gradual.
When the steady state is reached, both rows become identical. For this example,

rows to the same asymptotic values. Books discussing the multiplicative and other
behavior of these nonnegative matrices are numerous and frequently appear in
matrix algebra texts under the rubric of the Frobenius-Perron theorems.

Using the entropy formalism of Claude Shannon as developed previously, Hy
is computed as the sum across either of the identical rows of each probability times
its logarithm, px /og(p.p2x/og(p2)) remembering from above that we are working in
base 2 logarithms and to change the minus sign (resulting from taking the
logarithms of decimal fractions) to plus: Hy (Mip) = .4444 x log(.4444) + 5555 x
log(.5555) = .9911 The nonuniformity of the box occupancy probabilities is reflected
in the difference between the topological (maximal estimate) and metric (minimal
estimate) entropies and is therefore quantifiable and computable: H7 - Hy # 0 = 1.00
- 0.9911 = 0. 0089. If the maximal and minimal estimates of the entropy were equal

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016338.txt,"might sound like a risk, human understanding comes with its own limits; engineering
design is littered with what appeared to be good insights that have had bad consequences.
Declarative design rests on all the advances in AI, plus the improving fidelity of
simulations to virtually test designs.

The mother of all design problems is the one that resulted in us. The way we’re
designed resides in one of the oldest and most conserved parts of the genome, called the
Hox genes. These are genes that regulate genes, in what are called developmental
programs. Nothing in your genome stores the design of your body; your genome stores,
rather, a series of steps to follow that results in your body. This is an exact parallel to
how search is done in AI. There are too many possible body plans to search over, and
most modifications would be either inconsequential or fatal. The Hox genes are a
representation of a productive place for evolutionary search. It’s a kind of natural
intelligence at the molecular level.

AI has a mind-body problem, in that it has no body. Most work on AI is done in
the cloud, running on virtual machines in computer centers where data are funneled. Our
own intelligence is the result of a search algorithm (evolution) that was able to change
our physical form as well as our programming—those are inextricably linked. Ifthe
history of AI can be understood as the working of scaling laws rather than a succession of
fashions, then its future can be seen in the same way. What’s now being digitized, after
communication and computation, is fabrication, bringing the programmability of bits to
the world of atoms. By digitizing not just designs but the construction of materials, the
same lessons that von Neumann and Shannon taught us apply to exponentially increasing
fabricational complexity.

I’ve defined digital materials to be those constructed from a discrete set of parts
reversibly joined with a discrete set of relative positions and orientations. These
attributes allow the global geometry to be determined from local constraints, assembly
errors to be detected and corrected, heterogeneous materials to be joined, and structures
to be disassembled rather than disposed of when they’re no longer needed. The amino
acids that are the foundation of life and the Lego bricks that are the foundation of play
share these properties.

What’s interesting about amino acids is that they’re not interesting. They have
attributes that are typical but not unusual, such as attracting or repelling water. But just
twenty types of them are enough to make you. In the same way, twenty or so types of
digital-material part types—conducting, insulating, rigid, flexible, magnetic, etc —are
enough to assemble the range of functions that go into making modern technologies like
robots and computers.

The connection between computation and fabrication was foreshadowed by the
very pioneers whose work the edifice of computing is based on. Wiener hinted at this by
linking material transportation with message transportation. John von Neumann is
credited with modern computer architecture, something he actually wrote very little
about; the final thing he studied, and wrote about beautifully and at length, was self-
reproducing systems. As an abstraction of life, he modeled a machine that can
communicate a computation that constructs itself. And the final thing Alan Turing, who
is credited with the theoretical framework for computer science, studied was how the
instructions in genes can give rise to physical forms. These questions address a topic
absent from a typical computer-science education: the physical configuration of a

sea levels will rise by about a meter. You are correct that we should ask if it can be reduced.. We are currently 
involved in a proposal that explores capturing CO2 from the atmosphere.. That may cost about 100/ton CO2.. if 
there was a carbon tax, that might be doable. it is not clear yet, but total research on this so far <10

it controlled in the NSA to expose himself by contacting journalists.
Snowden’s continued interactions with Poitras and Greenwald make
it implausible that he was under Russian control before he went to
Hong Kong.

The Hong Kong Scenario

The most compelling support for the scenario that Snowden was
brought under Russian control while he was in Hong Kong comes, it
will be recalled, from Vladimir Putin. His disclosure about the case
leaves little doubt that Russian officials had engaged Snowden in
Hong Kong, that Putin had authorized his trip to Moscow, and that
the Russian government allowed him to fly to Moscow without a
Russian visa. We know that Putin’s version is supported by U.S. sur-
veillance of Snowden’s activities in Hong Kong. We also know that
the Russians went to some lengths not only to facilitate his trip to
Moscow but to arrange to keep him in Russia. This supports the
© possibility that the Russian intelligence service managed to bring ©
Snowden under its sway during his thirty-four days in Hong Kong.
The Russian intelligence service might even have been aware
of Snowden and his anti-NSA activities before his arrival on May
20. Snowden was anything but discreet in his contacts with strang-
ers in the anti-surveillance movement, including such well-known
activists as Runa Sandvik (to whom he revealed his true name and
address via e-mail), Micah Lee, Jacob Appelbaum, Parker Higgins,
and Laura Poitras. “It is not statistically improbable that members of
this circle were being watched by a hostile service,” a former NSA
counterintelligence officer told me in 2015. When I told him that
Poitras and others in her circle had used PGP encryption, aliases,
and Tor software in their exchanges with Snowden, he said, arching
his eyebrows, “That might work against amateurs, but it wouldn't
stop the Russians if they thought they might have a defector in the
NSA.” He explained that both the NSA and hostile services have the
“means” to bypass such safeguards.
I asked what the Russian intelligence service would have done if
it had indeed spotted Snowden in late 2012 or early 2013. “Maybe

OOK Ok

“What has he gotten himself into with the Russians?” pressed Ailes.

“Mostly,” said Bannon, “he went to Russia and he thought he was going to meet Putin.
But Putin couldn’t give a shit about him. So he’s kept trying.”

“He’s Donald,” said Ailes.

“It’s a magnificent thing,” said Bannon, who had taken to regarding Trump as
something like a natural wonder, beyond explanation.

Again, as though setting the issue of Trump aside—merely a large and peculiar
presence to both be thankful for and to have to abide—Bannon, in the role he had
conceived for himself, the auteur of the Trump presidency, charged forward:

“China’s everything. Nothing else matters. We don’t get China right, we don’t get
anything right. This whole thing is very simple. China is where Nazi Germany was in
1929 to 1930. The Chinese, like the Germans, are the most rational people in the world,
until they’re not. And they’re gonna flip like Germany in the thirties. You’re going to have
a hypernationalist state, and once that happens you can’t put the genie back in the bottle.”

“Donald might not be Nixon in China,” said Ailes, deadpan, suggesting that for Trump
to seize the mantle of global transformation might strain credulity.

Bannon smiled. “Bannon in China,” he said, with both remarkable grandiosity and wry
self-deprecation.

“How’s the kid?” asked Ailes, referring to Trump’s son-in-law and paramount political
adviser, thirty-six-year-old Jared Kushner.

“He’s my partner,” said Bannon, his tone suggesting that if he felt otherwise, he was
nevertheless determined to stay on message.

“Really?” said a dubious Ailes.
“He’s on the team.”
“He’s had lot of lunches with Rupert.”

“In fact,” said Bannon, “I could use your help here.” Bannon then spent several
minutes trying to recruit Ailes to help kneecap Murdoch. Ailes, since his ouster from Fox,
had become only more bitter towards Murdoch. Now Murdoch was frequently jawboning
the president-elect and encouraging him toward establishment moderation—all a strange
inversion in the ever-stranger currents of American conservatism. Bannon wanted Ailes to
suggest to Trump, a man whose many neuroses included a horror of forgetfulness or
senility, that Murdoch might be losing it.

“Tll call him,” said Ailes. “But Trump would jump through hoops for Rupert. Like for

failed academic who had been fired from several universities, to obtain tenure at De Paul
University. Finkelstein had never published any scholarship. Moreover, he had been dismissed by
Brooklyn College for abusing students who disagreed with his extremist views and had engaged in
sexist behavior at DePaul. Not exactly a strong record for tenure. But he had something going
for him. He was so vitriolically anti-Israel, that he had many radical supporters who cared more
about his politics than his scholarship. He also argued that most people who claim to be victims
of the Holocaust—including Elie Wiesel—were “frauds” and “liars” and that the Holocaust itself
was being exaggerated for political and financial reasons. By falsely claiming that those opposed
to his tenure were motivated by his political views on Israel and the Holocaust, rather than his
lack of scholarship, he hoped to bestow on himself the mantle of victimhood to a conspiracy of
Zionist-McCarthyites. I exposed his tactic in the Wall Street Journal by comparing it to the ploy
used by Mary McCarthy’ fictionalized failed academic who, realizing he wouldn’t get tenure,
became a communist so that he could claim that he was being denied tenure because he was a Red
rather than a lousy scholar:

“Facing tenure denial, Mr. Finkelstein opted for a tactic that fit the times. He expressed
views so ad hominem, unscholarly and extreme that he could claim the decision was being
made not on the basis of his scholarship, but rather on his politics.”**

°> Mr. Finkelstein is supported by hard-leftists like Noam Chomsky and Alexander
Cockburn. They regard him as a scholar in a class with Ward Churchill. He’s the
Colorado professor who called the 9/11 victims “little Eichmanns” comparing Finkelstein
to Churchill is a characterization with which I would not quarrel.

Mr. Finkelstein does not do “scholarship” in any meaningful sense. Although his writings
center on Israel (which he compares to Nazi Germany) and the Holocaust, he has never
visited Israel and cannot read or speak German — precluding the possibility of original
scholarship.

Prof. Bartov characterized his work as an irrational Jewish “conspiracy theory.” The
conspirators include Steven Spielberg, NBC and Leon Uris. The film “Schindler’s List,”
Mr. Finkelstein argues, was designed to divert attention from our Mideast policy. “Give
me a better reason! .. . Who profits? Basically, there are two beneficiaries from the
dogmas [of Schindler's List]: American Jews and American administration.” NBC, he says,
broadcast “Holocaust” to strengthen Israel’s position: “In 1978, NBC produced the series
Holocaust. Do you believe, it was a coincidence, 1978? Just at this time, when peace
negotiations between Israel and Egypt took place in Camp David?” He argues that Leon
Uris, the author of “Exodus,” named his character “Ari” in order to promote Israel’s
“Nazi” ideology: “[B]ecause Ari is the diminutive for Aryan. It is the whole admiration for
this blond haired, blue eyed type.” (Ari is a traditional Hebrew name dating back to the
Bible.) He has blamed Sept. 11 on the U.S., claiming that we “deserve the problem on our
hands because some things Bin Laden says are true.”) He says that most alleged Holocaust
survivors — including Elie Wiesel — have fabricated their past.

Like other anti-Semites, Mr. Finkelstein generalizes about “the Jews”; for example: “Just
as Israelis . . . courageously put unruly Palestinians in their place, so American Jews

command centers, offensive missile forces, naval forces and the Army
of the Guardians of the Islamic Republic (IRGC), the regime’s
praetorian guard and shock troops. This campaign would aim to
severely damage the nuclear program, limit Iran’s ability to defend
against the attack (and subsequent restrikes, if necessary) and reduce
its capabilities for post-attack retaliation.

A regime-change option would require a broad military offensive that
could include nuclear facilities, air defenses, Iran’s retaliatory
capabilities, leadership targets, regime supporters, and national
infrastructure and economic targets. This could include putting some
forces on the ground to collect intelligence and neutralize specific
targets that are difficult to strike effectively with air power. No large-
scale ground operations are likely, but they cannot be ruled out at
some levels of conflict and in some scenarios, such as those that posit
a need to open and secure passage through the Strait of Hormuz and
Persian Gulf.

In general, the more expansive a war’s goals as a plan escalates from
strike to campaign to broad offensive, the greater the force needed to
achieve those goals, the greater the uncertainty in achieving them,
and the greater the consequences of both success and failure.
Moreover, a war’s goals at the outset of conflict may not remain
stable. Early sudden successes or unanticipated failures can lead to
the escalation of initially limited goals, particularly if terminating
hostilities proves difficult. Lateral expansion as well as escalation is
also possible: Iranian leaders might surrender or agree to a truce but
be unable to enforce a similar decision on Hizballah leaders or terror
agents around the world. This leads to yet another layer of complexity
and uncertainty: Whose war would this be?

A U.S.-Iranian war would probably not be fought by the United
States and Iran alone. Each would have partners or allies, both
willing and not-so-willing. Pre-conflict commitments, longstanding

Islands. In addition to being a participant in the abuse of Jane Doe #3 and other
minors, Dershowitz was an eye-witness to the sexual abuse of many other
minors by Epstein and several of Epstein’s coconspirators. Dershowitz would
later play a significant role in negotiating the [Non-Prosecution Agreement] on
Epstein’s behalf. Indeed, Dershowitz helped negotiate an agreement that
provided immunity from federal prosecution in the Southern District of Florida
not only to Epstein, but also to “any potential coconspirators of Epstein.” Thus,
Dershowitz helped negotiate an agreement witha provision that provided
protection for himself against criminal prosecution in Florida for sexually
abusing Jane Doe #3. Because this broad immunity wouldhave been
controversial if disclosed, Dershowitz (along with other members of Epstein’s
defense team) and the Government tried to keep the immunity provision secret
from all of Epstein’s victims and the general public, even though such secrecy
violated the Crime Victims’ Rights Act.
Dershowitz Counterclaim at § 15 (quoting Joinder Motion at 4).

Remarkably, having quoted at length from the Joinder Motion in his Counterclaim in this
case, Dershowitz now seeks to have that very same language from the Joinder Motion deemed
“confidential” and sealed. Compare Counterclaim at 15 (block quotation above) with Motion to
Determine Confidentiality, Exhibit A at 4 (composite exhibit with proposed “confidential”
document that includes paragraph beginning “[o]ne such powerful individual that Epstein forced
then-minor Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with was former Harvard Law Professor Alan
Dershowitz, a close friend of Epstein’s .. . .”). Dershowitz cannot come before this Court and
file a counterclaim seeking damages from Edwards and Cassell for alleged defamatory
statements and then ask to have those very same statements placed under seal as

“confidential.” See Barron v. Florida Freedom Newspapers, 531 So.2d at 119 (“although
