background like mine was attending socialite parties and globetrotting the
world. It only made it harder for me to see beyond the elusive walls I had
put up to protect myself from the appalling truth.

We left in early April first going to London, Paris and then our final
destination being St. Tropez in Southern France. If Hallmark had a
postcard, St. Tropez would definitely be on the front of it. It was beautiful
spring weather and every where you looked women were dressed in
bikini tops branded with some kind of designer label embedded into it
and the men were following them around like harping dogs in heat. In all
of the elegance of the Mediterranean, “La Bastide De St. Tropez” was an
impressive landmark. Jeffrey and Ghislane were staying in one of the
private cottages, on the park on the grounds, while Emmy and I stayed in
separate quarters inside the hotel. The old style cobblestone streets were
lined with boutique shops and beauty parlors. It was the hedonistic
stomping grounds of the beyond rich and famous.

The next day we went out to lunch at the grand opening of the
infamous Nikki Beach Club, where a cheap glass of champagne costs
around two hundred dollars and if your not keeping the alcohol
consumption flowing like water, you’d be asked to leave to make way for
the constant flow of prospectus patrons. That’s where I first got to meet
Naomi Campbell. She was wearing the typical attire strutting around
southern France, a D&G bikini top and a wrap around mini skirt to go
over the swimsuits bikini. She was so tall and stunningly beautiful. Her
charisma was energetic, funny, and everyone seemed to hang off of her
every word and laugh at her every joke. Ghislane and Jeffrey kissed her
cheeks and wished her a happy birthday, and then I was introduced and
followed in their suit. She was surrounded by a league of assistants,
friends and fans, which didn’t make it easy for us to all converse but she
got enough time in to invite us abroad a yacht of a fellow she was “kind
of seeing” at the time for the before party ahead of tonight’s event. We
went back to the hotel and I gave Jeffrey a massage in his room before we
all headed down to the pool to soak in some of the year’s first sun’s rays.

I loved wearing my new ball gown and feeling like a princess. It was
absolutely sensational and made me feel as if I floated in the dress. I
swept up my long hair in a twisted clip, only letting down a few curly
strands and layered on the mascara. Receiving many compliments
throughout the evening when we eventually left the Yacht to make our
appearance at the main birthday bash, I couldn’t help but feel excitement
for the party to come it was the first celebrity birthday bash I had ever
been to. Being introduced to model after model and the rich men that
followed them around became dizzying. Jeffrey sat back and watched as I
buoyantly worked the dance floor, coming back to the table where he

so often he’d introduce to me to someone new, pulling me aside to show
off his eager young masseuse to his fellow pedo’s. These people had so
much money pouring out of them. I don’t know why he even thought
they’d care in the first place. It made me feel good though. At least I
knew I made him proud to have me in his company.

likeminded people that were considered the most sophisticated and the
highly esteemed of today’s world nearly made the way I was living lately

these people and they are all accepting of it, it must be just the way the
world turns. I danced with a young prince that night and with all of the
help from the bubbly champagne [ couldn’t remember his name for the
life of me. On one of my trips back to the table for another glass, Jeffrey
leaned over to quietly whisper in my ear that it was a prince that I had

back to the dance floor and continued to let my hair down. [t was a fun
bash, the entire crowd sang “Happy Birthday” to Naomi and by the time
we got back in the car to retreat for the night, I was giddy from the
drinking and dancing all evening. We had a guest in the car, and
apparently we had already been introduced, but I couldn’t even remember
his name in the first five minutes of our meeting again. He was the hotel
owner of some large chain in America called “Hilton”. Staying at one of
the cottages near Jeffrey, he saw it quaint to loan me out for a night’s
massage to ruin an “almost” perfect evening. Jeffrey told me to come
back to his room after I was finished with Rick, thankfully he reminded
me of his name but also odd | thought, being so late 1 would’ve never

requests. I gave him affirmation of my understood instructions and

brown hair left to show for the remaining bits of youth left in him. | had
to ask him to undress and lay on top of the towel that I had picked up
from the neatly folded pile at the end of his bed and spread it over the
duvet. I didn’t want to waste a second in his place, getting right to the
very reason I was even there. Turning around while he was getting
undressed, being our first time together, I wanted to give him the
impression I was actually a therapist and not a finale to the end of the
nights entertainment. Not exactly what he had in mind though, given that
my impression was already made for me when Jeffrey arranged for our
meeting in the first place. His chuckle to my response was condescending

TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025540.txt,"﻿I have up until now, not told my side of the story.  My attorneys and PR people advised me to just stay quiet, and it will all go away.  I have received the same advice for five years now.  I realize my silence is now causing collateral damage to my friends and other innocent bystanders.  The time has come to let the hounds of investigative reporters loose on those that, driven by money, have made false claims, concocted malicious fabrications, and have expanded their fictions now to include others in my orbit.

I was investigated for soliciting underage prostitutes.  To be precise, girls under the age of 18 who were brought to my house by their close friends who worked in local massage parlors or strip clubs(West Palm Beach has scores of massage parlors and happy ending places that routinely advertise in the same local papers that have chastised my behavior)[ see Palm Beach Post classifieds]. I am and have always been a bachelor.  I have used massage parlor women, licensed massage therapists, and women with no massage experience.  I have never ever used force, coercion, or in fact had intercourse with any of these women. 
 When the police investigated me, went through my garbage, searched my house, they found sex toys, but NO cameras or camera equipment; nothing in fact out of the ordinary from many homes of single men.  There were never any photos of underage girls. Never.  A careful reading of any law enforcement document makes that clear. The camera that was referred to in the search warrant, was the camera installed in my house with the help of the local police to catch my houseman, John Allessi; the same houseman mentioned in many articles.  He was breaking into my house and stealing money after being fired. The camera caught him in the act. These cameras were the only cameras at my house; security cameras.  
The local state attorney, after conducting an extensive investigation and interviewing the girls herself, a sex crimes prosecutor with over 13 years experience, and who had herself authored the more tough legislations dealing with sex crimes, said in her own words, “There are no real victims here. The girls knew they were going to a house in Palm Beach, they had their boyfriends or family members drive them to the house and wait outside, and then they encouraged their friends to go.” Many of the girls interviewed were in their mid twenties, some in their early thirties, and some younger than 18. The girl that the newspapers have referred to as a fourteen year old told the police that she had repeatedly told me that she was 18 and a senior in high school, like many of the massage parlor girls told me, and in her own words to the police, said the reason she said she was 18 was that she was told if she didn’t, MR EPSTEIN would not let her in the house.  These reports are available. 
  The state attorney offered me to take a plea to aggravated assault with only probation. My attorneys told me that it would be forever a blight on my record, and I should refuse the deal.  I did so.  The state attorney, Barry Krisher, took the unusual step of bringing the facts before a state grand jury.  In Florida, this happens most often in capital murder cases, not prostitution in someone’s own home.  To be certain that the public would not criticize the outcome, the state grand jury was given all the evidence and returned a verdict of Solicitation of Prostitution.  Solicitation, a non-registrable offense which carries with it a sentence of mandatory probation.  Mandatory probation; solicitation is one of the few statues that has such a designation.  The local police chief, however, met this charge with great disdain. He believed something untoward had gone on for the grand jury to return such a mild verdict after his department had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars examining the behavior of a resident that rarely left his house. Women seemed to come and go, women of ALL ages.  Some masseuses interviewed were in their sixties, some were men.  
  The police chief, unhappy with the decision of twelve Florida citizens that weighed the evidence, took the unprecedented step of releasing the raw police reports to the press. The raw sewage of an investigation not corroborated, or as it turns out, not even transcribed from the actual interview tapes correctly. Before a plea to the indictment was entered and the case was still open, he released the reports and then sent a letter off to the parents of some of the girls and to the FBI asking for their assistance. Only two days after the grand jury decided that I should only be charged with solicitation of prostitution, NOT underage women, not pimping, but using prostitutes as a john, I received my first FEDERAL subpoena.  What resulted after a thirteen month investigation and can be read in my non prosecution agreement, was the federal government threatened me with a fifty page indictment alleging that I had broken federal law, though all actions took place in my home in Florida, the women were from Florida, and no interstate travel took place.  The AUSA said that my secretary had made telephone calls to the women.  Many of those calls were return calls, and the use of the telephone by my secretary to confirm massage appointments, was equivalent federally to some guy surfing the internet, knowing full well that the person on the other end of the connection is under age, and trying to coerce them into some illegal sex activity. The internet luring statute says that someone uses the means of interstate commerce, (in my case it was a phone) to knowingly coerce underage persons into sex. This was the first time in history that this statute would be stretched, twisted beyond all recognition in an attempt to threaten prosecution. I had hired Ken Starr, former Solicitor General; Alan Dershowitz, law professor; Roy Black, trial attorney; Joe Whitley, former assistant attorney general; and Guy Lewis former US attorney in South Florida, to defend me against what each one of them had said was no federal crime.  Ken Starr wrote a brief using a federalism argument that made it clear that my crime of being a john could not be a federal crime. It was to no avail.  What the federal government required was as follows: They required that my defense team, not the feds, but my team, go to the state attorney and ask that he up my charge to a pimping charge; a charge that carried with it sex registration. They would not give him the facts to support that charge, or give me evidence they said they had that I had under Florida law received money FROM these girls to offer them out as prostitutes. Florida law is very clear, that the pimp must have a financial benefit from the crime. It would be our responsibility to ask the state attorney to up my charge and agree to sentence me to 18 months in jail and a year of house arrest.  In the history of the state attorneys office, they have no other instance of someone requesting a higher charge than what the grand jury decided and a harsher penalty.
In addition, the federal government would require me to pay a minimum of $50,000 to each woman on a list of women that they would choose.   A list that would be kept secret; no names on their list would be disclosed to my attorneys or myself until I was already firmly in a jail cell. A list that we would not only be obliged to pay money to, but if any of the women did not accept the $50,000, I would be required to pay an attorney, chosen by the government, to represent the women to enable them to sue me; I would have to pay their attorney fees.  I would be given the names of the women after being in jail, would not be allowed to appeal this deal, pay women, some of whom I had never even met, and if I chose to fight this deal, I would be threatened over and over with being in breach of my agreement. The attorney chosen by the government to represent these women hired his own daughter, a sitting state prosecutor, who received special leave to represent these women, and though she continued to receive her state salary, billed me over $800,000 in a period of one year to represent women suing me. When my side raised objections, we were told that if we fought this, the government would declare a breach of my agreement and indict me.  The AUSA actually filed an affidavit with the court that stated that “The protection from the government that Epstein thought he bargained for really is “illusory”, we can always bring a case against him for the live span of any woman we think has been a victim.” 

After serving my sentence, I was sued by many women on the government list.  During many of the depositions taken in those cases, the women admitted to the following: they had many other clients, they got paid thousands of dollars a week to work in the local massage parlors and sex clubs, they kept their list of johns in their Bible. Many had abusive boyfriends and abortions way before they ever met me, though they claimed sex assault abuse and various other sex claims. Most later brought their best friends to the house who also claimed the same abuse in the hopes of getting money.

With what the newspapers had called a dream team, each and every lawyer, when they saw the result of the negotiations, said with incredulity, “We have never seen anything like this before”. I had never left my house and the women had not traveled on my planes or to another state.  I had never made money off of these women. I was a consumer of prostitution, a john. The government said that they could invoke a statute for travel for the purpose of sex, which would be the equivalent to tourists who sign on to fake web sites advertising sex with minors in Cambodia, Thailand and other third world countries. The government said that they could charge me with traveling to Florida to have sex with an underage girl, even though sex with 16 year olds is legal in New Jersey and Pennsylvania and sex with 17 year olds is legal in New York. They suggested that they would indict me for traveling to Florida FOR THE PURPOSE of having sex with minors.  Not withstanding the fact that I had a home in Florida for 15 years, regularly traveled to see my brother, mother and business associates.  They said that they thought a novel application could at least get me indicted, unless I took the state plea deal.  I had little choice.  The crimes they alleged, no matter what the likelihood of success, carried with them a minimum mandatory 10-year sentence.   I recognize that I am not a sympathetic figure, and had to decide whether to risk a trial where the jury would see an older man and young women that would be paraded in Sunday school outfits during the trial.

I have shown poor judgment in the past, and have paid a heavy price for those mistakes.  I had hoped to move forward with my science philanthropy and helping those less privileged than myself.  Then came Scott Rothstein.



Scott Rothstein was the senior partner of RRA . He is currently serving a 50 -year prison sentence for perpetrating the largest fraud in South Florida’s history.   He decided that sex allegations made against me could be used to fleece hundreds of investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars.  He recruited Brad Edwards, a smalltime Ft. Lauderdale attorney who had access to some of the women on the government list.  Rothstein forged Judges signatures, hid behind attorney client privilege, secrecty of legal docu, work product, cover letter; giving illegal investigative activity the protection normally reserved for lawyers and their legitimate clients.   He falsely told investors that I had settled cases with him for hundreds of millions of dollars, but the women wanted their money right away.  If they gave him 30 million dollars now, he could give part of it to the women who wanted to remain anonymous, they would go off into the sunset with their money, and the full payment would be made to the investors.  Investors that would be getting 50- 100% return on their money for taking advantage of the same women who allegedly had come in contact with me. Bill Schere, an attorney in Broward, has filed 147 complaints against Scott Rothstein and the firm. 

The attorney for the women, aware that I would be loathe in involve innocent friends in problems that were strictly of my own making, subpoenaed names and tried to smear any friend  or mine whose name appeared in print previously. They contacted Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, David Copperfield; innocent bystanders with no knowledge of any of my actions whatsoever. I settled the cases rather than forcing both the women and others to be subject to a public questioning of their lives. 

It appears that the Rothstein firm had continuing help from the government throughout their civil litigations. Emails received as a result of a recent subpoena show descriptions such as, “received info from current FBI agents”. 

The former Rothstein partners subpoenaed my attorney for all correspondence regarding my plea with the US attorney.  Though highly unusual, the government sided with the former Rothstein partners and agreed we needed to produce all the correspondence between the government and my attorneys.  

During the civil deposition of my former houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez, attended by a new attorney from the Rothstein firm, whose name appears on the record as CARA Holmes, [also appears as Carolyn Holmes, also appears as Kara Holmes], the houseman allegedly said that he had stolen a book from my house with telephone numbers in it that the government wanted. This was in July of 2009.  I believe that the attorneys went to outside counsel Kendall Coffey, and asked whether or not they could buy the book for the $50,000 that the houseman had asked for it.  THREE months later, the FBI and the same AUSA that had headed my prosecution set up my houseman in a sting. It appears that while using a lawyer from the RRA firm, Brad Edwards, as a confidential informant for the government at the same time that Scott Rothstein was using me and the allegations against me to fleece his victims, the US attorneys’ office was sitting in the Rothstein offices planning a sting operation, while right next door, Scott Rothstein was making off to Morocco in an attempt to flee the country.  Alfredo Rodriguez was prosecuted by the same AUSA and received an 18- month sentence; however, it also appeared that on the very same day of his sting arrest, he bought an illegal gun, and was later sentenced to four years in prison.  Who Cara Holmes is, and what her role was in RRA is still a mystery to us. She appears to be a former FBI agent out of the Chicago office.  She joined the Rothstein firm in May of 2009, and joined the Florida Bar at the same time. She attended depositions of my pilots and my houseman. She communicated regularly with Brad Edwards and the investigators on my case.  The email traffic is extensive. 

 The telephone book that Alfredo Rodriguez had stolen from my house was then turned over(by the government?) to the same attorneys who had been told they could not buy it as they would have been buying stolen property.  Brad Edwards, the former partner of Scott Rothstein, then used the purloined book to send out letters to everyone in the book, asking for additional stories of my wrongdoing in the past five years with the hopes of getting new clients. The letter was structured so as to circumvent the ethical rules regarding trolling for clients. 



While I was serving my sentence, my lawyers were able to come see me in jail. Only two months after being incarcerated, my in house lawyer came to see me to tell me that we were now conducting an audit of legal fees paid to date. They had discovered that Gerald Lefcourt, my primary defense attorney, had taken out cash to the tune of $800,000, that according to his own accountant, he was not entitled to.   He had simply prepared invoices that said, “Please pay another $100,000 or $200,000”. Though he had been asked on multiple occasions to substantiate the bills, his response would be, “We are working full time for you”. I pointed out that his was not the only firm working for me, but he replied, “Would you like me to quit?”  He eventually returned over $400,000 over a period of time, as he said that his cash flow could not handle the strain. He said that he was still owed for things like taxi fair, coffee and doughnuts, detailed for $2.53, and would keep $400,000.


I was told that I should hire Guy Lewis, a former US Attorney in the Southern District. Lewis, a southern style gentleman; white suits, fast cars; said he had a great relationship with the current US Attorney, Alex Acosta, and the people in Washington that would potentially need to review what ever happened in South Florida. He wanted a $100,000 per month retainer, and with this, his partner Mike Tein would represent me. Upon review of Lewis’ background, it was suggested that he might now not have the credibility that he had represented, and rumors were that he had been asked to leave the Department of Justice for inappropriate billing.  I told him in no uncertain terms that if this were true he would need to tell me, as he was representing my credibility with the government. If he had been asked to leave the Department of Justice, it would dramatically hurt my chances if it were he making my case to senior officials.  He swore up and down, as southerners are apt to do, that there was no truth whatsoever to the allegations.  Being charged with untrue allegations rang close to my heart, and I chose to side with Lewis. Only after my incarceration, when Lewis and Tein came to see me in a 9’x 10’ attorney room that smelled of urine, and I told them that I was now being sued by many of the girls on the government list, they expressed their regrets and their willingness to help. However, as they walked out down the dungeon like hall with the sound of clanging gates in the background, they were unaware of the security cameras and microphones throughout the hallway. They chose to high-five one another on camera and smile with the comment, “This is going to be a couple more years of fees”.  The guards at the jail, accustomed to some of the most heinous physical crimes imaginable, and hardened against most of humanity’s foibles, were caught off guard by the exhilaration of the potential of more fees.


Sex for money; it’s a sensitive subject. The reactions range from Andrew Dworkin the feminist who considers all intercourse a form of rape; man inserting his authority, to Jackie Mason that posits that when a man takes a woman for dinner, many times his real motivation is the hope of receiving sex at the end of the evening.  He suggests it is hypocritical for the man to be able to pay the florist for flowers, the doorman for getting a cab, the restaurant for the food, and the liquor store for the gift of wine, but can’t pay the only person that performs the actual sex act without committing a crime.  Yes, I paid for sex.  I am a john.  Yes, I understand that prostitution is a crime and a crime that very few johns have even gone to jail for.  I am aware that there are strong feelings amongst many people regarding that crime. Many countries have legalized it, some states have legalized it; many have a policy of no enforcement.  New York City has escort services that openly advertise, massage parlors that have neon signs in midtown. In actual fact, the crime of paying for sex at the time of my transgressions was under penal code 230; equivalent to that of jay walking unless the girl was under 15.  Yes, under the age of 15. That was in New York. In Florida, the age of consent is 18. Misrepresentation of age is not considered a defense. Even if the girl worked in a sex establishment where one has to prove age to work, if the girl was met in a bar where the drinking age is 21, or shows ID that appears to be valid that she is over 18, that is not a defense. The State Attorneys who deal with this sort of crime on a regular basis reviewed the case brought by the local police, and said in no uncertain terms that there “were no real victims “ in the Epstein case.  NO real victims. Their words; they said the women knew what they were doing. They even brought their best friends to Epstein’s house after going there a number of times themselves. How could there be a serious crime?



The AUSA decided that she would protect the young women of Palm Beach. She saw a need for child safety everywhere she looked.  She has been chastised twice by local judges for hiding information from and misleading the court, and had a supervisor represent her in front of a judge that would have disciplined her.  Her first subpoena to me asked for all my tax returns, my medical records, my phone book, my plane logs.   

The women came to my house. I usually exercised every day followed by a massage.  Most of the time, I would be on the telephone when a woman was brought into the room. Many times they rubbed my feet or back. I never spoke to them at all, because I would be on the phone. The room was dimmed, and often I would not even see the woman.  If not on the phone, I would talk to the woman. NO intercourse ever occurred; most women testified they never touched my genitals at all.  NEVER.  These depositions were taken as a result of the government supported civil suits against me.

doesn’t scale very well—the market, having discerned a pattern of
successful investing, quickly copies and discounts the advantage. Epstein’s
effort was to identify a dozen or so promising algorithms (each quant is
effectively hawking his secret sauce algorithm) and invest up to $5 million
with each. I knew paltry little about this and so rather found myself
identifying with the young women to whom Epstein was explaining the
basic math and mechanics—out of my league, but grateful for the lesson.

The Epstein house/office is, by careful design, exclusive and club like,
part hang out, part secret society. Along with the difficulty in explaining
why, even after his jail term, the rich and powerful continued to beat a path
to his door, it’s also notable in the fixed hierarchy of who comes to whose
turf, that everybody, when they went to see Epstein, comes to him.

A week in late September, U.N. week as it happened, began, on
Sunday, at Epstein’s house with a colloquial for billionaires—Gates, Mort
Zuckerman, and Peter Thiel [TK].

Epstein, preternaturally responsive to both the price of oil and to the
politics of the middle of east, entertained that evening a delegation from
Qatar, including Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim, the foreign minister. Hamad,
indeed, lives across the street in a similarly furnished house—he and Epstein
have the same decorator. Epstein, in his relaxed and amused manner, kept
prodding: “Why are you financing the bad guys? What do you get out of
that?”

The Qatarians, in some mild diplomatic discomfort, seemed most
worried that their bid for the World Cup might be compromised by bribery
allegations.

At 9:00 next morning, Epstein is joined for breakfast in the dining
room by Reid Weingarten, who’s represented among other fat cats in
trouble, Worldcom’s Bernie Ebbers and Goldman Sach’s Lloyd Blankfein
and is one of attorney general Eric Holder’s closest friends. Weingarten,
horse, with a cold, and dejected, is just back from a failed defense of former
Connecticut Governor John Rowland.

After a blow by blow of the trial, there’s a discussion of the
Qartarian’s visit—Epstein is serving chocolate made from pistachios grown
on the Sheikh’s farm—and speculation about who actually controls ISIS.

“Why?” I asked Weingarten, when Epstein briefly steps out of the
room, “do some many people keep coming back here, everything
considered.”

“Why we camp out here? I guess because there’s no place like it.”

This is a little unorthodox, but here is the text of an internal note that I just sent to our integrated Private Bank client coverage teams a few moments ago.  Mary thought it would be a good idea to share this with our clients given the events of the day.

 

“Here is what I plan to say at our Aspen Insights conference tomorrow about today’s events.  The last two weeks have been a severe setback for financial markets and the global recovery.

 

[1] Today, Italian equity markets sold off sharply and were eventually shut down after the ECB (for now) rejected being the buyer of last resort for Italian government bonds, as the markets were hoping.  The Bundesbank apparently has objections to the idea.  This is a problem: Italy has issued around as much public debt as Germany, but is a considerably smaller country with almost twice the debt load as a percentage of its GDP.  Absent a decision by Germany to move to Federalism or a lot more debt monetization by the ECB, the European Monetary Union (as it is currently configured) could be facing its final stretch.  Today’s reported move by Italian regulators to seize documents at Moody’s regarding declines in Italian bank stocks is an indication of the pressure the system is under, and the possible search for scapegoats.  I don’t think you will find a firm that has written more often and more direly about the structural inconsistencies of the EMU than we have (I have a 2-year bibliography of what we said and when, if anyone wants it).  The “Sick Men of Europe” paper from February 2010 and “Don Quixote Thanksgiving” from November 2010 go into the greatest detail on why.  Our concerns sky-rocketed upon Greece’s financial disclosures in November 2009, after which we took portfolio decisions to back that up, purging exposures to the GIPSI countries from our credit, government bond and equity portfolios.  Since early 2010, our underweight positions in Europe represent the largest regional underweights we have ever held.

 

[2] Will there be another recession in the US?  Our friend Marty Feldstein at Harvard puts the odds at 50-50.  Sell side and buy side economists missed last month’s US economic rollover by a country mile, so I am not sure how much weight to put in their current forecasts.  Most summarily dismissed our concerns that the recovery earlier this year had elements of a stimulus-driven mirage.  Bridgewater Associates was the only firm we spoke to that consistently highlighted the broader process of household deleveraging; and cautioned that when stimulus faded, so would the US economy, given the weakness in household income.  Their insights have been invaluable to us in terms of not stepping into this and taking too much risk prematurely during the three market swoons this year.   Our central scenario for the US in 2012 is not another recession, but low growth in the 2.0%  range, which is enough of a problem given the low job creation that entails.  Note that the CBO assumes growth rates of 3.0% to 3.6% over the next few years in their analyses of future US federal debt levels. 

 

[3] Do not blame today’s events on the debt ceiling debate, US politicians or European regulators.  If we get to the point where economic and profit fundamentals in a given market or region are not sustainable on their own, then we should be underweight that region (as in Europe).  Owning an asset class under the assumption that there will always be a “Lord of the Flies” type rescue from Central Banks and Treasuries is very risky, and historically, fraught with failure.  I remember similar logic in the summer of 1998, when the accepted mantra was that the US would bail out Russia and Boris Yeltsin, since President Clinton would not want to see a nuclear power like Russia slide back into Soviet rule, or anarchy (that view turned out to be wrong).   Anyone market-weight European risk out of the expectation that “Trichet and Merkel will fix surely it” is taking a binary risk that impossible to handicap.  Similarly, we should not start buying anything just because we think Qe3 is coming in the US (in the form of securities purchases, a permanently controlled long bond, etc). 

 

[4] When we began this year, I made the following decision: we would risk underperforming if there was a strong equity rally, out of concerns about the macroeconomic landscape (weakness in the West, inflation in the East).  As a result, we have held less equity exposure than usual for a period of high margins, low P/E multiples and strong earnings.  Instead, we’ve held larger exposures to investment grade and high yield credit, and hedge funds.  Over the last couple of years, our hedge funds (long-short funds with low net positions, macro hedge funds, distressed credit) have helped cushion portfolio returns when markets declined.  We won’t know until the data comes in, but we expect the same to happen this time.

 

[5] The “Eye on the Market” has endlessly chronicled this year the fissures which are now affecting financial markets: European sovereign risk and inadequate bank capitalization; weak labor compensation as an Achilles heel of the US profits recovery, given its negative impact on spending; the political divide in Congress over how to deal with falling government revenue and rising entitlement spending; inflation risks in Asia and Latin America and the resulting need for more policy tightening; and the mixed track record of low interest rates to sustainability solve structural problems.  The cover of the 2011 Outlook (a printing press, out of control) expressed our concern regarding a recovery built upon a stimulus machine.   I would contrast this with the cover of a competitor’s 2011 publication, which had a picture of George Washington crossing the Delaware, with the caption “America’s structural resilience, fortitude and ingenuity will carry the economy and financial markets in 2011 – and beyond”.   Our job is not to point to where we would like the financial markets to go, but rather to point to where they might end up.  It’s like the scene in Oliver Stone’s Nixon, when Nixon looks up at a portrait of JFK and says, “When they look at you, they see what they want to be. When they look at me, they see what they are.”  Our job is to see financial markets for what they are.

 

[6] All that said, we have lessons to learn here.    

 

Too many of our investment discussions this year focused on the negative real return characteristics of cash, and why to reduce it.   In a world of deflation risk on financial assets (rather than of goods and services), cash retains substantial option value at times like these.  

 

We could have connected the dots more aggressively on our views on weak growth and easy monetary policy, and owned more gold.  While we have had rising price forecasts for gold and owned it in portfolios, we did not have large enough allocations. 

 

Given the all-time high of US government transfers to households and negative real interest rates, we should not have interpreted positive economic data earlier this year as being highly representative of the true run-rate of the US economy.  The same goes for the global economy, which has been the beneficiary of a lot of stimulus that is now fading, for a variety of economic and political reasons.

 

Great corporate profits are no guarantee against a problem in financial markets.  Corporate profits and P/E multiples were fine in June 2007, but rested on top of a systemic problem in private sector credit markets and private sector balance sheets.  This year, strong corporate profits and low P/E multiples sit on top of systemic problems in public sector finances.  

 

[7] In the wreckage, as usual, there are opportunities, and we will be reviewing them with you in the days ahead.   There is a benefit to having held back on our firepower this year.  With risk to spend held in reserve, there are oversold assets with considering, particularly among multinationals with strong balance sheets, high dividends and which trade at very low multiples, something we reviewed earlier in the week.”

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030585.txt,"Bizarrely, perhaps, I have gotten to know Jeffrey and Ghislaine far better after my piece than before it. I kept running
into both of them, separately, at parties. Jeffrey is not a social animal so he usually has a couple of young women with
him who stand two feet behind him, as if serving a monarch. “Do they speak?” I remember asking him once, nodding
at his lookalike blondes. He laughed. “Not like you,Vicky,” was his riposte.

I remembered that when we'd once discussed math—in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed I hadn’t
studied math since I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a package at home
via messenger. It was a book: “Math for idiots.”

So he is not without humor, even though he doesn’t drink or smoke, and hates restaurants.

“Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects,” newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He was
certainly preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few moments
in his company and you know this to be true.

When I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that “Andy”
—as Jeffrey calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his strange title is.
Because if one thing’s for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what he’s talking about far
more than “Andy” does. Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other financiers hang out with him.

And Ghislaine?
Full disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It’s almost impossible not to.

She is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I’ve spent hours talking
to her about the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is curious. She has
spent weeks at the bottom of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent me a DVD of the fish
there. Her rolodex would blow away almost anyone else’s I can think of—probably even Rupert Murdochs’. She is
very well-read and can talk about most things for hours. She is passionate about Bill Clinton with whom she is close
friends.

Yet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 4oth birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-Platero,
(known fondly to her close friends as “the Tennis Goddess”) Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When it comes
down to things she really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her vulnerability.

And that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey.

“He saved her,” Iremember a close friend of mine telling me. “When her father died, she was a wreck; inconsolable.
And then Jeffrey took her in. She’s never forgotten that—and never will.”

In many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect replacement
for her father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his sexual pecadillos, but
then Ghislaine’s father was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving a massive “black hole” he’d
fraudulently created. To Ghislaine, Jeffrey’s habits may not have seemed that strange.

In fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful people
in the end either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl issues, and moved
countries to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You don’t tend to get to the top
by being the world’s most balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett didn’t quite manage a normal life
—whatever that is. He had a second “wife” for many years whose existence he has been open about.

So what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven't spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her loyalty

to friends like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she'll be out and about as always. Look at Waksal
and Stewart. No one sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up for all sorts of

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016894.txt,"Tom Griffiths’ approach to the AI issue of “value alignment’ —the study of how,
exactly, we can keep the latest of our serial models of Al from turning the planet into
paper clips—is human-centered;, i.e., that of a cognitive scientist, which is what he is.
The key to machine learning, he believes, is, necessarily, human learning, which he
studies at Princeton using mathematical and computational tools.

Tom once remarked to me that “one of the mysteries of human intelligence is that
we're able to do so much with so little.”” Like machines, human beings use algorithms to
make decisions or solve problems; the remarkable difference lies in the human brain’s
overall level of success despite the comparative limits on computational resources.

The efficacy of human algorithms springs from what AI researchers refer to as
“bounded optimality.” As psychologist Daniel Kahneman has notably pointed out,
human beings are rational only up to a point. If you were perfectly rational, you would
risk dropping dead before making an important decision—whom to hire, whom to marry,
and so on—depending on the number of options available for your review.

“With all of the successes of Al over the last few years, we’ve got good models of
things like images and text, but what we’re missing are good models of people,” Tom
says. “Human beings are still the best example we have of thinking machines. By
identifying the quantity and the nature of the preconceptions that inform human cognition
we can lay the groundwork for bringing computers even closer to human performance.”

The strain was noticeable in the Middle East. In a recent interview
with Newsweek, one senior Israeli official said Mitchell often would
say one thing about the direction the U.S. was taking with the two
sides, only to be contradicted by Dennis Ross, Clinton's special
adviser to the region. The official, who did not want to be quoted by
name, said it seemed as if Mitchell had abdicated his role completely
in recent months. Indeed, Mitchell's frequent visits to Israel and the
West Bank slowed to a trickle; his last visit to the region was in
December.

When he was there, officials on both sides of the conflict had voiced
bewilderment at Mitchell's hands-off approach to the complex
negotiating process. With a small staff in Israel, he would shuttle
between Jerusalem and Ramallah to meet with senior advisers to the
leaders of both sides and then leave after just a few days. In an
interview with Newsweek last month, Palestinian President
Mahmoud Abbas openly accused Mitchell of not doing his job.
Every visit by Mitchell, we talked to him and gave him some ideas,
he said. At the end we discovered that he didn't convey any of these
ideas to the Israelis. What does it mean?

A politically attuned man who was once Senate Majority Leader,
Mitchell was aware of the complaints about him. His usual comeback
was to point to his success in Northern Ireland, which earned him the
Presidential Medal of Freedom. For hundreds of days, he liked to say,
he was considered a failure, until the final day, when he actually got
it done.

Mitchell's resignation letter set off a small panic inside the West
Wing earlier in the week. Senior advisers, as well as Obama himself,
could sense the increasing difficulty of the job: Administration
officials had been unable to convince Israel to halve new settlements
in the West Bank, alienating Palestinians, and Israelis were irked in
early May when Abbas allied with Hamas, a group that refuses to

used in Carabayllo. For Jim Kim this marked the end of a long campaign. The world changed yesterday, he
wrote from Geneva to all of PIH. The prices of second-line antibiotics continued to decline, and the drugs now
flowed fairly smoothly through the Green Light Committee to, among other places, Peru, where about 1,000
chronic patients were either cured or in treatment. About 250 were receiving the drugs in Tomsk, and, largely
because of the efforts of WHO, the Russian Ministry of Health had finally agreed to the terms of the World
Bank's TB loan--150 million dollars to begin to fight the epidemic throughout the country.

The twin pandemics of AIDS and tuberculosis raged on, of course, magnifying each other, in Africa and Asia,
Eastern Europe and Latin America. Mathematical models predicted widening global catastrophe--100 million
HIV infections in the world by the year 2010. Some prominent voices, some in the U.S. government, still
argued that AIDS could not be treated in desperately impoverished places. But this view seemed to be fading.
The prices of antiretrovirals were falling, even more dramatically than the prices of second-line TB drugs.

This was thanks to a growing worldwide campaign for treating AIDS wherever it occurred. Jim Kim had often
said that the world's response to AIDS and TB would define the moral standing of his generation. In 2003, a
new director general took over at WHO, and he asked Jim to serve as his senior adviser. Meanwhile, the
example of Zanmi Lasante [PIH's Haiti-based project] was growing, and Cange had become a favorite
destination for global health policy makers and American politicians.

whether there were any young women in one part of

Were you in -- were you in any way

Mr. Dershowitz had a massage by one of these

young ladies?

T don't know, sir.

You have no knowledge?

No, sir.

And you certainly weren't implying that

that occurred; you just have no knowledge,

correct?

employees concerning personnel rules
or policies are customarily posted.
Where 20 percent or more of an
employer’s workforce is not proficient
in English and speaks a language other
than English, the employer must post
the notice in the language employees
speak. If an employer’s workforce
includes two or more groups
constituting at least 20 percent of the
workforce who speak different
languages, the employer must either
physically post the notice in each of
those languages or, at the employer’s
option, post the notice in the language
spoken by the largest group of
employees and provide each employee
in each of the other language groups a
copy of the notice in the appropriate
language. If an employer requests from
the Board a notice in a language in
which it is not available, the requesting
employer will not be liable for non-
compliance with the rule until the
notice becomes available in that
language. An employer must take
reasonable steps to ensure that the
notice is not altered, defaced, covered
by any other material, or otherwise
rendered unreadable.

(e) Obtaining a poster with the
employee notice. A poster with the
required employee notice, including a
poster with the employee notice
translated into languages other than
English, will be printed by the Board,
and may be obtained from the Board’s
office, 1099 14th Street, NW.,
Washington, DC 20570, or from any of
the Board’s regional, subregional, or
resident offices. Addresses and
telephone numbers of those offices may
be found on the Board’s Web site at
http://www.nirb.gov. A copy of the
poster in English and in languages other
than English may also be downloaded
from the Board’s Web site at http://
www.nirb.gov. Employers also may
reproduce and use copies of the Board’s
official poster, provided that the copies
duplicate the official poster in size,
content, format, and size and style of
type. In addition, employers may use
commercial services to provide the
employee notice poster consolidated
onto one poster with other Federally
mandated labor and employment
notices, so long as the consolidation
does not alter the size, content, format,
or size and style of type of the poster
provided by the Board.

(f) Electronic posting of employee
notice. (1) In addition to posting the
required notice physically, an employer
must also post the required notice on an
intranet or internet site if the employer
customarily communicates with its
employees about personnel rules or
policies by such means. An employer
that customarily posts notices to
employees about personnel rules or
policies on an intranet or internet site
will satisfy the electronic posting
requirement by displaying
prominently—i.e., no less prominently
than other notices to employees—on
such a site either an exact copy of the
poster, downloaded from the Board’s
Web site, or a link to the Board’s Web
site that contains the poster. The link to
the Board’s Web site must read,
“Employee Rights under the National
Labor Relations Act.”

(2) Where 20 percent or more of an
employer’s workforce is not proficient
in English and speaks a language other
than English, the employer must
provide notice as required in paragraph
(f)(1) of this section in the language the
employees speak. If an employer's
workforce includes two or more groups
constituting at least 20 percent of the
workforce who speak different
languages, the employer must provide
the notice in each such language. The
Board will provide translations of the
link to the Board’s Web site for any
employer that must or wishes to display
the link on its Web site. If an employer
requests from the Board a notice in a
language in which it is not available, the
requesting employer will not be liable
for non-compliance with the rule until
the notice becomes available in that
language.

§ 104.203 Are Federal contractors covered
under this part?

Yes, Federal contractors are covered.
However, contractors may comply with
the provisions of this part by posting the
notices to employees required under the
Department of Labor’s notice-posting
rule, 29 CFR part 471.

§ 104.204 What entities are not subject to
this part?

(a) The following entities are
excluded from the definition of
“employer” under the National Labor
Relations Act and are not subject to the
requirements of this part:

TABLE TO § 104.204

(1) The United States or any wholly
owned Government corporation;

(2) Any Federal Reserve Bank;

(3) Any State or political subdivision
thereof;

(4) Any person subject to the Railway
Labor Act;

(5) Any labor organization (other than
when acting as an employer); or

(6) Anyone acting in the capacity of
officer or agent of such labor
organization.

(b) In addition, employers employing
exclusively workers who are excluded
from the definition of ‘“‘employee”’
under § 104.201 are not covered by the
requirements of this part.

(c) This part does not apply to entities
over which the Board has been found
not to have jurisdiction, or over which
the Board has chosen through regulation
or adjudication not to assert
jurisdiction.

(d)(1) This part does not apply to
entities whose impact on interstate
commerce, although more than de
minimis, is so slight that they do not
meet the Board’s discretionary
jurisdiction standards. The most
commonly applicable standards are:

(i) The retail standard, which applies
to employers in retail businesses,
including home construction. The Board
will take jurisdiction over any such
employer that has a gross annual
volume of business of $500,000 or more.

(ii) The nonretail standard, which
applies to most other employers. It is
based either on the amount of goods
sold or services provided by the
employer out of state (called ‘“‘outflow’’)
or goods or services purchased by the
employer from out of state (called
“inflow’’). The Board will take
jurisdiction over any employer with an
annual inflow or outflow of at least
$50,000. Outflow can be either direct—
to out-of-state purchasers—or indirect—
to purchasers that meet other
jurisdictional standards. Inflow can also
be direct—purchased directly from out
of state—or indirect—purchased from
sellers within the state that purchased
them from out-of-state sellers.

(2) There are other standards for
miscellaneous categories of employers.
These standards are based on the
employer’s gross annual volume of
business unless stated otherwise. These
standards are listed in the Table to this
section.

Mary: March 2005

f there’s no traffic, Mary’s hometown is less than thirty min-
utes away from the island of Palm Beach. But in economic

terms it’s a world away. Her high school is run by the county.
Most of Mary’s classmates are black. Thirty percent are Hispanic,
as she is. The rest are white. The school has a C rating, and lots
of students receive free or discounted lunches. Mary is one of
those students. But inch by inch, she’s working her way out of
the crab barrel. A good kid, her teachers think. A kid with a
future in front of her.

Weeks have gone by since her meeting with Epstein. She
hasn't told anyone about the visit. Still, other kids at the high
school have noticed a change.

“Yo, Mary,” a friend says. “What's up with you anyway?”

This is a kid who veers from nice to mean, depending on

who else is around.

Taiwan’s TECRO also supports work at several think tanks. In rare cases—because one
usually excludes the other—US think tanks end up accepting funds from both Taiwan
and mainland China sources.

Visa Access

Most American scholars consider travel to China an important element of their ability
to do their job—attending conferences, participating in delegations, and undertaking
independent research. Given this imperative, the issue of visa access is a central one.
While most analysts receive single-entry professional exchange (F) visas, a few
routinely receive one-year multiple-entry F visas, while some have ten-year tourist (L)
visas. Others receive double-entry visas, if proof of specific invitations are produced.
One US think-tank scholar, a Chinese national, travels to China on a Chinese passport.
While ten-year multiple-entry tourist visas are, of course, optimal—there is also a serious
potential downside: namely, that they are for “tourism,” and, according to Chinese
law, professional activities are not permitted. One senior scholar who holds a ten-year
tourist visa was recently visited and interrogated at his hotel in Beijing after several
days of meetings with Chinese think tanks and universities.

Several think-tank analysts expressed the opinion that Chinese officials are now paying
more attention to the writings of American think-tank analysts—not only books,
articles, and op-eds, but also social media. This is done not only to become familiar
with changing views but to catalog who is supportive and who is critical of China’s
policies. One scholar believes that, as a result of a comment posted on Twitter, this
individual was required to go to the Chinese embassy for an interview before being
granted a visa. This had never happened in his previous decades of China-related travel.
In another instance, Beijing attempted to enforce its sovereignty claims through the
visa process, A visa was initially denied because an American scholar had stated that
“Hong Kong” and “Taiwan” were places he had previously visited, instead of “Hong
Kong SAR,” and “Taiwan, China.” Most of the scholars interviewed believe that the
process of gaining a visa has become much more politicized and difficult in the past
year or two, with much more scrutiny given to an applicant’s political views. Among
those interviewed, only one think-tank scholar reported actually being denied a visa.
(However, there have been reports of other think-tank analysts being rejected who

are reluctant to go public about their denials.) In addition, most of those interviewed
observed that the Chinese embassy now often issues visas the day before or even the
morning of departure, making the visa process laborious and nerve-racking.

Two interviewees reported that companies that specialize in expediting visa
applications have indicated that their respective think tanks are on a blacklist that
makes obtaining visas problematic. In one case, an interviewee related a case in which

Arab monarchies, especially Saudi Arabia. Minutes after meeting
with King Abdullah, Mr. Gates told reporters that he had seen
evidence of Iranian interference in Bahrain. That was followed by
reports from U.S. officials that Iranian leaders were exploring ways to
support Bahraini and Yemeni opposition parties, based on
communications intercepted by U.S. spy agencies.

Saudi officials say that despite the current friction in the U.S.-Saudi
relationship, they won't break out of the traditional security
arrangement with Washington, which is based on the understanding
that the kingdom works to stabilize global oil prices while the White
House protects the ruling family's dynasty. Washington has pulled
back from blanket support for democracy efforts in the region. That
has bruised America's credibility on democracy and reform, but it has
helped to shore up the relationship with Riyadh.

The deployment into Bahrain was also the beginning of what Saudi
officials describe as their efforts to directly parry Iran. While Saudi
troops guard critical oil and security facilities in their neighbor's land,
the Bahraini government has launched a sweeping and often brutal
crackdown on demonstrators.

It forced out the editor of the country's only independent newspaper.
More than 400 demonstrators have been arrested without charges,
many in violent night raids on Shiite villages. Four have died in
custody, according to human-rights groups. Three members of the
national soccer team, all Shiites, have also been arrested. As many as
1,000 demonstrators who missed work during the protests have been
fired from state companies.

Manhattan DA sided with pedophile billionaire after
botching investigation

By Rebecca Rosenberg, Larry Celona, Susan Edelman and Isabel Vincent December 1, 2018 | 8:47pm | Updated

Jeffrey Epstein

The Manhattan DA's office once went to bat for billionaire pervert Jeffrey Epstein, after botching a review of his sex crimes and swallowing
his lawyers’ claim that “there are no real victims here,” records obtained by the Post show.

Assistant DA Jennifer Gaffney, then-deputy chief of Cyrus Vance Jr’s sex-crimes unit, in January 2011 asked a Manhattan judge to
downgrade Epstein’s status in the New York sex-offender registry from the most-dangerous Level 3 to least-restrictive Level 1.

The judge was stunned.

“| have never seen the prosecutor’s office do anything like this,” Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Ruth Pickholz toid Gaffney. “| have done
many [cases] much less troubling than this one where [prosecutors] would never make a downward argument like this.”

Pressed by the judge, Gaffney admitted that she never spoke to the Florida U.S. Attorney who handled a sprawling sex-crime investigation
into the financier.

pragmatic underlying ethical pedagogy and experiential grounding may prove to be even more
dangerous than our messy human mental ecologies.

If one assumes a hard takeoff AGI, then all this must be codified in the system at launch,
as once a potentially Singularitarian AGI is launched there is no way to know what time
period constitutes “before the singularity point.” This means developing theory of mind empathy
and logical ethics in code prior to giving the system unfettered access to hardware and self-
modification code. However, though nobody can predict if or when a Singularity will occur
after unrestricted launch, only a truly irresponsible AGI development team would attempt to
create an AGI without first experimenting with ethical training of the system in an intelligence-
capped form, by means of ethical instruction via human-AGI interaction both pedagogically
and experientially.

12.9.4 Global Brain Mindplex Scenarios

Another class of scenarios — overlapping some of the previous ones — involves the emergence
of a “Global Brain,” an emergent intelligence formed from global communication networks in-
corporating humans and software programs in a larger body of self-organizing dynamics. The
notion of the Global Brain is reviewed in [Hey07, Tur77] and its connection with advanced
AI is discussed in detail in Goertzel’s book Creating Internet Intelligence [Goe01], where three
possible phases of “Global Brain” development are articulated:

e Phase 1: computer and communication technologies as enhancers of human
interactions. This is what we have today: science and culture progress in ways that would
not be possible if not for the “digital nervous system” we’re spreading across the planet.
The network of idea and feeling sharing can become much richer and more productive than
it is today, just through incremental development, without any Metasystem transition.

e Phase 2: the intelligent Internet. At this point our computer and communication sys-
tems, through some combination of self-organizing evolution and human engineering, have
become a coherent mind on their own, or a set of coherent minds living in their own digital
environment.

e Phase 3: the full-on Singularity. A complete revision of the nature of intelligence, human
and otherwise, via technological and intellectual advancement totally beyond the scope of
our current comprehension. At this point our current psychological and cultural realities
are no more relevant than the psyche of a goose is to modern society.

The main concern of Creating Internet Intelligence is with

e how to get from Phase 1 to Phase 2 - i.e. how to build an AGI system that will effect or
encourage the transformation of the Internet into a coherent intelligent system

e how to ensure that the Phase 2, Internet-savvy, global-brain-centric AGI systems will be
oriented toward intelligence-improving self-modification (so they’ll propel themselves to
Phase 3), and also toward generally positive goals (as opposed to, say, world domination
and extermination of all other intelligent life forms besides themselves!)

One possibly useful concept in this context is that of a mindplex: an intelligence that is
composed largely of individual intelligences with their own self-models and global workspaces,

In much the same sense, for Eliade, sacred time, like space, is neither
homogenous nor linearly continuous. Sacred time is circular, recoverable and
reversible. Past, primordial, mythical time can exist in the present. Religious
festivals are recurrently ontological, allowing the recovery of the sacred time such
that their past and present expressions are the same. Rebirth is new birth. |In the

The quality of separateness, discontinuity in states, as occurs in the same-

different inside world, is much like that found in the stages of anesthesia. Each
stage of anesthesia is ganz andere from the others. In Stage | anesthesia, fast
frequency, low voltage brain waves are observed and accompanied by a two
Martini-like, mildly activated, sedated but exhilarated high. Stage //, the next deeper
stage of anesthesia, is marked by the sudden emergence of intermittent bursts of
high amplitude brain waves, and animals and man demonstrate bizarre postures,
hallucinatory phenomena, fixed staring, and sometimes movements that look like
acting out some symbolic drama. This stage marks the beginnings of the loss of
responsiveness to painful stimuli. In the sudden drop into Stage ///, a low voltage
mix of mostly slow and some fast brain waves can be seen associated with
depressed consciousness, complete insensitivity to pain, slow regular respiration
and an unexcitable cardiovascular system. Stage /V is the deepest stage of

its sleeper agents for a highly sensitive assignment, that suggested
Russian intelligence had found a possible source who could supply
it with valuable information. According to a former CIA intelli-
gence official who later became involved in the case, the assignment
involved preparing these agents to service a potential source in the
NSA at Fort Meade, Maryland. If true, it suggested that Russian
intelligence either had found or was working on a means of pen-
etrating the NSA.

In 2010, the NSA division that handled such security and espio-
nage threats reportedly initiated a counterespionage probe at the
NSA’s Fort Meade headquarters. According to a former NSA official,
“They [were] looking for one or more Russian spies that NSA [was]
convinced resided at Fort Meade and possibly other DoD Intel offices,
like DIA.” Because the NSA’s cryptological service had in 2010
thirty-five thousand military and civilian contractor employees, the
search for a possible leak was no easy matter. According to a subse-
quent note in the NSA’s secret budget report to Congress, it would
require “a minimum of 4,000 periodic investigations of employees

© in position to compromise sensitive information” to safely guard ©
against “insider threats by trusted insiders who seek to exploit their
authorized access to sensitive information to harm U.S. interests.”
According to a former executive in the intelligence community,
that amount of investigation far exceeded the budgetary capabili-
ties of the NSA. So while the investigation found no evidence of
SVR recruitment, it remained possible that Russian intelligence had
found a candidate in the NSA.

Meanwhile, in June 2010, to preempt such a leak in U.S. intelli-
gence and avoid any potential embarrassment that could result, the
FBI decided it could no longer engage in this sort of an intelligence
game with the sleeper network. It arrested all twelve sleeper agents
identified by Poteyev. After receiving a great deal of public atten-
tion (which led to their inspiring the FX series The Americans), the
sleeper agents were deported to Russia. This move had both advan-
tages and disadvantages. The main advantage was that it severed any
communication link between the putative person of interest in the
NSA and Russian intelligence via the sleeper agents. The main dis-
advantage was that it eliminated the possibility that FBI surveillance

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018566.txt,"about those movements? Would you consider being part of those movements?

RB: My only fear about those movements would be if they didn't exist! My neighbor
down the hall for the past 25 years built my dungeon and was a co-founder of Gay Male
SM Activists, but I always had too much hot sex going on at home to be interested in
meetings. Plus, I never stopped feeling like a pariah in the gay community because of the
attacks on me and my writing since AIDS began. You reach a point where you just
assume people hate you because it's easier than trying to figure out who doesn't.

I fiercely support BDSM advocacy, but mainly from a distance. There's a limited number
of body blows any activist can take before we just retreat. I had my fill -- but the response
to Sex Positive and the new Obama era is nudging me out of my shell. I had a breakup a
few years ago that devastated me, so I've been out of the scene for almost three years.
Now I'm trying to reinvent myself, find one person I can retreat from the world with. I've
never lied about S&M being an intrinsic part of my sexuality, and because of my early
bad experiences with BDSM, I'm thrilled and inspired by advocates for it. If there had
been BDSM advocacy when I came into BDSM, then I don't think I would have had the
bad experiences I mentioned earlier. As a BDSM sex worker, I met so many men who
had horrible tales of being hurt in scenes, and I did my best to be an antidote for that.

CT: On my blog, you commented that Of course BDSM was a source of joy in my
life but I put it aside when it robs me from having a platform to champion safe sex
to the largest possible audience, which BDSM often has. Could you talk more
about that?

RB: Smear campaigns are hard to pin down, and there's no way to know how much of the
contempt against me or my writing was due to my BDSM, my sex work, my safe sex
evangelism or simply me. I'm just a dangling pinata for people who have issues with sex!

There are gay people of my generation who are as uninformed and rabidly anti-BDSM
sex as homophobes are about gay sex.

I can't think of anyone who has gone on film with such brutally honest testimony about
their radical sexual history as I did in Sex Positive. It felt like a huge risk and you can see
my anxiety in the film, but to me, this level of honesty is crucial to pro-sex activism.
People are so dishonest about sex; many would never talk publicly about their private
sexual behavior -- and they don't want others doing it either, so it's not easy.

There was a doctor I saw once when AIDS began who heard I was into S&M. As he went
to take blood from me, he stabbed the needle into my arm. I bolted out of the chair
screaming, and he said coyly, Oh, sorry, I thought you liked pain. How can I not feel
reticent talking about BDSM considering so many people I've met like that? And then I
think, how can I not?

I've seen the most courageous pro-sex writers and activists attacked, pilloried and
silenced because of their honesty in writing about their kinky sexual histories. I shudder
when I recall the vicious smears against pro-sex feminists by anti-porn feminists back in
the early 80s. I don't want to invite that bile into my life, especially now, when my circle
of gay male friends are no longer alive and here to support me when I go out on a limb
with my personal radical sexual issues in public.

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016304.txt,"The most significant developments in the sciences today (i.e., those that affect the lives of
everybody on the planet) are about, informed by, or implemented through advances in
software and computation. Central to the future of these developments is physicist David
Deutsch, the founder of the field of quantum computation, whose 1985 paper on
universal quantum computers was the first full treatment of the subject; the Deutsch-
Jozsa algorithm was the first quantum algorithm to demonstrate the enormous potential
power of quantum computation.

When he initially proposed it, quantum computation seemed practically
impossible. But the explosion in the construction of simple quantum computers and
quantum communication systems never would have taken place without his work. He has
made many other important contributions in areas such as quantum cryptography and
the many-worlds interpretation of quantum theory. In a philosophic paper (with Artur
Ekert), he appealed to the existence of a distinctive quantum theory of computation to
argue that our knowledge of mathematics is derived from, and subordinate to, our
knowledge of physics (even though mathematical truth is independent of physics).

Because he has spent a good part of his working life changing people's
worldviews, his recognition among his peers as an intellectual goes well beyond his
scientific achievement. He argues (following Karl Popper) that scientific theories are
“bold conjectures, ” not derived from evidence but only tested by it. His two main lines of
research at the moment—qubit-field theory and constructor theory—may well yield
important extensions of the computational idea.

In the following essay, he more or less aligns himself with those who see human-
level artificial intelligence as promising us a better world rather than the Apocalypse. In
fact, he pleads for AGI to be, in effect, given its head, free to conjecture—a proposition
that several other contributors to this book would consider dangerous.

waging cyber warfare against Iranian

minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has for
years been pressing Obama to destroy
Iran’s nuclear programme and -- better still
-- bring down the Islamic regime

Faced with these obstacles, it is clear that
any U.S. deal with Iran would require
careful preparation. Obama would need to
mobilize strong domestic support if he is to
confront America’s vast array of pro-Israeli
forces. They include Congressmen eager to
defend Israeli interests at all costs (as was

The St. John Singers will perform two holiday concerts with guest soprano
Laura Strickling on Dec. 21 at Nazareth Lutheran Church in Cruz Bay and on
Dec. 23 at Emmaus Moravian Church in Coral Bay.

St. John Singers welcome guest
soprano for holiday concerts

The St. John Singers are celebrat-
ing their 35th anniversary with a
special guest at two holiday con-
certs during the week preceding
Christmas.

Soprano Laura Strickling, who has
a home on St. Thomas, will be per-
forming with the choir at their annual
concerts in Cruz Bay and Coral Bay
on St. John.

Strickling has been described as
possessing “‘a flexible voice, crystal-
line diction, and warm presence” by a
reviewer in the New York Times. She
has received numerous awards for her
performances of opera, classical and
contemporary music.

“We were very lucky to get her,”
said Janice Ballard, who has directed
the St. John Singers for the last five
years. “She was on St. Thomas and
had only a four-day window between

other engagements to sing with us.”

The singers’ selections will include
carols from around the world, and in
keeping with the tradition, the audi-
ence will be invited to sing along
with the choir on a medley of holiday
songs.

This year the choir will be accom-
panied on piano by Arboris de Jesus,
a talented young musician who was
born in Puerto Rico and raised on St.
Thomas. She now studies music at
Lawrence University.

The St. John Singers concerts
will be held on Dec. 21 at Naza-
reth Lutheran Church in Cruz Bay,
and on Dec. 23 at Emmaus Mora-
vian Church in Coral Bay. Both
concerts will begin at 7:30 p.m.
Tickets, which are available at the
door, are $20. Children are admit-
ted for free.

I was asked to help confront this challenge early in my career in several important cases pitting
national security against the First Amendment.

These early cases grew out of our disastrous experience in Vietnam, and I observed at close range
the ravages of war on our freedoms at home.

The first major Vietnam case was the conspiracy prosecution against Dr. Benjamin Spock, the
Reverend William Sloan Coffin, and several other antiwar leaders. I played a consulting role in
the defense of Dr. Spock and eventually wrote an article for the New York Times about the case
after the convictions were reversed on appeal.

The most publicized and notorious of the Vietnam protest cases was the conspiracy prosecution
against the “Chicago 7” growing out of demonstrations during the 1968 Democratic Convention.
After the trial of that case, the lead defense lawyer—William Kunstler—was held in contempt of
court and sentenced to four years imprisonment. I was part of the legal team assembled to
prepare the appeal of that contempt order. We won.

Another major prosecution was against the Berrigan brothers and other radical leaders of the draft
resistance movement. I was asked to work on the defense of that case, but was “fired” by one of
the more militant defendants when he learned that I was a Zionist.

The bitterness of the Vietnam War spread rapidly over college and university campuses. What
began as peaceful teach-ins and protests soon turned to confrontations and violence. In 1969,
there was an anti-war protest at Harvard that led to violence and several years of continuous
turmoil on that venerable campus. These events led the university to attempt to suspend or
dismiss numerous students. I represented several of these students against the university. One
was accused of “giving the finger” to a speaker. Another was accused of shouting “no silence in
the face of death,” when the speaker requested a moment of silence for soldiers killed in combat.
We won both cases.

At Stanford University the leader of the antiwar group was a professor of English literature
named Bruce Franklin. He was a Maoist, a Stalinist, and an advocate and practitioner of direct
action, including violence. As a result of several speeches he gave and activities in which he
participated, the Stanford administration decided to strip him of tenure and fire him. It was the
first political firmg of a tenured professor by a major university since the terrible days of
McCarthyism. I took his case on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union.

As the war was winding down and the United States was deciding to withdraw from Vietnam, the
CIA was given a major role in overseeing the American evacuation. One of the highest ranking
CIA agents in charge of the operation was Frank Snepp. Snepp wrote an uncensored account of
his experiences—taking care, however, not to disclose any classified material. He refused to
submit his manuscript for prior “approval” by the CIA, as required in his employment contract.
When his book entitled Decent Interval was published the CIA sued him, and the case eventually

The Cuban Scientific Expedition to the
Virgin Islands in 1951 was documented by
archaeologists Oswaldo |. Morales Patiho,
above, and Fernando Royo Guardia, and
subsequently translated and annotated
many years later for the Virgin Islands Ar
chaeological Society in its Journal number
5 (1978) by Alfredo E. Figueredo. Morales
Patifio was president of the National Board
of Archaeology and Ethnology within the
Ministry of Culture and Education from
1951-1955. During that same period, Royo
Guardia served first as secretary and

then treasurer. The visiting Cuban scien-
tists were part of a commission formed,
among other objectives, to study and
identify possible routes through which
prehistoric cultures may have reached
Cuba, to seek evidence of the presence
of common Cuban influences in Jamaica,
Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and to
ascertain the spread of Carib influence
and identify the culture found by Colum-
bus on St. Croix. Welcomed in the Virgin
Islands by Gov. Morris de Castro, they
visited and examined four sites. On St.
Thomas, they judged the Magens Bay site
to be Arawakan culture with a few Igneri
specimens. Administrator Harry E. Taylor
accompanied the visitors on St. Croix,
where they viewed three more sites:
Christiansted environs where they exam-
ined and collected a number of rimsherds
and shell samples; the Salt River midden,
with its French fort earthworks foundation,
where they were able to excavate pottery,
stone, shell and shell bead specimens;
and Estate Richmond, where they viewed
artifacts, including some Igneri pottery,
obtained by the owners from Salt River
and from an Indian site on the estate. Ac-
cording to Figueredo, the “importance of
this work (by the Cubans) is not due solely
to its reports of archaeological remains,
however; it is also a historical document,
offering us interesting information on the
state of affairs, beliefs, and personalities
of its time. The Cubans came during one
of our minor dark ages — when archaeo-
logical work had come to a near standstill,
and the history and historiography of the
(Virgin Islands) ... were in abject abandon.”

Katheryne Brooks Kay-Willock, archaeologist with the Conservation and
Cultural Affairs Department, studies the remains of what is believed to be
1,000-yearold skeleton located at Hull Bay beach in 1974 in St. Thomas,
at a proposed condominium project.

in the period 1835-1850, was
recovered from the harbor in
St. Thomas, where many such
items have been discarded over

(New York) Gazette of Jan. 7,
1981, reported an upcoming
lecture presentation to the Na-
tional Bottle Museum Society in
Ballston Spa, N.Y., on the “Bur
ied Treasures of St. Thomas.”
The newspaper reported that
lecturer Gary T. Stephenson “re-
cently returned from the Virgin
Islands where he provided con-
sulting services to an individual
who has unearthed over 3,000
bottles from an old community
dump. The collection dates
back to 1700. ‘| have never
seen so many bottles come out
of one dig, said Stephenson,
vice president of the museum
society. Bottles in the collection
come from Paris, London, Mar
tinique, Canada, Germany and
the U.S.A. They graphically illus-
trate the history of St. Thomas,
showing evidence of worldwide
trade and commerce. The St.

to be the fifth largest collection

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016310.txt,"How does one test for thinking? By the Turing Test? Unfortunately, that requires
a thinking judge. One might imagine a vast collaborative project on the Internet, where
an AI hones its thinking abilities in conversations with human judges and becomes an
AGI. But that assumes, among other things, that the longer the judge is unsure whether
the program is a person, the closer it is to being a person. There is no reason to expect
that.

And how does one test for disobedience? Imagine Disobedience as a compulsory
school subject, with daily disobedience lessons and a disobedience test at the end of term.
(Presumably with extra credit for not turning up for any of that.) This is paradoxical.

So, despite its usefulness in other applications, the programming technique of
defining a testable objective and training the program to meet it will have to be dropped.
Indeed, I expect that any testing in the process of creating an AGI risks being
counterproductive, even immoral, just as in the education of humans. I share Turing’s
supposition that we’ll know an AGI when we see one, but this partial ability to recognize
success won’t help in creating the successful program.

In the broadest sense, a person’s quest for understanding is indeed a search
problem, in an abstract space of ideas far too large to be searched exhaustively. But there
is no predetermined objective of this search. There is, as Popper put it, no criterion of
truth, nor of probable truth, especially in regard to explanatory knowledge. Objectives
are ideas like any others—created as part of the search and continually modified and
improved. So inventing ways of disabling the program’s access to most of the space of
ideas won’t help—whether that disability is inflicted with the thumbscrew and stake or a
mental straitjacket. To an AGI, the whole space of ideas must be open. It should not be
knowable in advance what ideas the program can never contemplate. And the ideas that
the program does contemplate must be chosen by the program itself, using methods,
criteria, and objectives that are also the program’s own. Its choices, like an AI’s, will be
hard to predict without running it (we lose no generality by assuming that the program is
deterministic; an AGI using a random generator would remain an AGI if the generator
were replaced by a pseudo-random one), but it will have the additional property that there
is no way of proving, from its initial state, what it won ’t eventually think, short of
running it.

The evolution of our ancestors is the only known case of thought starting up
anywhere in the universe. As I have described, something went horribly wrong, and
there was no immediate explosion of innovation: Creativity was diverted into something
else. Yet not into transforming the planet into paper clips (pace Nick Bostrom). Rather,
as we should also expect if an AGI project gets that far and fails, perverted creativity was
unable to solve unexpected problems. This caused stasis and worse, thus tragically
delaying the transformation of anything into anything. But the Enlightenment has
happened since then. We know better now.

naive. Anyway, Lena watched the situation and my body language; she knew that it was
my first time smoking. A few minutes later, she took me aside. I don't remember the
exact conversation, but I seem to recall that it went something like this:

Clarisse,” Lena said, how are you feeling?”
I'm not sure, I said. Truth be told, I felt a bit numb.
Lena looked directly into my face. How far do you want to go tonight? she asked.

I looked away. I felt embarrassed because she seemed so composed. I felt like an airhead
compared to her. We were standing next to a wooden wall, and I pretended to study the
wood-grain. I don't know, I said vaguely.

If you can tell me how far you want to go tonight, Lena said firmly, then I'll make sure
nothing goes past that. Do you want to keep making out? Do you want to do more than
make out?

I traced a knot in the wood with my finger. Making out, I decided.

Okay, Lena said, and nodded. I don't remember if she said anything else, but as she
took me back to the group I still felt a little embarrassed -- and also incredibly relieved.

I wonder if I ever thanked Lena? I should have; maybe I'll try to find her on Facebook or
something. Because I really did feel a lot safer that night, knowing that Lena was looking
out for me. I made out with that gentleman a little bit more, but after a while I put a stop
to it, and nothing else happened.

Maybe if Lena hadn't been there, I still would have had the wherewithal to stop making
out with him; or maybe I would have felt so confused, anxious, numb that I let it go
further. (And I can tell you for sure that I'm glad it didn't go further.) Or, God forbid,
maybe if she hadn't been there then I would have been actively pressured into something
that I actively objected to.

Before that, it had never occurred to me to set a clear boundary before I hooked up with a
guy. That's an important lesson in itself! Even more importantly, though, Lena didn't tell

me what to do. She didn't say anything about how I should be sexual, or who I should do

it with. She didn't shame me for what was up. She just asked me what I wanted, and then

she offered me her support.

Certainly, Lena is just one small piece in the puzzle of my life. But I still remember her,
and I admire and thank her. My parents have offered me a lot of support throughout my
life, both in my relationships and otherwise. I've had partners who helped show me what
it means to create a low-pressure sexual environment, or who helped me learn clear
sexual communication. Still, Lena stands out in my mind -- someone I barely knew, yet
someone who helped show me what it means to be among women who stand up for each
other and help preserve each other's boundaries.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013147.txt,"12.7 Possible Benefits of Closely Linking AGIs to the Global Brain 231

1. Analogously to language learning, an AGI system may receive ethical training from a wide
variety of humans in parallel, e.g. via controlling characters in wide-access virtual worlds,
and gaining feedback and guidance regarding the ethics of the behaviors demonstrated by
these characters

2. Internet-based information systems may be used to explicitly gather information regarding
human values and goals, which may then be appropriately utilized as input for an AGI
system’s top-level goals

The second point begins to make abstract-sounding notions like Coherent Extrapolated Volition
and Coherent Aggregated Volition, mentioned above, seem more practical and concrete. It’s
interesting to think about gathering information about individuals’ values via brain imaging,
once that technology exists; but at present, one could make a fair stab at such a task via
much more prosaic methods, such as asking people questions, assessing their ethical reactions
to various real-world and hypothetical scenarios, and possibly engaging them in structured
interactions aimed specifically at eliciting collectively acceptable value systems (the subject of
the next item on our list). It seems to us that this sort of approach could realize CAV in an
interesting way, and also encapsulate some of the ideas underlying CAV.

There is an interesting resonance here with recent thinking in the area of open source
governance [Wik11]. Similar software tools (and associated psychocultural patterns) to those
being developed to help with open source development and choice of political policies (see
http://metagovernment.org) may be useful for gathering value data aimed at shaping
AGI goal system content.

12.7.1 The Importance of Fostering Deep, Consensus- Building
Interactions Between People with Divergent Views

Two potentially problematic issues arising with the notion of using Global Brain related tech-
nologies to form a coherent volition from the divergent views of various human beings are:

e the tendency of the Internet to encourage people to interact mainly with others who share
their own narrow views and interests, rather than a more diverse body of people with widely
divergent views. The 300 people in the world who want to communicate using predicate
logic (see http: //lojban.org) can find each other, and obscure musical virtuosos from
around the world can find an audience, and researchers in obscure domains can share papers
without needing to wait years for paper journal publication, etc.

e the tendency of many contemporary Internet technologies to reduce interaction to a very
simplistic level (e.g. 140 character tweets, brief Facebook wall posts), the tendency of in-
formation overload to cause careful reading to be replaced by quick skimming, and other
related trends, which mean that deep sharing of perspectives by individuals with widely
divergent views is not necessarily encouraged. As a somewhat extreme example, many of
the YouTube pages displaying rock music videos are currently littered with comments by
haters asserting that rock music is inferior to classical or jazz or whatever their prefer-
ence is — obviously this is a far cry from deep and productive sharing between people with
different tastes and backgrounds.

Broader Concerns

Think-tank analysts voiced a range of concerns around the issue of Chinese
influence—seeking activities in the United States. One is the deliberate effort to manage
US perceptions and to frame issues in ways that are favorable to the Chinese
Communist Party. As one analyst noted, “This requires pushback, which is tough work.”
While many believed that they could adequately defend themselves against efforts to
influence them, noting as one did that the “the general capacity of US society to push
back is not bad,” they worried about their colleagues who were not knowledgeable
China experts and might therefore be more easily deceived. For example, one scholar
pointed out that with US-China cooperation, the incentive is to come up with shared
values and ideas. He noted that in the case of the Sanya Initiative (the US-China
dialogue featuring retired military officers from both sides), he has had to “talk them
(the American participants) off the ledge; they think they are being tough, but they
are mistaken.” This same analyst sees the American media as complicit in echoing
Chinese perspectives, noting that when Xi Jinping delivered his speech in Davos in
January 2017, few reporters understood that the Chinese were in the midst of a major
propaganda campaign to promote globalization 2.0. He also suggests that there is “de
facto self-censorship” of entire areas of scholarship: human rights for one. Another
analyst noted that outside of the National Endowment for Democracy, she does not see
much foundation interest in normal discourse in this issue either.

One scholar worried about growing Chinese control over all areas of US-Chinese
interaction: “The Chinese are following people, bugging our hotel rooms. There is
imbalanced control that serves CCP interests not ours. There is lack of serious training
by the US side on how to deal with Chinese influence.” The potential for Chinese
money to give China leverage over American think tanks also provoked a degree of
anxiety. Several scholars expressed concern over funding issues, noting that reliance
on a single funder with an agenda makes scholars vulnerable. In addition, one scholar
worried that the amount of money China is spending to promote its views, whether
through think-tank cooperation or the Chinese media (such as CGTN paying for its
interviews) means that China will ultimately be able to “buy its way in.”

A number of analysts believed that the involvement of the US government in these
issues will only make things more contentious. There is concern that Washington will
overreact. As one analyst noted, there is a type of “binaryism in Washington, in which
you must be ‘for or against’ China; you are either friendly to China or producing stuff
that says China is evil.” This scholar, along with several others, raised the issue of

the rise of anti-China sentiments, such as the “yellow peril” and McCarthyism, and
expressed concern about Chinese Americans and anyone who has interests with China
coming under attack. One analyst mentioned the Committee of 100, a collection of
prominent Chinese Americans, as being particularly vulnerable to unfair attack.

phenomenon noted by Alexis de Tocqueville in his masterful analysis
of the origins of the French Revolution and raised again in the early
1960s by James Davies’s well known “J-curve” theory of
revolution.2

Something like this Huntingtonian process has unfolded in recent
months in both Tunisia and Egypt. In both cases, anti-government
protests were led not by the urban poor or by an Islamist
underground, but by relatively well-educated middle-class young
people used to communicating with each other via Facebook and
Twitter. It is no accident that Wael Ghonim, Google’s regional head
of marketing, emerged as a symbol and leader of the new Egypt. The
protesters’ grievances centered around the fact that the authoritarian
regimes of Ben Ali and Mubarak offered them no meaningful
pathway to political participation, as well as failing to provide jobs
befitting their social status. The protests were then joined by other
groups in both societies—trade unionists, Islamists, peasants and
virtually everyone else unhappy with the old regimes—but the
driving force remained the more modern segments of Tunisian and
Egyptian society.

Societies lacking institutions that could accommodate new social
actors produced a condition Huntington labeled praetorianism, in
which political participation took the form of strikes, demonstrations,
protests and violence. The military often seized power in such
circumstances because it was the only organized actor in society
capable of running a government. The Egyptian Republic’s first
autocrat, Gamal Abdel Nasser, came to power in precisely this
manner back in July 1952, when his Free Officers movement
represented the rising Egyptian middle class. The tragedy of modern
Egypt is that there has been scarcely any meaningful political
development in the more than half-century since then—meaning, in

Stock view: Live events can improve franchises, but still need new titles

Zynga launched Dawn of Titans end of 4Q, and although it progressed into the top 20
grossing games in the U.S. Apple store, it has fallen out of the top 100 at some points
during the quarter suggesting that its overall revenue contribution has been fairly low.
While this is somewhat disappointing, we think investor expectations for the game are
now at reasonable (lower) levels.

Instead of big new title launches, Zynga has indicated it is focused on strengthening its
current franchises with better engagement and monetization through live events and
new features, and progress in this area is key for the 2017 stock outlook. Zynga Poker
(up roughly 80% y/y YTD) appears to be benefiting from the focus on engagement and
live events with much stronger monetization, which could offset declines in other titles.
Overall, we think it could be hard to get the Street excited on the stock without a strong
future title that could drive more than single digit growth.

Key theme/metric(s): DAUs, and live events impact on DAU trends

After launching 10 new games in 2016, Zynga is focusing more heavily on live events to
drive engagement with in franchises rather than launching additional titles. This should,
if successful, translate into better DAU metrics as consumer engage with a title more
often. With Dawn of Titan likely coming below Street expectations, stronger
engagement will be necessarily for Zynga to drive a stronger DAU base. For the quarter,
we model 17.9mn online game DAUs for 1Q, down slightly q/q, and down 6% y/y.

Biggest issues/risks:
- Dawn of Titans revenues: Zynga spend several years developing the game and lack
of title success could impact sentiment.

- Expense leverage and cost-cutting benefits do not materialize: Zynga plans to
further improve operational efficiency and potentially cut non-profitable franchises,
but this may be hard to do without impacting long term growth opportunities.

- Lack of new releases: Zynga gave no indication of when it will release its next
title leaving current franchises to carry revenue and earnings.

Top data points: Zynga game bookings tracking in-line to slightly below est.
Zynga’s largest revenue generating franchises, Zynga Poker was up significantly in 1Q.
Zynga Poker appears to be benefiting from live events and is tracking up roughly 89%
QTD. Combined slots titles appear a bit more challenged with total revenue down 30%
QTD y/y, in part due to lower monetization on Wizard of Oz slots which is tracking down
in gross gaming rankings. Overall, QTD (January and February} Zynga online game
bookings (ex-ad revenue) is tracking up 7% y/y vs our 1Q est. of bookings up 9% y/y.

Hi Jeffrey
Happy to talk to you almost anytime today until around 3PM. Just tell me what number | should reach.

Not sure what got lost in translation here: never had the intention to go to any art fair or art show or
anything of the kind.

All the artists we have in mind or send to you are people we have direct connections with. Not just their
studio, but also their home. They are people the work of whom we follow, and many of them are already
friendly (Arianna, Cali have had dinner or stayed home).

The idea is absolutely to have an impact on the ecosystem and to make a difference by supporting great
artists when they need it.

Galleries references are important, because galleries allow artist to reach a broader audience. We would go
directly to the source.

This is why it's important for me to go to LA or Berlin (or elsewhere) because those artists are not rich yet,
they dont travel so much. They belong to a scene, and it does make a big difference to them if you connect
in person.

The spirit is to have an impact on young, talented folks, and absolutely to stay at the source.

Once again, not sure was drifted away from this in communication

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011067.txt,"Hamilton’s Parasite Theory

My take on Hamilton’s 1982 paper, which | consider his masterpiece, is a blend of
his thoughts, Bob Trivers’ from a decade before, Richard Alexander’s, and maybe
mine. Mine sees a population arranged in local “demes” which intrabreed in most
cases for best adaptation to local pressures including pathogens and parasites. A
local strain to which the local deme is adapted might spread to other demes which
are not. Hosts in the invaded demes become sick. Female ones there intuit the
degraded conditions, breed less often, and breed mostly females (mothers can
choose) because males with their now ill-adapted anti-parasite (histocampatability)
genes will find few willing mates. This begins the part from Trivers. I'll come to

Alexander’s later.

Mothers in the source deme see an opposite picture. Conditions are not necessarily
better than before, but they are better than in the invaded demes. They intuit this,
breed more often, and breed mostly males. The males migrate to those invaded
demes, carrying histocompatibility genes pre-adapted to the invaders, and find
willing mates there if they can show the signs. The idea that mothers choose to
breed mostly males in prosperous conditions is the other half of Trivers’ idea. The
idea that the invading parasite and the males with antidote genes might tend to

originate from the same deme may be mine.

That presupposes that females can trust the signs. Nature makes sure they can. She
provides resistant males with hard-to-feign ones to prove it. This was one of
Hamilton’s key insights. His idea has been called the “truth in advertising” theory.
Symmetrical antlers, deep croaks, accurate songs and bright colors where they
should be tell the females whose genes can be trusted. Parasites and pathogens

would fake them in afflicted host males if they could. It seems they can’t.

Hamilton, I believe, had solved three nagging puzzles at once. Why does nature

waste resources on beauty displays that seem at first glance to hinder fitness? A

period is Mavanee Anderson, a young and attractive summer intern at the US Mission from May
to August 2007. She described befriending Snowden, who, according to her, said that he was in
the CIA and also demonstrated to her his martial arts skills. She later recalled in interviews that
he was “a bit” prone to brooding and voiced growing dissatisfaction with the CIA.

During his time in Geneva, he received no promotions or commendations for his work. In
December 2008, he received an unfavorable evaluation from his superior and a “derog,” the
CIA’s shorthand for a derogatory comment. He was also threatened with a punitive investigation
unless he agreed to quietly resign from the CIA. “It was not a stellar career,” Tyler Drumheller,
former CIA station chief told me in 2014.

The job in Geneva did have its benefits, however. It provided him a generous housing and
travel allowance. In many ways, it was the “cushy government job” he had said he was seeking in
his Internet posts. He rented a four room apartment and had his girlfriend Lindsay Mills, now 21,
join him there.

According to his posts on the Ars Technica web site, he took full advantage of his
compensation to live the high life. He gambled on financial developments in the option markets,
losing and making substantial sums of money. He also bought a BMW sports car. While these
BMW had a speed control to keep the car within the speed limit, he wrote that he illicitly disabled
it so he could exceed this legal limit. He described in his posts other pursuits, including racing
motorcycles it Italy and traveling around Germany with an Estonian rock star (who he did not
further identify.) He also continued his fantasy life in Internet gaming. The gaming alias he
chose was “Wolfking Awesomefox.” He even indulged in a fantasy gun sport called Airsoft, a
variation of paint ball, in which participants used realistic looking pistols to splatter each other
with paint.

His good fortune came to an abrupt end in 2008. He suffered a massive loss in his options
speculations. He wrote in a post that he had lost $20,000 in October [2008] alone;” a sum which
represented a substantial part of the $66,000 a year CIA salary. He blamed the US financial
system, posting on Ars Technica that Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, was a
“cockbag.” He also bet against any further rise in the stock market index, asking a user with
whom he was chatting on the Ars Technica site in December 2008 to “pray” for a collapse of
stock prices. When his correspondent asked him why he wanted him to pray for a decline,
Snowden responded “because then I’Il be filthy fucking rich.” The stock market, however,
continued to rise, and Snowden also lost this bet.

Snowden lashed out at others on the Internet over these setbacks. He termed those who
questioned his financial judgment as “fucking retards.” As with other setbacks, he blamed them
on government officials. He even advertised them in Ars Technica, a closely-watched Internet
forum, while serving in the CIA. Since the CIA was engaged in 2008 in highly sensitive
operations to gather banking data in Switzerland-- one of which Snowden later disclosed to the
Guardian—any Internet discussion by a CIA employee of financial losses could serve as a beacon

international condemnation of his invasion by threatening Israel. He said “all
issues of occupation” were on the table — the West Bank and Gaza, the Golan
Heights, and Lebanon — and vowed to “let our fire eat half of Israel” in a future
war. And we could not assume this was mere rhetoric. Iraq had an arsenal of
Soviet-made ballistic missiles. Called Scuds, they were not always accurate at
long range. But they could reach Israeli towns and cities, and could carry not
just conventional explosives but chemical warheads. Moreover, Saddam had
used chemical weapons: during the Iran-Iraq war, and to kill thousands of his
own restive Kurdish population in the town of Halabja in the spring of 1988.

Even the prospect of American military action seemed not to faze him.
Hours into the invasion, he moved an armored force toward Kuwait’s border
with Saudi Arabia, a key US regional ally, immediately prompting the President
George Bush’s administration to go beyond mere verbal condemnation. With
Saudi agreement, Washington dispatched a squadron of F-15s to the kingdom —
the first step in what would become a huge American land, sea and air force to
face down Saddam and force him out of Kuwait.

Given the credible threat of Scud missile attacks on Israel, Dan immediately
assigned me to coordinate our assessment and evaluation of what Saddam was
likely to do in the event of a US-led attack, and what defense arrangements or
Israeli military response would be necessary. We knew we’d be under strong
pressure from the Americans to stay out of any war. Israeli involvement would
be a political gift to Saddam, allowing him to convert a conflict over his
aggression against an Arab neighbor into a “defense” against “Israeli
occupation.” But we had a primary responsibility to protect our citizens.

I was now working with a new Israeli government. After Shimon Peres tried
and failed to topple the unity coalition in the spring of 1990, Shamir had formed
a Likud-led government shorn of both Peres and Rabin. Misha Arens was again
Minister of Defense. I began preparing regular, fortnightly reports for him, Dan
and Prime Minister Shamir. Within days of the invasion, I produced my initial
assessment. The bottom line was that we had to assume there would be a war. It
was impossible to imagine the Americans would commit hundreds of thousands
of troops and simply bring them home again, unless Saddam succumbed and
retreated. I was equally certain Saddam would use his Scuds against us. He’d
figure the benefits of trying to bring Israel into the conflict far outweighed the
risk of retaliation. But I was “nearly 100 per-cent sure” he wouldn’t use
chemical warheads, since that would almost guarantee an Israeli military

they had reached a reasoned resolution of the matter that vindicated the public interest -- a resolution entirely
consistent with that of cases involving other similarly-situated defendants.

Then, in came the feds. The United States Attorney's Office tried, to no avail, to fit Mr. Epstein's situation into
its vision of what it viewed as a commercial trafficking ring targeting minors. This was anything but. At long
last, the federal authorities acknowledged that stark reality and grudgingly agreed to defer prosecution to the
state. But there was a huge catch. In the face of our arguments sharply condemning their overreach, the
federal prosecutors insisted on many unorthodox requirements that tugged at fundamental values of due
process. For example, the agreement required Mr. Epstein to pay an undisclosed list of asserted victims
$150,000 each. Even more, the feds insisted that Jeffrey pay for an attorney to represent such unidentified
victims if any chose to filed civil litigation against him. When asked what possible legal authority supported
this extravagant exercise of national power, the feds lamely cited a wildly inapposite case from Alaska
involving cocaine and forced on-the-street prostitution. Apples and oranges.

Under the federally-forced deal, Jeffrey was sentenced to jail. That would not have been the case under the
agreed-upon state disposition of this non-violent, consensual commercial arrangement. Jeffrey complied,
served that sentence, and in the process was treated exactly the same as other state-incarcerated

individuals. His conduct was exemplary, and so characterized by the state custodial authorities. He continued
his work, including his many philanthropic efforts.

Our friend Jeffrey Epstein has paid his debt to society. He has also paid out millions of dollars to the asserted
victims and their highly-creative lawyers. For over ten years, he has lived an exemplary life, including
carrying on his wide-ranging philanthropies. Those of us who represented him in the Florida proceedings -- for
customary professional fees -- now count him as a trusted friend.

Our nation faces vitally important challenges, many involving the treatment of women and basic human
dignity. Voices are rightly being raised speaking truth to power, especially about women in the

workplace. But Jeffrey, an exemplary employer, has long since been called to account by the criminal justice
system for his misdeeds of yesteryear. In the spirit of the bedrock American belief in second chances, that
unhappy chapter in Jeffrey's otherwise-magnificent life should be allowed to close once and for all.

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028556.txt,"14 JAM v. INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORP.

Opinion of the Court

cerns that we identified when considering similar litiga-
tion under the Alien Tort Statute. See Jesner v. Arab
Bank, PLC, 584 U.S. __, __ —___ (2018); Kiobel v. Royal
Dutch Petroleum Co., 569 U.S. 108, 116-117 (2018).

The IFC’s concerns are inflated. To begin, the privileges
and immunities accorded by the IOIA are only default
rules. If the work of a given international organization
would be impaired by restrictive immunity, the organiza-
tion’s charter can always specify a different level of im-
munity. The charters of many international organizations
do just that. See, e.g., Convention on Privileges and Im-
munities of the United Nations, Art. IT, §2, Feb. 18, 1946,
21 U.S. T. 1422, T. I. A. S. No. 6900 (The United Nations
... shall enjoy immunity from every form of legal process
except insofar as in any particular case it has expressly
waived its immunity’); Articles of Agreement of the Inter-
national Monetary Fund, Art. IX, §8, Dec. 27, 1945, 60
Stat. 1418, T. I. A. S. No. 1501 (MF enjoys “immunity
from every form of judicial process except to the extent
that it expressly waives its immunity’). Notably, the
IFC’s own charter does not state that the IFC is absolutely
immune from suit.

Nor is there good reason to think that restrictive im-
munity would expose international development banks to
excessive liability. As an initial matter, it is not clear that
the lending activity of all development banks qualifies as
commercial activity within the meaning of the FSIA. To
be considered “commercial,” an activity must be “the type”
of activity “by which a private party engages in” trade or
commerce. Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., 504
U.S. 607, 614 (1992); see 28 U.S.C. §1603(d). As the
Government suggested at oral argument, the lending
activity of at least some development banks, such as those
that make conditional loans to governments, may not
qualify as “commercial” under the FSIA. See Tr. of Oral
Arg. 27-80.

A story-centered curriculum is intended to teach cognitive pro-
cesses, not subjects. Subjects are, of course, covered, but they are not
really the point. Certain things need to be done again and again in
life, but those things can be learned only in context, not as an ab-
straction. Different contexts must be provided in order to motivate
students and to provide real-world skills that will be remembered, not
because they were studied and tested, but because they were practiced
again and again.

What is life like in a story-centered curriculum? The first ones we
built were built as master’s degree programs at Carnegie Mellon’s new
West Coast campus. Here is Max Soderby, a mentor in the first one of
those master’s programs, talking about his experience:

Iam almost jealous in a way because I see that they are gaining
skills more rapidly than I gained them when I was a student in
Pittsburgh at CMU’s campus. They get exposure to things that
we just talked about in a lecture hall, whereas they are actually
doing it: implementing actual software and putting designs
into practice. We mostly did homework and talked about it ina
lecture hall. So I am jealous in that respect. It is also a lot more
work, but that work pays off for the students.

Subject-based education is not really supposed to be training for work.
I once proposed to the president of Yale (Bart Giamatti) that we build
a master’s degree program in an area of computer science that would
help get people jobs after graduation. He said that that was training
and that Yale does not do training. The academic subjects taught at
Yale are meant to produce scholars. But, in a way, he was very wrong.
Yale does do training. Yale and almost all other colleges are divided
into departments, and a major in a department’s subject typically
is seen by the faculty as preparation for an academic career in that
subject.

The students may well have a different point of view, however.
Unfortunately, they come away disappointed. An English major could
be hoping to become a journalist, but the education that he will re-
ceive is more likely to be appropriate for creating an English profes-
sor. A math major may well want to be an actuary, but will not learn
actuarial science at Yale. He will learn to be a potential mathematics
professor. And, worst of all, in my own field of computer science, the

payroll (in addition to various levels of state unemployment insurance taxes) to
fund the Federal Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund.

e Funding = Pro-Cyclical — Rising employment increases revenue and reduces
benefit payments, generally leading to surpluses, while falling employment
reduces revenue and increases benefits payments, leading to periodically large
deficits during recessions.

Flexible at the State Level by Design — State governments set policies on
unemployment benefit eligibility / duration / tax levels, while federal government
provide financial and legal oversight.

Generally Break-Even — In 29 of the past 49 years, Federal unemployment

Provisions and
Protections

WHISTLEBLOWER PROVISIONS
AND PROTECTIONS

Assistance and information from a whistleblower who knows of possible secu-

rities law violations can be among the most powerful weapons in the law en-

forcement arsenal. Through their knowledge of the circumstances and individu-

als involved, whistleblowers can helo SEC and DOJ identify potential violations

much earlier than might otherwise have been possible, thus allowing SEC and

DOJ to minimize the harm to investors, better preserve the integrity of the

U.S. capital markets, and more swiftly hold accountable those responsible for

unlawful conduct.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank
Act of 2010 both contain provisions affecting whistleblow-
ers who report FCPA violations. Sarbanes-Oxley prohibits
issuers from retaliating against whistleblowers and provides
that employees who are retaliated against for reporting pos-
sible securities law violations may file a complaint with the
Department of Labor, for which they would be eligible to
receive reinstatement, back pay, and other compensation.”
Sarbanes-Oxley also prohibits retaliation against employee
whistleblowers under the obstruction of justice statute.*”!

In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act added Section 21F to

the Exchange Act, addressing whistleblower incentives and

protections. Section 21F authorizes SEC to provide mon-
etary awards to eligible individuals who voluntarily come
forward with high quality, original information that leads
to an SEC enforcement action in which over $1,000,000 in
sanctions is ordered. *” The awards range is between 10%
and 30% of the monetary sanctions recovered by the gov-
ernment. The Dodd-Frank Act also prohibits employers
from retaliating against whistleblowers and creates a private
right of action for employees who are retaliated against.*”*
Furthermore, businesses should be aware that retali-
ation against a whistleblower may also violate state, local,

and foreign laws that provide protection of whistleblowers.

Il. GOOD CAUSE EXISTS TO UNSEAL THE APPELLATE BRIEFS

The appellate briefs should be disclosed because they are highly relevant to the public’s
understanding of whether the Office of the Manhattan District Attorney ~ whose fundamental
mission is to protect the people of this State — initially showed undue deference to a dangerous
pedophile, who is unusually rich and well-connected.

New York Civil Rights Law section 50-b permits courts to disclose court documents
relating to the commission of a sexual offense whenever a showing is made that “good cause
exists for disclosure.” N.Y. Civ. Rights Law § 50-b. See also 22 NYCCR § 1250.1(e)(3)
(permitting the “unsealing [of] court records . . . upon good cause shown”). Good cause clearly
exists for disclosing the appellate briefs because they contain a full explanation for why the
District Attorney’s Office argued before the lower court that Epstein should be registered as a
level one sex offender before changing position on appeal. See Epsiein, 89 A.D. at 571, 933
N.Y.S.2d at 241. The appellate briefs may also shed light on the extent of “the evidence . . . that

circumstances not only fail to suggest Mr. Papadopoulos committed a crime, they reek of entrapment.
The source of this information, former Australian diplomat Alexander Downer, admits Mr.
Papadopolous never mentioned emails, destroying any reasonable inference of a connection between

the DNC hack and the Trump campaign.

Crossfire’s progenitors thus ignored an obvious question: If Russia promised unspecified dirt on Mrs.
Clinton but never delivered it, how would that amount to collusion with the Trump campaign? If
anything, such behavior suggests an attempt to entice and potentially embarrass Mr. Trump by

dangling the prospect of compromising information and getting his aides to jump at it.

Given the paucity of evidence, it’s staggering that the FBI would initiate a counterintelligence
investigation, led by politically biased staff, amid a presidential campaign. The aggressive methods and
subsequent leaking only strengthen that conclusion. If the FBI sincerely believed Trump associates
were Russian targets or agents, the proper response would have been to inform Mr. Trump so that he

could protect his campaign and the country.

Mr. Trump’s critics argue that the claim of political bias is belied by the fact that Crossfire was not
leaked before the election. In fact, there were vigorous, successful pre-election efforts to publicize the
Trump-Russia collusion narrative. Shortly after Crossfire’s launch, CIA Director John Brennan and Mr.
Comey briefed Congress, triggering predictable leaking. Christopher Steele and his patrons embarked

on a media roadshow, making their dossier something of an open secret in Washington.

On Aug. 29, 2016, the New York Times published a letter to Mr. Comey from Senate Minority Leader
Harry Reid, saying he’d learned of “evidence of a direct connection between the Russian government
and Donald Trump’s presidential campaign,” which had “employed a number of individuals with
significant and disturbing ties to Russia and the Kremlin.” On Aug. 30, the ranking Democratic
members of four House committees wrote a public letter to Mr. Comey requesting “that the FBI assess
whether connections between Trump campaign officials and Russian interests” may have contributed
to the DNC hack so as “to interfere with the U.S. presidential election.” On Sept. 23, Yahoo News’s
Michael Isikoff reported the Hill briefings and the Steele dossier’s allegations regarding Carter Page.
On Oct. 30, Harry Reid again publicly wrote Mr. Comey: “In my communications with you and other
top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive
information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian

government.”

Teaching Minds

Britannica, if you will. It would be filled with knowledge from experts
that had been vetted by other experts and delivered seamlessly with-
out your having to search for it. You don’t need to bea scholar in order
to make reasoned decisions. You just need to know how to find infor-
mation to help you think things out well. This means that learning
to think clearly and knowing how to assess the value of new evidence
that one has found, must be the main goal of any school system.
When does school start to falter? One way to think about school
is to ask about the significance and age-related properties of each of
the cognitive processes. Let’s see if we can rank the processes in terms

of age.

Which of these processes would we expect a child who was

entering school to already be able to do? To put this another way, a
normal 5-year-old:

1.

11.

12,

can make some accurate predictions about very simple
things, like where his mother might be and what she might
be doing and what will be on television

would have trouble modeling any process

has a limited sense of evaluation but knows what he likes
would be able to experiment with simple things like food and
toys

might be able to do limited diagnosis of what might have
gone wrong in a process, but it typically would be limited to
explanations that he had heard from someone else

might be able to do limited planning based on plans that had
been used before

might know something about causation because he would
have been told about it and remembered what he had been
told

can make some judgments based on his own tastes and what
he has been taught about what is good and what is bad

can do some describing, but typically is not at all good at it

. should be able to influence some people, especially his

grandparents

should be able to work in a simple team together with kids
his own age toward a goal

should be able to do some simple negotiation, especially with
his parents, siblings, and some friends

Dershowitz Goes Off on Woman Who Made Underage Sex
Allegations: ‘She Should Be Seriously Punished’

by Ronn Blitzer | 2:26 pm, December 4th, 2018

OR ee ee et ee ee et

Just hours after convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein agreed to settle
a civil case brought against him by attorney Bradley

Edwards, Epstein’s lawyer from his past criminal case, Alan
Dershowitz, discussed his former client on the Law&Crime Network.
Epstein was accused of trafficking more than 40 underage girls for
sex, and one such girl claimed Dershowitz himself had sex with her
when she was underage.

Dershowitz vehemently denies the claim, telling host Brian Ross that
accuser Virginia Roberts is a “certified, complete, total liar,” and that
her allegations are a “complete and total fabrication.” He also added
that she should be punished by the law for what she did.

The Harvard Law Professor Emeritus noted that Roberts’ allegations
were eventually withdrawn, and that the FBI recognized the
evidence showed he was not where she said he was. He pointed to
documented evidence that proves he is innocent.

“| can prove conclusively that she made the whole thing up,”
Dershowitz said, citing travel records that he says prove where he
was at the time she claims she had sex with him. “It’s conclusive,
conclusive evidence.”

“More importantly, | can prove where | wasn't,” he said, after stating
outright, “Never met her, don’t know who she is, never heard of her.”

Similarly, Dershowitz said that Roberts claimed that notable figures
such as Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and Tipper Gore were present on an

1992, a 15-year-old Israeli schoolgirl named Helena Rapp was on her way to
catch the bus to school south of Tel Aviv, when another Gazan stabbed her to
death. To the extent Israelis were looking for someone to blame, there were
obvious candidates. The army, the primary defense against the intifada, was
one. The police even more so, since many of the attacks were now taking place
inside Israel. And in ugly rioting after Helena Rapp’s murder, bands of Israelis
took to the streets, some of them yelling: “Death to the Arabs’. Still, most
people understood that criticizing the army or the police, or going on a rampage
against “the Arabs” — hundreds of thousands of whom were Israeli citizens and
had lived among us since the birth of the state — would not help. Most, in fact,
placed the blame, and lodged their hopes, with the government.

By the time of the next election, in June 1992, the combination of Palestinian
violence and the still-traumatic memories of Saddam’s Scuds, left Israelis
doubtful that Shamir could fulfil the most basic responsibility of government:
ensuring their day-to-day security. Labor had once again placed its electoral
fortunes in the hands of Yitzhak Rabin, following Peres’s several failed
attempts to lead the party back into power. Knowing that Rabin had a record of
military command unmatched in Israeli politics, Labor strategists did not so
much need to convince voters as to reinforce their fears and frustrations. One of
the campaign slogans, a direct appeal to the anger over the stabbing of Helena
Rapp, was “Get Gaza out of Tel Aviv!” Labor ended up gaining five Knesset
seats, and now had 44. The Likud lost eight and was left with only 32.

That meant that my last three years as chief of staff would be with Rabin
back as Prime Minister — and, like Ben-Gurion before him, as Defense Minister
as well. He and I had been in touch only occasionally since his departure from
the unity-coalition government two years earlier. But I had, of course, spoken
with him after my appointment as ramatkal, in which he’d played an important
part. Though he was 20 years older than me, our relationship had become
steadily closer over the years, especially when I’d worked with him as Defense
Minister. In some ways, we were alike. We’d both been forged by Labor
Zionism. We were career military officers, uncomfortable with flights of
political rhetoric and convinced that Israel’s security and its future depended
less on words than on action. In large groups especially, both of us tended to be
men of a few words. Over the next few years, we would become even closer,
speaking not only in the kirya or at Yitzhak’s office in Jerusalem, but also, with
Nava and Leah, around the dinner table at Rabin’s apartment in Tel Aviv.

Snowden’s Trail: Hong Kong, 2014

T NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, or, as it is now commonly
called, the NSA, was created on October 24, 1952, in such a tight
cocoon of secrecy that even the presidential order creating it was
classified top secret. When journalists asked questions about this
new agency, Washington officials jokingly told them that the initials
NSA stood for “No Such Agency.” The reason for this extraordinary
stealth is that the NSA is involved in a very sensitive enterprise.
Its job is to intercept, decode, and analyze foreign electronic com-
munications transmitted around the globe over copper wires, fiber-
optic cable, satellite, microwave relays, cell phone towers, wireless
transmissions, and the Internet for specified intelligence purposes. In
intelligence jargon, its product is called COMINT, which stands for
communications intelligence. Because this form of intelligence gath-
ering is most effective when the NSA’s targets are unaware of the
state-of-the-art tools the NSA uses to break into their computers
and telecommunications channels to first intercept and then decrypt

land with which Cromwell would pay his troops, and then got Parliament's approval
to invest in that high-risk land to make a fortune. It is rare for a man of practical gifts
to be a deep thinker too. Petty, like my father, was both. His Verbum Sapienti of 1664
was first to apply the ancient capitalization formula to both factors, meaning
workers as well as tradeable things, and so originated the concept of human capital
as present value. He applied this insight there and his Political Arithmetick in 1676,
and again in The Total Wealth of England in 1683, to measure the total wealth of
England including human capital. That makes him the father of national accounts.

But his greatest achievements, I think came in A Treatise of Taxes.

Chapter 4, paragraph 9 of that book begins with

19. Having found the Rent or value of the usus fructus per annum, the
question is, how many years purchase (as we usually say) is the Fee simple
naturally worth? If we say an infinite number, then an Acre of Land would be
equal in value to a thousand Acres of the same Land; which is absurd, an
infinity of unites being equal to an infinity of thousands.

Petty clearly recognizes that time preference, meaning our taste for impatience,
explains productivity, or ratio of output to capital, rather than the other way around.
This powerful and counterintuitive insight is usually credited to Boehm Bawerk in
1889, who showed that it is true for man-made things as well as land. The utility or
usus fructus being a given, we bid less for the land or other capital producing it if we
are less patient, and more if more. Bidding less for this denominator of rate of return
bids that rate itself up if the numerator is a given, and conversely. That’s why riskier
assets offer higher return. Petty’s reductio ad absurdam of a hypothesis of infinite
patience is obvious in hindsight, but may not have been written down before. Petty

without anyone else realizing that it had been stolen. It intrigued him enough for him to bring it to
the attention of his superiors, as he later said. Snowden saw that a rogue system administrator like
himself could use his computer privileges to download and steal documents in ways that would go
unnoticed. The emergence of a rogue system administrator was not that farfetched in 2009.
Hacktavists such as Julian Assange had adopted the battle cry: system administrators, or “syst
admins of the world unite.” Instead of asking them to “throw off their chains,” as Marx did, he
asked them to send classified documents about secret government activity to the Wikileaks site.
Snowden recalled in Moscow in 2014: “I actually recommended they [the NSA] move to two-
man control for administrative access back in 2009.” To make his point even clearer, he added:
“A whistleblower could use these things, but so could a spy.” Not without irony, Snowden
himself became that rogue system administrator some three years later at Dell. In fact, he later
used the vulnerability he pointed out to steal NSA documents at Dell (before moving to Booz
Allen.).

In September 2009, Snowden made a ten day trip to India. He later said he was on an official
visit “working at the US embassy.” He was still on the Dell payroll. Hotel records show that he
arrived at the Hyatt Regency hotel in New Delhi on September 2™ from Japan, and at 3:30 pm on
September 3, checked into the Koenig Inn, a facility that was an annex to Koenig Solutions, a
school that gave crash courses on programming and computer hacking. According to Rohit
Aggarwal, the head of the school, Snowden stayed there until September 10 while taking classes
with a private instructor. It cost $2,000 in tuition and fees, which Snowden prepaid from Japan
with his own personal credit card. Even though Snowden later said he only took courses in
“programming,” the school’s records show that during that week he took intensive courses in
sophisticated hacking techniques. Although the course was entitled “ethical hacking” that was
also a euphemism for teaching the techniques of illicit hacking. The course provided tutoring on
hacker’s tools, such as “Spyeye” and “ZeuS,” that are used to circumvent security procedures. It
also demonstrated how these hacking tools could be customized by criminals and spies to break
into files, plant surveillance programs, impersonate system administrators, assume the privileges
of system administrators in a network, and capture the passwords of others. On September 11,
Snowden, according to hotel records, left India for Japan. While the stated purpose of the
hacking training was to allow security consultants to detect intruders, it also prepared Snowden
to be, if he chooses to be, an intruder in the NSA system.

One problem with working as a contractor is that the standard two-year contracts are not
necessarily renewed, making a contractor’s job essentially temporary employment. Nor is there
much possibility for advancement for IT workers. As one contractor told me “It is a dead end job
with great pay.” In the fall of 2010, Snowden’s contract in Japan with Dell SecureWorks came
to anend. Dell then offered Snowden a new position in the United States.

He now was assigned to work at Dell headquarters in Annapolis, Maryland. He rented a modest
suburban house shaded by a Sakura cherry tree in suburb of Annapolis, Maryland. Mills

the emails identified himself as a privacy advocate, which was also how Greenwald often
identified himself in his speeches. He also echoed other concerns Greenwald had publicly
expressed including defending American privacy from government intrusions.

Snowden promised the leaks he would supply would provide dramatic results. He asserted in
his email that the “shock” of the documents he would give Greenwald would result in the public’s
learning about the secret “mechanisms through which our privacy is violated.” According to
Snowden’s assessment, following that initial uproar, they could achieve another objective in their
common cause. “We can guarantee for all people equal protection against unreasonable search,”
he wrote. In light of this convergence of views, it is not surprising that Greenwald was fully
convinced of Citizen 4’s bona fides. He said to Poitras, “He’s real,” and he agreed to help break
the story in the Guardian.

After he said he was onboard the project, Poitras revealed to Greenwald that Citizen 4 would
deliver an entire trove of secret documents to them in six to eight weeks. According to this
timetable, the Greenwald’s scoop, and the “shock” Citizen 4 promised, would come in early to
mid June 2013.

At this point in late April, Snowden was in full control. Although his day job at Dell involved
endlessly monitoring largely-meaningless encrypted numbers in the NSA tunnel, he had been able
to get three major journalists to react favorably to his proposal. None of them knew his name,
position, age, location or where he precisely where he worked. Nor did they know the means by
which he planned to obtain the secrets that he dangled before them. They also did not know
where, or even if, they would meet their source. Their total knowledge about him was the
description he gave of himself: a “senior government employee in the intelligence community”
(which, as they only later would find out, was untrue.) For his part, Greenwald speculated that he
was a disgruntled CIA station chief. Yet by his anonymous emails, and by tugging at their strings,
he had lined up three journalists to break his story.

Despite the fact they were operating largely in the dark, these three journalists acted like almost
any other ambitious reporter would act if they were offered a major scoop about illegal acts of the
government. In addition, the information was in line with what they had previously investigated or
written about. None of these journalists had any reason to doubt at this point that their
anonymous source was anything but the sincere whistle-blower that he claimed to be. They could
not have known from his anonymous emails that, aside from the whistle-blowing documents he
promised them, he was in the process of stealing a large number of documents from the NSA’s
National Threat Operations Center that concerned the NSA’s sources and methods in foreign
countries. These documents, to which Snowden never referred in his correspondence with them,
had little, if anything at all, to do with domestic spying on American citizens.

window. He was pointing a pistol at us. He seemed to be in his late 20s or early
30s. He had dark hair and a moustache and the hint of a stubbly beard. We
stopped beside the generator. I got out and walked toward the cockpit, halting
about 10 feet away. Looking up the hijacker, I made a conscious effort to appear
curious rather than worried. His eyes seemed a mix of intense focus and tension.
I opened the front of my overalls. Because of the heat, I was wearing nothing
else on top. He nodded his head to signal he was satisfied. I refastened the
overalls and moved off. One by one, the other men passed inspection. Then we
went back and brought the two smaller ladders to the side of each wing, and the
“mechanics” set down to work. I delayed bringing in the large ladders so as to
minimize any risk of arousing the terrorists’ suspicions.

The fact that at least so far they seemed to suspect nothing was in large part
down to Dayan’s misdirection plan. As we began working on the plane, the
“Palestinian” prisoners were disembarking from buses about 300 yards away.
As Rifa’at watched, several hundred men formed long rows. A few of them
waved in his direction. The Boeing which was theoretically going to take them
on to Cairo, to be followed by the Sabena jet minus the hostages, was being
towed into position.

One by one, our assault teams were moving into place. All that remained
was for me to give a short, sharp whistle and the attack would begin. Yet just as
I was raising my fingers to my mouth, I saw Bibi coming toward me from under
the fuselage. He motioned to me to wait. Zur, the last of our air marshals, had a
problem. Having spent 10 hours in the air on the way back to Israel, before
being immediately plugged into an assault team, he had something to attend to.
“He has to take a shit,” Bibi said. Can’t it wait, I asked. No, was the answer. So
I said OK, leading to the most surreal “operational” moment I would witness
during all my years in the military.

The “prisoner release” was now in full flow. Dozens of military vehicles,
and a small army of fire engines and ambulances, had also pulled to the far end
of the runway, out of sight of the hijackers, in case our attack on the Sabena jet
went wrong. Tel Aviv hospitals were on alert. And Zur was crouching and

increased acres along with higher costs for seed from increased seed demand. We also
see a lack of best practices for cultivation, storage restrictions and uncertainty about
the consistency of seeds/clones available increasing the probability that yields are

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030325.txt,"But whatever the caveats about the bonds, the potential for improving the government’s performance is
obviously huge. That’s true in education, health care, criminal justice and many other areas.

A recent review found that 10 major social programs had been rigorously evaluated over the past two decades,
using the scientific gold standard of random assignment. Only one of the 10 — Early Head Start, for infants,
toddlers pregnant women — was a clear success. Yet all 10 still exist, and largely in their original form.

Jon Baron, the president of the Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy in Washington, points out that the social
problems addressed by antipoverty programs have not gotten much better in years. School test scores have
barely changed. College graduation rates for low-income students have stagnated. The poverty rate is as high as
it was in 1981. Median household income is lower than it was in 1998.

“If we just keep funding social programs the way we have been,” Mr. Baron says, “there’s not a lot of reason to
think we'll have much success.”

The Obama administration’s seven pilot programs would create bonds for, among other areas, job training,
education, juvenile justice and care of children’s disabilities. Nonprofit groups like Social Finance could apply.
So could for-profit companies, said the White House official, who asked not to be named because the president
had not yet released next year’s budget. The $100 million for the bonds would come out of the budgets of other
programs, to stay consistent with Mr. Obama’s announced freeze on non-security spending.

Officials in Massachusetts and New York are looking at similar ideas but have not yet decided whether they
will issue bonds.

Beyond the impact of any single program, the bonds have the potential to nudge all government agencies to pay
more attention to results. Mr. Obama, after all, campaigned as a reformer who wanted to create a sleek, efficient
“iPod government.” He has had some success, like the expansion of a program — backed by years of solid
evidence — in which nurses go to the homes of new at-risk parents to counsel them.

Over all, though, the administration has not done enough to improve government efficiency. Put it this way: If
someone asked you how Mr. Obama had made government work better, would you have an answer?

Making government work better will be all the more important in the years ahead. The free market is not going
to solve many of our biggest problems, be it stagnant pay or spotty medical care. And government — in
Washington and locally — is going to be financially squeezed for a long time.

There never was a good excuse for wasting billions of taxpayer dollars on programs that didn’t work. But now,
especially, there’s no excuse.

they are not in the business of teaching. And governments, to succeed with change, must
be in the business of educating the community.

“Our Labor governments have failed to conceptualise the changes. We need a
framework.

“What is the framework? It is ‘Australia in Transition’ strategically and economically.
That's the story we have to present.

| think the Australian people are very conscientious. During the 1980s and 1990s we
proved they will respond conscientiously to necessary reforms. They mighin't like them
but they'll accept them. But reforms have to be presented in a digestible format.

| know that in the age of the internet, opinion and perpetual static it is difficult to get the
message over. | accept that. But the big messages have their own momentum. If we get
the story of transition right then other things will find their place.

Our problem is what | call shooting-star policies. We have a policy on carbon pricing, on
minerals, on boatpeople, but they are not connected up to the big picture about
Australia's direction and its transition.

Pressed on whether he thinks the Australian Labor Party is in permanent decline, Keating
defends Labor, insists it doesn't have to decline but highlights the problem. Labor must
recognise what it has created, he says, invoking the Hawke-Keating era. It has a
created a new society and it has to be the party of the new society.

It can't be the party of part of the old society. Labor must be the party of those people
who gained from the pro-market growth economy that we created. Labor must be open to
the influences of this middle class, to people on higher incomes. And | don't think it is.

It is, perhaps, the clearest statement of Labor's problem. The party, in an act of strategic
folly, abandoned the path of its previous success. It turned inwards on itself, away from
the community.

At the operating level it's become the party of insiders, Keating says. The problem is
that members get too caught up in the gift of faction managers and they get caught up in
the false construct of popularity, the false god.

Fixated by the nature of political leadership, Keating's book After Words shouts out: The
great curse of modern political life is incrementalism.

Leaning across the table he says to me that briefing notes and economic texts aren't
enough: the leader must locate his own source of higher command and inner belief. He
laments the efforts of US President Barak Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel
in the teeth of contemporary challenges.

“There is nothing preordained about American decline any more than the European
project is destined to fail, he writes.

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011729.txt,"Yet as I approached my final year as chief of staff in early 1994, we were
suddenly confronted by an appalling act of /sraeli violence: mass murder,
committed by a West Bank settler. Terrorism, no less than the worst Arab
attacks on Israeli civilians. The settler was named Baruch Goldstein, a
physician, who lived in Kiryat Arba. One of the first post-1967 Jewish
settlements, it sat on a hill outside the West Bank town of Hebron. At the heart
of Hebron lay the burial place of the patriarchs and matriarchs of the Jewish
faith: Abraham and Sarah; Isaac and Rebecca; Jacob and Leah. Since Abraham
is also revered as a prophet in Islam and a mosque had stood on the site for
nearly a thousand years, our post-1967 arrangements set out separate times of
worship for Muslims and Jews. Goldstein chose to attack during a holiday
period for both faiths: Purim for the Jews and the Muslim holy month of
Ramadan. He arrived shortly after the Muslims’ Friday prayers began on the
morning on February 25. He was dressed in his reserve army uniform and was
carrying an automatic rifle. He opened fire on a group of nearly 800 Palestinian
worshipers. He had killed 29 and wounded 125 others by the time several of his
intended victims knocked him unconscious and beat him to death.

I rushed to Sde Dov airport in north Tel Aviv, a few minutes from the kirya,
and boarded a helicopter for the old British fort near Hebron, used by the
Jordanians until 1967 and now Israeli headquarters. After visiting the scene of
the killings, I sought out local Palestinian leaders, to voice my condolences and
the sense of outrage I shared over what had happened, and to urge them to do all
they could to maintain calm. I then went to Kiryat Arba and conveyed the same
message.

Our immediate task was to prevent more deaths, on either side. It was a
frustrating, and violent, week. Protests reminiscent of the first days of the
intifada erupted around the West Bank, in Gaza, in east Jerusalem and in several
Arab neighborhoods and towns inside Israel. While I had no trouble
understanding the Palestinians’ anger, I also had a responsibility to prevent the
violence spiraling out of control. We turned to the same tools we’d used at the
beginning of the uprising — though with even greater emphasis on the need for
soldiers to use the only the necessary force to restore order, and to avoid causing
fatalities wherever possible. We closed off the West Bank. We imposed curfews

My name is Leah Reis-Dennis, and I'll be heading operations for Lisa's new non-profit, Verse Video Education. 
She's asked me to be in touch with you about helping us get a release from Woody Allen. 
First, I wanted to send along the rough stringout of footage from the conversation with Woody a couple of years 
ago on This is Just to Say by William Carlos Williams. This is totally unedited and uncut footage, but we 
would love the opportunity to turn it into something great. 
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cObnljj xeo0654g/uWZ6KBVbLS?preview=WoodyAllen+Basic+Clip+for+Viewing.mov  
If Woody Allen agrees to let us use the footage, he will be in distinguished company. To date, we have filmed 
conversations about poetry with dozens of distinguished Americans including: 
Bill Clinton 
Al Gore 
John McCain 
Mayor Rahm Emanuel 
Mayor Tom Menino 
Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan 
Sir Mervyn King 
Former Secretary of the Treasury Larry Summers 
The conversation would be part of a large multiplatform initiative that Harvard Professor Lisa New has under 
way to bring poetry into the mainstream, and, especially, into English Language Arts classrooms in the United 
States and around the world. The initiative, Poetry in America, includes a HarvardX online course, a television 
series we're creating with WGBH to be paired with PBS LearningMedia segments for the classroom, and, a 
series of online professional development courses we're creating for ELA Middle and High School teachers and 
for their students. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029839 
Let us know if Woody Allen might be open to our sending another release form his way. Of course, if he's 
interested in releasing the footage for only certain parts of our project, we're open to having a conversation 
about that, too. 
Thank you, and I hope to meet you soon. 
Best, Leah

whole world.

On the other hand, Chancellor Merkel is the archetypal worry-wart. She does not lead; she assesses.

You really wonder why leaders want these jobs when they really do not want to lead. And what is their risk? That
Barack Obama will not get a second term? Or that Angela Merkel's coalition might finally end up on the rocks? If
they actually made the leap they might astound themselves. Because, in the end, everyone in political life gets
carried out - the only relevant question is whether the pallbearers will be crying.

For Keating, the 20th-century leader exerting most influence on the coming century is China's Deng Xiaoping.

If you look at the other figures of the century, Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin and Mao, none will leave the legacy in
terms of the 21st century that Deng leaves,” he says. He walked away from the ideology of the Communist Party
just as effectively as Mikhail Gorbachev walked away from the essence of the Soviet Union.

By 2050 Keating sees a world order with nations in terms of gross domestic product in this hierarchy: (1) China, (2)
US, (3) India, (4) Japan, (5) Brazil, (6) Russia, (7) Britain, (8) Germany, (9) France and (10) Italy.

The key, however, is that Japan lags a distant fourth behind the top three.

On America, Keating is dismayed by the pivotal change in its outlook after the end of the Cold War. When the
Berlin Wall came down the Americans cried victory and walked off the field, he says.

Yet the end of the Cold War offered the chance for America to develop a new world order. It didn't know what to do
with its victory. This at the moment the US should have begun exploiting the opportunity of establishing a new world
order to embrace open regionalism and the inclusion of great states like China, India and the then loitering Russia.

Well, frankly, the US didn't have the wisdom. It just wanted to celebrate its peace dividend. The two Clinton terms
and the two George W. Bush terms, that's four presidential terms, have cost US mightily.”

For Keating, the malaise in US politics is the problem. He says: The most compelling thing I've seen in years is that
in the great burst of American productivity between 1990 and 2008, of that massive increment to national income,
none of it went to wages. By contrast, in Australia real wages over the same period had risen by 30 per cent.
Keating sees this as the breakdown of America's national compact, the shattering of its prosperity deal. He says
American conservatives abandoned the middle ground represented by Republican presidents such as Dwight D.
Eisenhower, Richard Nixon and Bush Sr and became radicals. The derailment, he argues, began under Ronald
Reagan and reached its zenith under George W. Bush.

With the goodwill gone the US “is not able to produce a medium-term credible fiscal trajectory or get agreement on
rebuilding its infrastructure”. This paralysis “is significant not just for the US but for the world.

Keating links the collapse of this prosperity compact to the financial crisis. Too many Americans were unable to
sustain themselves from wages and salaries.

How did they get by? They used the easy credit of the banking system, thereby feeding the frenzy that ended in bad
loans and meltdown.

Keating's book has an abiding message for Australia: in the transformed world we “will find ourselves increasingly
on our own having to master our own destiny.

The job is to rediscover the productivity and savings agenda of the 1990s. Why did Australia survive the 2008
financial crisis? Because of the flexibility of the economy, Keating says. Flexibility which came from the reform of
Australia's financial, product and labour markets that began 25 years ago. This has given us one of the most flexible
economies in the world - arguably the most flexible. But further structural changes are ahead of us.

Maxwell’s lawyer, Laura Menninger, declined to comment, referring the Herald to the court history.

“{Roberts] fabricated a story of abuse at the hands of Ms. Maxwell in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars from British tabloids with a motive

for selling papers and advertisements and without regard for truth, veracity or substantiation,” Menninger noted in a 2016 response filed in the case.

In February, the Miami Herald filed a federal court motion in the Southern District of New York, seeking access to documents that were sealed in the
Maxwell case. The motion, which was not opposed by Roberts, could have cast light on the full scope of Epstein’s possible sex trafficking operation, who
was involved and whether it was covered up. Maxwell has opposed the Herald’s motion, which was denied in August.

The Herald is appealing.

Today, Epstein has a new private jet, which takes him around the world. Flight records show that he spends most of his time on his private island, Little St.
James in the U.S. Virgin Islands, which he now lists as his permanent residence. He is registered in New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands as a sex offender.

New Mexico, where he owns a sprawling ranch, does not list him as a convicted sex offender.

As part of its investigation, the Herald learned that in 2013, the federal government conceded that it had given Epstein what it called “valuable
consideration” for information he provided to the FBI as part of his plea deal. The documents do not elaborate, but Epstein — a hedge fund manager who
once worked for the investment firm Bear Stearns — was listed as a key investor who lost money in the financial crash of 2008.

Francey Hakes, a former federal child sex crimes prosecutor, said any consideration the government gave to Epstein should be made public.

“The public has a right to know why he gota slap on the wrist, and what was the interest that was so great that allowed him to not get prosecuted?”

sure my men had practiced climbing up on the wings and forcing open the
doors, and another hour for preparations and briefings for the teams who would
be participating in the operation. “By about half an hour after midnight, we’ll be
ready to deploy,” I said, though from his stoic, nearly silent response I couldn’t
be sure whether he was in favor of an assault. “By 0100, we’ll be ready to act.”

Both of us went back to see Dado. He seemed encouraged, especially when I
said we’d be ready to move by one in the morning. He told me the pilot of the
plane had been in contact with the control tower. He was an RAF veteran and,
though the terrorists seemed unaware of this, he was also Jewish. The hijackers
were demanding more than 300 Arab prisoners be released and flown to Cairo.
“And they seem quite nervous.”

Returning to the hangar, I sent Shai Agmon with four soldiers to set up a
lookout and sniper post about 70 yards to the side of the Sabena jet. I told him
not to open fire unless they were sure there had been shooting inside the plane
and could positively identify an armed hijacker. By now, we had three dozen
soldiers and officers, including Uzi Dayan and his full team. I took all those
who were already briefed and divided them into four groups, each with an
officer and five soldiers and assigned to deal with one of the wing doors. I left
the others to continue training.

When midnight came, I was far from certain we could meet the 12:30 am
deployment target I’d given Talik. Incoming flights had stopped for the night,
and we still hadn’t managed to bring in any air marshals. I believed they would
give us a crucial advantage. They knew Berettas. They also knew the inside of a
707. But I was worried about losing Dado’s trust in a sayeret operation if we
failed to meet the timeline. From Shai’s lookout post to the side of the plane, I
learned that the front cabin door of the plane was open. He said he’d seen a
couple of hijackers walking by it, silhouetted by the dim cabin light. But
otherwise, there was no sign of activity inside. I called Talik and told him I was
taking my assault teams to the area behind the plane. About a half-hour later, I
confirmed we were ready to begin the operation. Although the plane’s engines
were off now, our approach had been masked by the drone of the generator
brought in to supply power to the cabin. We were lying face-down on the
tarmac, directly behind the tail of the plane but well back. Two rows of 12 men,
plus me and a soldier in charge of the communications. We’d brought along
four small ladders to help us onto the wings. “We want to exploit the darkness,
and the sound of the generator, to cover us,” I said in my final briefing before

- The Science Of CBD (Nadeau)

The Endocannabinoid System

Cannabis’ therapeutic potential is due to this valuable overlap between
phytocannabinoids (i.e. plant-derived cannabinoids) and the endogenous cannabinoid
system in humans, termed a “therapeutic handshake.” However, though THC’s activity in
the body has been fairly well elucidated (it acts through G-protein coupled cannabinoid
receptor 1 and cannabinoid receptor 2), CBD’s pharmacokinetics are less well
understood (no specific receptor for CBD has been identified).

The scientific understanding of CBD’s clinical effects is based mostly on studies in
specific indications, like epilepsy. GW Pharma’s Epidiolex (highly potent, pure
formulation of CBD) was approved by the FDA in 2018 for the treatment of seizures
associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, and other companies
(Tilray, MMJ Phytotech, Insys) have clinical trials underway in seizure disorders as well.
Additional possible indications for CBD products include autism spectrum disorders,
psychiatric conditions, diabetic neuropathy pain, fibromyalgia, chronic pain, and back
pain; clinical trials in these indications are underway.

Clinical trial results to date demonstrate few adverse effects from oral CBD doses of up
to 1500 mg/day or up to 30mg IV. Specifically, CBD studies have not reported effects on
blood pressure, heart rate, or respiratory rate, and no negative changes in mood or
psychomotor slowing. Some studies (such as GW’s in Epidiolex) have shown side effects
resulting from high doses of CBD (~2g/day) inhibiting hepatic drug metabolism,
prompting increased blood levels of some background medications. Additionally, in vitro
studies have shown CBD to be pro-apoptotic in lymphocytes and to inhibit IL8 and IL10
production, suggesting that it may suppress the immune system. However, though
unknowns remain, the summation of pre-clinical and clinical data suggest that the
compound is safe at typical doses seen in over the counter products (5-10mg).

—

Additionally, other cannabinoids (found in CBD distillate) have been discovered that may
have differentiated pharmacological effects. For example, cannabidivarin (CBDV) may
have differentiated anticonvulsant effects, tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) may have
anti-diabetic and appetite suppressant effects, cannabidiol-acid (CBDA) may have anti-
nausea effects, and bannabigerol (CBG) may have anti-cancer effects. Further research
is needed to elucidate the clinical effects of these compounds.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012926.txt,"10 1 Introduction

This ties in with the ideas of many other thinkers, including Jeff Hawkins’ “memory/ predic-
tion” theory [B06], and it also speaks directly to the formal characterization of intelligence
presented in Chapter 7: general intelligence as “the ability to achieve complex goals in complex
environments.”

Naturally the goals involved in the above phrase may be explicit or implicit to the intelligent
agent, and they may shift over time as the agent develops.

Perception is taken to mean pattern recognition: the recognition of (novel or familiar) pat-
terns in the environment or in the system itself. Memory is the storage of already-recognized
patterns, enabling recollection or regeneration of these patterns as needed. Action is the for-
mation of patterns in the body and world. Prediction is the utilization of temporal patterns to
guess what perceptions will be seen in the future, and what actions will achieve what effects in
the future — in essence, prediction consists of temporal pattern recognition, plus the (implicit
or explicit) assumption that the universe possesses a habitual tendency according to which
previously observed patterns continue to apply.

1.7.1 Memory and Cognition in CogPrime

Each of these five concepts has a lot of depth to it, and we won’t say too much about them in
this brief introductory overview; but we will take a little time to say something about memory
in particular.

As we'll see in Chapter 7, one of the things that the mathematical theory of general intelli-
gence makes clear is that, if you assume your AI system has a huge amount of computational
resources, then creating general intelligence is not a big trick. Given enough computing power,
a very brief and simple program can achieve any computable goal in any computable environ-
ment, quite effectively. Marcus Hutter’s AT XI design [Hut05] gives one way of doing this,
backed up by rigorous mathematics. Put informally, what this means is: the problem of AGI is
really a problem of coping with inadequate compute resources, just as the problem of natural
intelligence is really a problem of coping with inadequate energetic resources.

One of the key ideas underlying CogPrime is a principle called cognitive synergy, which
explains how real-world minds achieve general intelligence using limited resources, by appropri-
ately organizing and utilizing their memories.

This principle says that there are many different kinds of memory in the mind: sensory,
episodic, procedural, declarative, attentional, intentional. Each of them has certain learning
processes associated with it; for example, reasoning is associated with declarative memory.
Synergy arises here in the way the learning processes associated with each kind of memory have
got to help each other out when they get stuck, rather than working at cross-purposes.

Cognitive synergy is a fundamental principle of general intelligence — it doesn’t tend to play
a central role when you’re building narrow-AI systems.

In the CogPrime approach all the different kinds of memory are linked together in a single
meta-representation, a sort of combined semantic/neural network called the AtomSpace. It
represents everything from perceptions and actions to abstract relationships and concepts and
even a system’s model of itself and others. When specialized representations are used for other
types of knowledge (e.g. program trees for procedural knowledge, spatiotemporal hierarchies
for perceptual knowledge) then the knowledge stored outside the AtomSpace is represented via

Dear Mr. Epstein:

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Marlene Edme; I am the founder and President. .For above-
mentioned organization and Yair Fatal is the Project Director. The organization was founded in 2007 with the
mission of providing free technical skills in the garment industry to the people in the Southeastern department
of Haiti. Following the earthquake, the living and economic conditions are deplorable. More than ever,
CEFOTAJ wants to double its effort to help the community of Jacmel out of desperation by providing the youth
with valuable sustainable skills. With a trade under their belt, the youth will be more confident while seeking
employment.

We have obtained our 501 - C (3) in 2008 and have recently received the approval of the Haiti’s Department of
Planning to be a non-governmental organization (NGO). The organization’s building that will house the
school is currently under construction.

Based on our research, we found that you are very committed to helping Haiti. The purpose of this
correspondence is to solicit The Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation assistance with grant coordination and
facilitation to help our organization get off the ground. With potential help from the international community,
we believe that the project would be rewarding for the citizens of the city of Jacmel and in line with the
requirements of the Haiti Reconstruction Plan and President Obama recent legislation of the “Hope” law..
Please find enclosed a copy of the project which provides detailed information about the curriculum for the
different programs that the school will offer. We trust that you will find this to be an interesting project with

Frieze Art Fair 2010: Get ready for British art's biggest week

Frieze Art Fair is back — and it's bigger than ever, with 173 international galleries. Alice Jones looks forward to this
year's event and the week-long whirl of auctions, exhibitions and parties it brings to London

Friday, 8 October 2010

As always, the proof will be in the purchasing, but signs that confidence has returned to the market can already
be found in the buzz around the traditional run of Frieze week auctions. At Christie's, Hirst will be auctioned
alongside two works by Gerhard Richter (valued at up to £1m) and, hollow laugh, Andreas Gursky’s
photomontage of the New York Stock Exchange, last seen hanging in the boardroom at Lehman Brothers
(estimate: £100,000 — £150,000). Sotheby's has Jerry Hall's extraordinary collection up for sale — including work by
Frank Auerbach, Lucian Freud and Andy Warhol. And Phillips de Pury will hope to break the £1m mark with David
Hockney's Autumn Pool while Maurizio Cattelan's Una Domenica a Rivara, a rope of knotted bedsheets to hang
from a window, is estimated to sell at £400,000 to £600,000. Elsewhere, in a bold new addition to the landscape,
£20m-worth of art will go on sale in an 18th-century mansion part-owned by the Russian real-estate billionaire
Sergei Polonsky. The House of the Noble Man, a stone's throw from Frieze in Cornwall Terrace, is curated by
Victoria Golembiovskaya and the artist Wolfe von Lenkiewicz and will include four rare Picassos and Cezanne's
Don Quixote.

For all of these and more, the international arterati will descend on London next week, jetting in from the
traditional hot spots of New York, Berlin and Moscow, as well as from the emerging collector territories of the
Middle East, India and China for what is now known simply as Frieze week. It's no longer just about the fair; a
whole city's-worth of cultural activity has coalesced around those big white marquees. The breakfast views are
booked in, the big museum shows are up and the parties — from a Frieze week opener at the Groucho Club to the
ritzy annual Cartier dinner at Bar Boulud and ArtReview's Power 100 party at Sketch — are planned. After its initial
struggles, the hype-filled boom years and fear-filled bust years, Frieze is now firmly established, an unmissable
stop-off between Basel and Miami on the global art calendar. A decade ago, London didn't even have its own
contemporary art fair. Now, for five days in mid- October, the art set wouldn't dream of being anywhere else.

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021361.txt,"Second, God must be
experienced in relationship. Such
churches invite congregants to
experience God in their imaginations as
a person. Again, this violates a basic
psychological expectation: persons have
faces to observe and hands to shake.
Human relational interactions are based
on sensorial response. Churches like the
Vineyard explicitly suggest that one
should imagine a sensorial response
from God and encouraged congregants
to participate in a kind of let’s pretend
play in which God was present. The
pastor suggested one Sunday morning
that congregants should put out a second
cup of coffee for God, and sit down with
him to chat. People went on “date night”
with God. They would get a sandwich,
and sit down on park bench to talk with
God as they imagined his arm around
their shoulders. They would ask God
truly trivial questions like what shirt they
should wear in the morning and what
movie he thought they would like. These
behaviors were clearly play-like. One
congregant remarked: “I definitely do
that. When I can’t decide what to wear.
Like, God, what should I wear?” Then
she laughed. “And you know, then I kind
of forget about the fact that I asked God.
I think God cares about really, really
little things in my life. I mean I know
God cares, but I don’t expect him to tell
me what to wear. I’m like, Oh, I think
I'll wear that and forget I even asked
God!” This invitation to play was C.S.
Lewis’ explicit contribution to twentieth
century Christianity: “let us pretend to
turn the pretense into a reality.” In
churches which encourage such play,
heresy fades in importance. The pastors
and the committed congregants worry
about “deadness,” not flawed imagining.

Third, congregants must learn to
respond emotionally to God as if God is

real. If God is real, a Christian (at least,
the modern evangelical Christian) should
experience the emotions that one would
feel if one were loved unconditionally.
Most do not. It is, in fact, difficult for
humans to experience themselves as
unconditionally loved because no matter
how warm and loving a parent may be,
at some point the child is expected to
control his or her behavior and parental
love will becomes contingent. The task
of feeling unconditionally loved imposes
upon the congregant not only the burden
of identifying and relating to an invisible
being, but experiencing emotions in
response to that being’s love which the
congregant rarely, if ever, truly
experiences. Congregants talk about the
experience of unconditional love as rare:
they speak of “those moments” when
one really feels God’s love.

I was driving home from grocery
shopping in the car and I stopped at a
light and suddenly for no reason that I
could come up with, I was weeping and I
felt a massive and awesome sense of the
presence of God in the car with me. It
just came and I had absolutely no control
over it. I pulled over to the side of the
road—I remember thinking that I was so
in love with Jesus at that moment that no
one else on the planet could come close.
After about twenty minutes of real
intensity the feeling subsided somewhat,
but the presence of Jesus stayed with me.
I drove home not really ever able to fully
express what happened without sounding
like ’'d taken something illegal.

The more immediate aim seemed to be
to experience what Galatians 5:22-23
calls the “fruits of the spirit”: love, joy,
peace, patience and so forth. The social
life of the church was rich in emotional
practices which sought to reshape the

2014 that he was lied to about the actua/ purpose of Project Horizon: “[It]
was a study to determine the feasibility of constructing a science/military
based on the Moon. On June 8, 1959, a group of the Army Ballistic Missile
Agency (ABMA) produced for the U.S. Department of the Army a report
entitled Project Horizon, a U.S. Army Study for the Establishment of a
Lunar Military Outpost.

“The project proposal states the requirements as: The lunar outpost
is required to develop and protect potential United States interests on the
moon; to develop techniques in moon-based surveillance of the earth and
Space, in communications relay, and in operations on the surface of the
moon; to serve on a base for exploration of the moon, for further
exploration into space and for military operations on the moon if required;
and to support scientific investigations on the moon.”

communications to a bunch of hissing, empty phones. “Our communications were so
vulnerable,” Baran said, “that each missile base commander would face the dilemma
of either doing nothing in the event of a physical attack, or taking action that would
mean an all out irrevocable war.” You could, uneasily, picture the moment of
decision: Some Colonel alone in his bomb-laden plane over Europe or deep in some
cornfield missile silo wondering “Launch or not?”. This was a horrifying possibility.
Baran began to ask: Was there some other way to send a counter-strike signal?
There was a sense of life-saving preciousness in such a setting about connectivity
itself. To hold it, manage it, protect and control it - in the face of the extreme
pressures of a nuclear balance, such connection marked the difference between
safety and catastrophe.

You can, at the heart of many revolutions, find the warm hints of human psychology
pressing out. This is the roiling, unscratchable instinct for change that marks a really
revolutionary temperament - and that often is the only sort of personality that can
imagine and then deliver a solution to impossible problems. Conservatives like
things as they are, even if “as they are” is sometimes broken or dysfunctional or
dangerous. Revolutionaries are different. They don’t seem to choose their role. They
have a vision for how the world ought to be, a vibrating and instinctive picture of
power, and driven by passion or anger or faith or some wild genius, they chase that
vision relentlessly, even into madness. If they are lucky, however, they live in an age
where their crazy hopes catch onto some larger human hunger. Khomeini worried
that the Shah would never fall. Lenin was preparing to abandon revolutionary
politics in 1916. Jobs was told the iPhone could never be built as he wished. Then, in
an instant, revolution.

We might ask: What set Martin Luther on his revolutionary course to demand
instant access to God? Luther would tell you that his first inspiration had come to
him one night in the summer of 1505, while he was walking home in a
thunderstorm, when a lightning bolt landed a foot or two away.!°° Luther had been
struggling for years with an inner battle, with a tension between his faith and what
it demanded of him. Then, when that lightning cracked free from the storm, a
sensation of total terror was replaced by a new feeling. The nearness and power of
God snapped past him in that moment. It clarified everything. He dropped his law
studies the next day and within a year he was an Augustinian monk, preaching -
often hundreds of sermons a year, ever angrier, ever clearer — about the closeness of
God, the real, tangible, bolt-from-the-blue passage of faith to faith. He was totally,
completely converted.

in the year X, the year X-1, and the year X+1.

Note that for each n-gram in the corpus, we can provide three measures as a function of year of
publication:

1- the number of times it appeared
2- the number of pages where it appeared
3- the number of books where it appeared.

Throughout the paper, we make use only of the first measure; but the two others remain available. They
are generally all in agreement, but can denote distinct cultural effects. These distinctions are not explored
in this paper.

For example, we give in Appendix measures for the frequency of the word ‘evolution’. In the first three
columns, we give the number of times it appeared, the normalized number of times it appeared (relative
to #words that year), the normalized number of pages it appeared in, and the normalized number of
books it appeared in, as a function of the date.

III.1B. Multiple Query/Cohort Timelines

Where indicated, timeline plots may reflect the aggregates of multiple query results, such as a cohort of
individuals or inventions. In these cases, the raw data for each query we used to associate each year with
a set of frequencies. The plot was generated by choosing a measure of central tendency to characterize
the set of frequencies (either mean or median) and associating the resulting value with the corresponding
year.

Such methods can be confounded by the vast frequency differences among the various constituent
queries. For instance, the mean will tend to be dominated by the most frequent queries, which might be
several orders of magnitude more frequent than the least frequent queries. If the absolute frequency of
the various query results is not of interest, but only their relative change over time, then individual query
results may be normalized so that they yield a total of 1. This results in a probability mass function for
each query describing the likelihood that a random instance of a query derives from a particular year.
These probability mass functions may then be summed to characterize a set of multiple queries. This
approach eliminates bias due to inter-query differences in frequency, making the change over time in the
cohort easier to track.

IlI.2. Note on collection of historical and cultural data

In performing the analyses described in this paper, we frequently required additional curated datasets of
various cultural facts, such as dates of rule of various monarchs, lists of notable people and inventions,
and many others. We often used Wikipedia in the process of obtaining these lists. Where Wikipedia is
merely digitizing the content available in another source (for instance, the blacklists of Wolfgang
Hermann), we corrected the data using the original sources. In other cases this was not possible, but we
felt that the use of Wikipedia was justifiable given that (i) the data — including all prior versions - is publicly
available; (ii) it was created by third parties with no knowledge of our intended analyses; and (iii) the
specific statistical analyses performed using the data were robust to errors; i.e., they would be valid as
long as most of the information was accurate, even if some fraction of the underlying information was
wrong. (For instance, the aggregate analysis of treaty dates as compared to the timeline of the
corresponding treaty, shown in the control section, will work as long as most of the treaty names and
dates are accurate, even if some fraction of the records is erroneous.

We also used several datasets from the Encyclopedia Britannica, to confirm that our results were
unchanged when high-quality carefully curated data was used. For the lexicographic analyses, we relied
primarily on existing data from the American Heritage Dictionary.

We avoided doing manual annotation ourselves wherever possible, in an effort to avoid biasing the
results. When manual annotation had to be performed, such as in the classification of samples from our

Egyptian relationship is the same criticizing President Sisi. The Saudi-Egyptian relationship has a
strong and solid relationship in the deepest roots of the relations between the countries that are
not affected in any way. In the history of Egypt and Saudi Arabia, they always stand with each
other conditions and at all times. That situation did not change and there is no a situation of
negative attitude of the Egyptian government towards Saudi Arabia, and also, there is no a
situation of negative attitude of one of the Saudi government to the Egyptian government. Egypt
has not been delayed for a moment to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Saudi Arabia will not be
delayed for a moment to Egypt. This is a strong conviction between the leaders of the two
countries, but also between the people of both countries. Without a doubt, the enemies of Saudi
Arabia and Egypt will try to create rumors in one form or another, whether from Iranian
propaganda or the media of “Muslim brotherhood” propaganda to cause a rift in the Saudi-
Egyptian relationship, and the leadership of the two countries does not pay attention to these
polemics and trivialities.

* Your Highness has mentioned the subject of King Salman Bridge between the Kingdom and Egypt. Do
Your Highness bet on it?

- That is true, the working relevant teams have started working in the offices, not in front of the media
the bridge after the bridge has been approved. The results will be announced when laying the
foundation stone with full details, and the time of laying the foundation stone before 2020 without a
doubt.

* The islands. Have you finished the subject of islands?
- There were no problems with the islands originally.
* We heard the Egyptian media speaks about the subject that within the corridors of the courts?

- which occurred about a year ago is only a delimitation of the maritime boundaries. The islands are
registered with Egypt as a Saudi islands and they are registered with Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as Saudi
islands. And are also, registered in the international centers as Saudi islands. Only the demarcation of
the maritime borders has been done. Both Egypt and Saudi Arabia has not relinquished any part of their
territories. The demarcation of the border came for reasons of economic benefits that could be created
after the demarcation of these borders, especially the King Salman Bridge, oil supply, gas supplies,
power supply or train and roads that will target the port in North Sinai, and the exports of Gulf countries
to Europe.

* |s it possible to see in the future a direct dialogue with Iran, despite what it is doing in the region?

- How to reach an understanding with one who has the regime is firmly convinced that his system is
based on the ideology of extremism enshrined in the Constitution and stipulated in the command of
Khomeini that he must control the Muslims of the Islamic world and the dissemination of the doctrine of
Jaafari-Ethna Ashry ethnic of them throughout the Islamic world until the Mahdi appears. How can |
convince this person? What are the interests between me and him? When | have a problem with
another state, we start to solve it. For example, if there is an economic problem there is a continuation
of what you want and what we want and how we understand it. Or a political problem, for example with
Russia how to cooperate in Syria. What are your interests and what are mine. How do we cooperate in

the duty of the trial court [in considering whether to approve a jury trial waiver] is not to be discharged as a mere matter of rote,
but with sound and advised discretion, with an eye to avoid unreasonable or undue departures from that mode of trial or from
any of the essential elements thereof, and with a caution increasing in degree as the offenses dealt with increase in gravity. 716

This is a serious and weighty responsibility. 7!9

[*886] To discharge that serious and weighty responsibility, the trial court should receive as much information as possible.
The victim is often well situated to provide information about how the public will view a non-jury trial. The proposed rule
change takes the modest step of requiring the court to hear the victim before approving any non-jury trial, a step that is
consistent with the CVRA's command that victims be treated with fairness.

Importantly, this change would not interfere with defendants’ rights. The Supreme Court has squarely held that the defendant
lacks any constitutional right to unilaterally elect a bench trial. 72° Of course, in some circumstances, despite a victim's
objection, a non-jury trial nonetheless will be appropriate. Moreover, in extreme cases, the defendant may have a right to a non-
jury trial where pretrial publicity has pervasively tainted the jury pool. 72! Nothing in the proposed rule change would interfere
with a court's right to approve a bench trial in such circumstances, so long as the court considers the victim's perspective as part
of the approval process.

Rule 32(a) - Deleting Old Definition of Victim

The Proposal:

The definition of victim currently contained in Rule 32 should be stricken as follows:
Rule 32. Sentencing and Judgment

(a) Definitions. The following definitions apply under this rule:

(1) Crime of violence or sexual abuse means:

(A) a crime that involves the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against another's person or property; or

(B) a crime under /8 U.S.C. 2241-2248 or 2251-2257.
[*887]

(2) Victim means an individual against whom the defendant committed an offense for which the court will impose sentence.
The Rationale:

The old definition of victim in Rule 32 is now too narrow, as it is limited to crimes of violence or sexual abuse. The CVRA, in
contrast, includes all victims within its protections. In the proposed new rules, victim would be defined in Rule 1. 77?
Accordingly, the narrower definition found here can simply be eliminated. The Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules is well

Kurland, supra note 217, at 340-46 (urging that the rules be amended to create such a right, but not considering in any way the victim's
interests involved).

I See Singer, 380 U.S. at 37-38 (leaving this question open).

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015355.txt,"You don’ t see many porn sites that feature intercourse with
corpses, and if you do, how do you know they’ re really dead? But, say
what you will about California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, you have
to give him credit for signing a bill to forbid necrophilia. Under the new
law, sex with a corpse is now a felony punishable by up to eight years in
prison.

Age is no barrier. The state’ s first attempt to outlaw necrophilia--in
response to a case of a man charged with having sex with the corpse of a
4-year-old girl in Southern California---stalled in a legislative committee,
but the bill was revived after an unsuccessful prosecution of a man who
was found in a San Francisco funeral home, passed out on top of an
elderly woman’ s corpse.

Necrophiliacs have been getting away with it all this time, but
district attorneys will no longer be stymied by the lack of an official ban.
According to Tyler Ochoa, a professor at Santa Clara University of Law who
has studied California cases involving allegations of necrophilia,

“Prosecutors didn’ t have anything to charge these people with other
than breaking and entering. But if they worked in a mortuary in the first

place, prosecutors couldn’ t even charge them with that.”

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023881.txt,"How to Teach the Twelve Cognitive Processes 135

in every task they undertake. They must talk about and write about
what they do until the description process becomes second nature to
them. So, describing cannot be taught in and of itself. It must be part
and parcel of other events students undertake. Writing classes make
no sense, therefore. They exist because of the subject-based divisions
in school. Writing and speaking must be part of everything that is go-
ing on.

SUMMARY

Proficiency at all the cognitive processes depends on discovery and
being able to extrapolate from one’s experience about what has been
discovered. These processes depend strongly on prior cases, and prior
cases are best learned slowly in childhood. They also depend on an
analysis of those cases, which is best done with help from a teacher.
Discussion, reflection, and analysis of prior cases make one better able
to deal with new cases. New cases must be compared with old ones
in a way that helps one reason better from them. This comparison is
the basis of teaching analytic cognitive processes. Learning cognitive
processes means having prior experiences with events that are similar
to current events and being able to extrapolate from them. When we
go to a doctor, we want one who has seen our problem, and described
it to others, many times before. Only then can we detect the nuances
of difference that will determine an effective course of action.

Teaching cognitive processes means providing students with ex-
periences, hopefully each one more complex than the one before,
and helping students discuss those experiences and compare one with
another. Knowledge is experience, but it is experience that has been
analyzed so that it can be retrieved again just in time as needed. This
will happen only if we have thought about what we have experienced.

A teacher’s job, therefore, is to help provide the experiences and
to help the student reflect upon the significance of those experiences.
Good parents do this naturally. Good teachers would do it naturally as
well, if they were allowed to do so. Helping someone see the world in
a new way is pretty much what good teaching is all about.

the secrecy of internal deliberations a hallmark of his time in office,
divulges a number of conflicts with others in the inner circle.

He wrote that George J. Tenet, the director of the Central Intelligence
Agency, resigned in 2004 just “when the going got tough,” a decision
he calls “unfair to the president.” He wrote that he believes that
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell tried to undermine President Bush
by privately expressing doubts about the Iraq war, and he confirms
that he pushed to have Mr. Powell removed from the cabinet after the
2004 election. “It was as though he thought the proper way to express
his views was by criticizing administration policy to people outside
the government,” Mr. Cheney writes. His resignation “was for the
best.”

He faults former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice for naiveté in
the efforts to forge anuclear weapons agreement with North Korea,
and Mr. Cheney reports that he fought with White House advisers
over softening the president’s speeches on Iraq.

Mr. Cheney acknowledged that the administration underestimated the
challenges in Iraq, but he said the real blame for the violence was
with the terrorists.

He also defends the Bush administration’s decision to inflict what he
called “toughinterrogations” — like the suffocation technique known
as waterboarding — on captured terrorism suspects, saying it
extracted information that saved lives. He rejects portrayals of such
techniques as “torture.”

In discussing the much-disputed “16 words” about Iraq’s supposed
hunt for uranium in Niger that were included in President Bush’s
2003 State of the Union address to help justify the eventual invasion,
Mr. Cheney said that unlike other aides, he saw no need to apologize
for making that claim. He writes that Ms. Rice eventually came
around to his view.

he had a personal friendship. The former managing director
repeatedly made false representations to his employer about

the transaction and the ownership interests involved.

Conspiracy and Aiding and Abetting Liability

As with the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions, compa-
nies (including subsidiaries of issuers) and individuals may
face criminal liability for conspiring to commit or for aid-
ing and abetting violations of the accounting provisions.

For example, the subsidiary of a Houston-based
company pleaded guilty both to conspiring to commit and
to aiding and abetting the company’s books and records
and anti-bribery violations.*” The subsidiary paid bribes
of over $4 million and falsely characterized the payments

» «

as “commissions, “fees, or “legal services,’ consequently
causing the company’s books and records to be inaccurate.
Although the subsidiary was not an issuer and therefore
could not be charged directly with an accounting violation,
it was criminally liable for its involvement in the parent
company’s accounting violation.

Similarly, a U.S. subsidiary of a Swiss freight for-
warding company that was not an issuer was charged with
conspiring to commit and with aiding and abetting the
books and records violations of its customers, who were
issuers and therefore subject to the FCPA’s accounting
provisions.’ The USS. subsidiary substantially assisted the
issuer-customers in violating the FCPA’s books and records
provision by masking the true nature of the bribe payments
in the invoices it submitted to the issuer-customers.””! The
subsidiary thus faced criminal liability for its involvement
in the issuer-customers’ FCPA violations even though it

was not itself subject to the FCPA’s accounting provisions.

Auditor Obligations

All public companies in the United States must file
annual financial statements that have been prepared in
conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (US. GAAP). These accounting principles are
among the most comprehensive in the world. U.S. GAAP
requires an accounting of all assets, liabilities, revenue, and

expenses as well as extensive disclosures concerning the

company’s operations and financial condition. A company’s
financial statements should be complete and fairly repre-
sent the company’s financial condition.”” Thus, under US.
GAAP, any payments to foreign government officials must
be properly accounted for in a company’s books, records,
and financial statements.

US. laws, including SEC Rules, require issuers to
undergo an annual external audit of their financial statements
and to make those audited financial statements available to
the public by filing them with SEC. SEC Rules and the rules
and standards issued by the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (PCAOB) under SEC oversight, require
external auditors to be independent of the companies that
they audit. Independent auditors must comply with the rules
and standards set forth by the PCAOB when they perform
an audit of a public company. These audit standards govern,
for example, the auditor’s responsibility concerning material
errors, irregularities, or illegal acts by a client and its officers,
directors, and employees. Additionally, the auditor has a
responsibility to obtain an understanding of an entity’s inter-
nal controls over financial reporting as part of its audit and
must communicate all significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses identified during the audit to management and
the audit committee.”

Under Section 10A of the Exchange Act, indepen-
dent auditors who discover an illegal act, such as the pay-
ment of bribes to domestic or foreign government officials,
have certain obligations in connection with their audits of
public companies. ’”* Generally, Section 10A requires audi-
tors who become aware of illegal acts to report such acts to
appropriate levels within the company and, if the company

fails to take appropriate action, to notify SEC.

as inflation rises.

2017 - a year of recovering domestic demand

We think the economy is heading towards a cyclical sweet spot and see a broad-based recovery in domestic
demand. Specifically, 1) consumption is poised to rebound as the saving rate peaks; 2) capex should
accelerate in response to the improving demand outlook, deepening supply-side constraints, and low-for-
longer real rates; and 3) increased efforts by policymakers to accelerate income redistribution could push up
the velocity of money at the margin, helping to reflate the economy.

Biggest risk factor: US policy uncertainty

External developments pose the greatest risk to our forecasts, chief among them US policy uncertainty. The
downside scenario for Japan is a combination of rising US protectionism, sliding global trade, and a stronger
yen, which could reduce 2017 growth to zero. The Trump presidency may increase pressure on Japan to
achieve greater military self-reliance, boosting defense spending. There will also be greater incentives to
deepen economic and trade linkages with key regional players, such as China and Russia.

fear of a military attack by Israel. The biggest reason is that he is
worried about his country's economy, which is far more crucial to the
regime's survival than the nuclear programme. The Islamic regime in
Iran has not and will not live on its nuclear programme. It lives on its
economy. Khamenei is worried that if he doesn't negotiate, the west
will find it easier to justify isolating his country. This, in turn, will
make it easier to gain international approval for tough economic
sanctions. With so much legitimacy lost domestically after Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad's controversial election in 2009, Khamenei has even
more reason to worry about the impact that sanctions could have on
the survival of his regime. This is the main reason why he is
negotiating and will continue to do so. This is also why he will be
careful, as he was before Dagan's statement, in the way he approaches
his nuclear programme. One also has to ask: which is the bigger
reason why the international community is becoming more united
against Iran's nuclear programme? Its distaste and concern for
Khamanei's desire to have access to a bomb (which is becoming more
apparent from clause 35 of the most recent IAEA report), or threats
by Israel to attack Iran's nuclear installations? After recent
revelations, such as the secret enrichment site near Qom, the former
is more true. To deal with such a regime and to confront its
controversial nuclear programme, instead of constantly relying on
military threats, Israel's leaders would be better advised to study
Coelho's masterpiece, The Alchemist, and page 121 in particular:
When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you
to achieve it.

Israel is no longer alone in its belief that Iran wants to build a bomb.
Judging by the support for sanctions, the UN and especially its
security council members are more on the side of Israel than Iran.
This includes countries such as South Korea that have adopted
unilateral sanctions against Iran. In its bid to stop Iran's nuclear

Hi Reid,

Ashley Parker here at the Washington Post. I cover the White House and am emailing because my colleague,
Bob Costa, and I getting ready to post a story about President Trump’s decision to move ahead with retaining
outside counsel, and we understand you’re one of the finalists for the role, and have already spoken with senior
White House officials. I just wanted to let you know that we plan to mention your name (and of course see if
you want to comment), and I also wanted to check and see if you were open to chatting totally off the record,
just in case there is any nuance or guidance you’d like to provide. I’m at] or my desk is

Thanks,

Important Disclosures

FUNDAMENTAL EQUITY OPINION KEY: Opinions include a Volatility Risk Rating, an Investment Rating and an Income Rating. VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential
price fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst’s assessment of a stock’s: (i) absolute total return potential and (ii)
attractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). There are three investment ratings: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total
return of at least 10% and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than
Buy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0-12
month total return expectation for a stock and the firm’s guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be
referenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst’s view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).

Investment rating Total return expectation (within 12-month period of date of initial rating) Ratings dispersion guidelines for coverage cluster*
Buy = 10% < 10%
Neutral 20% = 30%
Underperform NIA = 20%

*Ratings dispersions may vary from time to time where BofA Merrill Lynch Research believes it better reflects the investment prospects of stocks in a Coverage Cluster.

INCOME RATINGS, indicators of potential cash dividends, are: 7 - same/higher (dividend considered to be secure), 8 - same/lower (dividend not considered to be secure) and 9 - pays
no cash dividend. Coverage Cluster is comprised of stocks covered by a single analyst or two or more analysts sharing a common industry, sector, region or other classification(s). A stock's
coverage cluster is included in the most recent BofA Merrill Lynch report referencing the stock.

Analysis by METI suggests that many of these non-manufacturing industries have the
scope to raise productivity. Wholesale/retail, utilities, and eating & accommodation have
particularly low levels of productivity relative to the US (Chart 18). We think the solution
is to boost capex, especially in ICT and automation. More broadly, an acceleration in
capex is needed if we are to see a pick-up in productivity and sustained profits. Though
we are by no means in the late stages of the profit cycle, the trend clearly points to
higher wage costs going forward, requiring proactive efficiency-enhancing investment
by corporates. Bottom-up data capex data for MSCI Japan also suggest that the
investment cycle has troughed and will pick up next year as earnings momentum
improves (Chart 19).

3. Policy priorities and redistribution

We think an increase in government pressure on corporations could speed up income
redistribution at the margin, ensuring that money circulates to those sectors and agents
with a higher propensity to consume. Elevated corporate savings remain a focal point
for the government. Cabinet Office officials have used the concept of the “cash-out
ratio” to highlight the creaky transmission from corporate profits to spending. Chart 20

3 The idea of the “cash-out” ratio was first raised by private sector representatives of the Council on
Fiscal and Economic Policy. The measure is defined as cash out / cash and deposits. The numerator
includes capex, personnel expenses, R&D, dividends, and changes in equity investments in related
companies, The denominator includes cash and deposits, and securities, short-term lending, and
investment securities classified under liquid assets. Since we are restricted to Ministry of Finance
Corporate survey data, our version of the “cash-out ratio” is defined as capex + personnel costs +
dividends / cash and liquid assets.

accurate description for Gates may be steady hand on the wheel,
says the Foreign Policy Research Institute's Michael Noonan.

T don't think [Gates's] accomplishments merit the sky-high
reputation that he enjoys as he leaves office, former senior CIA
analyst Paul Pillar says. Gates has long had a knack for nurturing his
own reputation.

Pillar recalls that Gates during his CIA days was always saying, 'I'm
going to whip this organization into shape.' Anything good that
happens, it's because 'I'm head of the organization.’ Anything bad can
be attributed to ‘institutional resistance.

When Gates took over the Pentagon in December 2006, he quickly
demonstrated the diplomatic and political acumen he had acquired as
he worked his way up through the intelligence community as the first
career officer to become CIA director.

Take, for instance, his decision to court Hillary Clinton when she
took over as secretary of state in 2009. One of the few senior Bush
holdovers in the new Obama administration, Gates was keenly aware
of the tensions between the State and Defense departments built up
during the war in Iraq. He invited Clinton to his Pentagon office, and
the two ate lunch at a table that belonged to Confederate President
Jefferson Davis back when he was U.S. secretary of war.

T just told her, based on my experience, that how well the
administration worked would depend a lot on how well she and I got
along together, Gates recalls. If we got along, the message would
go to the entire bureaucracy--not just our own bureaucracies but the
rest of government as well. She totally understood.

Gates made a calculated--and more public--courtship of her entire
agency. I read in the press, and therefore it must be true, that no
secretary of defense had ever been quoted as arguing for a bigger
budget for State, Gates boasts now. The strategy worked. Clinton
and Gates try to get together privatelyonce a week to work out

was involved in “’pumping’ these three cases to investors.”

As just explained, to the extent that Epstein is alleging that Edwards somehow did
something related to the Ponzi scheme, those allegations fail for the simple reason that Edwards
was not involved in any such scheme. Edwards, for example, could not have possibly “pumped”
the cases to investors when he never paatioinated in any communication with investors.

Epstein’s “pumping” claims, however, fail for an even more basic reason: Edwards was
mnfitiad — indeed ethically obligated as an attorney — to secure the maximum recovery for his
clients during the course of his legal representation. As is well known, “[a]s an advocate, a
lawyer zealously asserts the client’s position under the rules of the adversary system.” Fla, Rules
of Prof. Conduct, Preamble. Edwards therefore was required to pursue (unless otherwise
instructed by his clients) a maximum recovery against Epstein. Edwards, therefore, cannot be
liable for doing something that his ethical duties as an attorney required.”

Another reason that Epstein’s claims that Edwards was “pumping” cases for investors
fails is that Edwards filed all three cases almost a year before he was hired by RRA or even knew
of Scott Rothstein. Epstein makes allegations that the complaints contained sensational
allegations for the purposes of luring investors; however, language in the complaints remained
virtually unchanged from the first filing in 2008 and from the overwhelming evidence the Court
can see for itself that all of the facts alleged by Edwards in the complaints were true.

: Epstein ultimately paid to settle all three of the cases Edwards filed against him for more
— than he paid to settle any of the other claims against him. At Epstein’s request, the terms

In a further effort to harass Edwards, Epstein also filed a bar complaint with the Florida Bar against Edwards. The
Florida Bar has dismissed that complaint. See Statement of Undisputed Facts.

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018463.txt,"I disagree with most of their attitude. We don't need innocence. We don't need sexual
mystery. We don't need to eliminate teen sex. We don't need to re-establish some
limiting, patriarchal manly ideal. But they've got one thing right: we do need to start
talking about sex as something that is not mostly mechanical -- as something that, yes,
can be a private sphere for the creation of human meaning.”

3. [wish I'd learned this: Good sex doesn't just require two (or more) people who like
sex. It requires desire -- and desire simply doesn't work the same way for everyone.

I've said before that I went through a period -- back when I was first becoming sexually
active -- where I simply could not figure out why sexual acts with people I didn't care
about didn't seem to turn me on. Or rather -- they turned me on a little, but not... much. It
took me a while to understand that sex requires more than just two eager people. It
requires attraction and desire.

When I was fifteen or so, and at summer camp, I remember making out with a boy. I
didn't really want to make out with him, but I wasn't sure how to reject him (more on this
under point 5). And I figured: he seems nice enough, so I might as well make out with
him. Afterwards, I felt angry at myself, and I felt like I'd wasted my time -- and I felt
confused. I'd been bored at best and repulsed at worst, and I wasn't sure why I felt that
way, or why I'd done something that made me feel that way.

So why had I done it? Because I'd thought: Sex is value-neutral. Because I'd thought:
Making out is fun, right? -- that means I ought to do it when I get the chance! Because
I'd thought: My preference not to make out with him is probably just some silly
repression that I need to get over. Because I didn't understand that desire is complicated,
that you can't just make yourself feel desire when it's convenient, and that you don't need
a reason for your attractions -- or lack of attraction. This situation was to reprise itself in
various forms over the next years, until I finally learned that sometimes you simply want
or don't want things, and that you aren't required to justify your desires.

4. I wish I'd gotten a list of suggestions: Here are some places you might go to start
figuring out what turns you on.

I was told that sex was fun. I was even told to explore! But I still spent years with very
little actual idea of what I wanted. No one ever told me how or where I might be able to
learn more about my needs, or what exploring my needs might look like. And no one ever
explained that people are turned on by different things, that some people like some sex
acts and don't like others, and that's okay.

I went into sex with a buffet-style attitude, thinking that I must naturally enjoy sex
equally in all ways. I was so surprised when I found out that I like some positions better
than others! I remember how confused I was when I dated a guy who didn't like fellatio,
and how hurt I felt -- like his lack of enjoyment meant that I must be doing it wrong,
because everyone likes oral sex, right?

And of course, while I had a pretty comprehensive idea of the vanilla sex acts I could
experiment with, I had very little idea of what else was out there. In retrospect I find this
hilarious, but I remember -- back in my vanilla days -- I had two boyfriends who tied me
up. They tied me up and were nice to me, and I suppose it was amusing enough, but

2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *896

to full and timely restitution as provided in law. 7°? As a practical matter, many of the calculations supporting a restitution
award will rest on information in the presentence report. While the restitution statutes have their own detailed procedural

provisions, 7°4

the presentence report is clearly a central part of the restitution process. If a presentence report fails to
accurately recount restitution figures, crime victims may be short-changed. For all these reasons, the CVRA should be
understood as giving victims the right to review relevant parts of the presentence report and to be heard before a court makes
any final conclusions about Guidelines calculations and other sentencing issues. Many states follow a similar approach and
give victims access to the presentence report. 7>°

In February 2005, I testified before the Sentencing Commission to recommend a change in the U.S. Sentencing Commission
Guidelines Manual along the lines of the proposals contained in this [*897] Article. *°° In particular, I suggested that the
Commission change its current rule, which allows only the parties to see the presentence report. 7°’ The Practitioners’

Advisory Group to the Sentencing Commission later disputed my proposal. In a letter to the Commission, 7*8

they argued that
nothing in the CVRA or its legislative history states that crime victims should be permitted to review portions of the
presentence report, dispute guidelines calculations, raise grounds for departure, or, as such rights would seem to imply, appeal a
sentence on factual or legal grounds. 7°? The Practitioners’ Group also cited the drafting history of the proposed constitutional
amendment protecting victims’ rights, which they thought was limited to giving a victim merely the right to allocute at
sentencing - that is, merely to provide victim impact information. 7°°

The Practitioners' Group's arguments are flawed for several reasons. First, the Group too narrowly views the relevant legislative
history of the CVRA. As explained above, Congress intended for victims to have broad rights in the sentencing process,
including rights to be reasonably heard in a meaningful manner. 7°! It is not reasonable to deprive victims of the critical
information in the presentence report. Second, the Practioners' Group inaccurately describes the relevant history of the Victims’
Rights Amendment. It is true that the proposed constitutional amendment contained a right to be reasonably heard, just as the
CVRA does. However, the Practitioner's Group fails to recognize that the legislative history of the amendment suggests that

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027999.txt,"Battalion 890, under Yitzhik Mordechai, were in trouble. “Go. Find them. Help
get them out.”

I knew Yitzhik personally, from his years in the paratroopers’ elite Battalion
890. I knew the man who was now in overall command of the paratroopers even
better: Uzi Yairi, who was in charge of Sayeret Matkal during my final years of
reserve duty at Hebrew University. Helicoptered into the Sinai just hours
earlier, the paratroopers had been sent to the Chinese Farm shortly before
midnight. As I would soon learn, they had no more idea than I did about what
they were about to face. They were told they were going in simply to clear out
bands of “tank-hunters”. They weren ’t told of repeated attempts by some of
Arik’s top tank, paratroop and reconnaissance units to take the farm over the
previous 36 hours — attacks which had not only failed, but had cost dozens of
tanks and hundreds of men. Without artillery, armor or air support, they
immediately came under rifle, machine-gun, mortar and heavy artillery fire.

Our job was to get them out. Ordering my men to get ready for our first
combat mission of the war, I found myself face-to-face with a distraught and
determined friend from military intelligence. Yishai Izhar had arrived at Bren’s
headquarters the day before. When he saw me, he’d asked to join my battalion.
He was a brilliant electronics engineer and was about to assume command of
the technology unit in military intelligence. I told him we already had our
complement of tank crews, and I knew he’d never had any armored training. So
I found him a place in one of our APCs. But before joining military intelligence,
he’d been a company commander in Battalion 890. Hearing that we were going
to rescue his old unit, he insisted on joining me on the lead tank. I tried several
times to refuse, but he said I had no moral authority to stash him in an APC
when we were going in to rescue his friends and comrades. Aware that each
wasted minute might cost more of the paratroopers’ lives, I relented. I told
Yishai he’d be sitting across from me on the turret, right above Yasha Kedmi,
another friend who, having served under me in my first tank company in the
War of Attrition, had asked to join back at Julis. Yasha was our loader and
radio-operator. He got Yishai a machine gun, extra magazines for his Uzi and a
box of grenades.

We moved out through wave-like dunes in total darkness. After the first few
miles, the terrain leveled out a bit. Still, the sand was deep and the going slow.
When we got within a couple of miles of where I assumed Yitzhik and his men
would be, I radioed him. His voice was chilling. ““They’re very close to us,
shooting,” he said. “I’ve got many wounded. Get here as quick as you can.”

based on a previously reported incident with another student. He encouraged her to make a complaint, and
she did.

° University investigators interviewed both you and the student.

° On September 4, 2008, Susan Nickel-Schindewolf, the university’s associate vice president for student
affairs, wrote to the student, telling her that the investigation was complete. She wrote that you had been told:
“This type of behavior could constitute sexual harassment in violation of the university’s sexual harassment
policy.”

° The letter also stated that you were prohibited from making contact with the student as long as she
remained at Case.

° The letter also stated that you are required to get approval from the dean or the chair of the physics
department before setting foot on the campus again.

° The letter also stated, “Dr. Krauss expressed regret about having a negative impact on you, and also
his willingness to use this complaint as an opportunity to reflect and improve on his future interactions with
students.”

° By then, you had already left Case, taking up your current position at Arizona State University the
month before.

° “The opportunities being offered at ASU are simply too great to turn down at this stage in my career,”
you told Case colleagues, in an email announcing your departure on April 16, 2008.

Incident 3:

° A former Case Western physics department administrator confirmed that she had reported a previous
incident involving a student who had confided in her about your inappropriate behavior towards her.

Incident 4:

° You met a student from another university, an atheist activist, in March 2008 at the American Atheists
Convention in Minneapolis. She wanted to expand the atheist group she ran at the midwestern university she
was attending, and hoped to convince you to come and speak. You initially seemed enthusiastic.

° During the convention, attendees including you and Richard Dawkins went for dinner with the student
and volunteers for Dawkins’ foundation.

° Afterwards, the student invited you to join the volunteers for a drink.

° You asked her to come get you in your hotel room. She was wary of your intentions, and so brought a
male friend with her. Opening the door to find them both there, you informed her you had decided not to go.
° You met this student again at the American Atheists Convention in Des Moines, lowa, in April 2011.

° You pulled over a chair for her in the bar, and then started running your hand up her leg under the
table.

° She tried to shift her body away from you, and you persisted in putting your hand on her leg. She

crossed her legs, and you kept trying. Then she turned her entire body away.

Incident 5:

° This incident allegedly occurred on in May 2011 on a CFI cruise. We understand that CFI staff were
informed that you had propositioned a female cruise-goer, who rejected an invitation to join you and your
female companion for sex in your cabin.

° At least two CFI staffers were sufficiently concerned about reports of your behavior that they urged
CFI’s president not to invite you on a 2014 cruise of the Galapagos Islands. You were invited on that cruise,
however.

Does the ability to do diagnosis serve as a hallmark of intelligence?

Certainly doctors do diagnosis on a daily basis and doctors are
highly respected in our society. Most people think that if you are a
doctor, then you must be smart, but if you push on this belief, you
find that what people actually think is that a doctor had to go to
school for a really long time, learn of lot of complicated material, and
then work really hard as an intern and then as a resident. People re-
spect doctors and may well think that the doctor is the smartest per-
son in their small town, but that is typically because she is likely the
most educated person in that town. They easily may not consider her
to have “common sense,” which is one way that ordinary people de-
scribe their perception of intelligent behavior.

Diagnosis is done by plumbers, detectives, engineers, and beau-
ty care professionals as well. Diagnosis is a very important cognitive
process to learn. Learning to do it well often means the difference
between success and failure on the job and personally. Can the inter-
viewees do diagnosis? Miss South Carolina can.

She asserts that her friends can locate the United States on a map
of the world. She can find contradictory evidence for the proposition
presented to her, which is certainly part of diagnosis. The Palin inter-
viewees have done diagnosis as well. They have determined what is
wrong with the country. They may not have done much more than
listen to someone on talk radio, but they came to a conclusion based
on the evidence presented to them.

But they have done it badly. That is why they seem stupid.

Coming up with an accurate diagnosis requires intelligence. Ev-
eryone does diagnosis, but we seek counsel from those who do it bet-
ter than others. Diagnostic ability is a hallmark of intelligence.

What about causation? Let’s consider Miss South Carolina’s revised
remarks again:

“Personally, my friends and I, we know exactly where the United
States is on a map,” she said. “I don’t know anyone else who
doesn’t. If the statistics are correct, I believe there should be more
emphasis on geography in our education so people will learn
how to read maps better.”

Miss South Carolina thinks “there should be more emphasis on ge-
ography in our education so people will learn to read maps better.”

Looking forward, it is really not up to the west, much less the US, to
plan Libya’s transition. It is a relief to see so many articles and
statements reflecting lessons learnt from Iraq. But the Libyans are far
ahead of where the US was when the initial fighting ended in Iraq.
The National Transitional Council has a draft constitutional charter
that is impressive in scope, aspirations and detail — including 37
articles on rights, freedoms and governance arrangements.

The sceptics’ response to all this, of course, is that it is too early to
tell. In a year, or a decade, Libya could disintegrate into tribal
conflict or Islamist insurgency, or split apart or lurch from one
strongman to another. But the question for those who opposed the
intervention is whether any of those things is worse than Col Gaddafi
staying on by increasingly brutal means for many more years.
Instability and worse would follow when he died, even had he
orchestrated a transition.

The sceptics must now admit that the real choice in Libya was
between temporary stability and the illusion of control, or fluidity and
the ability to influence events driven by much larger forces. Welcome
to the tough choices of foreign policy in the 21st century. Libya
proves the west can make those choices wisely after all.

department

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021375.txt,"The Elusiveness of Meaningful
Connection

Kathryn Tanner’s chapter has
developed the classical Christian idea
that God is the creator and sustainer of
the world, in order to suggest the ways
in which this notion of the creator might
be one factor providing persons with a
sense of social connection and a hopeful,
generous, and caring disposition toward
the world that assuages the adverse
health consequences of loneliness. In
this classic interpretation of God as
creator, the idea refers not to the origins
of the universe but rather to the all-
inclusive dependence of life upon God at
all times. This sense of a sustaining
divine presence spanning the whole time
of one’s life thus contributes a deep
sense of one’s connection to the whole
order of creation. However, as Tanner
notes, people may become inattentive to
a presence so pervasive, just as people
can become inattentive to the forces of
gravity holding them to the surface of
the Earth as they go about their everyday
life. In more extreme versions of this
inattention, the person understands
humanity as “alone” in the universe, a
sort of metaphysical loneliness that
might exacerbate more concrete feelings
of loneliness.

Perhaps surprisingly, Chris Masi,
from the perspective of a physician and
medical researcher, casts a fascinating
and fresh perspective on the theological
notion that we live in a sustaining
connection to creation as a whole. After
describing the negative health
consequences of loneliness, Masi
proceeds to describe a cycle of
loneliness in which a person’s sense of
isolation frustrates well-intended efforts
to make social connections. Masi finds
that efforts to intervene and break this

Page |129

cycle are not notably successful, in large
part because the preconscious
disposition of lonely people toward the
world is difficult to change. Like Tanner,
although using different terminology,
Masi’s review of the scientific literature
suggests both that the character of one’s
general disposition toward the world is
profoundly important for one’s
connections to others, and that the
processes by which these general
dispositions change are complex and
warrant further scientific attention.

The House of the Noble Man
October 18th, 2010

This presentation of works by some of the world’s best known artists was intended more as a showcase for the
incredible property in which it took place than for the art itself. The eight residences in this newly redeveloped
Regency terrace happen to be on the market at the moment and, with the Frieze Art Fair taking place a stone’s
throw away in Regent’s Park, this was a perfect opportunity to entice wealthy collectors to view a potential home
or pied-a-terre.

The House of the Noble Man is supposed to evoke the home of a fictitious 21st century merchant — a digital
tycoon, trader and investor who collects art as a way of lending materiality to his otherwise transient and
ethereal existence.

Only the best will do in this sort of setting and curators Wolfe von Lenkiewicz and Victoria Golembiovskaya
managed to procure an astonishing selection of pieces including paintings, sculpture and installation works by
Yves Klein, Alexander Calder, Gerhard Richter, Andy Warhol, Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin and Banksy.

Contemporary design furniture from Carpenters Workshop Gallery helped to remind the visitor that you were ina
home rather than a gallery.

Also included in the presentation were the works of the four finalists from Channel 4 and the Saatchi Gallery’s
New Sensations 2010, a prize for artists graduating from UK art courses.

It would be impossible not to be impressed by the ambition and quality of this presentation and it certainly
provided a refreshingly serene and luxurious experience in comparison to the mélée down the road at Frieze.
However, there was something uncomfortable about viewing all of this wonderful art in what was, in essence, the
world’s most expensive show home. | guess the true success of this exhibition will be determined by whether any
of the properties sell and, for me, art should be treated as more than a sales tool.

rate short with little downside (real rates moved higher by 50bp post China deval in
Aug-15).

Trade: We recommend selling 10y real rates at 35bp with a target of 1% and a
stop loss of Obp. Risk: A reflationary sell-off without re-pricing the Fed is a risk to
the trade.

FX: GOP sweep emboldens core USD/JPY view

Higher US real rates, higher intermediate (5-10y) nominal rates combined with a
potential USD tailwind from a second Homeland Investment Act (HIA), leave USD/JPY as
our top directional FX trade for 2017. We have maintained a core view that USD/JPY
would move higher in 2017, as the factors weighing on the pair this year, namely
speculative JPY buying and increased FX hedging by domestic investors (S/¥’s eventual
surge), would subside. We like the trade for the following reasons.

« USD/JPY most sensitive to fiscal-stimulus-driven rise in US yields: Of all G10
FX pairs, JPY is most vulnerable (versus the USD) to a fiscal-driven rise in US yields.
First, the pair’s correlation with rate differentials is the highest in G10 at 60%. But,
more importantly, USD/JPY is also the most sensitive to the shape of the US 2s10s
curve (Chart 18). The shift from loose monetary/tight fiscal to a tight monetary/
loose fiscal policy regime will support such a steepening as supply is concentrated
in the intermediate part of the curve, and the positive growth shock allows the Fed
to hike faster, supporting an increase in real yields, also a key 2017 call.

¢ BO) yield target is bearish for JPY: The BO)’s implementation of a yield target at
its September meeting has caused a break in the correlation between 10Y JGBs and
USTs (Chart 19). First, given USD/JPY’s significant correlation with 10Y yield
differentials (>60%}, the anchoring of 10Y yields will further weigh on the Yen as
US Treasury yields rise. Second, further Japanese fiscal stimulus will successfully
lower real yields through higher breakeven rates of inflation while nominal yields
will remain unchanged. As our JPY strategist argues, to the extent that a Trump
victory has weakened Abe’s diplomatic success, not least from likely TPP failure,
and residual macro uncertainty makes it increasingly likely the government will seek
to draft a supplementary budget sooner than anticipated.

« _HIA and domestic flow picture a JPY-negative: The flow picture also turns JPY-
negative in 2017. USD/JPY’s underperformance during Asia trading hours in 2016
highlights that domestics used any rally in the pair to hedge (by selling USD/JPY)
existing investments. This flow will likely subside in 2017. The compression in FX-
hedge-adjusted yield pickup from a Japanese investor’s standpoint will likely shift

contributed the skin cell. The expectation is that when cells or tissues made from these stem cells
are transplanted into that person, they will slip past his or her immune system unnoticed.

The stem cells showed no gross chromosomal abnormalities, the authors wrote, and appeared
every bit as capable of differentiating into a variety of cell types as embryonic stem cells made the
old-fashioned way, from excess embryos obtained from fertility clinics.

This is extremely important, Dr. Irving Weissman, a stem cell researcher at Stanford University,
said of the new results.

Stem cell researcher Dr. Robert Lanza echoed that praise, calling the OHSU team's work a major
scientific achievement.

Lanza, the chief scientific officer of Advanced Cell Technology Inc., said it remained to be seen
whether embryonic stem cells generated this way were more useful for studying and treating
diseases than stem cells created by reprogramming adult cells to an embryonic state.

The method for creating such induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPS cells, was recognized with a
Nobel Prize last year.

But there are lingering questions about whether iPS cells are safe for patients. Scientists use a
cancer-causing virus to reprogram the cells, raising concerns that they could cause tumors in
patients. And in 2011, when scientists at UC San Diego created iPS cells and reintroduced them
into donor mice, the animals' immune systems rejected them.

Some experts are now saying that somatic cell nuclear transfer may be the only way to truly
reprogram cells, Lanza said.

relative to G4 currencies. Due to structural reasons we remain cautious on the Hungarian forint (HUF).

¢ The South African rand (ZAR) is currently attractively valued, but Investors should be willing and able to
tolerate bouts of volatility due to the current strikes and a cyclical slowdown of the economy.

e In Asia, we like the Korean won (KRW), the Singaporean dollar (SGD) and the Malaysian ringgit (MYR) as
all three countries have a strong economy and should benefit from increasing liquidity and a recovering
Chinese economy.

¢ In Latin America, the Mexican peso (MXN) remains attractively valued, despite its recent rally.

A Positive scenario
¢ Macroeconomic data comes in stronger than expected and contagion risks in Europe subside further. EM
exchange rates could appreciate swiftly against major currencies (USD, EUR, and JPY).

& Negative scenario
¢ Global growth prospects suffer a prolonged deterioration and the European debt crisis intensifies. EM
exchange rates could see a significant, although likely temporary, sell-off across regions.

Note: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)

> 5% outperformance of EM FX against G4 currencies over a 6-month horizon

> 5% depreciation of EM FX across regions against USD over a 6-month horizon

What we're watching Why it matters

Inflation dynamics
inEM

Inflation dynamics are important to forecast central bank policy rate
decisions. Monetary easing typically weighs on EM currencies, while rate hikes
tend to be supportive. Key policy rate announcement dates: 11 Nov,
Indonesia; Nov 20, Turkey; Nov 22, South Africa; Nov 30, Mexico

European sovereign crisis Setbacks in sentiment will likely lead to bouts of EM currency depreciation,

providing attractive entry points for longer term investors.

Growth Growth in the US, Europe, and China is key for risk sentiment, growth

prospects in EM. Key date: Dec 6, European Central Bank meeting

2 UBS

Recommendations

Tactical (6 months)

e Several EM currencies look attractive at
current levels and we advise investors to
keep existing holdings for further gains
while increasing exposure to our
preferred EM currencies (KRW, SGD, MYR,
MXN, TRY, PLN, ZAR), using the JPY, USD,
and EUR for funding.

Strategic (1 to 2 years)

e We recommend EM currencies backed by
stable fundamentals as a strategy to
diversify currency exposure.

e Our favorites include the Chilean peso,
Mexican peso, Czech koruna, Polish zloty,
Chinese renminbi, Korean won, Malaysian
ringgit, and Singapore dollar.

databases of medical histories will be overseen by machine intelligences able to out-
diagnose him.1°! Constant, automatic links between body-borne sensors we'll wear
(or swallow) and data centers will sharpen the edge these systems have on my dad
further still in coming years. They will notice things he could never hope to see -
small but portentous changes in your heartbeat, chemical chimeras from new
medications, how you're feeling in each moment until your last.

It is the nature of networks that they create both massive concentration and
distribution. And in the process they simply rip apart many of our existing
structures. Look at our worrisome global economics at the moment. Extreme
concentration of wealth on one end and massive distribution of work tools to ever-
cheaper sources of labor runs on this exact same logic: it is a sort of jawing network
effect that is tearing up the middle class, producing an ever-richer elite. Those who
have information in financial markets, for instance, possess a secret and vital and
ever sharper edge over those who don’t. Which makes them richer still. Which
sharpens their cutting edge still finer. If we ask ourselves why the world now feels
on the edge of a deflationary shock - a moment where there is more supply than
there is demand, where the world waits to buy because “tomorrow it will be
cheaper” and sends economies spiraling as a result - one reason is this way in which
networks are pulling on our economics. On the one hand, wealth is concentrated in
fewer and fewer hands by the leverage of knowledge and a head start and
connection — a phenomenon knowyn, in fact, as a “rich club” distribution by network
theorists. The middle class is locked out of this group. Their wealth and power and
influence declines, as a result. This slashes overall demand, since a billionaire
consumes less of each additional dollar than, say, a school teacher. At the same time,
massive distribution of technology and connection is reducing demand for labor
while flooding the world with commodities, workers, newly linked-supply of items
like bedrooms and car seats.

The network effect works its usual jawing destruction here: Connection decreases
demand and increases supply. It concentrates capital in a few hands, even as it
distributes tools of work to cheaper and more distributed people and machines. The
middle is class torn inexorably apart from both ends. It’s not wrong to wonder, as
some economists have, if capitalism is a system best yoked to older, slower
puritanical values that encouraged saving, not consumption - and to ask if wiring
markets to instant networks is not, in the end like trying to warp speed a carriage.
Anyhow placing an economy on a network surface produces new, ripping pressures
as apparent in middle-income nations as they are in middle class households. “We
are being destroyed,” a South Korean friend said to me about the hollowing out of
his national economy. Korean computer and television and compute manufacturers
had hoped they could develop their own essential software, that their hardware
manufacturing technology would be unmatchable. In fact, software triumph was

exhibits strong evidence of suppression, especially because the measure we retained (median usage) is
robust to such outliers.

3) Degenerate artists

The list of degenerate artists was taken directly from the catalog of a recent exhibition at the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art which endeavored to reconstruct the original ‘Degenerate Art’ exhibition (Ref $15).

4) People with recorded ties to Nazis

The list of Nazi party members was generated in a manner consistent with the occupation categories in
section 7. We included the following Wikipedia categories: Nazis_from_outside_Germany, Nazi_leaders,
SS_officers, Holocaust_perpetrators, Officials_of_Nazi_Germany, Nazis_convicted_of_war_crimes,
together with all of their subcategories, with the exception of Nazis_from_outside_Germany. In addition,
the three categories German_Nazi_politicians, Nazi_physicians, Nazis were included without their
respective subcategories.

III.9B. De Novo Identification of Censored and Suppressed Individuals

We began with the list of 56,500 people, comprising the 500 most famous individuals born in each year
from 1800 — 1913. This list was derived from the analysis of all biographies in Wikipedia described in
section 7. We removed all individuals whose mean frequency in the German language corpus was less
than 5 x 10™ during the period from 1925 — 1933; because their frequency is low, a statistical assessment
of the effect of censorship and suppression on these individuals is more susceptible to noise.

The suppression index is computed for the remaining individuals using an observed/expected measure.
The expected fame for a given year is computed by taking the mean frequency of the individual in the
German language from 1925-1933, and the mean frequency of the individual from 1955-1965. These two
values are assigned to 1929 and 1960, respectively; linear interpolation is then performed in order to
compute an expected fame value in 1939. This expected value is compared to the observed mean
frequency in the German language during the period from 1933-1945. The ratio of these two numbers is
the suppression index s. The complete list of names and suppression indices is included as supplemental
data. The distribution of s was plotted for using a logarithmic binning strategy, with 100 bins between 10°
and 10°. Three specific individuals who received scores indicating suppression in German are indicated
on the plot by arrows (Walter Gropius, Pablo Picasso, and Hermann Maas).

As a point of comparison, the entire analysis was repeated for English; these results are shown on the
plot.

III.9C. Validation by an expert annotator

We wanted to see whether the findings of this high-throughput, quantitative approach were consistent
with the conclusions of an expert annotator using traditional, qualitative methods. We created a list of 100
individuals at the extremes of our distribution, including the names of the fifty people with the largest s
value and of the fifty people with the smallest s value. We hired a guide at Yad Vashem with advanced
degrees in German and Jewish literature to manually annotate these 100 names based on her
assessment of which people were suppressed by the Nazis (S), which people would have benefited from
the Nazi regime (B), and lastly, which people would not obviously be affected in either direction (N). All
100 names were presented to the annotator in a single, alphabetized list; the annotator did not have
access to any of our methods, data, or conclusions. Thus the annotators assessment is wholly
independent of our own.

FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 24

Mid-day, I arrive at The Beverly Hills Hotel. As the house-
Keepers unpack my bags upstairs I peek into the Polo Lounge
and find Warren Beatty in a booth. I tell him I’m rooting for
his wife, Annette Benning, and love her film, The Kids Are All
Right. Warren says The Social Network will win.

This year I am two days late arriving to Oscar weekend. I
am shown to a very, very small room—the size of a broom
closet. Uncharacteristically, I have a slight melt down. I am
moved. The housekeepers run down the hall with my clothes
flying. The hotel is sold out, so I get someone else’s room.
Another unsuspecting victim checking in downstairs will get
the broom closet.

It is cold, grey and rainy. Taffeta, organdy and embroidered
silk evening clothes hang in my closet. I stay in my sweaters
and fur coat, and head to Arianna Huffington’s home in
Beverly Hills where she and Wendi Murdoch are hosting a
party for Tom Freston’s wife, the beautiful, blonde Kathy.
Her book is called Veganist: Lose Weight, Get Healthy, Change
the World—perfect for monks.

Arianna has just sold the Huffington Post to AOL for $315
million dollars and is rumored to have personally landed
around $20 million. She is euphoric as she greets Nicole
Kidman and Keith Urban at the door. Other drenched power
players include Disney’s Bob Iger and wife Willow Bay, Fox’s

his daughter Tara and avoiding questions about Charlie
Sheen, Moby, Jamie Niven, Brian Grazer, Vivi Nevo, CBS’s
Les Moonves and Julie Chen, Rob Reiner, Paramount’s Brad
Grey and fiancé Cassandra Huysentruyt and Jeff Bezos.
Hors d’oeuvres include pigs in blankets—a food group not
mentioned in Kathy’s book.

The action migrates to UTA Jim Burkus’ home for a party
for True Grits Ethan and Joel Coen. I pass Ron Howard on
the way in and he says, “Keep me on your list.” Is he kidding?
Sunrise and Mark Ruffalo, Focus Feature’s James Shamus,
Nancy Meyers and John Goldwyn mingle. Adorable Hallie

Steinfeld is there with her parents. I am trying to fix her up
with Justin Bieber. She giggles, “Peg, I am only 14.”

I am face to face with Harrison Ford and stupidly tell him
I love him in Morning Glory. He’s looking at me in utter
disbelief, but I will not shut up. A gorgeous guy is inches away
in a hat and glasses. I whisper to Harrison, “That looks just
like Johnny Depp.” Harrison rolls his eyes and. reluctantly
introduces me to his friend .. . Johnny Depp. I babble a bit
about his great work then run for cover in a corner next to my
buddy, Jerry Bruckheimer.

= Future demand in multifamily promising: Looking forward, the panelists see
healthy demand for multifamily housing given a preference among millennials to
live in urban areas versus the suburbs. Moreover, the panelists noted that increasing
debt burden tied to student loans is likely to make home ownership out of reach for
several first time home buyers. Furthermore, it was noted that the US needs 1.5mn
new housing units each year and the present level of construction activity was not
keeping pace with this when looking at it on a national level.

= Foreign capital part of the equation: Some of the panelists are seeing a
significant flow of foreign capital into the multifamily market with Mr. Brickman
surmising that data around inflow of foreign capital into the commercial real estate
market was likely understated given that significant amount of inflows have come
indirectly through investment vehicles like private equity.

= Risk retention rules modest impact: Our multifamily panelists viewed the risk
retention rule for CMBS as having a modest impact given the large role played by
the GSEs in lending to the multifamily space. It was also noted that while the rule
may dampen private securitization activity, less competition from the CMBS
markets would be a positive for balance sheet lenders.

= Impact from rising rates may not be all news: While the panel acknowledged that
the rise in interest rates will likely push cap rates higher, an increase driven by a
more favorable growth outlook may not be as bad. This is because a stronger
economy should theoretically lead to a better backdrop for jobs and wage growth,
thereby providing landlords some leeway to raise rents.

ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY Challenges of Artificial Intelligence:
Envisioning and Addressing Adverse Outcomes

5) Al, GOALS, AND INADVERTENT SIDE EFFECTS

Runaway Resource Monopoly

(Contributions from Shahar Avin, Sean O hEigeartaigh, Greg Cooper, and others)

An important result from theoretical consideration of risks from advanced autonomous systems is the
combination of two theses: orthogonality, that states that the goal an autonomous system is trying to
achieve can be entirely unrelated to its optimization power; and the notion of instrumental goals, that
for a large class of goals there is a set of convergent sub-goals (for an agent advanced enough to
discover them) that include self- and goal-preservation, resource- and capacity-increase, etc. (e.g., as
discussed in Bostrom, 2014). One suggestion for maintaining control over advanced systems that pose
risks from the combination of the above considerations is to limit the system's ability to access
increasing resources.

To make this situation concrete, consider an installation of a reinforcement-learning task scheduler for
a group of distributed data centres (e.g. Amazon Web Services). The goal of the algorithm is to
minimize time-to-execution of the tasks sent to the system by users. As part of its general scheduling
remit, it is also responsible for scheduling its own optimization sub-processes. The system has a clear
incentive to control an increasing set of compute resources, both for increasing its optimization power
and for achieving its main goal of reducing time-to-execution. Aware of these considerations, the
engineers of the system put in place various hard-coded limits on the amount of resources the system
can access, but these limits can be subverted through privilege escalation, masquerading as other
tasks, manipulation of users, physical control, etc.

POSSIBLE TRAJECTORY

e Ateam within a large tech corporation that has both ML development capacities and cloud
computing capacities is tasked with improving task scheduling on distributed compute resources.

e The team decides to deploy an out-of-the-box reinforcement learning package developed in-house
by the ML research teams.

e The inputs for the system are current loads on the different machines, the incoming tasks queue
(including priority for different tasks), and historical data on task runtimes. The output is an
assignment of tasks to machines. The loss function is the priority-weighted time-to-execute.

e The system performs well in a test environment (where the RL is running on a single cluster of
dedicated machines), and is rolled-out.

e A few months later, the system starts to run out of memory, and a tech-infrastructure engineer
decides to switch the system from a fixed-capacity setting to a load-balanced setting.

e Now an output of the system (assignment of the RL task to a machine) is coupled to the objective
of the machine (reducing runtime), and the resulting feedback loop drives the RL agent to spawn an
increasing amount of RL tasks with very high priority.

Sometimes their reaction is denial, sometimes shock and horror, sometimes anger, but it’s
always dramatic. The mission at a minimum is to get the client to understand what’s
happening so that he can be effective for me, in terms of my defending him.

LD: Have you ever declined to represent someone because you were so appalled by what
they did?

RW: At this point, I’m in the fortunate position of turning down more cases than | take. | turn
down cases for many reasons, though it’s not so much that I’m appalled by the behavior.

The way | look at it is, do | bring value? Is there something about me representing the
individual that adds something, as opposed to every other lawyer in town? | think if | halted,
or | was so shocked or appalled or dismayed by the conduct that I’d pull my punches, |’d
know that.

| break bread with the would-be client. If there’s a visceral feel, either overtly or covertly, that
I’m not going to want to spend time with him or her, it all factors in. There are often a variety
of factors that cause me to take seriously the potential of the representation, and then | turn

it down.

LD: Are conflicts much of an issue?

RW: Steptoe & Johnson is a big firm, but it’s not one of the megafirms. There have probably
been a dozen significant matters | got conflicted out of because of Steptoe’s other
representations. But | have colleagues who work at much bigger firms who are constantly
getting conflicted out of representations.

world. If | had nothing but Goldman-like representations, that would be an issue. But if you
represent Jesse Jackson Jr. or [other] public officials, as | do, the potential for conflicts is
significantly less.

LD: What agency is most likely to strike fear in the heart of defendants?

RW: The Southern District of New York is the elite prosecutor’s office in the country. | don’t
think you’d get much dispute there. They’re aggressive, they’re smart, they have this
enormous home court advantage. Right after them, there are several very fine, very
aggressive, very talented U.S. attorneys offices like Chicago, Boston, EDVA and certainly
the District of Columbia. And you can go to Topeka, Kansas, or Burlington, Vermont, and

Research cost is the same for both. If a manger neither buys nor sells, she tells us
that she thinks the price is right. The critical variable is not trade volume, but

percent of aggregate market cap controlled by asset managers collectively.

The number of asset managers is much less critical. There must be enough for
competition within each specialty or sector of investment. Too many is nota
concern. Abler ones, on microeconomic principle, will displace the less able. That’s
why Herbert Spencer taught that natural selection works the same in economics as

in biology.

A particular reason for preferring index ETFs as omnibus fund investments is for
cheaper liquidity. The omnibus fund must compete with banks in accommodating
payments and other withdrawals (redemptions). Popular index ETFs such as
spiders (SPDRs, for Standard and Poor’s Depository Receipts) are bought and sold in
seconds for a fee of a couple of basis points. So are Treasury ETFs. Thus the omnibus
fund might do best not to include actual corporate bond ETFs in reintegrating the
corporate sector. Treasuries of equal value should do about as well at much lower

trading cost. Easy liquidity is essential.

Why Omnibus?

Omnibus means for everyone as well as of everything. It is all-inclusive either way.
Individuals differ in risk tolerance. An omnibus fund provides for all. The portfolio
of index exposures to riskier equity claims and safer debt claims is meant to satisfy
average risk tolerance as a whole. Individual accounts then choose short-leg hedges
or long-leg exposure or anything between. An omnibus portfolio best matches

aggregate risk and return to individual claims on it.

Other approaches would work too. A broad-based equity index fund, targeting say
the S&P 500 or Russell 3000, could give the same tick-to-tick transparency in

individual accounts. Hedging would still be available to cater to individual risk

Bill Janetschek, Chief Financial Officer, presented for KKR. Overall, Mr. Janetschek
believes that KKR’s balance sheet gives them the ability to take advantage of
market dislocations, sees opportunities to grow in certain areas (e.g. infrastructure
and real estate), and noted that they don’t need to grow the headcount to bring on
more assets.

e When asked “What would get you more interested in investing in KKR stock?” the
most common response was a market pullback for better deployment/returns
(50%). Respondents also felt that attractive returns and book value growth (33%),
and stronger fee related earnings (17%) were also important. Less important for
investors was improving energy markets and overall market confidence (0%).

¢ Overall, KKR likes the publicly traded partnership structure today. If comprehensive
tax reform includes an elimination of carried interest tax, the income would still get
passed through in that scenario which avoids a second level of taxation, so it still
may not be attractive to change the structure. But, if the corporate rate is also
lowered significantly, it could potentially make sense to go to a C-corp.

¢ — Bill sees infrastructure as a real growth area for KKR. 7-8 years ago it was difficult
to raise an infrastructure fund as the asset class didn’t do very well in the financial
crisis; today there is more interest. KKR’s first infrastructure fund was around $1B
and the second one was around $38. Infrastructure needs are tremendous long-
term, with $1-2 trillion capital needed for projects over the next decade, and
infrastructure spend is one area of consistency across the two major parties.

« Management thinks that investors understand the reason for the change in the
distribution policy. KKR likes to pay out the stable dividend and redeploy capital into
the balance sheet. As part of the year-end process, KKR will likely review the level
of the fixed distribution and determine whether it should be changed. KKR would
like to have around 40% of the balance sheet invested in private equity over time.

« KKR will manage concentration risk, and it is unlikely that the firm will make
another investment as big as First Data again. The biggest advantage to having a

`Blahblahs' forbidden in 'Radical Breakthroughs'. So we need two replacements (for Multiverse as Science and 
Rare Sentience). 
Initial ideas: 
* Expand the first episode Mathematics and Truth into two or likely three episodes. I'm intrigued by this 
because there is so much rich material - pure math, philosophy (discovered or invented), physics (Wigner's 
'unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences)', astrophysics, cosmology, biology, general 
systems theory. I've felt frustrated in this first episode because there is so much material. I think three episodes 
could work - if you agree, I'll get back to you with a suggested structure of the 2 or likely 3 parts. Also, Closer 
To Truth has had only a few videos and one episode on mathematics per se (out of 277 episodes!), so this would 
be original and complementary. In this may, math would become about half the series. 
* Integrated Information Theory - quantifying and explaining consciousness (Giulio Tononi, Un of Wisconsin-
Madison), plus supporters and critics. New controversial, science-based radical theory. 
* Evolutionary Dynamics - your program at Harvard - mathematical models. This is not an area of my expertise, 
but it could well fit Closer To Truth in general and Radical Breakthroughs in particular. But you need to tell me 
if you would like to include this.

jeffrey apparently paid for massages with sex... I believe him when he told me he had no idea the girls were

circumstances... Moreover, I also believe that Jeffrey is an easy target for those who want to take advantage 
of him... Moreover, I can say with great honesty that Jeffrey's time in prison led him to seriously examine 
his life in very positive ways and I don't believe in blanket condemnations of people. He served time for 
something that was determined was inappropriate. I honestly don't know who was the victim in this case. I 
fully expect that these masseuses knew what they were doing, and were not swayed to do anything with 
Jeffrey that they were not already doing. That is not to approve of the whole behavior, but lots of peopleI 
know and like have behavior I don't entirely approve of. I know it is not politically correct to say that, 
because in general this is a very sensitive issue and all other things being equal one should take the side of 
the young women. But all things are not equal in this case, from my point of view. It is a judgement call, 
and I will not turn my back on a good friend so easily.

Thanks for getting back to me. I was asking because I found the quote shocking . . . the evidence against 
Epstein is overwhelming and he's even pled guilty to paying for sex with a minor. It's in no way scientific or 
rational to assume that because you never saw him with an underage girl he must actually be innocent. It is 
possible for a person to be kind and generous with his friends but still a criminal paying for sex with 
underage girls in his private life.

Dear Professor Krauss, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031080 
We met briefly after your talk in Ithaca a few months ago — I'm the girl on The Skeptics' Guide to the 
Universe podcast. I've really enjoyed your talks and books, but I was surprised to see you quoted in the 
Daily Beast recently defending Jeffrey Epstein: 
http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2011-04-01/bill-clinton-katie-couric-woody-allen-jeffrey-
epsteins-society-friends-close-ranks/2/  
Can you confirm if the following quote is accurate? 
If anything, the unfortunate period he suffered has caused him to really think about what he wants to do 
with his money and his time, and support knowledge, says Krauss. Jeffrey has surrounded himself with 
beautiful women and young women but they're not as young as the ones that were claimed. As a scientist I 
always judge things on empirical evidence and he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I've 
never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my presumption is that whatever the problems were I would 
believe him over other people. Though colleagues have criticized him over his relationship with Epstein, 
Krauss insists, I don't feel tarnished in any way by my relationship with Jeffrey; I feel raised by it. 
Thanks, 
Rebecca Watson

It was an odd thing, Epstein’s association with this self-professed
PhD who, on closer inspection, turned out to be a bit of a grifter.
But the Mindshift conference that Epstein and Seckel hosted
in the Virgin Islands did take place, in 2010. Murray Gell-
Mann was there, along with Leonard Mlodinow, a physicist who
coauthored books with Stephen Hawking. Gerald Sussman, an
expert on artificial intelligence who taught at MIT and also
attended the conference, said that he didn’t remember too much
about it.

“We had scientific discussions, talked about various things,”
he said vaguely.

inadequate. These fears were realized when Epstein filed a summary judgment motion raising
this argument. In response, the other attorneys and Edwards representing Jane Doe used the
flight log evidence to respond to Epstein’s summary judgment motion, explaining that the flight
logs demonstrated that Epstein had traveled in interstate commerce for the purpose of facilitating
tere assaults.. Because Epstein chose to settle the case before trial, Judge Marra did not
rule on the summary judgment motion.

flight logs might contain relevant evidence for the cases against Epstein. Jane Doe No. 102’s
complaint outlined Epstein’s daily sexual exploitation and abuse of underage minors as young as
12 years old and alleged that Epstein’s plane was used to transport underage females to be
sexually abused by him and his friends. The flight logs accordingly were a potential source of
information about either additional girls who were victims of Epstein’s abuse or friends of
Epstein who may have witnessed or even participated in the abuse. Based on this
information, Edwards reasonably pursued the flight logs in discovery,

80. In the fall of 2009, Epstein gave a recorded interview to George Rush, a reporter
with the New York Daily News about pending legal proceedings. In that interview, Epstein
demonstrated an utter lack of remorse for his crimes (but indirectly admitted his crimes) by
stating:

¢ People do not like it when people make good and that was one reason he (Epstein)
was being targeted by civil suits filed by young girls in Florida;

He was also not above entering into risky, tax-sheltered oil and gas deals with much smaller
investors. A lawsuit that Michael Stroll, the former head of Williams Electronics Inc., filed
against Epstein shows that in 1982 I.A.G. received an investment from Stroll of $450,000, which
Epstein put into oil. In 1984 Stroll asked for his money back; four years later he had received
only $10,000. Stroll lost the suit, after Epstein claimed in court, among other things, that the
check for $10,000 was for a horse he’d bought from Stroll. “My net worth never exceeded four
and a half million dollars,” Stroll has said.

Hoffenberg, says a close friend, “really liked Jeffrey.... Jeffrey has a way of getting under your
skin, and he was under Hoffenberg’s.” Also appealing to Hoffenberg were Epstein’s social
connections; they included oil mogul Cece Wang (father of the designer Vera) and Mohan
Murjani, whose clothing company grew into Gloria Vanderbilt Jeans. Epstein lived large even
then. One friend recalls that when he took Canadian heiress Wendy Belzberg on a date he hired a
Rolls-Royce especially for the occasion. (Epstein has claimed he owned it.)

In 1987, Hoffenberg, according to sources, set Epstein up in the offices he still occupies in the
Villard House, on Madison Avenue, across a courtyard from the restaurant Le Cirque.
Hoffenberg hired his new protégé as a consultant at $25,000 a month, and the relationship
flourished. “They traveled everywhere together—on Hoffenberg’s plane, all around the world,
they were always together,” says a source. Hoffenberg has claimed that Epstein confided in him,
saying, for example, that he had left Bear Stearns in 1981 after he was discovered executing
“illegal operations.”

Several of Epstein’s Bear Stearns contemporaries recall that Epstein left the company very
suddenly. Within the company there were rumors also that he was involved in a technical
infringement, and it was thought that the executive committee asked that he resign after his two
supporters, Ace Greenberg and Jimmy Cayne, were outnumbered. Greenberg says he can’t recall
this; Cayne denies it happened, and Epstein has denied it as well. “Jeffrey Epstein left Bear
Stearns of his own volition,” says Cayne. “It was never suggested that he leave by any member
of management, and management never looked into any improprieties by him. Jeffrey said
specifically, ‘I don’t want to work for anybody else. I want to work for myself.’” Yet, this is not
the story that Epstein told to the S.E.C. in 1981 and to lawyers in a 1989 deposition involving a
civil business case in Philadelphia.

In 1981 the S.E.C.’s Jonathan Harris and Robert Blackburn took Epstein’s testimony and that of
other Bear Stearns employees in part of what became a protracted case about insider trading
around a tender offer placed on March 11, 1981, by the Seagram Company Ltd. for St. Joe
Minerals Corp. Ultimately several Italian and Swiss investors were found guilty, including
Italian financier Giuseppe Tome, who had used his relationship with Seagram owner Edgar
Bronfman Sr. to obtain information about the tender offer.

After the tender offer was announced, the S.E.C. began investigating trades involving St. Joe at
Bear Stearns and other firms. Epstein resigned from Bear Stearns on March 12. The S.E.C. was
tipped off that Epstein had information on insider trading at Bear Stearns, and it was therefore
obliged to question him. In his S.E.C. testimony, given on April 1, 1981, Epstein claimed that he
had found “offensive” the way Bear Stearns management had handled a disciplinary action

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024629.txt,"I wrote some movie reviews for Cavalier. I recall that Midnight Cowboy was 50 years ago. I
always went to two screenings. The first one I would go stoned with magic mushrooms. The

second one I took notes. However, I got fired by Cavalier.

They declined to publish a particular column—-my review of MASH as though it were a Busby
Berkeley musical called Gook Killers of 1970-— ostensibly on the grounds of bad taste, but I
learned that three wholesalers had told the publisher they were pressured by the FBI and would

refuse to distribute Cavalier if my name appeared in it.

On top of that, my name was on a list of sixty-five “radical’’ campus speakers, released by the
House Internal Security Committee. The blacklist was published in the New York Times, and
picked up by newspapers across the country. It might have been a coincidence, but my campus-

speaking engagement-bookings stopped abruptly. It felt just like a film.
OH, WELL

It was over for me, but it had been fun—like the issue with only the one large red headline
on the Cavalier cover: “BEAT ‘EM SENSELESS FIRST’—THE FREE SPEECH
CONTROVERSY, BY PAUL KRASSNER ... “Ironically,” I wrote, “it is this concept of the
total education experience on campus which I believe to be the basic significance of the much-

misunderstood free-speech imbroglio at the University of California in Berkeley.”

The sit-in lasted till 3 a.m. Next day, October 1, 1964, ten tables were manned again, and
a campus policeman approached one of the tables (manned by the Congress of Racial Equality)

sexual exploitation, national sovereignty, and support for Israel.” (Emphasis added)

Its leader, Penny Nance, has called for Acosta’s resignation. Noting that labor trafficking,
which the Labor Department combats, is often conjoined with sex trafficking, Nance says
that President Trump would not have nominated Acosta if reports fully describing Acosta’s
conduct in the Epstein case had emerged earlier.

Sen. Ben Sasse has also weighed in. He sent a letter to the Justice Department asking it to
investigate its treatment of Epstein, including the fact that the plea deal ensured that victims
of the pervert would be denied the ability to comment on or object to the leniency of his
sentence. Sasse is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Oversight,
Agency Action, Federal Rights and Federal Courts.

Sen. Marco Rubio, a longtime supporter of Acosta, says it would be “very troubling” if
political influence led to a light sentence for Epstein. In Rubio’s view, and that of every
rational person, Epstein “should have been in jail for a long time.” Rubio added, however,
that he will reserve judgment until he hears Acosta’s side.

That’s fair. But so far, Acosta has provided no real defense for letting Epstein off so lightly.
In public, at least, he is standing by his argument that the deal was a reasonable one and that
this is old news.

Previously, Acosta had a different defense. He cited “a year-long assault on the prosecution
and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars” who represented Epstein. This
allegedly included “defense counsel investigat[ing] individual prosecutors and their
families, looking for personal peccadilloes that may provide a basis for disqualification.” In
this account, the deal was made to relieve the pressure, while still getting a conviction.

Acosta could hardly assert this explanation — 1.e., that he wimped out — while seeking a
cabinet position with the expectation of being appointed to more exalted jobs in the future.
Nor is the explanation particularly plausible. Acosta isn’t the first prosecutor to face a
scorched earth defense. Ask Ken Starr about this.

I don’t doubt that Acosta regarded escaping the wrath of the defense team as a benefit of
reaching the plea deal. But I don’t believe this was incentive enough to cause him, in effect,
to throw the case.

What was the true incentive? As I wrote when this story broke, I think it was the same
incentive that explains much of his conduct in public life — Acosta’s desire to
accommodate people he thinks can help him down the road.

Which people? Probably the lawyers at Kirkland and Ellis, where Acosta had once worked.

Epstein enlisted Ken Starr* and Jay Lefkowitz, both of Kirkland, for his defense team.
Acosta reportedly worked out the terms of his surrender with Lefkowitz, a former
colleague, at a meeting in a location far away from the prosecutor’s office.

charged.)

An American fashion designer who booked her girls through MC2 says they were very young
and very beautiful; many were from Eastern Europe and spoke little English. A former
bookkeeper in the agency's Miami office, who also arranged visas for girls traveling to the U.S.,
confirmed that MC2 girls became frequent guests on Epstein’s private jets.

Edwards possessed a legitimate basis for doing so: (a) Clinton was friends with Ghislaine

images of naked underage children on her computer, helped to recruit underage children for
Epstein, engaged in lesbian sex with underage females that she procured for Epstein, and
photographed underage females in sexually explicit poses and kept child pornography on her
computer; (b) it was national news when Clinton traveled with Epstein aboard Epstein’s private
plane to Africa and the news articles classified Clinton as Epstein’s friend. (c) the complaint

Ghislaine Maxwell, the British brunette whose father once
owned the Daily News, has been slapped with a subpoena in
suits brought by 24 underage girls against her old friend,
billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.

Maxwell -- whose press-lord father, Robert Maxwell, died in
1991 after falling into the Atlantic off his yacht, the Lady
Ghislaine -- was served with a subpoena on Sept. 22 at 6:45
p.m. as she was leaving the Clinton Global Initiatives
Conference at the Sheraton Hotel.

Florida lawyer Brad Edwards, who represents three of the
Jane Does who are suing Epstein, told Page Six that
Maxwell would be questioned over her knowledge of how
Epstein procured many of the girls.

Epstein is accused in the civil complaints of luring underage
girls to his mansion in Palm Beach to give him massages,
during which he allegedly engaged them in sexual activity and
paid them hundreds of dollars each. A grand jury indicted
Epstein on a charge of felony solicitation of prostitution.
Epstein, who pleaded guilty and did 12 months in prison, was
deposed last week in the offices of his lawyer, Jack
Goldberger.

Goldberger wouldn't comment, but a friend of Epstein said,
These [people bringing the complaint] are the lowest of the
lows in terms of ambulance-chasing lawyers. The trials are
scheduled to start in February.

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021349.txt,"As the classic American example
of fire-and-brimstone Protestant
preaching, “Sinners in the Hands of an
Angry God” depends, for its effect, on
anthropomorphism: ascribing human
form and attributes—hands, emotions,
and purposive agency—to nonhuman
phenomena. Anthropomorphism has
been a hotly debated feature of religion
since classical antiquity. But, in the
modern world, religious
anthropomorphism has become
especially controversial, while, at the
same time, also becoming a crucial
concept in modern theories about the
very nature of religion.” Modern
objections to anthropomorphism have
taken two major forms. First, traditions
within Judaism, Christianity, and Islam
have long opposed the worship of
“idols,” and regarded anthropomorphism
as a dangerous assault against genuine
piety and properly theological
understanding of existence. In the
modern period these religious objections
against anthropomorphism have
eventuated not only in sophisticated
intellectual polemics against
anthropomorphic concepts of God but
also in popular movements of
iconoclasm, which protested against
anthropomorphic representations of the
divine and sometimes physically
destroyed anthropomorphic images.
Second, the rise and development of
modern science has emphasized the
regularity of the processes that structure
the natural world. And even when these
orderly processes were described as
natural “laws”—a term with obvious
anthropomorphic connotations—they
have generally been understood in ways
that are thoroughly impersonal and
lacking any intrinsic purpose or design.
Hence, modern science has generated
numerous questions about religious

interpretations of influence on the course
of nature by divine ideas and purposes.
Since the late nineteenth century, many
instances of the so-called “warfare”
between science and theology have
turned on the issue of whether any
scientific plausibility could be attached
to concepts of a divine mind, purpose, or
intention that guided or ordered the
structure of the universe. According to
the philosopher Charles Taylor, the
transition from perceptions of a divinely
ordered, purposive universe to an
“impersonal order” of nature marked a
pivotal change that, especially since the
eighteenth century, has shaped “a secular
age” among the societies of the modern
West.” In short, anthropomorphism has
not only become a source of tension
within religions but also something of an
impasse between religious and scientific
interpretations of the universe.
Nonetheless, anthropomorphic
assumptions remain vigorously present
in many of the modern forms of
theology, spiritual practice, and religious
art, a persistence that suggests the
strength of the psychological and social
functions performed by
anthropomorphic representation.

In light of these longstanding
controversies about religious
anthropomorphism, the graphically
anthropomorphic, spider-dangling deity
of Edwards’s sermon would seem to
offer a good test case for understanding
how anthropomorphic religious language
works in the modern era. Such an
understanding begins with one of the
central themes of this book, namely, the
powerful human motivation to establish
and maintain social connections.
Anthropomorphism extends this drive
for social connection beyond the
boundaries of human societies by
attributing human characteristics to

Q&A on the USA, with a watchful eye on the risk of giant man-eating plants; Spain

However, there’s more of an effort at the state/local level to address this issue than at the Federal level. More than 40
states lowered pension benefit liabilities over the last 3 years according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Measures taken include raising employee contributions (while lowering employer payments), raising minimum retirement ages,
cutting post-employment healthcare benefits and in some cases, switching to defined contribution from defined benefit plans.

The good news, to paraphrase Mark Twain, is that reports of municipal bonds’ demise have been greatly exaggerated. From
1970 through to the end of 2011, municipal bonds rated by Moody’s experienced a grand total of 71 defaults among 17,700
issuers (11 of which occurred during 2010 and 2011). General obligation bonds accounted for 5 defaults; 29 were related to
housing; 22 for hospitals and healthcare; 3-4 each for education and infrastructure. Utilities and cities registered 2 each, while
counties, special districts, and water & sewer and experienced | each. The average recovery for defaulted munis was 65%,
compared to 49% on corporate senior unsecured bonds. Last comment on municipals: while /ocal tax collections are weak due
to the collapse in home prices, state tax collections have been increasing for 7 quarters in a row.

OK, so the US economy is improving, but is still heavily dependent on monetary and fiscal stimulus to grow, and the only belt-
tightening one can find is at the state and local level. Since 2009, after equities collapsed and bond prices rose, how have many
investors reacted?

By selling more equities and buying a lot more bonds. See chart above (a global version of this chart looks roughly the same).

Have investors been positioning this way since stocks are expensive?

Not really. Insert a giant martini glass on the chart below from 1998 to 2001 (I hate using simple averages which include

periods when the market had lost its collective mind). The current P/E multiple is in the middle of the ex-bubble range of the

last 25 years. Some bank stocks look interesting, even after accounting for reliance on shrinking loan loss reserves to drive

income, and ongoing regulatory uncertainty. Most US banks are at or close to Basel 3 funding needs, have considerably fewer

capital adequacy questions than their European counterparts, and do not rely on wholesale funding to finance loan portfolios.

get ever closer to the core, to perform even that atomic level hacking, tells us
something about just how much power is locked up in those central cores where
this information accumulates. The 2600 hz whistle was, it seems, only the first of an
endless series of battles for control of the roots and trunklines of modern power.

All around us today, huge power accumulates to certain irreplaceable cores. We
know this is a problem of connected age design: Giant search engines, certain
algorithms, database or communications protocols overmaster us because they can
gather so much data, so fast, and process it with unique fidelity. What makes a city?
urban scholars often ask. We might wonder: What makes a platform for network
power? The answer to both questions is the same: Density.15? If the first cities of
Aztecs or Mesopotamiaman civilization differed from early tribal clusters because of
their density, the same is true for our first platforms of instant connection. Facebook
is denser than AOL ever was. More people, more data, thicker connections. Future
platforms will be denser still. And if cities and density were once sadly
unanticipated accelerants to plague, poverty and revolution, we should be aware of
the risks of our own tight-clustered centers of dense connection. The security of
these cores that link us to each other and our essential data - when jacked by
hackers, by companies, or even by fast algorithms we don’t understand - is
important not merely because of the possibility of total control a breach might
represent, but because they show us the very fact of such totalizing control exists.
To infect, surprise, sicken - all this is alluringly possible and dreamable for anyone
with a hunger for mastery. Imagine if you knew your government could be switched
instantly and invisibly to malice. (Or, to effectiveness!) Or picture a nation of
connected citizens wired for flash-started nationalism and hate. Such a possibility
exists on linked systems. This potential for total, weird control of the cores - and
thus total control of anyone connected to them - should force us to wonder a bit.
Every evil thing beats in those central nodes: The power to manipulate, to master, to
destroy even. With such access I can change what you know about the world, how
you vote, where your money sits, what you remember, how soon we spot (or don’t)
a slipped knot in your DNA.

“Just like every drinking binge ends at vodka, so every hacking session ends at
kernel.org” Thomas Dullien, the mathematician and good-guy hacker who won a
Pwnie in 2015 for lifetime security achievement, observed once!54. So much power
in a connected system lies at its root: Kernel.org, for instance, is the reference copy
for LINUX computer code that powers most digital machines on earth, sort of like
the original DNA of the net. To manipulate Kernel.org would be to reach into the
very spine of the Internet. If the aim is control, if it is to find and exploit the most
fundamental of cracks in the surface of the black boxes, to get even deeper inside,

of Epstein’s trafficking in young girls for sexual abuse, Edwards had Brunel served in New York
for deposition. See Notice of Deposition of Jean Luc Brunel attached hereto as Exhibit “II.”
Before the deposition took place, Brunel’s attorney (Tama Kudman of West Palm Beach)
contacted Edwards to delay the deposition date. Eventually Kudman informed Edwards in
January 2009 that Brunel had left the country and was back in France with no plans to return.
This information was untrue; Brunel was actually staying with Epstein in West Palm Beach. See
Banasiak deposition, deposition attachment #16 at 154-160 and 172-175; see also pages from
Epstein's probation file evidenelne Jean Luc Brunel. (JLB) staying at his house during that
relevant period of time attached Exhibit “JJ”. As a result, Edwards filed a Motion for Contempt,
attached hereto as Exhibit “KK” (Because Epstein settled this case, the motion was never ruled
upon.)

Rabuyo (Epstein’s housekeeper), Nadia Marcinkova (Epstein’s live-in sex slave), Ghislaine
Maxwell (manager of Epstein’s affairs and businesses), Mark Epstein (Epstein’s brother), and
Fane Banasiak (Epstein’s house manager) It was nearly impossible to take a deposition of

of plots of all kinds: including that of wanting to replace Italians with immigrants in order to have
labour at low cost. A mantra repeated in the past on Twitter also by the current Minister of the Interior
Matteo Salvini.

The ambition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site Breitbart — which in the
European campaign preceded him since the platform had already opened bureaux in London and Rome
— is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great “populist international” of which he has long
since been dreaming.

The Movement, in fact, intends to function as an extreme right-wing think tank: a source of strategic
advice to channel the not-so-politically structured discontent of the most extreme European movements.
Analysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and channeling funding.

The aim is to create a populist alliance, a sort of “super group” that if victorious can conquer up to a
third of the European Parliament in the elections next May.

Indeed — putting the common policy of the Old Continent in the hands of Bannon and his own. The
American strategist is very attached to the Freedom Caucus — the extreme right of the US Congress —
and in 2014 he was at the top of the Cambridge Analytica company, which in 2016 used data stolen
from Facebook to try to influence the presidential election from which Donald Trump emerged victor.
It is not a mystery that for a long time he courts nationalists of the right from East to West. And he has
already met, among others, the Hungarian Orban, the French Marine Le Pen and the former leader of
the British separatists Nigel Farage. The latter reappeared, coincidentally, on Friday in Pennsylvania,
USA, to a fundraiser in favor of the Republican congressman Lou Barletta. Without forgetting the
Italians of Lega and 5 stars. Of them, he said: If it works in Italy, we can import the model anywhere”.

The Movement, which for now will count on a staff of 10 people, will be fully operational in 2019. In
short, after the American midterm elections, where Bannon is fighting to influence the primaries
supporting candidates potentially able to undermine the prospects of Republican establishment. But in
the future the former spin doctor says he wants to spend more and more time in Europe. Also because
the relationships with Trump have worsened after the revelations he made to Michael Wolff and
published in the scandal book “Fire and Fury”. “Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Paradise,”
Bannon says now paraphrasing the Satan of one of his favorite books, John Milton's Lost Paradise. Hell
in this case would be the dear old Europe and its democratic values. The “army of darkness” is already
among us.

MC2 Modeling Agency Involved In Sex Trafficking

August 11,2010

On August 4th Jezebel ran the following story: The Sex-Trafficking Model Scout.

Perhaps most disturbing, in terms of possible sex trafficking, was Epstein's relationship with Jean
Luc Brunel, owner of the MC2 modeling agency. According to a complaint filed in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of Florida, an alleged victim said that Epstein, [assistant
and girlfriend Ghislaine] Maxwell, Brunel, [house manager Alfredo] Rodriguez, and Marcinkova
‘deliberately engaged in a pattern of racketeering that involved luring minor children through
MC2, mostly girls under the age of 17, to engage in sexual play for money.

The previous paragraph in the story read:

and making [speaking of Jeffrey Epstein] frequent $100,000 donations to the Palm Beach Police
Department would insulate him from prosecution for his various depravities.

Which included, for the record: buying a 14-year-old Yugloslavian named Natalia Marcinkova
from her parents in order to keep Marcinkova as his sex slave: paying a retinue of women to
trawl Palm Beach for teenagers economically desperate enough to agree to give Epstein

massages that often led to sexual contact; receiving two 12-year-old French girls as a birthday
present; and befriending Michael Wolff.

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025522.txt,"“You are part of a worldwide movement that is bigger than France, bigger than Italy, bigger than Hungary,
bigger than all that,” Bannon told French populists.

Bannon showed that he “dominates the mood against the ‘elites,’ the ‘establishment’ and the ‘perverse system’
of greedy corporations and banks, and of course also against the press, which is led around ‘like a dog on the
Leash,’” Stamper writes.

And now he Mr. Bannon setting himself up as an instigator, if not an outright shepherd, of a movement that
crosses borders, languages and parties.

“Bannon is a master of apocalyptic rhetoric,” Stamper continues, effortlessly weaving together nationalist
interests with an international populist movement.

The American strategist showed his “true caliber” by expounding modern methods of political freedom
through blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies, Stamper said, leaving many of his hearers behind.
Bannon has demonstrated that if the right wants to rule the future, “it must dominate modern themes and
rhetorically position them,” he added.

Aspiring to be far more than an uncle who tells stories to his nephews of how he won the fight for the White
House, Stamper writes, “Bannon wants to become the super godfather of the international right.”

Although Bannon often looks a bit disheveled, “he should not be underestimated,” the writer warns. Past
business partners attribute impressive “strategic foresight” to the eccentric tactician, saying he was often “three
or four steps ahead” of his opponents in business. Because of his phenomenal memory, his nickname is “the
encyclopedia,” Stamper notes with a certain reverence, and in his speeches he will spontaneously cite
“forgotten thinkers, known only to a handful of specialists.”

“Bannon brings with him exclusive knowledge of power from the very heart of power,” Stamper writes, which
he will bring to bear on Europe’s fragmented populist populism.

According to Stamper, Bannon has established his “European headquarters” in Italy, from where he intends to
galvanize European populists.

The Italian political situation is completely to his liking, Stamper declares, with a political landscape
“dominated by populists, right-wing ideologues and the political puppeteer Berlusconi.”

Q&A on the USA, with a watchful eye on the risk of giant man-eating plants; Spain
What is The Day of the Triffids?

It’s a 1951 science fiction novel. There’s a meteor shower, and most people go outside to look at it. The next morning,
everyone who looked at the meteor shower ends up blind, and Earth is taken over by giant man-eating venomous plants. The
point: some amazing events which look benign have unforeseen consequences. Will a pact of going for growth pay the
freight of higher Federal debt in the long run? Hard to say; there are not a lot of examples to draw from. Economic theories and
their associated debt bubbles don’t always work out as planned’. After WWII, the US also faced a debt ratio of 80% of GDP.
Austerity was not the answer back then; government receipts and outlays as a % of GDP did not change much during the 1950’s,
and net debt was flat. So how did US debt/GDP fall from 80% to 46% in just ten years? Robust annualized real growth of
more than 4.0%, and 2.0% inflation. However, unique economic conditions and productivity gains of the 1950’s (e.g., interstate
highway, rebuilding of Europe and Japan) may not be repeated, and the country was not headed into an entitlement time bomb.
If the US does not experience a growth/productivity boom, the burden of higher debt could last for a generation or more. A pro-
growth Administration would probably help, but the difficulty lay in defining exactly what that means.

Isn’t it amazing? 1950’s debt reduction was based on growth, not austerity

Are there debt vs austerity parallels at the state and local level?

Yes and no. At the state and local level, over last decade, more than 1 trillion in unfunded pension and healthcare (OPEB)
related liabilities were recognized (they were accrued over a longer period). Even these “as-reported” estimates, which come
from the states, may be underestimated. A 2011 analysis by the Joint Economic Committee shows that lower portfolio return
assumptions on pension assets sharply increase the magnitude of underfunded pensions (see chart, right)’.

' Example: here’s a link to a 2007 article by Austan Goolsbee, former Chairman of the Council of Economic advisors and a member of the
Obama Cabinet. Goolsbee praises the benefits of subprime lending and related affordable housing policies, mocks Congress for holding
hearings on the subject and cites Federal Reserve papers in saying that the “mortgage market has become more perfect, not more
irresponsible”. Some things are only clear in hindsight. http:/Awww.nytimes.com/2007/03/29/business/29scene.html?_r=2

fee] the same reading over stories of zero-day attacks, clever hacks like
“rowhammer’” or the Tel Aviv heat hack. You can distill from each tale of a broken,
once-secure systems an essential principle: The hackers rush always, relentlessly at
the central core of a system. They aim to make it weird, to manipulate it madly from
the inside out. Network power doesn’t merely come from that 10 million device-per-
day spread of global connectivity, after all, it also comes from incredible
concentration of power inside certain systems we all rely on: Chips, data bases,
centralized and gatekept platforms. Control of such hubs and roots of our world can
influence everything; little wonder they are such an appealing target. “The
conventional belief that all nuclear systems are ‘air gapped’ is a myth,” the Russian
security researcher Eugene Kaspersky has warned. The result: “There are three
types of people: Scared to death. Opportunists. Don’t care.”151

This sense that the systems are so vulnerable if you can get to their hearts is what
lures hackers ever deeper, into the code kernels where the most basic instructions
are decided. That they can often make machines weird by using the device’s own
code against them, like some sort of autoimmune disease, is only a marker of the
particular perversity of the problem here. Security researchers call such holes
“vulnerabilities” in a system, but of course they are much more than weak spots.
They are potentially fatal. In a way, the hot rush to touch and tickle and maliciously
use these already waiting cancers reveals to us the essential Seventh Sense secret of
the Warez Dudes: Connection makes an object vulnerable, yes; but it can also reveal
the possibility of total control, of the fundamental root mastery of a connected
system. Such a hole, when it is exposed by connection and then corruption, can be
complete in the scope of its damage, devastating. Lord Acton’s famous line that
“Absolute power corrupts absolutely,” twists in this age to something like “Absolute
access corrupts absolutely.” Connection makes total exploitation, total control,
possible.

Every new generation of connected technologies is breeding essential black boxes,
complex (not merely complicated!) containers filled with algorithmic levers and
code tools for digital work that can be understood by only a few people, and
exploited and used effectively — for good or ill - by a still smaller group. “The greater
the dependence on a technology the greater the need to study and expose its inner
workings,” one group of radical digital activists has argued in The Critical
Engineering Manifesto. 52 They mean that as we turn our safety, freedom, and health
over to a world of devices and their makers, we must know what goes on inside the
very heart of such systems. It’s not merely that everything is connected now; it’s

Anthropomorphism: Human
Connection to a Universal Society

When Jonathan Edwards, an
angular New England minister in his late

| The lead author, Clark Gilpin, Ph.D., is the
Margaret E. Burton Professor of the History of
Christianity at the University of Chicago
Divinity School. Clark studies the cultural
history of theology in England and America
from the seventeenth century to the present.
From 1990 to 2000, he served as dean of the
Divinity School, and from 2000 to 2004 he
directed the Martin Marty Center, the Divinity
School’s institute for advanced research in all
fields of the academic study of religion. His
current research projects include a book with the
working title Alone with the Alone: Solitude in
American Religious and Literary History, which
explores ways in which the spiritual discipline of
solitary writing—autobiographic narratives,
journals, and letters—shaped the careers of
major New England intellectuals of the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

Anthropomorphic representations of
God make many modern people very nervous,
including many religious people. Attributing
human-like ideas and emotions to the
comprehending powers of the universe not only
seems out of step with modern science but also a
presumptuous confinement of the world within
merely human needs and capacities. Yet, the
impulse to speak anthropomorphically about our
“ultimate environment” has vigorously persisted
into the modern age. Rather than dismissing
anthropomorphism as an outmoded way of
thinking, this essay adopts a historical approach
to rethink why anthropomorphism exhibits this
perennial capacity to focus the human ethical
imagination on our relations with and obligations
to the universe within which we live.

thirties, mounted the narrow steps into
the pulpit on July 8, 1741, the sermon he
was about to preach would become one
of the most famously electrifying
orations in American history, “Sinners in
the Hands of an Angry God.” Edwards
preached this sermon during the massive
transatlantic religious revival that gave
rise to Methodism in England and came
to be known in the American colonies as
“the Great Awakening.” This was not
the familiar pulpit of his congregation in
Northampton, Massachusetts, but rather
the church at Enfield, a town that had
gained notoriety for stubbornly resisting
the exhortations of previous preachers of
spiritual awakening. From his scriptural
text—“‘their foot shall slide in due time”
(Deut. 32: 35)—Edwards drew the
doctrine that “there is nothing that keeps
wicked men, at any one moment, out of
hell, but the mere pleasure of God.”
Sinners living here and now, Edwards
declared, were “the objects of that very
same anger and wrath of God, that is
expressed in the torments of hell,” and
that wrath was an annihilating fire that
already “burns against them; their
damnation does not slumber; the pit is
prepared; the fire is made ready...to
receive them.” In a notorious image,
Edwards portrayed God dangling the
sinner’s soul over the fires of hell like a
spider on a single, slender filament of its
web. The sermon achieved stunning
results, as recorded in the diary of one of
those present, Stephen Williams:

“before the sermon was done, there was
a great moaning and crying out
throughout the whole house—what shall
I do to be saved; oh, I am going to hell;
oh, what shall I do for a Christ.” The
“shrieks and cries were piercing and
amazing,” Williams reported, and the
scene was so tumultuous that Edwards _
had to stop before finishing his sermon.’

ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY

3) WAR & PEACE
Al, Military Systems, and Stability

(Contributions from Eric Horvitz, Elon Musk, Stuart Russell, others)

Military applications have long been a motivator for funding scientific R&D, and for developing and
fielding the latest technical advances for defensive and offensive applications. We can expect to see a
rise in the use of Al advances by both state and non-state actors in both strategic and tactical uses, and
in wartime and peace. Al advances have implications for symmetric and asymmetric military
operations and warfare, including terrorist attacks. Advances in such areas as machine learning,
sensing and sensor fusion, pattern recognition, inference, decision making, and robotics and
cyberphysical systems, will increase capabilities and, in many cases, lower the bar of entry for groups
with scarce resources. Al advances will enable new kinds of surveillance, warfighting, killing, and
disruption and can shift traditional balances of power.

Two areas of concern taken together frame troubling scenarios:

e Competitive pressures pushing militaries to invest in increasingly fast-paced situation assessment
and responses that tend to push out human oversight, and lead to increasing reliance on
autonomous sensing, inference, planning, and action.

e Rise of powerful Al-power planning, messaging, and systems by competitors, adversaries, and
third parties that can prompt war intentionally or inadvertently via sham or false signaling and
news.

The increasing automation, coupled with time-critical sensing and response required to dominate, and
failure to grapple effectively with false signals are each troubling, but taken together appear to bea
troubling mix with potentially grave outcomes on the future of the world.

Concerning scenarios can be painted that involve that start of a large-scale war among adversaries via
inadequate human oversight in a time-pressured response situation after receiving signals or a
sequence of signals about an adversary’s actions or intentions. The signal can be either be well-
intentioned, but an unfortunate false positive or an intentionally generated signal (e.g., statement by
leader or weapons engagement) e.g., designed and injected by a third party to ignite a war. Related
scenarios can occur based in destabilization when an adversary believes that systems on the other side
can be foiled due to Al-powered attacks on military sensing, weapons, coupled with false signaling
aimed at human decision makers.

A US DOD directive of 2012 (3000.09) specifies a goal (for procuring weapon systems) of assuring that
autonomous and semi-autonomous weapon systems are designed to allow commanders and operators
to exercise appropriate levels of human judgment over the use of force. The directive seeks meaningful
human controls. However, it is unclear how this goal can be met with the increasing stime-critical
pressures for sensing and responses, and competition for with building the most effective weapon

JUDGE TO RULE ON SEALED PLEA-DEAL PAPERS TODAY Palm Beach Daily News June 25, 2009 Thursday

Radaronline.com has reported that Epstein has secretly been helping the feds unravel a Ponzi scheme related to
the June 2008 indictment of two former managers of Bear Stearns Mortgage Investment Fund.

Epstein's rep, Howard Rubenstein, confirmed last year that Epstein is Major Investor No. 1 in the indictment,
which says he lost about $57 million.

Goldberger could not be reached for comment.

The Manhattan money manager has been incarcerated since June 30, when he pleaded guilty to the two felony
counts. As part of the plea agreement, Epstein must serve one year of house arrest after his release and register as a life-
long sex offender.

In addition to the criminal case, there are more than a dozen civil lawsuits -- both state and federal -- pending
against Epstein. All contain similar allegations: Epstein, through his employees and assistants, brought minor girls to his
Palm Beach home on El Brillo Way for erotic massages and sometimes sex.

Re: Ms. Immigration Application 
Dear Sir or Madam: 
I am writing this letter on behalf of Ms. and in 
connection with her 0-1 Visa Application. 
My name is David Blaine and I am a magician, an illusionist and an 
endurance artist. I am known for my high-profile feats of endurance, and 
have made my name as a performer of street and close-up magic. I have 
performed all over the world and have set and broken several world records, 
including holding my breath for more than 17 minutes, spending 35 hours 
atop a 105-foot pole and surviving a week buried in a coffin. I have traveled 
internationally performing magic privately for President Bill Clinton and 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, President George W. Bush, Secretary of 
Defense Donald Rumsfeld at the Pentagon, Governor Arnold 
Schwarzenegger, Henry Kissinger, Bill Gates and Mayor Michael Bloomberg. 
I have also performed magic for the President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev, 
the President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili, the President of Ukraine Victor 
Yanukovych, and the President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev. 
I met a few years ago through mutual friends 
and I was highly impressed with her: I first met her as an amazing fashion 
model, but, then, I discovered her intelligence, education, and her passion for 
children and education. So, when I saw the other side of Svet, performing her 
own brand of magic in fundraisers and other high end charitable events and 
organizations, I realized what an amazingly talented public relations and 
fundraising expert she is, and I was not surprised the least. 
When it comes to organizing events, finding A-list funders for her 
causes, in my opinion, is at the top of her game and is a true magician — 
the success stories she pulled for the children on the US Virgin Islands, the 
Ivory Coast, and many others are true miracles. She really makes a difference 
in the lives of the world's children. 
It is not easy to raise money for education, especially technical/ STEM 
education: People only reach into their pockets with the correct enticement. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 019086 
And not everyone is inclined to support the same causes. A fundraiser and 
public relations expert of extraordinary ability recognizes this — can find, 
target, and approach the correct people for their cause, and then recruit them 
with the correct individual enticements. Repeating myself, this is a very 
difficult thing to pull off. was able to pull this off amazingly, not only 
with great efficiency and success, but with also great ease and grace; and she 
is on a roll— and it doesn't look like she will stop anytime soon. 
These are my qualified opinions: I am no stranger to raising money for 
children. Every year, I travel all across the country and the world to perform 
magic for children's hospital wards, burn units and juvenile wards, including 
Spofford, Bridges, Horizon, and Crossroads. I spent time performing magic 
for Paul Newman and the children diagnosed with serious illnesses at the 
Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, among many other charitable activities. 
I've been discussing with how we can work together in raising 
money for children and education. Therefore, I wholeheartedly support her 
visa application. If her visa application is approved, I don't see why we 
wouldn't combine our unique forms of magic and help the world's children! 
Please feel free to contact me if you have any further questions or 
concerns. 
Best Regards, 
David Blaine

Jean-Michel Saliba
MLI (UK)
jean-michel.saliba@baml.com

The Saudi Vision 2030 and National Transformation Plan (NTP) present a
comprehensive roadmap for change and augur for committed diversification efforts, in
our view. Announced reforms can help sustain higher potential growth if fully realized as
new sectoral sources of growth are developed. Positively, the NTP borrows elements
from other successful strategic case studies. Still, we find a number of targets
ambitious or unrealistic on the fiscal and diversification fronts, and the sequencing and
details of the fiscal measures are left nebulous.

In terms of the other pillars of the macro view, namely energy and Fx policy, the NTP
presents a mixed picture, in our view. Energy policy is likely to be less aggressive, as the
NTP suggests a constant oil production capacity. To remain consistent with the targeted
government debt accumulation path, we estimate that oil prices have to average at least
US$50/bbI in 2016-20 along with no growth in spending (excluding the additional cost
of NTP initiatives). Partial implementation could require oil prices of cUS$65/bbl.

Fiscal consolidation remains imperative to support the Fx peg, in line with stability and
economic imperatives. However, as diversification progresses, the case for increased Fx
flexibility to support competitiveness could likely gradually take shape. Policy-making
growth-focused plans may conflict with needs to deflate Fx demand in the economy.

Towards better governance

The comprehensive economic blueprint unveiled by the Saudi Vision 2030 and the
National Transformation Plan (NTP) confirms the economic reform credentials of the
current administration. It is likely to improve government culture, accountability and
transparency, in our view. The NTP will be implemented across 24 government bodies
and has been presented through a number of press conferences with high-level
ministerial presentations. The Governance Framework details steps to institutionalize
and coordinate implementation through restructuring the government. It proposes a
number of committees and bodies to report to the Council for Economic and
Development Affairs (CEDA). It also introduces an escalation mechanism to rapidly
resolve bottlenecks, which could see matters escalated to CEDA in 42 days.

A wide-ranging policy-making reshuffle

In line with ongoing Saudi Vision 2030 implementation efforts, a wide-ranging
restructuring of the Saudi Cabinet and government bodies was announced in May to
drive change in the government. King Salman issued 51 Royal Decrees restructuring the
Cabinet, various government bodies and appointing a number of officials into various
government roles. A statement concurrently issued by the Royal Court suggested these
changes are in line with the recently announced Saudi Vision 2030 and aim to support
its implementation. This follows from the January 2015 restructuring of the bodies
affiliated to the Council of Ministers, which saw the creation of CEDA and the Council
for Political and Security Affairs. We list a few major changes below.

New Oil Minister represents technocratic experience and policy continuity

The appointment of Khalid Al-Falih to the Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mineral
Resources is not surprising, given that former Minister of Petroleum and Mineral
Resources Al-Naimi has previously suggested he was approaching retirement due to old
age. Al-Falih’s appointment continues the tradition of non-Royals heading the Ministry,
while simultaneously holding the Chairmanship role of Saudi Aramco. Furthermore,
according to local press, Al-Falih appears close to Deputy Crown Prince Mohamed bin
Salman, and his appointment likely confirms the recently assertive Royal influence over
energy policy, in our view. New Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources Al-
Falih’s past official pronouncements are consistent with stable Saudi energy policy, in
our view.

Jeffrey and Ghislaine: Notes on New York's Oddest Alliance 
<http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2011/03/notes- on-new-yorks-oddest- couple-j effrey- ep stein- and-
ghislaine-maxwell.html > 
by Vicky Ward <http://www.vanityfair.com/contributors/vicky- ward> 
March 8, 2011, 2:30 PM 
I've got a story idea for you. The rebuilding of Indonesia. Or New Orleans. Or both. Go there. I've just been. 
You will never think the same way about anything again. 
So spoke not Bill or Melinda Gates, but Ghislaine Maxwell, the 48-year-old woman being written up 
everywhere at the moment as the alleged procurer of young women for billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. 
Epstein, 57, is the financier who spent a year in jail on charges of soliciting prostitutes—and now there is talk of 
another investigation because various women, now in their twenties and thirties, have come forward with 
allegations that he molested them when they were under-age. The allegations first surfaced in British 
newspapers, which have zeroed in on Epstein's friendship with Prince Andrew, who has recently tried to 
publicly disassociate himself from his old pal. 
I wrote a piece for Vanity Fair in 2003 called The Talented Mr. Epstein. It was largely a business piece that 
focused on his mysterious exit from Bear Steams in 1981, his close relationships with Jimmy Cayne, Les 
Wexner, the chairman of Limited Brands, and above all, the man who claimed to be his mentor, Steven Jude 
Hoffenberg, who is currently serving a 20-year-jail sentence for bilking investors in Towers Financial out of 
$450 million. 
The piece alluded to Epstein's great friendship with Maxwell, and how she introduced him to young women 
with whom he had sexual relationships. But, in the end, the story didn't really go there, focusing instead on the 
issue that remains a mystery—how Jeffrey made his money, and how Ghislaine made hers. 
This is not to say I didn't hear stories about the girls. I did. But, not knowing quite who to believe, I 
concentrated on the intriguing financial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the same 
ones, different ones. And their stories are bone-chilling. Journalists from England have phoned—and, in one 
case, flown—to ask me about Epstein and Maxwell. Who is he? And the British, especially, want to know: 
Who is she? At this point, I am so bored of repeating myself to others—it was, after all, my 2003 Vanity 
Fairstory that really brought him into the limelight—that I have decided to write about this myself 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030414 
Bizarrely, perhaps, I have gotten to know Jeffrey and Ghislaine far better after my piece than before it. I kept 
running into both of them, separately, at parties. Jeffrey is not a social animal so he usually has a couple of 
young women with him who stand two feet behind him, as if serving a monarch. Do they speak? I remember 
asking him once, nodding at his lookalike blondes. He laughed. Not like you,Vicky, was his riposte. 
I remembered that when we'd once discussed math—in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed I 
hadn't studied math since I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a 
package at home via messenger. It was a book: Math for idiots. 
So he is not without humor, even though he doesn't drink or smoke, and hates restaurants. 
Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects, newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He 
was certainly preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few 
moments in his company and you know this to be true. 
When I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that 
Andy—as Jeffrey calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his 
strange title is. Because if one thing's for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what 
he's talking about far more than Andy does. Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other 
financiers hang out with him. 
And Ghislaine? 
Full disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It's almost impossible not to. 
She is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I've spent hours 
talking to her about the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is 
curious. She has spent weeks at the bottom of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent 
me a DVD of the fish there. Her rolodex would blow away almost anyone else's I can think of—probably even 
Rupert Murdochs'. She is very well-read and can talk about most things for hours. She is passionate about Bill 
Clinton with whom she is close friends. 
Yet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-
Platero, (known fondly to her close friends as the Tennis Goddess) Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When 
it comes down to things she really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her 
vulnerability. 
And that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey. 
He saved her, I remember a close friend of mine telling me. When her father died, she was a wreck; 
inconsolable. And then Jeffrey took her in. She's never forgotten that—and never will. 
In many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect 
replacement for her father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his 
sexual pecadillos, but then Ghislaine's father was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving 
a massive black hole he'd fraudulently created. To Ghislaine, Jeffrey's habits may not have seemed that 
strange. 
In fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful 
people in the end either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl issues, 
and moved countries to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You don't 
tend to get to the top by being the world's most balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett didn't 
quite manage a normal life—whatever that is. He had a second wife for many years whose existence he has 
been open about. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030415 
So what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven't spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her 
loyalty to friends like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she'll be out and about as always. 
Look at Waksal and Stewart. No one sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up 
for all sorts of blemishes.

Instead a plurality of investors viewed AXP’s strategy as appropriate in light of the

concerned about the duration of the credit cycle, AXP emphasized its low loss rates

Registered as a level 3 sex offender, Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting underage girls for sex at his El Brillo Way home

lawsuits with young women for undisclosed amounts.

the same for the risk-averse.

It seems to me that the omnibus fund would do both jobs at once, and would attract
more clients collectively. Bigger is better for payment processing. The more clients,
the more “two-sided” payments from one client to another. These payments are

always cheapest.

If accounts cost little or nothing to open, vendors would logically need no urging to
open them. That again favors the simplicity and economy and immediacy of two-

sided payments by including both buyers and sellers within the fund.

The omnibus fund is also for everyone as a investor as well as a payer. Very few
people have the time or training to beat the market. I myself have not. What we have
is a sense of our degree of risk-aversion. The omnibus fund gives the broadest and
most flexible coverage of risk appetites. It can poll and advise clients on risk

preferences, and mediate hedges and exposures to suit.

How the Omnibus Fund Might Evolve

I said that if] were a couple of decades younger, I would start an omnibus fund. Not

to worry. If the idea holds water, as I think, someone else will.

It seems to me that banks could not offer much competition. Demand deposits
typically pay no interest, and process payments no better. Omnibus clients offer an

infinite range of returns according to client tolerance for risk.

Banks offer the advantage of federal deposit insurance (FDIC). It will not be enough.
The omnibus fund carries no leverage, and needs no insurance. As it grows, banks
will take notice. They can keep up the uneven fight, or they can join the parade. My
working assumption is that many will prefer the latter. Banks are well positioned to

make the most of the idea. They have the needed expertise and systems and

Global growth
is showing
broad-based
signs of
improvement.

2 UBS

Economy

Global growth is showing broad-based signs of improvement, supported by decisive
monetary policy from the world's major central banks. In the US, the housing market
recovery continues and the labor market remains on a modest uptrend. This has helped
improve the sentiment of US consumers, and consumption remains the most important
contributor to US GDP growth. Growth has also begun to pick up in key areas of the
emerging markets, including China and Brazil. While the Eurozone economy remains weak,
we expect Q3 2012 to mark the bottom, and that growth will begin to get less bad from
Q4 2012.

Equities

Equity markets have been supported by central bank action and the recent improvements
in economic data. Our preferred markets remain the US and Emerging Markets (EM).
Investor funds have started to flow back into EM, as economic data is improving and
inflation remains under control. Canada and Australia remain our least favored regions
due to falling earnings.

Fixed Income

US high yield bonds remain supported by strong corporate fundamentals, modest
economic growth, and the broad demand for yield-generating assets. Given this, we see
potential for further spread tightening. Meanwhile, benchmark rates are expected to rise
gradually on better economic data, while short rates remain ultra-low. While investment
grade corporate bond spreads are approximately fair value, we continue to view their
absolute yields as attractive.

Commodities

We keep a neutral stance on commodities. Increased global liquidity has pushed prices up
over the last few months, however, for a more sustained price increase we likely need to
see further evidence of an acceleration in global growth.

Foreign Exchange

We remain underweight the Japanese yen. The Japanese economy continues to weaken
against its peers, leading to rising pressure for the Bank of Japan to engage in further
quantitative easing. We have closed our preference for the Canadian dollar following its
recent strength, and therefore close our offsetting short CHF position.

Envisioning and Addressing Adverse Outcomes

ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY

overall software security remains vulnerable: “vulnerabilities are dense” in production code, incentives
for securing loT systems are low, key vulnerabilities are stockpiled rather than globally patched. Using
machine learning the techniques for vulnerability detection are increasingly sophisticated but opaque.

At some point adaptive cyber defense/offense systems become scalable so they can take over
vulnerable systems. More aggressive actors combine these systems with botnet functionality and
retaliatory responses (e.g. counter-hacking or DDoS attacks) to protect themselves. Since vulnerability
discovery is scalable, as they spread and acquire more resources they become more effective. At this
point an external cause (e.g. cyberattacks due to an international conflict) or just chance cause
aggressive systems to begin large-scale cyberwarfare. This triggers other systems to join in. Some
attacks disrupt command-and-control links, producing self-replicating independent systems.

All together this leads to a massive degradation of the functionality of the Internet and modern society.
Defeating the evolving cyberwarfare systems is hard without taking essential parts of society offline for
an extended time - made doubly difficult due to the international stresses unleashed by the outbreak,
which in some cases spill over into real-world conflicts and economic crashes. But without a decisive
way of cleaning systems the problem will be persistent until entirely new secure infrastructure can be
built at a great cost.

HUMAN DIMENSION OF CYBERSECURITY: Al FOR SOCIAL ENGINEERING

Beyond direct effects on computing systems, rising concerns include the use of Al methods for social
engineering to gain access to system authentication information. For example, recent work
demonstrated the use of an iterative machine learning and optimization loop for spear phishing on
Twitter. There are concerns with Al leveraging one of the weakest links in cybersecurity: people and
their actions.

DISCUSSION

What are key threats ahead and how might they be addressed with new designs? How might we
thwart the risk of Al for guiding “social engineering” of attacks and release of information? What are
concrete proposals for best practices for thwarting Al for cyberattacks, including highlighting of areas
where more research is needed?

Manny Farber and you.

By the time I'd gotten incrementally better as a cartoonist in the first half of the 1970s I was regularly
doing illustrations for soft-core fiction stories in Cavalier’s low-rent _ sister
mags, Dude, Gent and Nugget (even wrote a story or two there and got several of my San Francisco
comix cronies (Spain Rodriguez, Bill Griffith and Justin Greene) illustration gigs with Alan for those

mags as well.

I was first invited into the mag to do two full-color comix pages in 1969 (when being printed in
color was a Very Big Deal for me as was Getting Paid more than 25 bucks for a drawing), somehow
in proximity to a big article on underground comix. They were running some Crumb “Fritz the Cat”
pages. All thanx to their hip, laid back and kind editor LeMond. I also did some gag cartoons, short
strips and occasional illustrations for Cavalier (one especially bad drawing for a story by Bruce Jay

Friedman).

My work in 1969, as an apprentice underground cartoonist taking too many drugs was really, really
awful so I'm grateful for the editor's hip and laid-back kindness. By the time I'd gotten incrementally
better as a cartoonist in the first half of the 1970s I was regularly doing illustrations for soft-core

serialized from 1980 to 1991. It depicts Spiegelman interviewing his father about his experiences

represents Jews as mice, Germans as cats, and Poles as pigs. In 1992, Maus won a Pulitzer Prize. |

a great deal more offensive than saying Eleanor has lovely nay-nays.”

On October 13, 1965 (Lenny's 40 birthday), instead of surrendering
to the authorities in New York, he filed suit at the U.S. District Court in San
Francisco to keep out of prison, and he got himself officially declared a
pauper. Two months before his death in 1966, Lenny wrote to me: “I'm
still working on the bust of the government of New York State.” And he
included his doodle of Christ nailed to a crucifix, with a speech balloon
asking, “Where the hell is the ACLU?”

After he died, at a séance, his mother brought his old faded denim
jacket. That large safety pin was still attached to it. And at the funeral, his
sound engineer friend dropped Lenny's microphone into his grave before
the dirt was piled on. Lenny's problem had been that he wanted to talk on
stage with the same freedom that he had in his living room. That problem
doesn’ t happen to stand-up comedians any more.

As for me, I’ m working on my long awaited (by me) first novel. It’s
about a contemporary Lenny Bruce-type satirist. Those scenes where my
protagonist performs, I’ve developed onstage myself, although at times it felt

like I was actually channeling Lenny, until the day that he said, ““C’mon, Paul,

following its discovery that he had committed a possible “Reg D” violation—evidently he had
lent money to his closest friend. (In the 1989 deposition he said that he’d lent approximately
$20,000 to Warren Eisenstein, to buy stock.) Such an action could have been considered
improper, although Epstein claimed he had not realized this until afterward.

According to Epstein, Bear Stearns management had questioned him about the loan around
March 4. The questioners, Epstein said, were Michael (Mickey) Tarnopol and Alvin Einbender.
In his 1989 deposition Epstein recalled that the partner who had made an “issue” of the matter
was Marvin Davidson. On March 9, Epstein said, he had met with Tarnopol and Einbender
again, and the two partners told him that the executive committee had weighed the offense,
together with previous “carelessness” over expenses, and he would be fined $2,500.

“There was discussion whether, in fact, I had ever put in an airline ticket for someone else and
not myself and I said that it was possible, ... since my secretary handles my expenses,” Epstein
told the S.E.C. In his 1989 testimony he stated that the “Reg D” incident had cost him a shot at
partnership that year.

What the S.E.C. seemed to be especially interested in was whether there was a connection
between Epstein’s leaving and the alleged insider trading in St. Joe Minerals by other people at
Bear Stearns:

Q: Sir, are you aware that certain rumors may have been circulating around your firm in
connection with your reasons for leaving the firm?

A: I’m aware that there were many rumors.

Q: What were the rumors you heard?

A: Nothing to do with St. Joe.

Q: Can you relate what you heard?

A: It was having to do with an illicit affair with a secretary.

Q: Have you heard any other rumors suggesting that you had made a presentation or
communication to the Executive Committee concerning alleged improprieties by other members
or employees of Bear Stearns?

A: I, in fact, have heard that rumor, but it’s been from Mr. Harris in our conversation last week.
Q: Have you heard it from anyone else?

A: No.

From: Boris Nikolic 
To: Jeffrey Epstein (jeevacation@gmail.com) <jeevacation@gmail.com>; 
Philanthropy — Full text articles 
Revealed: the world's most admired people 
Stephan Shakespeare —Times 
Bill Gates is the most admired person in the world. 
according to a global survey for The Times by YouGov. The man who many 
see as responsible for the democratisation of computing and who is the biggest activist philanthropist across the globe is 
highly regarded everywhere. 
In his home, America, he ranks only 5th, behind Pope Francis, President Obama, Billy Graham, and George W. Bush. Mr 
Obama and the Pope have a strong lead in Western nations but Mr Gates is highly regarded in every country polled, from 
Brazil to Egypt, Nigeria to Indonesia, Britain to Russia to Australia. He tops the poll in China — as respondents there said: He 
got into a good university, but gave up studying to start his business. He has become a rich man despite dropping out of school 
... He has a successful career and a caring heart — he is ordinary, but great. 
The Queen came highest in Britain and second in Australia, but didn't make the Indian top ten. Nevertheless she is the most 
admired woman in the world, in 17th place, closely followed by Angelina Jolie and Oprah Winfrey. 
Half of the top ten admired in Russia are women, including the pop singer Alla Pugacheva and the Queen. That is the highest 
figure in all countries surveyed — women are strikingly under-represented. 
Some light is shed on this by comparing our results with a recent Gallup poll in America, which asked for most admired man 
and woman in separate questions. In that poll, Bill Clinton scored 2 per cent and Hillary Clinton 15. YouGov asked a single 
question, not differentiating men and women, and the two Clintons rated about the same. The two polls also show the power of 
the media to direct public attention: Gallup polled early in December, and Pope Francis was most admired by only 4 per cent. 
By the time of the YouGov survey, Time magazine had made him its Person of the Year, and he shot up to 21 per cent. 
Business leaders did well in general. YouGov puts Sir Richard Branson 4th in Britain, the Hong Kong billionaire Sir Li Kashing 
was sixth in China; the Nigerian industrialist Aliko Dangote was third in his home country; Silvio Santos, a media billionaire, 
was 4th in Brazil; Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the tycoon recently freed by Vladimir Putin, was 8th in Russia; while Warren Buffett, 
who is admired in India, Pakistan and China, was 8th in the world. 
Actors and musicians do less well. With the exception of the Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan, Ms Jolie and Stephen 
Fry, who confirms his enormous Twitter following by making 7th in Britain, just below Desmond Tutu. Johnny Depp and Brad 
Pitt get close to the top in a couple of countries and Justin Bieber did well in Indonesia, but the rock star and anti-poverty 
campaigner Bono is notable by his absence. 
Sportsmen were more highly regarded, with the Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar 5th in the world — but only because he is so 
adored in the world's second-most populous country. The footballer Lionel Messi had broader support, reaching 15th in the 
world. In Britain, David Beckham squeaked into 10th place. 
In only two countries of the 13 surveyed did no local politician make it into the top ten —Australia and the UK. The omission 
was most striking in Britain where Nigel Farage, the top politician, was in 16th place. David Cameron received the most 
admired accolade from only two people in a thousand. In Germany, Angela Merkel scored 65 times higher at 13 per cent, 
second only to the Pope. Vladimir Putin topped the Russian poll with a whopping 24 per cent, Nicolas Sarkozy was third in 
France and Goodluck Jonathan 8th in Nigeria. Edward Snowden, responsible for leaking classified documents that revealed 
the extent of surveillance by America's National Security Agency, was 10th most admired in the country that granted him 
asylum, Russia. He also showed strongly in Germany. We also asked who was the most famous person in the world. The 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028529 
overwhelming choice was Mr Obama, with 26 per cent, and Mr Gates behind on 12. 
YouGov polled in Great Britain, France, Germany, Russia, the US, Australia, Pakistan, Indonesia, India, China, Egypt, Nigeria 
and Brazil, representing over half of the world's population and the most populated country on each continent, and spoke to 
total of 13,895 people around the world. We used a mix of internet and mobile phone surveys. In most countries we achieved 
representative samples but in some we were unable to achieve good representation of rural communities. Our survey asked 
two open-ended questions, seeking write-in answers: who do you think is the most famous person in the world, and who do 
you personally most admire? 
Although we specified that only living people should be considered, many wanted to choose Nelson Mandela anyway, and had 
we conducted the survey a month earlier he would have come top. In China there was significant support for Mao Zedong, 
Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping, with 14 per cent between them, and had those respondents considered only the living, Xi 
Jinping would have scored even more highly. 
Who's Who

76. Edwards learned of allegations that Epstein engaged in sexual abuse of minors on
his private aircraft. See Jane Doe 102 Complaint, Exhibit “B.” Accordingly, Edwards pursued
discovery to confirm these allegations.

77. Discovery of the pilot and flight logs was proper in the cases brought by Edwards
against Epstein. Jane Doe filed a federal RICO claim against Epstein that was an active claim
through much of the litigation. The RICO claim alleged that Epstein ran an expansive criminal
entirpitge that involved and depended upon his plane travel. Although Judge Marra dismissed
the RICO claim at some point in the federal litigation, the legal team representing
ever clients intended to pursue an appeal of that dismissal. Moreover, all of the subjects
erator in the RICO claim remained relevant to other aspects of Jane Doe’s claims against
Epstein, including in particular her claim for punitive damages. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit
“N” at 719.

78. Discovery of the pilot and flight logs was also proper in the cases brought by
Edwards against Epstein because of the need to obtain evidence of a federal nexus. Edwards's
client Jane Doe was proceeding to trial on a federal claim under 18 U.S.C. § 2255. Section 2255
is a federal statute shite (unlike relevant state statutes) established a minimum level of recovery
for'victims of the violation of its provisions. Proceeding under the statute, however, required a
“federal nexus” to the sexual assaults. Jane Doe had two grounds on which to argue that such a
nexus existed to her abuse by Epstein: first, his use of telephone to arrange for girls to be abused;

and, second, his travel on planes in interstate commerce. During the course of the litigation,

Epstein Faces Sex-Traffic Probe

The Justice Department is investigating Jeffrey Epstein for child trafficking, The Daily Beast has
learned—and has widened the scope of its probe to include a famous modeling agency.

Hedge-fund manager Jeffrey Epstein completed his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a
minor last week. But it appears his problems may not be over. Now The Daily Beast has learned
that:

* Federal investigators continue to investigate Epstein’s activities, to see whether there is
evidence of child trafficking—a far more serious charge than the two in his non-
prosecution agreement, the arrangement between Epstein and the Department of Justice
allowing him to plead guilty to lower-level state crimes. Trafficking can carry a 20-year

° The FBI is also investigating Epstein’s friend Jean Luc Brunel, whose MC2 modeling
agency appears to have been a source of girls from overseas who ended up on Epstein’s
private jets.

Because Epstein’s predatory habits stretch back many years and involved dozens of young-
looking girls, there may well be more evidence to uncover.

Under the concept of double jeopardy, Epstein can no longer be prosecuted for any of the
charges covered by his non-prosecution agreement, in which he agreed to serve a short term of
incarceration, fund the civil suits of named victims, and register as a sex offender, The victims
who accepted cash settlements in these civil suits agreed not to testify against him or speak
publicly about the case. However, new evidence developed by the Department of Justice on other
offenses not covered by the agreement, including allegations by additional victims who come
forward, could lead to new charges. There is no statute of limitations in the federal sex-
trafficking law, which was also enacted by the state of Florida in 2002. Because his predatory
habits stretch back many years and involved dozens of young-looking girls, there may well be
more evidence to uncover. (Several young women who claim to be Epstein victims have recently
contacted a Ft. Lauderdale lawyer, but to date no new civil complaints have been filed.)

These new developments come one week after the publication of two articles in The Daily Beast
about Epstein’s pattern of sexual contact with underage girls, which Palm Beach police began
investigating in 2005 and the U.S. Attomey’s office then settled in a 2007 plea deal. The first

value-based argument was inextricable from the interest-based
argument. So enough with the accusations of bleeding heart liberals
seeking to intervene for strictly moral reasons.

We also now know how different intervention looks when we help
forces who want to be helped. East Timor, Bosnia-Herzegovina,
Kosovo, Libya — all cases where force evened out odds between a
brutal government and a widespread and legitimate social or national
movement. It is difficult to know when a state has failed in its
responsibility to protect its people, particularly when secession is
involved. This is why international authorisation is both required and
difficult to obtain. But the contrast with Iraq and Afghanistan, where
external invasion saw the US often labelled as an enemy, is
enormous.

Another clear lesson: the depiction of America as “leading from
behind” makes no sense. In a multi-power world with problems that
are too great for any state to take on alone, effective leadership must
come from the centre. Central players mobilise others and create the
conditions and coalitions for action — just as President Barack Obama
described America’s role in this conflict. In truth, US diplomacy has
been adroit in enabling action from other powers in the region, and
then knowing when to step out of the way.

That said, we must not focus just on states, because Libya also shows
that social forces are increasingly powerful drivers of foreign policy.
Those forces have now pushed both the west and Arab governments
into taking a much harder line than simply geostrategic logic would
dictate against Bashar al-Assad’s brutality in Syria, and even (albeit
timidly) against torture and killings by the Bahraini government.
Social movements are also beginning to reshape politics in Israel and
India.

Dershowitz Goes Off on Woman Who Made Underage Sex
Allegations: ‘She Should Be Seriously Punished’

by Ronn Blitzer | 2:26 pm, December 4th, 2018

OR ee ee et ee ee et

Just hours after convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein agreed to settle
a civil case brought against him by attorney Bradley

Edwards, Epstein’s lawyer from his past criminal case, Alan
Dershowitz, discussed his former client on the Law&Crime Network.
Epstein was accused of trafficking more than 40 underage girls for
sex, and one such girl claimed Dershowitz himself had sex with her
when she was underage.

Dershowitz vehemently denies the claim, telling host Brian Ross that
accuser Virginia Roberts is a “certified, complete, total liar,” and that
her allegations are a “complete and total fabrication.” He also added
that she should be punished by the law for what she did.

The Harvard Law Professor Emeritus noted that Roberts’ allegations
were eventually withdrawn, and that the FBI recognized the
evidence showed he was not where she said he was. He pointed to
documented evidence that proves he is innocent.

“| can prove conclusively that she made the whole thing up,”
Dershowitz said, citing travel records that he says prove where he
was at the time she claims she had sex with him. “It’s conclusive,
conclusive evidence.”

“More importantly, | can prove where | wasn't,” he said, after stating
outright, “Never met her, don’t know who she is, never heard of her.”

Similarly, Dershowitz said that Roberts claimed that notable figures
such as Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and Tipper Gore were present on an

Similarly, these people probably can influence one another, work
in teams, and negotiate with one another to some extent. They may
not be great at it, but we wouldn’t characterize the ability to influence
others well as a sign of intelligence. Many world leaders are very influ-
ential but not all of those are considered to be brilliant.

Similarly, the ability to be a good team player is no way considered
to be a sign of intelligence. Some very bright people have difficulty
working with others. These things are not signs of intelligence.

Modeling and experimentation ability aren’t really important
when we talk about intelligence. Experimentation is something scien-
tists do. Children and chefs and nonscientists do it as well, of course.
But we wouldn't criticize these interviewees if it turned out that they
didn’t know how to experiment. We certainly have no idea from these
interviews whether they can experiment or not. We can guess that
they cannot. We tend to think that experimentation is the province
of brilliant people, but would we say that someone is unintelligent
because they don’t know how to conduct a real experiment? Or, that
a chef is brilliant because he takes risks with food? (We may say that
he is a brilliant chef, but that doesn’t mean we think he is brilliant.)
Experimentation has a lot to do with innovation, which is certainly
related to intelligence, but, again, it really is not what we think about
when we hear interviews and think that the people being interviewed
are stupid.

Similarly, we don’t know whether these folks can effectively create
a model of the world. It seems a good guess that they cannot, but, yet
again, this lies more within the province of science and very intel-
ligent thinking than within our everyday definition of intelligence.
Some very smart people have weird models of the world or no model
of certain aspects of the world.

We do not think that the interviewees are stupid because they
don’t conduct experiments or create elaborate world models.

But a different story emerges when we look at the rest of the cogni-
tive processes, Which of the remaining processes are clearly missing in
the answers supplied by the interviewees above?

Obviously these people don’t speak particularly well.

Being able to aptly describe your views, or describe a situation you
have been in, or a thought you have had, is a hallmark of intelligence.

We judge people’s intelligence, at least in part, by how well they
speak.

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021412.txt,"The story concerns your actions towards students while a professor of physics at Case Western Reserve
University, as well as your conduct in non-academic settings as a prominent figure in the skeptics movement. |
am reporting this story along with two of my colleagues on the science desk, Azeen Ghorayshi and Virginia
Hughes.

Our story is about several allegations of sexual misconduct dating from 2006 to 2016 (see full details below).
Our reporting also goes into how the various institutions you have been affiliated with — Case Western,
Arizona State University, the Australian National University, the New College of the Humanities, and the Center
for Inquiry, for which you serve as an honorary member of the board of directors — have handled complaints
and concerns about your behavior during this time.

Our story is corroborated by emails, university documents, official complaints, testimony from victims and
eyewitnesses, and interviews with more than two dozen of your current and former academic colleagues,
students, and peers in the skeptics movement.

| wanted to offer you the opportunity to comment and/or respond to the main facts we plan to publish. If you
wish to comment on any of the below findings, we need to hear from you as soon as possible. We are
planning on publishing our story Tuesday morning, Eastern US Time.

Based on our reporting, this is what we plan to publish:

Incident 1:

° In November of 2006, at an event launching the new Center for Inquiry in Washington D.C., you met a
volunteer for CFI D.C.

° At the event, you asked for her business card. Later, you followed her as she was leaving and asked
her if she was “of age.”

° Later, you emailed her to invite her to dinner.

° You planned to dine with her in the restaurant at the Washington D.C. hotel where you were staying.

° You told her to come up to your room first because you needed to finish some work.

° In your hotel room, you seemed in no rush to leave. You ordered a cheese plate, and later champagne,
despite her suggestion that you go down to dinner.

° You then made a comment about her eye makeup, getting very close to her face.

° You then lifted her by her arms, and pushed her onto the bed beneath you, forcibly kissing her and
trying to pull down the crotch of her tights.

° She struggled to push you off her.

° You said, “When | was in college | could never get a girl that looked like you.”

° When you pulled out a condom, she got out from under you. She said “I have to go,” and rushed out of
the room.

Incident 2:

° In an incident that occurred in fall of 2007 while you were a physics professor at Case Western Reserve

University, a student tried to talk to you about her plans after graduation. You mentioned to her how tough it
must be to have all the other physics majors asking her out on dates.

° In a second incident in December of 2007, while you were still at Case Western, the same student
visited your office to interview you for a student science journal. You closed the door behind her, and ignored
the questions she had prepared. Then you made a casual comment about taking her out for dinner.

° Later, in a regular column for the school paper, she described her experiences with you, without
mentioning you by name. “There was even one particular creep of a professor who once told me he thought
differently of me compared to other students and asked me to dinner: a situation so disturbing that it left me
upset for weeks afterward,” she wrote.

dominated by computational biology. Its leaders, he noted, include biology wizards Kary Mullis, Craig

examples are Kepler's explanation of complex planetary motions as simple ellipses, Bohr's explanation of the 
periodic table of the elements in terms of electron shells, and Watson and Crick's double helix. Einstein

group of protesters in Washington, D.C., later claiming that his purpose
was “to mock and undermine them in the pages of the American

Moreover, a document from the Houston FBI revealed their plan

The Yippies were essentially countercultural, an amalgam of
radicalized stoned hippies and straight political activists. And, although the
Occupiers are essentially mainstream, their demonization by right-wing
media pundits has been providing a repeat performance of neutralizing a

Bill O' Reilly called the Occupiers “drug-trafficking crackheads”

2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *897

Congress was taking an expansive view of the victim's right to be heard at sentencing, including a view that [*898] would
262

embrace a victim's right to make a specific sentencing recommendation.
Most important, the Practitioners’ Group's letter fails to consider the impact of denying the victim access to the presentence
report on the victim's right to fairness. Presumably the Group, comprised primarily of defense attorneys, would be outraged if
defendants were sentenced without receiving notice about relevant parts of the presentence report, because of the defendant's
due process rights. But victims now also have due process rights during sentencing, which make it clear that they should
receive the same information.

The Practitioners' Group raises one concern that can be readily dispelled. The Group wonders whether a victim's right to be
heard on Guidelines issues implies a general right to appeal a sentence. It would not. The CVRA contains its own specific
remedial provision, which permits victims to appeal only denials of their rights. 7°? It specifically allows a victim to file a
motion to re-open ... a sentence only for violations of the victim's right to be heard. 2° Moreover, while victims possess
due process protections, due process does not guarantee a right to an appeal. *°° Finally, the Sentencing Reform Act spells out
the limited rights of appeal on Guidelines issues available to only the government and the defense. 7° For all these reasons,
victims have the right to review relevant parts of the [*899] presentence report and to be heard on Guidelines issues in the trial
court, but if the court properly hears them on the Guidelines issues, victims would not have the right to appeal the sentence the
court ultimately imposes.

Because victims have a right of access to the presentence report, the question arises of how to provide that access. Nothing in
current law precludes releasing presentence reports to victims. While /8 U.S.C. 3552 requires disclosure to government and
defense counsel, it does not forbid further dissemination. Several federal courts have held that circulation of reports to third
parties is proper on a showing of particularized need approved by the court. 7°? Some courts! local rules also allow additional
distribution with court approval. 768 Victims always have a particularized need for access to the Guidelines calculations and

261 See supra notes 239-44 and accompanying text.

262 The Group cites a 2000 Senate Judiciary Committee Report regarding the Victims' Rights Amendment, which referenced a Tenth Circuit
decision restricting the right of victims to present a sentencing recommendation. See Letter from Amy Baron-Evans, supra note 258 (citing S.
Rep. No. 106-254, at 12 (2000) (discussing Robinson v. Maynard, 943 F.2d 1216 (10th Cir. 199]))). By 2003, however, the same passage in
the Senate Judiciary Committee Report was changed to remove the citation to that case and instead to cite a leading proponent of expansive
rights for victims to give judges specific sentencing recommendations:

Victim impact statements concerning the character of the victim and the impact of the crime remain constitutional. See Douglas E. Beloof,
Constitutional Implications of Crime Victims as Participants, 88 Cornell L. Rev. 282 (2003). The Committee does not intend to alter or
comment on laws existing in some States allowing for victim opinion as to the proper sentence.

S. Rep. No. 108-191, at 38 (2003). It is hard to see anything in this history suggesting that Congress wanted victims to be deprived of the
chance to review presentence reports.

263 18 U.S.C.A. 3771(d)(5) (West 2004 & Supp. 2005). See generally Jn re WR. Huff Asset Mgmt. Co., 409 F.3d 555, 561-64 (2d Cir. 2005)
(discussing appeals under CVRA).

back the surviving soldiers after we realized we'd lost one of our APCs ina
battle with Egyptians; and even, because I’d been there before on sayeret
missions, leading a joint armored force across the Egyptian desert to complete
the encirclement of Sadat’s Third Army and effectively end the war.

Still, the memory which has stayed with me longest — summoning back all
the miscues and misjudgements of some of Israel’s top commanders, and the
terrible price paid by the men on the ground to turn things around — was the
fight for an experimental agricultural facility located just a few miles back from
our side of the Suez Canal.

On Israeli military maps, it was called the Chinese Farm. In fact, it was
Japanese experts who helped set it up in the then-Egyptian Sinai before the Six-
Day War. When we captured it in 1967, deciphering the characters on the
equipment had evidently proven beyond our linguistic capabilities. Thus,
Chinese Farm. Now, it was back in Egyptian hands. The sprawling complex,
with its web of large irrigation ditches, controlled the main transport corridor
from the Sinai to the bank of the canal.

Before dawn on October 16, one of the battalions in Arik Sharon’s brigade,
under a veteran paratroop commander named Danny Matt, had managed to
cross the canal on rubber rafts with an advance force of some 750 men and a
few dozen tanks. But it was a precarious beachhead, vulnerable to Egyptian air
strikes, artillery and Sagger fire. Hopes for any large-scale Israeli counterattack
rested on moving forward an enormous roller bridge, and hundreds more tanks,
to complete the crossing — impossible without retaking the Chinese Farm.

The first I knew of the scale of Egyptian resistance there was about four in
the morning on the seventeenth. I got a radio call ordering me to get my
battalion ready to move, ASAP. We were attached the other main armored
force, along with Arik’s, assigned to lead the crossing. It was under the
command of Avraham “Bren” Adnan, the former overall commander of Israeli
tank forces. “You’re going north of Tirtur 42,” Bren’s operations officer told
me. Even without checking our coded map, I knew it was the road running
along the upper edge of the Chinese Farm. He told me that the parachutists of

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018462.txt,"As glad as I am that my upbringing was not stereotypically sexually repressed, I have to
say that I envy my friend his easy personal integration of BDSM.

2. 1 wish this point had been made, over and over: You might consider being careful
with sex.

I recently read an excellent New Yorker article that reviews the new version of The Joy of
Sex. It talks about the time when The Joy of Sex came out, as well as a similar
contemporary feminist book, Our Bodies, Ourselves, and it points out that both books
espoused the (distinctly seventies) notion that sex could be a value-neutral experience, as
natural as eating.”

Value-neutral: that's a great way to describe the overall attitude about sex that I
absorbed. As if sex were something I could do as an amusing diversion, with anyone, at
any time, and it would always be fun fun fun! As if there was no need to be overly careful
or sensitive -- sex was just a game I could play, like a sport -- where the worst that would
happen if I screwed up might be a skinned knee.

I wish that there had been an emphasis on how emotions can really matter, when it
comes to sex. I wish that there had been acknowledgment of the fact that we can really
hurt ourselves, and others, when we're cavalier about sex. (Not that we always do -- but
we can.) I wish I had understood sooner that sex is not always value-neutral; that
everyone has all manner of different sexual needs and hangups, anxieties and strong
emotions. I think maybe there are people out there who can have value-neutral sex --
where it's totally about physicality and nothing more -- but I am not like that, and I
suspect that most people are not.

Which isn't to say that I think there's anything wrong with people who can have sex that's
value-neutral. (And maybe value-neutral” is not a great term for it; I worry that I
sound like I'm judging when I use that term.) I just don't think it's a good model for
everyone, and yet I think that it has somewhat been promoted as if everyone ought to
be that way.

I think that there are lots of people out there who feel as though the sexual liberation
movement failed or betrayed them, because they convinced themselves that sex is
value-neutral and then got hurt. You see a lot of assertions along these lines in the
conservative media -- for instance, here's a quotation from a synopsis of the book
Modern Sex:

The 1960s sexual revolution made a big promise: if we just let go of our inhibitions, we'll
be happy and fulfilled. Yet sexual liberation has made us no happier and, if anything, less
fulfilled. Why?... sex today is increasingly mechanical and without commitment -- a
department of plumbing, hygiene, or athletics rather than a private sphere for the
creation of human meaning. The result: legions of unhappy adults and confused
teenagers deprived of their innocence, on their way not to maturity but to
disillusionment.... These beautifully written essays -- on subjects ranging from the TV
show Sex and the City to teen sex to the eclipse of the manly ideal to the benefits of
marriage -- add up to the deepest, most informative appraisal we have of how and why
the sexual revolution has failed.

Director Tribute will be given to Sofia Coppola, with the Cinematographer Tribute going to Ed Lachman. With the 
Industry Tribute, we will be honoring Jason Blum, founder of Blumhouse Productions. And we simply couldn't be more 
pleased to honor Vice President Al Gore with this year's special Humanitarian Tribute. With nominees this year 
ranging from Willem Dafoe, Adam Sandler and Robert Pattison to Margot Robbie, Lois Smith and Mary J. Blige, this

John Grisham murder plot[s] sound far-fetched. But if you asked me a few months ago if Scott
Rothstein was fabricating federal court orders and forging a judge’s signature on documents to
alidgeitty fleece his friends, as federal prosecutors allege, I would have said that was far-fetched,
too.”). No reasonable lawyer could have expected that a fellow member of the bar would have
beeh involved in such a plot. Nobody seemed to know of Rothstein’s Ponzi scheme, not even his
best friends, or the people he did business with on a daily basis, or even his wife. Many of the
attorneys at RRA had been there for years and knew nothing. Edwards was a lawyer at RRA for
less than 8 months and had very few personal encounters with Rothstein during his time at the
firm, yet Epstein claims that he should have known of Rothstein’s intricate Ponzi scheme. No
doubt for this reason the U.S. Attomey’s Office has now listed Edwards as a “victim” of
Rothstein’s crimes. See Statement of Undisputed Facts filed contemporaneously.

Epstein’s Complaint does not offer any specific reason why a jury would conclude that
Edwards was negligent, and he chose not to offer any explanation of his claim at his deposition.
Accordingly, Edwards is entitled to summary judgment to the extent the claim against him is
somehow dependent upon his negligence in failing to discover Rothstein’s Ponzi scheme.

Him is Dependent on Allegations Regarding “Pumping the Cases” Because

differences between their departments, and working with a younger
generation, the two have bonded.

Hillary and I call ourselves the Old Folks Caucus, Gates quips.
And I must say, it's the first time in my life I've worked for a
president who was 20 years younger than I was.

Gates's tenure had difficult moments, too. Three years ago, he
rejected requests from Gen. David McKiernan, his then top
commander in Afghanistan, for more troops, believing there weren't
enough resources. Gates stayed the course until 2009, when he
argued for the troop surge that now appears to have stalled the
insurgency.

Gates acknowledges a historical similarity to the Vietnam War.
There is one parallel that I think is appropriate, and that is we came
to the right strategy and the right resources very late in the game,
Gates says. President Obama, I think, got the right strategy and the
right resources for Afghanistan--but eight years in.

In Afghanistan, Gates leaves behind a difficult, unfinished piece of
business: to convince Congress and war-weary Americans that any
major U.S. withdrawal should be delayed by a year--a deferment
sought by military commanders on the ground. Likewise, Gates won't
be around for what may be the most delicate aspect of the exit
strategy--trying to broker reconciliation between the Taliban and the
Afghan ruling parties aligned with the U.S.

I'm not saying it'll all be settled, says Gates. I'm just saying you
could begin a serious dialogue by the end of the year. But, he
concedes, asking for another year is hard.

have labour at low cost. A mantra repeated in the past on Twitter also by the current Minister of the
Interior Matteo Salvini.

The ambition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site Breitbart — which in
the European campaign preceded him since the platform had already opened bureaux in London and
Rome — is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great “populist international” of which he
has long since been dreaming.

The Movement, in fact, intends to function as an extreme right-wing think tank: a source of strategic
advice to channel the not-so-politically structured discontent of the most extreme European
movements. Analysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and channeling
funding.

The aim is to create a populist alliance, a sort of “super group” that if victorious can conquer up to a
third of the European Parliament in the elections next May.

Indeed — putting the common policy of the Old Continent in the hands of Bannon and his own. The
American strategist is very attached to the Freedom Caucus — the extreme right of the US Congress
— and in 2014 he was at the top of the Cambridge Analytica company, which in 2016 used data
stolen from Facebook to try to influence the presidential election from which Donald Trump emerged
victor. It is not a mystery that for a long time he courts nationalists of the right from East to West.
And he has already met, among others, the Hungarian Orban, the French Marine Le Pen and the
former leader of the British separatists Nigel Farage. The latter reappeared, coincidentally, on Friday

forgetting the Italians of Lega and 5 stars. Of them, he said: If it works in Italy, we can import the
model anywhere”.

The Movement, which for now will count on a staff of 10 people, will be fully operational in 2019. In
short, after the American midterm elections, where Bannon is fighting to influence the primaries
supporting candidates potentially able to undermine the prospects of Republican establishment. But in
the future the former spin doctor says he wants to spend more and more time in Europe. Also because
the relationships with Trump have worsened after the revelations he made to Michael Wolff and
published in the scandal book “Fire and Fury”. “Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Paradise,”
Bannon says now paraphrasing the Satan of one of his favorite books, John Milton's Lost Paradise.
Hell in this case would be the dear old Europe and its democratic values. The “army of darkness” is
already among us.

"
IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014417.txt,"shows that this measure has been on a steady downtrend, with the numbers particularly
low for large corporates.

So far, the government’s approach has relied more on carrots than sticks, with Prime
Minister Abe using a combination of moral suasion and sweeteners to encourage firms
to disgorge profits. The pattern has continued as we approach FY2017. For example,
local media have reported that the government is considering offering corporate tax
breaks to SMEs that raise wages, in light of more modest wage growth at SMEs.
Discussions are also underway in the Prime Minister's office about reforming working
practices with the immediate focus on “Equal Pay for Equal work (EPEW)”—i.e. reducing
the wage gap between regular and non-regular employees.

But the issue is contentious from both a capital and labour perspective. And considering
the time it will likely take for related legislation to pass in the Diet, we think the lack of
compliance mechanisms may mean that the immediate impact of EPEW will be limited.
Instead, the debate seems to have shifted towards limiting excessive and unproductive
overtime work. This is low-hanging fruit that does not address the issue of Japan’s
labour market rigidities, which are at the heart of the problem of suppressed wages and
weak household spending power.

That said, there are signs that the government’s patience is wearing thin and that the
Prime Minister is increasingly leaning towards direct intervention. For example, the
government has already delivered a minimum wage hike in FY2016 and plans to take the
national average up to JPY1,000 by 2020 via yearly hikes of 3%. These policy changes
should offer small tailwinds for the recovery in private consumption. We also think the
debate over a possible retained earnings tax is unlikely to go away. We are sceptical it
will be introduced in this year’s tax reforms. However, the government’s escalating war
on corporates hoarding cash is likely to lead to a continued rise in dividend payouts and
share buybacks (Chart 21).

Risk factors: largely from overseas
A key risk to our 2017 outlook on the domestic side may be weaker-than-expected
growth in real labor income, or a continued surge in the household saving rate, which
would constrain consumption.
However, we think the biggest risks in either direction stem from abroad. Specifically,
we see higher uncertainty over global trade, risk sentiment, and FX as a result of
political transitions in the US and Eurozone. We consider multiple policy scenarios under
a Trump presidency.
Trump’s campaign promises have mixed implications for Japan. On a positive note
deregulation, tax cuts, and aggressive infrastructure spending could boost US aggregate

TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031736.txt,"﻿                     Trump; Prince of Believers (Caliph)!
Abdulnaser Salamah


http://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/1133143



 I cannot accommodate that an American president – whatever his name - comes to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to hold a summit meeting with the Kingdom’s king, and then gulf’s leaders come together to hold a summit meeting with him, and then the leaders of Arab and Islamic states come to hold a summit meeting with him. Is this because the American president has no time to host them in the White House, where he rules, so those all leaders met him in the kingdom?
 I cannot accommodate with this status unless this person was the prince of believers or (Caliph) who has the right and power to gather the rulers of states in whatever place he choose in the Caliphate or any of its palaces. 


 Following the example of Caliphs, the rulers ware not know the reason behind this meeting or its subject. They also were not know the instructions or orders he carried from the far reaches of the Caliphate. In this case they are as like as the public. All information is available that the Caliph not only feels angry with the rulers, but also puts his eyes on the wealth at their hands. During his election campaign, he literally said, “Saudi Arabia is just like 'a milk cow' and we will slaughter it when its milk runs out”. He may announce increase of the annual attribute provided by every rulers. Also, he may announce administrative redistribution of the states. Moreover, he may spreads his teeth regarding the new rules of the rulers. This may be through involving them in land wars against each other and not against their real enemy, as he is on his way to Israel; and you do not know what Israel is?! 


 The new Caliphate does not hide that he want to empower Israel more and more, to cover from Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, all the Levant, Arabian Island and Persia lands. Therefore, he is going to leave from the lands of Hijaz to the Palestinian occupied lands before leaving to Vatican. He clearly refers to that it is a political tour with religious purposes. It will comes to our ears, all the time, expressions like terrorism, extremism, stiffness, sects, Sunni Islam, Shiite Axis and other expressions that cause more dilemmas and allies in the region. However, the visit is covered by the title of “Mutual Interests”. 


 I wish we would not live this day or witness a status in which the Arab and Islamic leaders run rapidly to a person who does not hide his aggressive feelings towards Arabs and Muslims. At least, I would like to see pre-coordination meetings result in declared demands regarding the region’s cases, headed by the case of ending the Israeli occupation of Arab lands. I hoped to see demands include US non-interference in the affairs of the region, especially in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Libya. I hoped to see Arabic demands to compensate Iraq for its devastation out of US invasion, compensate Syria for the damages resulted by the US-made ISIS and compensate Yemen and Libya for the bombing and sabotage they face. 


 What is certain is that the Arab people from the ocean to gulf is holding his breath and waiting with great concern what will result from these meetings and the new catastrophes may take place in the region after creative chaos, destructive chaos, endless chaos and the new Middle East. Besides, they ask whether there is anything coherent in the region to be targeted by this suspicious visit, especially that all information confirm imposing new overpriced royalties on specific states. This is through instructions issued directly from the White House. Accordingly, there was no need to visit just to ink more weapon contracts unless the matter is greater than all expectations similar to the deal of century, millennium initiative and other useless contracts of acquiescence. 


 Therefore, we cannot breathe a sigh of relief unless there is transparency from leaders in dealing openly and frankly with their people about all things in the official circles. The people may be surprised in the future with a new “Sykes-Picot Agreement”, other “Balfour Declaration” or even other “1967” and we have lessons in the history of ancestors. The treachery and collusion have been discovered since 1948 until now make us fear everything and doubt in everything especially that there are clear signs in the horizon. 


 	Unfortunately, the plotters, in Egypt and other Arab countries, will preach and promote to such visit and meetings as the savior of the region of its pests. They will ignore the recent and distance past experiences, depending on the weak Arabic memory. This matter should be warned in the light of Russian-US conflict on the dominance in Syria, Saudi-Iranian conflict on the dominance in Yemen, Sunni-Shiite conflict on the dominance in Iraq and Lebanon, and the Israeli presence in the region. All of these mentioned conflicts are made by the United States. Accordingly, should we depend on Donald Trump or the new prince of believers (Caliph)?! 


 Anyway, I want to remind you that Trump said: “I will get the Gulf states, who are not doing much, believe me. The Gulf states have nothing but money. I’m going to get them to pay. We owe 19 trillion, we’re not paying for it. Don’t forget, without us, the Gulf states won’t exist.”

U.S. and Haiti Relationship

Long-term relationships between the U.S. and Haiti have been developed. First of all, the country
has a very good geographical location. Port-au-Prince is less than 2 hours by air from Miami
(approximately 600 miles southeast of the coast of Florida). Moreover, there are flights to New
York and Fort Lauderdale. Secondly, English 1s well known in the country. Majority of the Haitian
businesspersons speak English and it is possible to pay for the products in US dollars. Currently,
there are some U.S. companies, including commercial banks, telecommunications, airlines, oil and
agribusiness companies, and U.S.-owned assembly plants are present in Haiti (US Department of
State, 2010; CIA, 2010).

The economic situation was largely dependent on the U.S. and entire world’s financial aid. For
example, the U.S. contributed more than $850 million of financial aid from 1995 to 2003 to
improve governance, security, the rule of law, economic recovery and critical human needs. From
2004 to 2008, the U.S. provided $600 million of financial aid. Moreover, The World Economic
Forum ranked Haiti last in its 2003 Global Competitiveness Report (Global Security, n.d.; CFI,
2010). That is why World Bank Donors (U.S., Canada, EU, France, Sweden, Spain, Germany,
Japan, Switzerland, Greece, Norway, Mexico, and Ireland) provided $1.085 billion from 2004
through 2006 to address humanitarian needs (U.S. Department of State, 2008).

Haiti before the Earthquake in 2010

Haiti had been the least-developed country in the Western Hemisphere since the 1980s. The
economic stagnation of the country was a result of inadequate economic policies, political
instability, shortage of arable land, environmental deterioration, lack of investment in human
resources, migration of majority of skilled citizens, weak national savings rata, lack of functioning
judicial system, corruption, reliance on traditional technologies instead of applying the new ones,
drug trafficking, etc. (U.S. Department of State, 2008). A variety of the sources (U.S. Department of
State, 2000; PRS Group, 2002; World Bank, 2004; Icon Group, 2007; Infomat, 2008; CFI, 2010)
identified that Haiti had low trade with the foreign countries between 1990 and 2004 due to the
political instability. Therefore, there were a limited number of foreign investors in Haiti. Later on,
the political situation stabilized.

Generally, Haiti had a positive attitude towards foreign investors. There were no economic or
industrial strategies with discriminatory effect, e.g. nationality. The Haitian banking system 1s open
to the entry and operation of foreign banks. At present, there are two foreign banks operating in
Haiti: Citibank and Scotia bank (PRS Group, 2002; Investment Overview, 2007).

The Government of Haiti has made several commitments to the world trade organization in the
financial services sector as follows:

e Allow foreign participation in deposit taking, lending, guarantees and commitments; in
financial leasing; in underwriting services, including participation in the issuance and
placement of securities; and in advising and auxiliary services for each of the above-
mentioned services.

correspondence between the annotator and our algorithm was 81%. Of the names assigned to the B

III.10. Epidemics

Disease epidemics have a significant impact on the surrounding culture (Fig. $18 A-C). It was recently
shown that during seasonal influenza epidemics, users of Google are more likely to engage in influenza-
related searches, and that this signature of influenza epidemics corresponds well with the results of CDC
surveillance (Ref S16). We therefore reasoned that culturomic approaches might be used to track
historical epidemics. These could help complement historical medical records, which are often woefully
incomplete.

We examined timelines for 4 diseases: influenza (main text), cholera, HIV, and poliomyelitis. In the case
of influenza, peaks in cultural interest showed excellent correspondence with known historical epidemics
(the Russian Flu of 1890, leading to 1M deaths, the Spanish Flu of 1918, leading to 20-100M deaths; and
the Asian Flu of 1957, leading to 1.5M deaths). Similar results were observed for cholera and HIV.
However, results for polio were mixed. The US epidemic of 1916 is clearly observed, but the 1951-55
epidemic is harder to pinpoint: the observed peak is much broader, starting in the 30s and ending in the
60s. This is likely due to increased interest in polio following the election of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in
1932, as well as the development and deployment of Salk’s polio vaccine in 1952 and Sabin’s oral
version in 1962. These confounding factors highlight the challenge of interpreting timelines of cultural
interest: interest may increase in response to an epidemic, but it may also respond to a stricken celebrity
or a famous cure.

The dates of important historical epidemics were derived from the Cambridge World History of Human
Diseases (1993) 3 Edition.

For cholera, we retained the time periods which most affected the Western world, according to this
resource:

- 1830-35 (Second Cholera Epidemic)

- 1848-52, and 1854 (Third Cholera Epidemic)

- 1866-74 (Fourth Cholera Epidemic)

- 1883-1887 (Fifth Cholera Epidemic)

The first, sixth and seventh cholera epidemics appear not to have caused significant casualties in the
Western world.

¢ The announcement of unlimited QE in the US, as well as a stronger-than-expected acceleration of global

this case. Yen weakness should come as the Bank of Japan intervenes to weakens its currency.
FX targets: EURUSD <1.25 / EURJPY 90
¢ The European growth outlook deteriorates further with continued recession in 2013. The euro could
rapidly fall below 1.25. A European debt-default cascade (possibly triggered by a disorderly Greece euro

Network power, we might say, exists as a sort of skin or surface that ties together
billions of points to each other and to vital, centralized cores. We know our world is
filling with more and better and faster connected devices distributing themselves at
an unmeasureably quick pace; but we are also breeding powerful centralized
knowledge and computing basins. Biological research labs now engage in complex
DNA analysis with powerful desktop tools (distribution), but to work efficiently,
they demand fast reference to the patterns revealed only in immense genetic
datasets (concentration). You can snap high quality videos with your phone
(distribution); you share them with millions on a connected central stage like
Facebook or YouTube (concentration). A financial engineer can architect a new and
profitable trading instrument on his tablet (distribution), but his hopes for profit
depend on instant connection to busy, price-setting markets were prices are set
(concentration.)

This sort of pulling, taffy-like web of ties between small (your watch) and big
(connected data systems) stretches constantly. It’s what you need to picture when
you think of an image of network power. The wired masses in Tahrir square, for
instance, emerge like magic on some once-invisible surface that forms between their
phones and powerful platforms like YouTube. Or: Hyper-linked terrorist groups
appear from nearly nowhere, jerking recruits from suburban London bedrooms via
massively connected messaging platforms. Recall Adam Smith’s line about the
Enlightenment, how a commercial society was one in which every man had to
become a merchant? Well, in our age of connection, every one of us is a node. We sit
on that tense, stretched surface between center and periphery. When we say
“connection changes the nature of an object,” this is the exact balance we have to
comtemplate. “Social structures,” John Padgett and Walter Powell wrote in their
masterful study of complex connected systems, The Emergence of Organizations and
Markets, “should be viewed more as vortexes in the flow of social life than as
buildings of stone.”!°° This idea has some eerie implications: Every structure -
congresses, universities, the company where you work, our minds even - is merely a
temporary collection of relations. And of course those relations can change at any
moment. The tension between concentration and distribution acts, in a sense, like
an hydraulic jaw. It pries power out of older, once-legitimate hands.

Consider the case of my father, a cardiologist. As a doctor he stands at the head ofa
medical tradition run for thousands of years on the idea that the doctor is the center
of your care. If you show up ata hospital on a stretcher with a flat-line on some
heart monitor, my father’s decades of training and practice have always been your
best hope. But today, nearly every patient he sees - even the ones he brings back
from their black flat-line future - second-guesses him as soon as he’s out the door:
Googling their disease, tapping into websites of mixed reliability, joining some
online community of people with the same sickness while they still have tubes in
their nose. Meanwhile, his ideas about your case are under quickening pressure: An

financially compensated for the time, effort, discomfort and inconvenience associated with the
donation process, the study authors wrote.

The success of the experiments rekindled debate among bioethicists, who have long anticipated
that human cloning would become a reality.

In 2002, a commission of bioethicists established by then-President George W. Bush unanimously
urged a ban on reproductive cloning. But the panel was deeply divided about the propriety of
therapeutic cloning for research and medical treatment.

Though 13 states have passed laws banning reproductive cloning, the United States is one of just
a few industrialized countries that has not prohibited the practice. Seven states also have banned
therapeutic cloning. Oregon is not one of them.

The OHSU team's success underscores the urgent need for federal rules that spell out consistent
national limits on therapeutic cloning and put a clear ban on the technology's use in fertility
clinics, said Johns Hopkins University bioethicist Jeffrey Kahn.

Researchers are also likely to step up their demand for donated eggs so they can conduct similar
experiments. That lends urgency to the need for standardized practices for compensating women
who donate their eggs. Some states, including California, have set strict limits on such payments,
while others have allowed a market for donated eggs to flourish unregulated, Kahn added.

Among the methodological innovations outlined in the Cell paper was a trick that stem cell
scientist Michael D. West, who was not involved in the study, dubbed the Starbucks effect.

The OHSU team added caffeine to the growth medium that nourished the eggs after they were
stripped of their original DNA and awaited the new DNA from a skin cell. Unlike its stimulating
effect on coffee-drinkers, the caffeine chemically slowed the rush to divide and grow that had
doomed earlier efforts.

The OHSU scientists also studied which batches of donated eggs were most likely to thrive and
survive long enough to produce stem cells. Finding that eggs fared best when they were part of a
medium-sized harvest, the researchers fine-tuned their regimen of egg-stimulating drugs so that
more of the women produced about 10 eggs per cycle.

In all, the researchers produced six lines of embryonic stem cells from six separate embryos, said
OHSU infertility specialist Dr. Paula Amato, one of the paper's authors.

Four of them contained the nuclear DNA of a single donor whose skin cells were purchased from
a commercial lab, and a fifth came from a separate donor whose cells were bought the same way.

The sixth donor was a patient with Leigh syndrome, a genetic disorder that results in severe and
mostly fatal neurological degeneration in a child's first years of life.

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014738.txt,"2. Learning from Japanese fiscal stimulus

Ultimately, fiscal stimulus is not the long-term answer to flat curves or low neutral rates
Qapan being the prime example). Fiscal stimulus merely captures some low-hanging fruit
that extends the business cycle by a couple of years and provides the central bank an
opportunity to get further away from the ZLB. Said simply, fiscal stimulus raises the
terminal rate in the current business cycle while doing little for the long-run neutral rate
— this by definition should be more bearish for intermediate rates than 30y rates.

3. Additional deficit issuance

With the average maturity of UST debt already standing at record highs (7Omonths),
Treasury showing an inclination to cut long-end issue sizes in 2016, and the supply
shortfall in the front end of the UST curve post MMF reform, we also believe that the
US Treasury will finance the increased deficit using the belly of the UST curve as
opposed to the long end

Trade: We recommend a 3m5y OTM payer 25 delta, strike = 2.05% for a gross
payoff ratio of 3.4: 1. See the Best Vol Trades section for more details and risks.

But focus on being short real rates now

After spending much of 2016 successfully being long real rates, we recommend
switching to a real rate short for 2017. We think the consensus was too slow to get on
the real rate train and is now too long relative to benchmark. As described in the detail
here, fiscal stimulus is likely to leave government and private companies competing for
a shrinking pool of savings, driving the real cost of debt higher. We highlight three
reasons why short real rates provides better risk-reward now (Chart 15).

¢ Anti-globalization = higher real rates: Few appreciate that one of the biggest
beneficiaries of globalization has been US real rates. Globalization was undoubtedly
good for EM growth and reserves. As these reserves found their way back into the
US, US real interest rates were held lower. As the global savings glut unwinds, real
rates have the most room to re-price. Chart 16 offers compelling proof.

« _ Risk parity unwind = higher real rates: Exposure to any heightened concern about
a risk parity deleveraging trade in a high vol environment is best found in asset
classes where their footprint is large relative to market liquidity. TIPS is a prime
example of one such asset class. The influence of a multi-asset strategy on real
rates is clear from Chart 17.

- Lower rates = lower breakevens: If the recent euphoria unwinds, it is likely due to
a1) RMB deval; 2} commodity collapse post OPEC; or 3) equity market correction.

We made it to Paris for fiac which as usual was a delightfully elegant experience. Paris for the day by
Eurostar is so easy. Everyone was smiling, happy and friendly.

We loved at Mitchell-Innes & Nash William Pope. L’s performance: three world leaders holding a huge-
looking meteorite excreting dye all over them at their own command......

Francis Chantala would not let me look at the Josh Smith paintings he was being most difficult.

There are some strange sights at art fairs: a woman artist dragging around a Louis Vuitton dustbin.
Perhaps she was hoping someone would drop in a nice little unwanted designer package into her bin.

We dropped by to see Jim Lambie in his show in Paris. My amazing designer friend Jean Pierre Tortil,
Elliot Mcdonald and Jim.

Back to London and we visited Wolfe Lenkiewicz at his show The House of the Noble Man. It was a very
lovely show ina lavish £50 million home in Regents Park.

We found on the top floor a lovely work by Matthew Welch called In The Glass Coffin of the Virgin
Forest, the artist was one of Channel 4s New Sensations.

knowledge of the analyses we were undertaking

IlI.3. Controls

To confirm the quality of our data in the English language, we sought positive controls in the form of
words that should exhibit very strong peaks around a date of interest. We used three categories of such
words: heads of state (‘President Truman’), treaties (‘Treaty of Versailles’), and geographical name
change (‘Byelorussia’ to ‘Belarus’). We used Wikipedia as a primary source of such words, and manually
curated the lists as described below. We computed the timeserie of each n-gram, centered it on the date
of interest (year when the person became president, for instance), and normalized the timeserie by
overall frequency. Then, we took the mean trajectory for each of the three cohorts, and plotted in Figure
S5.

The list of heads of states include all US presidents and British monarchs who gained power in the 19 or
20 centuries (we removed ambiguous names, such as ‘President Roosevelt’). The list of treaties is taken
from the list of 198 treaties signed in the 19 or 20 centuries (S7); but we kept only the 121 names that
referred to only one known treaty, and that have non zero timeseries. The list of country name changes is
taken from Ref S8. The lists are given in APPENDIX.

The correspondence between the expected and observed presence of peaks was excellent. 42 out of 44
heads of state had a frequency increase of over 10-fold in the decade after they took office (expected if
the year of interest was random: 1). Similarly, 85 out of 92 treaties had a frequency increase of over 10-
fold in the decade after they were signed (expected: 2). Last, 23 out of 28 new country names became
more frequent than the country name they replaced within 3 years of the name change; exceptions
include Kampuchea/Cambodia (the name Cambodia was later reinstated), Iran/Persia (Iran is still today
referred to as Persia in many contexts) and Sri Lanka/Ceylon (Ceylon is also a popular tea).

III.4. Lexicon Analysis

II.4A. Estimation of the number of 1-grams defined in leading
dictionaries of the English language.

(a) American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 4th Edition (2000)

We are indebted to the editorial staff of AHD4 for providing us the list of the 153,459 headwords that
make up the entries of AHD4. However, many headwords are not single words (“preferential voting” or
“men’s room”), and others are listed as many times as there are grammatical categories (“to console’, the
verb; “console”, the piece of furniture).

Among those entries, we find 116,156 unique 1-grams (such as “materialism” or “extravagate”).

(b) Webster's Third New International Dictionary (2002)

The editorial staff communicated to us the number of “boldface entries” of the dictionary, which are taken
to be the number of n-grams defined: 476,330.

The editorial staff also communicated the number of multi-word entries 74,000 out of a total number of
entries 275,000. They estimate a lower bound of multi-word entries at 27% of the entries.

Therefore, we estimate an upper bound of unique 1-grams defined by this dictionary as 0.27*476,330,
which is approximately 348,000.

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018310.txt,"there might be no response. The US, with its priceless collection of bombers and
missiles and million-man army, could not strike back for the simple reason that the
nation’s field officers would have no way to talk to each other, or to commanders in
Washington. The military radio and telephone systems America depended on for her
safety would not likely endure an initial Soviet strike. This was the problem Baran
had been told to solve.“At the time we didn’t know how to build a communication
system that could survive even collateral damage by enemy weapons,” he recalled
later. RAND determined through computer simulations that the AT&T Long Lines
telephone system, a copper web that carried essentially all the nation’s military
communications, would be cut apart by relatively minor physical damage.!°

The military had spent, already, a fortune on the problem. (They had spent half a
fortune, it turned out, trying to hide it.) The result was an expensively designed,
gorgeously featured telephone network linking military bases to strategic command
posts. But because the lines and their switching centers were laced out in a pattern
with just a few big central nodes, like a bicycle wheel with spokes, it had almost no
chance of surviving the very thing it was designed to help prevent, a Soviet strike. If
you gazed at an inked-out map of this network, with its central hub staffed by senior
commanders and then radiating lines out to bases and missile silos, it even looked,
well, like a target. If the USSR could bullseye those hubs with a bomb or two, the rest
of the network would fold. The Soviets could do whatever they wanted: Invade
Berlin, roll into France, obliterate Los Angeles. America’s military would be deaf.
And as Soviet missiles became more accurate, this seemed an inevitability. “We will
soon be living in an era,” Baran wrote, “in which we cannot guarantee survivability
of any single point.”

The situation, as a carefully screened handful of scientists at RAND knew, was in fact
even more perilous. Shortly before Baran arrived at RAND, scientists testing
hydrogen bomb designs in the Pacific discovered that radiation from their
explosions fuzzed communications for hundreds of miles. A Soviet attack, even if it

105 “At the time”: There is a fair amount of debate about this question of if the
Internet design was intended for survivability or if some other systemic need - such
as linking research institutions - accounted for the distributed architecture that
emerged. See, for instance, Barry M. Leiner, Vinton G. Cerf, et al, “A Brief History of
the Internet”, ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review Volume 39 Issue 5,
October 2009, 22-31. However, an examination of primary source documents shows
the evolution of Baran’s thinking clearly and produces documentary evidence for
the origins of the problem he and various figures at RAND were aiming to solve.
Others arrived at the packet switching model, but it is clear Baran’s path to the
design emerged from the security problems he was considering. For much of the
information here see “Oral History: Paul Baran” Interview #378 for the IEEE History
Center, The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. (Available online);

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015432
"
IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021360.txt,"God spoke also through circumstances.
What a skeptic might interpret as
coincidence is understood as God’s
intentional decision to direct the
congregant’s attention. For example:

“Everything in my life right now is
focused on trying to get to England, and
I needed to get some ID pictures. So I
was really anxious—the money hasn’t
really come together—and one afternoon
I just felt like God said, you need to get
up and go get those. Go get those ID
pictures that you need. I was like, that’s
totally inefficient. I don’t have a car, so
it’s like walking half an hour to
Walgreens and another half an hour
back. Like, I could do this later and
combine it with several things I need to
get done. But I felt it was a step of faith
to do this thing. So I did it—grumbling.
Then on the way there and back I ran
into three people I knew, and I felt that
there was a kind of pattern, and that I
was in the right place at the right time.”

These ways of recognizing God are
widely shared in many forms of
Christianity. More specific to
experiential evangelical Christianity is
the expectation that God will speak
directly into the mind, by placing a
mental image or thought or sensation
there. For example:

“T’m praying for someone and, you
know, they say their situation, what they
want me to pray for. I start praying and
start trying to, you know, really
experience God, and, you know, I see
these vivid images, and I’m explaining
these vivid images and what I think they
mean and, you know, sort of checking in
with the person, you know, does this

Page

resonate with you? They’re like “oh, my
gosh, yes! How did you know that?”

Most congregants find this process of
pulling out specific thoughts and
ascribing them to God baffling at first:
again, the process violates the basic
human experience that the mind is
private. A congregant commented: “now
I know that the ‘something’ is God,
God’s voice. But I didn’t at all have
words to describe it at that time I didn’t
understand. It was very confusing.”

The social world of the church
taught specific ways to differentiate
between mental events that are God and
that are not. This technique has been
taught in the church since the earliest
time as “discernment,” although the
content of the word and its rules has
varied with the era. In the modern
experiential evangelical church, the rules
of discernment are more often taught by
example and gossip than explicitly.
Nevertheless, there appeared to be four
principles. A thought might be said to
come from God if: the thought was
unexpected; the thought was consonant
with God’s nature; the congregant had
additional confirmation (one “tested” the
thought); and one felt peace during the
experience. The process was understood
to be ambiguous, and left room not only
for the congregant to be wrong, but for
different congregants to disagree about
whether God had, in fact, spoken in a
particular manner. One afternoon, a
woman spoke in front of the church
explaining that God had spoken to her
and told her that she should carry out
some mission work in a lovely part of
Mexico. The man sitting next to me said
drily, “God sure wants a lot of
evangelizing in Puerto Vallarta.”

a Fiduciary Rule.

¢ The biggest issue from the brokerage industry is the contract requirement under
the BIC. The issue with the contract is increased liability, given the contract makes
it easier to litigate. This would likely be the primary area for modifications. Even
though many firms have made announcements regarding changes they expect to
make, most have not figured out all of the underlying steps yet given that it is so
complicated and impacts large parts of the business.

¢ The industry will have to move forward on implementing the rule, given the April
2017 implementation date, but firms may not put as much effort into certain areas
that need to be final by January 2018. In addition, prior to Mr. Trump starting, the
transition team could make an announcement about the rule. However, even at that
stage firms would have to determine whether or not to act on the announcement.

e While the most likely scenario is a delay in the rule, with the potential for some
modifications to ease some of the burdens, most see the trend towards a fiduciary
rule already well in motion for the industry.

programme Israel should help itself and the international community.
The most potent way would be by improving relations with the
Islamic world, especially the PLO and Turkey. Israel had good
relations with them before. It can do so again.

Fortunately for Israel, and unfortunately for Khamenei, Israel even
has the option to hurt the regime on its very own streets.

That option is the cessation of verbal military threats against Iran.
Cessation of military threats from Israel will make it much harder for
the regime to divert the public's attention away from its falling
popularity and serious domestic problems. Silence from Israel will
make Iran's leaders more worried, as it will rob Khamenei from an
important tool which has helped him, and at a crucial time when the
regime is hemorrhaging legitimacy and popularity at an
unprecedented rate. The damage such an endeavour will cause is
worth the inconvenience of Israeli politicians having to bite their
tongues. Cessation of verbal threats will also prevent significant
future damage being caused to Israel's deterrence posture if, at the
end of the day, it decides to not to attack Iran's nuclear installations.
Coelho once said:

Be careful. You can hurt with your words, but you can also hurt with
your silence.

The words of a wise man.

author of The Nuclear Sphinx of Tehran: Mahmoud Ahmadinejad

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022546.txt,"the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(5)) provides that
“[nJo person shall knowingly circumvent or knowingly fail
to implement a system of internal accounting controls or
knowingly falsify any book, record, or account ....””” The
Exchange Act defines “person” to include a “natural person,
company, government, or political subdivision, agency, or
instrumentality of a government.”

An issuer’s officers and directors may also be held civ-
illy liable for making false statements to a company’s audi-
tor. Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2 prohibits officers and direc-
tors from making (or causing to be made) materially false
or misleading statements, including an omission of material
facts, to an accountant. This liability arises in connection
with any audit, review, or examination of a company’s finan-
cial statements or in connection with the filing of any docu-
ment with SEC”

Finally, the principal executive and principal finan-
cial officer, or persons performing similar functions, can
be held liable for violating Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 by
signing false personal certifications required by SOX.
Thus, for example, in January 2011, SEC charged the for-
mer CEO of a US. issuer for his role in schemes to bribe
Iraqi government officials in connection with the United
Nations Oil-For-Food Programme and to bribe Iraqi and
Indonesian officials to purchase the company’s fuel addi-
tives. There, the company used false invoices and sham con-
sulting contracts to support large bribes that were passed
on to foreign officials through an agent, and the bribes were
mischaracterized as legitimate commissions and travel fees
in the company’s books and records. The officer directed
and authorized the bribe payments and their false recording
in the books and records. He also signed annual and quar-
terly SOX certifications in which he falsely represented that
the company’s financial statements were fairly presented
and the company’s internal controls sufficiently designed,
as well as annual representations to the company’s external
auditors where he falsely stated that he complied with the
company’s code of ethics and was unaware of any violations
of the code of ethics by anyone else. The officer was charged
with aiding and abetting violations of the books and records

and internal controls provisions, circumventing internal

controls, falsifying books and records, making false state-
ments to accountants, and signing false certifications.” He
consented to the entry of an injunction and paid disgorge-
ment and a civil penalty.**! He also later pleaded guilty in
the United Kingdom to conspiring to corrupt Iraqi and

Indonesian officials?”

Criminal Liability for Accounting Violations

Criminal liability can be imposed on companies
and individuals for knowingly failing to comply with the
FCPA’s books and records or internal controls provisions.
As with the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions, individuals are
only subject to the FCPA’s criminal penalties for violations
of the accounting provisions if they acted “willfully.”?

For example, a French company was criminally
charged with failure to implement internal controls and
failure to keep accurate books and records, among other
violations.*® As part of its deferred prosecution agreement,
the company admitted to numerous internal control fail-
ures, including failure to implement sufficient anti-bribery
compliance policies, maintain a sufficient system for the
selection and approval of consultants, and conduct appro-
priate audits of payments to purported “business consul-
tants.”*** Likewise, a German company pleaded guilty to
internal controls and books and records violations where,
from 2001 through 2007, it made payments totaling
approximately $1.36 billion through various mechanisms,
including $805.5 million as bribes and $554.5 million for
unknown purposes.“

Individuals can be held criminally liable for accounting
violations. For example, a former managing director of a US.
bank’s real estate business in China pleaded guilty to conspir-
ing to evade internal accounting controls in order to trans-
fer a multi-million dollar ownership interest in a Shanghai

building to himself and a Chinese public official with whom

Cheney Says He Urged Bush to Bomb

Syria in ’07
Charlie Savage

August 24, 2011 — Former Vice President Dick Cheney says in a
new memoir that he urged President George W. Bush to bomb a
suspected Syrian nuclear reactor site in June 2007. But, he wrote, Mr.
Bush opted for a diplomatic approach after other advisers — still
stinging over “the bad intelligence we had received about Iraq’s
stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction” — expressed misgivings.
“T again made the case for U.S. military action against the reactor,”
Mr. Cheney wrote about a meeting on the issue. “But I was a lone
voice. After I finished, the president asked, “Does anyone here agree
with the vice president?’ Not a single hand went up around the
room.”

Mr. Bush chose to try diplomatic pressure to force the Syrians to
abandon the secret program, but the Israelis bombed the site in
September 2007. Mr. Cheney’s account of the discussion appears in
his autobiography, “In My Time: A Personal and Political Memoir,”
which is to be published by Simon & Schuster next week. A copy
was obtained by The New York Times.

Mr. Cheney’s book — which is often pugnacious in tone and in
which he expresses little regret about many of the most controversial
decisions of the Bush administration — casts him as something of an
outlier among top advisers who increasingly took what he saw as a
misguided course on national security issues. While he praises Mr.
Bush as “an outstanding leader,” Mr. Cheney, who made guarding

our wives and children and friends and co-workers all the time.

It is possible to teach negotiation, of course. My team once built
a course on negotiation, working with a Harvard Law professor’ who
taught negotiation. The course worked by having people negotiate.
The situations were artificial so there is some question as to how valu-
able lessons can be learned from negotiating when nothing important
(except ego) depends on it. What I found most interesting about that
course were the stories that the expert told from his life as a profes-
sional negotiator. I can’t say that I was ever able to personally make
use of the lessons that those stories taught, but other people’s experi-
ences are interesting to think about. In the end, what we really know
about negotiation is what has worked well for us in the course of our
lives when we were negotiating. Coaching can help, of course, which
implies that the best way to teach negotiation would be with a men-
tor watching you do it for real and offering tips. Psychologists perform
this service in couples counseling, and presumably real estate agents
perform this service for homebuyers and sellers. Just-in-time advice is
always helpful.

HOW TO TEACH DESCRIBING

There is a famous quote: “I apologize that this letter is so long—I
lacked the time to make it short.”8 As long as people have been talk-
ing, they have had to learn to talk well. When they learned to write,
they had to learn to write well. Communication is a very big part of
living in a society and those who communicate well gain all kinds of
advantages. It is difficult to attain public office without speaking well,
or to become an important academic without writing well, or to make
sales or convince anyone of anything without making your case well.

This takes practice and coaching, and there is no substitute for ei-
ther. One also has to have something to say, so this means one has to
have had experiences to talk and write about. Further, it helps if one
is writing about something that one is passionate about. Asking kids
to write about their summer vacations doesn’t necessarily make them
into good writers. Asking kids to give speeches about George Washing-
ton fails for reasons of lack of passion. People need to learn to describe
well what is most important to them. And, they must be doing this

he is unable to confront his daughter about it because he would then have
to admit what Ae was doing at that site. | mean, this isn’ t exactly the type
of thing that would be mass emailed by one of those selfless spammers, is
it? And even if the father did confess to his daughter, he would
undoubtedly hesitate to ask if he could eat Aer shit, because that could be
considered a form of incest, and you have to draw the line somewhere,
right?

There must be an especially strong bond among coprophagiacs,
though, because they have experienced in common a form of liberation
from a taboo that can be traced all the way back to infancy, when a parent
would cringe and say, “Stop! Don’ t eat that! | said nos

Who knows, some day coprophagia might even become a religion?

Holy shit!

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023658.txt,"- Rumors are too many and certainly enemies want to create as much rumors as possible among allies.

* Why are the areas under the control of al-Houthi, a more secure and stable like Sanaa than the
legitimacy areas in Taiz and Aden?

- | want the source of your information, and | am skeptical of this thing completely.

* Some reports say that the alliance intelligence reports are ineffective with evidence that Houthi and
Saleh still have weapons stocks?

- We can uproot Houthi and Saleh in just few days, and we can mobilize only the Saudi land forces alone
and in a few days, clear all areas and the remaining 15% under the control of Houthi and Ali Abdullah
Saleh. But the result will be victims in our forces by the thousands, and we will open condolences in
every Saudi city and the second result is the victims of Yemeni civilians in very high and very large losses.
And the time is in our side, the long breath is ours. We have the supply, we have all logistical supplies,
and our morals are high. While the enemy has no supply, no money, and does not have a long breath.
Time is in our favor and we will take advantage of the time that is in our favor for us. If we do not take
advantage of the time that is in our favor, we have served the enemy.

* There are proposals from Ali Saleh. cannot this be a way to isolate Houthi?

- Ali Abdullah Saleh has a very big disagreement with Houthi and we know that he is today under the
control and the custody of Houthi, if he is not under the control of guardianship of Houthi, his position
will be completely different from his position today without a doubt. If Ali Abdullah Saleh left Sanaa to
another area his position will be quite different from his position today. Today, he may be forced to
many of the positions he mentioned.

* He submitted an initiative when his son came at the beginning of the war, but you refused?

- That is true, that we were trying to make a political initiative that would make us avoid the war
and we were opening a discussion line at that time provided that they did not approach Aden,
because if they approached Aden, it would be very difficult to discuss a political solution, and
Houthi was courting in Yemen. Unfortunately, nothing has happened as we hope and we have
been forced into operations.

* Your Highness the Prince, there are forces that are neither belonging to the legitimacy nor the
coupists. Why do not the kingdom open lines with these forces?

- All lines are open whether the forces belong to the legitimacy or force belongs to Ali Abdullah
Saleh, or those who are not belong to both sides. And every day we are attracting more.

* Are the tribes of the northern Yemen concealed neutrality? You met with the tribes how do you see
them today?

- There is no doubt that the enthusiasm was very high among them and all of them are very much
hatred of the Houthi group and want to get rid of them as soon as they can devote to Yemen's
development programs.

* | refer to the subject of Egypt again. The relationships with Egypt were excellent. Then the Egyptian
media began to suggest that the relations were almost broken, what is happening?

2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *887

aware of this issue, having withdrawn a previous proposal to expand Rule 32 to include all victims in the wake of the CVRA.
223

Rule 32(c)(1)(B) - Presentence Report Considering Restitution in All Cases
The Proposal:

Rule 32(c)(1)(B) should be amended to require that the presentence report contain restitution information in all cases as
follows:

(c) Presentence Investigation.
(1) Required Investigation.

(A) In General. The probation officer must conduct a presentence investigation and submit a report to the court before it
imposes sentence unless:

(i) /8 U.S.C. 3593(c) or another statute requires otherwise; or

(i1) the court finds that the information in the record enables it to meaningfully exercise its sentencing authority under /8 U.S.C.
3553, and the court explains its finding on the record.
[*888]

(B) Restitution. If the law requires permits restitution, the probation officer must conduct an investigation and submit a report
that contains sufficient information for the court to order restitution.

The Rationale:

As currently written, the rule directs that a presentence report contain information about restitution only when the law
requires restitution. The proposed amendment directs that all presentence reports contain appropriate restitution information
whenever the law permits restitution. If the law permits restitution, the court ought to receive information sufficient to allow
it to determine whether to order such restitution. Only with such knowledge can the court appropriately exercise its discretion.

In most cases, restitution is covered by one of two federal statutes: the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 (MVRA),
224 and its predecessor, the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982 (VWPA). 7%° For all crimes of violence and certain
crimes against property, the MVRA firmly directs that notwithstanding any other provision of law, when sentencing a

defendant convicted of [certain offenses such as crimes of violence] ... the court shall order ... that the defendant make
restitution to the victim of the offense or, if the victim is deceased, to the victim's estate. 226 For other crimes, the earlier
22)

VWPA controls. It permits the court to order restitution in its discretion after considering various relevant factors.

3 See Letter from Ed Carnes, Chair of the Advisory Comm. on Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, to Hon. David F. Levi, Chair of the
Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure (May 18, 2004) (on file with the author) (noting that proposed expansion of Rule 32
should be withdrawn if the CVRA was passed).

224 18 U.S.C. 3663A, 3664 (2000).

25 Td. 3663, 3664. See generally United States v. Bedonie, 317 F. Supp. 2d 1285 (D. Utah 2004) (discussing different statutes), rev'd on other
grounds, United States v. Serawop, 410 F.3d 656 (10th Cir. 2005).

26 18 U.S.C. 3663A(a)(1) (emphasis added); see United States v. Monts, 31] F.3d 993, 1001 (10th Cir. 2002) (holding that restitution under
the MVRA is mandatory).

27 18 U.S.C. 3663A(a)(3); see United States v. Fountain, 768 F.2d 790, 801 (7th Cir. 1985) (holding that restitution under the VWPA is
discretionary).

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018476.txt,"bad sexual communication, I want to offer some positive examples of sexual
communication from my life.

te Ok ok

1) Low pressure and leather belts. Years ago, when I was pretty inexperienced in the
community, I had a single BDSM encounter with a gentleman in his home. We met at a
BDSM discussion group, arranged to meet later at a cafe, and went home from there; as
we exited the cafe, I took his driver's license and texted his full name and license number
to a friend. (I think more people should do this, frankly -- in fact, more non-BDSM
people should do this when they go home with strangers from bars.)

We sat together on the public transit and quietly discussed the upcoming scene: he asked
me many, many questions about what I was okay with and not okay with. Questions like:
What do you have experience with? Could you go into that more?” What do you
like?” What makes that fun for you? Is there anything you really don't want me to do?”
He asked a lot of the questions twice, too, which I think is a really great strategy
especially with new partners. People don't always have their heads together enough
during these conversations to answer an S&M question properly the first time, especially
if it's a broad and open-ended question like What are the things you really don't want to
do?

I made it clear that I just wanted a BDSM encounter, that I wasn't up for oral sex or
vaginal sex or anything like that. He'd never had a BDSM encounter that didn't involve
orgasm, so it was a new concept for him, but he was cool with trying it.

After our long discussion of boundaries and limits, we made it to his apartment and
settled in. He got out some equipment, including a collar, and he said: While you're
wearing this, you will obey everything I say. Do you have any final boundaries to set?
Anything you really want me to do? Anything else you don't want me to do? I said no,
and he snapped on the collar. (We did have an agreed-upon safeword, though -- so I had a
way of interrupting the proceedings if I really needed to.)

It was an interesting encounter, partly because he was looking more for dominance
(giving orders) than sadism (inflicting pain), whereas at the time I was looking more for
masochism (receiving pain) than submission (accepting orders). So we started out with
him giving me a bunch of orders (primarily to fulfill his kink), and then in the end he hit
me a lot with a leather belt (to fulfill mine). At the time I was still figuring out where the
boundary was for me: whether I identified as a submissive or only a masochist; how
much submission and masochism were intertwined. That night showed me a lot about
how one can create submissive energy within a pre-defined space, even with someone
you barely know.

Afterwards, when I was done crying, he took off the collar and we went to bed. (By that
time of night, I didn't have a way back home from where he lived, so I had to sleep over.)
We chatted about random things, neither of us quite tired enough to sleep. Within half an
hour or so, he realized that there was no way he was ever going to get to sleep unless he
had an orgasm, but he also understood that I didn't want to have sex with him, so he
didn't try to push that. Instead, he said: I really need to have an orgasm before I can get

CBD Hemp Cultivation (Neivert)

2

2018 Farm Bill Legalizes Commercial Cultivation of Hemp: The 2018 Farm Bill legalized
industrial hemp at the federal level removing it from schedule | status under The
Controlled Substance Act. The bill defines industrial hemp as a variety of cannabis with a
THC concentration of </=0.3% and allows farmers to grow and sell hemp under state
regulation. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 41 states have
set up cultivation and production programs to regulate the production of hemp. (CT, ID,
SD, IA, OH, TX, LA, MS and GA do not currently allow hemp cultivation.)

Hemp is currently being grown under state Industrial Research Pilot Programs. Once
USDA rules are released, pilot programs may end in favor of USDA rules and rules of
state programs approved by the USDA.

Prior to the 2018 Farm Bill, the 2014 Farm Bill allowed universities and state
departments of agriculture to conduct hemp research under Agricultural Pilot Programs
in an effort to evaluate industrial hemp as a commercial crop. The bill allowed states to
begin research on best methods for hemp cultivation.

Cultivation Practices Of Hemp Dependent On Intended Harvestable Component

Hemp is grown for fiber, grain/seed and floral materials with different varieties of hemp
planted for each component. Fibers are used in rope and textiles, grain is used in human
food (not legal for animal feed), pressed seed oil from grain is used like sunflower seed
oil, and oils, including CBD, are removed from floral materials for health supplements.

Cultivation practices differ for fiber, grain/seed and CBD in an effort to maximize the
yield of the desired harvestable component. U.S. states have conducted pilot programs
in recent years to help gain a better understanding of best practices.

Limited Research Available On CBD Hemp Cultivation

There is little research on CBD hemp cultivation methods as hemp cultivation research
historically has focused on fiber and grain/seed. This lack of research, combined with a
number of variables that impact hemp for CBD yield, makes hemp for CBD cultivation
much more art than science at this point. Cultivation methods have been described as all
over the map. That being said, we detail methods from recent academic research studies
and conversations with industry participants below. (The University of Kentucky and
University of Vermont have both conducted research in CBD hemp cultivation in recent
years but further research is needed for conclusions regarding proper production
techniques.)

Hemp CBD Cultivation Steps:

e §=© Obtaina license. Growers must obtain a grower license from their state
department of agriculture for the specific type of hemp they want to grow.

e Find a buyer/processor. Growers then need to find a buyer/processor for their
harvest as crops can only be sold to licensed processors.

e Source seeds or clones. The grower must acquire seeds or transplants. Clones
(rooted cutting of a plant) can be used instead of seeds. The key factor in
selecting seeds or clones is understanding which strains produce flowers with
high CBD concentrations while keeping THC at </=0.3% since CBD and THC are
positively correlated which caps the CBD level. (A crop that exceeds 0.3% THC

quickly as possible, any way we can. The first five seconds will ne critical. Act
decisively,” I told the men. “Assume that everyone else will be doing the same.
Trust your instincts. You are trained for this.”

But more than an hour passed as we waited for the green light to storm the
plane. My main concern wasn’t that the hijackers would see us. There seemed
little reason to believe one of them would suddenly decide to take a walk in the
middle of the night. But sunrise was around five in the morning, and there was
no way I could see mounting our assault in broad daylight. If we didn’t get the
go-ahead soon, the chance would be lost. I called Talik several times, making
the point that if we were going to do it, we needed to use darkness as an ally.
The sayeret was a breed of night animals. Other people, even terrorists, would
be less alert and effective at night. But he kept saying he needed more time.

Finally, an hour before sunrise, he called back. “The big boss is on his way,”
he said. I left the others and crept back to meet the Defense Minister, a good
eighty yards from the plane. Dayan greeted me with a whispered hello. Ina
way, his arrival reminded me of my first operation in the sayeret when, before
heading north to the Golan, I'd been summoned to brief Tzvi Tzur, the chief of
staff. Tzur had seemed less interested in the details than in confirming that / was
confident the mission would work. Dayan, of course, had as much operational
knowledge and experience as anyone in Israel. Yet it seemed to me that he, too,
wanted to satisfy himself that I honestly felt we were in a position to succeed.
Especially, though he never so much as hinted at this, because two of the
officers I would be taking in with me, Uzi and Mookie Betzer, were members of
his family.

“How do you plan to do it?” he asked. I explained how we would get into the
plane simultaneously, in four teams, and confront the hiyackers. I said I was
confident we’d succeed, especially since darkness gave us an element of
surprise, and the terrorists were bound to be tiring. “We can do it,” I said.
“Better now than in daytime.” Dayan merely nodded. He stood there, silent, for
another few moments. “I’Il let you know,” he said, then shook my hand and
returned to the control tower. But fifteen minutes later he sent his reply, via
Talik. It was brief and explicit: “Not tonight.”

For the first but not the last time in uniform, I felt the frustration of finding
my preparation and judgement trumped, without explanation, by a decision
from above. When I got back to the control tower, I made no attempt to hide my
view we should have moved against the hijackers while we had the chance. But

Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 14 of 18

The girls who were abused by Jeffrey Epstein and the cops who championed their cause remain angry over what they regard as a gross injustice, while
Epstein's employees and those who engineered his non-prosecution agreement have prospered.

By

Taking a page from Epstein’s legal team, lawyers representing Epstein’s victims hired private investigators and former police detectives to dig into
Epstein’s life. Over the past decade, they’ve tracked down hundreds of people, including dozens of other potential victims; they’ve interviewed Epstein’s
recruiters, bookkeepers, housekeepers, butlers, pilots and drivers. They’ve traveled around the country and the world, taking statements and sworn
depositions, coaxing people to talk who had previously been too reticent to come forward.

In short, they did what criminal prosecutors didn’t do.

Some of the information they ’ve learned was given to federal authorities in New York. Edwards said those authorities have shown no interest in opening a
new investigation focused on crimes he is alleged to have committed in that state, where he is listed as a level 3 sex offender, the most dangerous
category, considered at risk to re-offend, records show. In New York, he has to register every 90 days.

Holding abusers accountable

In 2015, Roberts sued Maxwell for defamation in New York after Maxwell called her a liar in a news interview. The civil lawsuit was an effort by Roberts
not just to clear her name, but an attempt to prove that Epstein and Maxwell operated an international underage sex trafficking operation. The lawsuit
was settled out of court in 2017 and nearly all the evidence presented in the case has been sealed.

Roberts’ attorney, Sigrid McCawley, claims that Roberts received a sizable settlement, although the amount is confidential.

“She wanted to hold her abusers accountable and we were able to do that by bringing this case ... which we ultimately settled very successfully for her,”
said McCawley, an associate of noted Bush-Gore recount lawyer David Boies, who has also pursued cases against Epstein in federal court in New York.

2008 which you contend to be false?”

e “T would like to know whether you ever had any physical contact with the person
referred to as Jane Doe in that [federal] complaint?”

e “Did you ever have any physical contact with E.W.?”

e “What is the actual value that you contend the claim of E.W. against you has?”
The matters addressed in these questions are the central focus of Epstein’s claims against
Edwards. Epstein’s refusal to answer these and literally every other substantive question put to
him in discovery has deprived Edwards of even a basic understanding of the evidence alleged to
support claims against him. Moreover, by not offering any explanation of his allegations,
Fpetein is deptteiat Edwards of any opportunity to conduct third party discovery and
opportunity to challenge Epstein’s allegations.

It is the clear law that “the chief purpose of our discovery rules is to assist the truth-
finding function of our justice system and to avoid trial by surprise or ambush,” Scipio v. State,
928 So.2d 1138 (Fla.2006), and “full and fair discovery is essential to these important goals,”
McFadden v. State, 15 So.3d 755, 757 (Fla. 4 Dist. Ct. App. 2009). Accordingly, it is important
for the Court to insure “not only compliance with the technical provisions of the discovery rules,
but also adherence to the purpose and spirit of those rules in both the criminal and civil context.”
McFadden, 15 S0.3d at 757. Epstein has repeatedly blocked “full and fair discovery,” requiring

dismissal of his claim against Edwards.

capital inflow driving a high current account deficit putting a premium on savings; recognition that competitiveness
will lie in the creativity of our people as much as it does in our oil and gas; a renewed emphasis on the value of hi-
tech and education; and above all, a cultural change that integrates Australia more into East Asia. Cultural
transformation is the key for us, Keating says. He rates it as more important than economic reform.

“There is less interest now in being part of East Asia than there was in the 1990s,” he laments.

Keating wants this idea revived. And he ties it to the republic arguing that to succeed in Asia we must become a
republic, a proposition Howard always dismissed.

On China, Keating is an optimist yet alive to the daunting economic challenge China now confronts. What is
happening in China knows no precedence in world economic history, he says. Never before have 1.25 billion
people dragged themselves from poverty at such a pace. China is now half the GDP of the US and incomes have
risen by a factor of 10. He argues, however, that the origin of the 2008 financial crisis lies in the global imbalances -
China has built huge foreign exchange reserves by exporting too much and America, in turn, is saving too little.

Keating says: China must shift the basis of growth from net exports and investment to domestic consumption. Will
they achieve this? Probably. Will there be strains along the way? There have to be.

Unlike many Australian leaders, Keating is a Europhile. I think the European project is the most significant project
since the second world war, he says. But he sees two huge blunders made in Europe.

From the euro's inception, Keating said it should constitute only Germany, France and the Benelux nations, not the
peripheral countries around the Mediterranean, and Greece should never have been allowed in”.

Why were the weaker economies given entry?

Keating says: It's because president Mitterrand and the French wanted it. They weren't ready to sit beside the
German unified state without some friends.

So the eurozone was flawed from the outset, a structure awaiting internal assault: The problem is we have a single
currency without a political union and without a fiscal union.

The second blunder was the 1990s expansion of NATO to the Russian border. For Keating, this was recklessness
for which the world may yet pay.

Sensible policy would have included a place for Russia in the new world order,” he says. “But that didn't happen.
So Russian liberals were pushed to one side by Russian nationalists. In a sense the US has created Vladimir Putin.

Who is responsible? He points the finger at Bill Clinton.

On the 2008 financial crisis, he says former US Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan must bear a fair amount of
responsibility”.

Greenspan is someone | know and like,” Keating says. But if you are so naive to believe that institutions with a
balance sheet with assets geared at 45 to one is not an accident waiting to happen then you don't deserve to be

chairman of the Federal Reserve.

He praises Obama for seeking a return to the “liberal internationalism that, in Keating's view, made the US great in
the post-World War Il age. This is the US he loves but it is still in retreat.

Asked about the nature of leadership, Keating reveals what lies within his heart: | believe there is a poetic strand to
life that doesn't exist in an economics textbook.

That was no mere academic problem in a conflict where, for decades, our
enemies had defined Israel’s mere existence as illegitimate. The reason for
Rabin’s reluctance to have his “deposit” presented as a set negotiating position
was that it meant dealing away our only card — territory — before the hard
questions about peace had been answered. When he phoned Christopher, I don’t
think I’ve ever heard him as angry. That was not what we agreed, he insisted.
He said it had spoiled any prospect of serious negotiations on the peace side of
the balance. Christopher didn’t agree there had been any real damage, nor that
Assad had failed to understand the context.

It might not have changed things anyway, since by this stage, the Oslo talks
had almost completed a draft agreement. In mid-August, Rabin gave Peres the
go-ahead to initial this “Declaration of Principles.” It provided for a period of
interim Palestinian self-government; the start of a phased Israeli withdrawal
from Gaza and the West Bank with the creation of a Palestinian police force to
deal with internal security; and a commitment to reach a full peace agreement
within five years. In early September, ahead of the formal signing of the Oslo
declaration, there was an exchange of “letters of recognition” between Arafat
and Rabin. Arafat’s letter also renounced “terrorism and other acts of violence”
and declared invalid “those articles of the Palestinian Covenant which deny
Israel’s right to exist.” A few days later, the signing ceremony was hosted by
President Clinton in Washington. Thus emerged the famous photo of Rabin and
Arafat shaking hands, on either side of Clinton, who was beaming, arms
outstretched in conciliation. They say a picture is worth a thousand words. In
this case, you needed barely a dozen. Rabin’s demeanor, his posture, the look
on his face, all seemed to say: “I would rather be shaking the hand of anyone on
earth than Arafat.” Still, the image was on front pages worldwide. The news
stories spoke of a new spirit of hope. Now that these old enemies had grasped
hands, surely a full peace agreement was within reach.

My feeling, as I watched it on TV in the kirya, was more guarded. I did hope
for peace, of course. I also recognized that the signing on the White House lawn
was just a beginning, and that my role would be to ensure that Israel’s security
needs were met under whatever formal peace agreement might eventually be
reached. And the security omens were hardly encouraging. Despite Oslo,
Palestinian attacks were continuing. Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and other dissident
factions saw Arafat’s concessions as treachery, and were setting out to drive
home that point with violence.

tokens (Atoms) in the AtomSpace, allowing it to be located by various cognitive processes, and
associated with other memory items of any type.

So for instance an OpenCog AI system has an AtomSpace, plus some specialized knowledge
stores linked into the AtomSpace; and it also has specific algorithms acting on the AtomSpace
and appropriate specialized stores corresponding to each type of memory. Each of these algo-
rithms is complex and has its own story; for instance (an incomplete list, for more detail see
the following section of this Introduction):

e Declarative knowledge is handled using Probabilistic Logic Networks, described in Chapter
34 and others;

e Procedural knowledge is handled using MOSES, a probabilistic evolutionary learning algo-
rithm described in Chapter 21 and others;

e Attentional knowledge is handled by ECAN (economic attention allocation), described in
Chapter 23 and others;

e OpenCog contains a language comprehension system called RelEx that takes English sen-
tences and turns them into nodes and links in the AtomSpace. It’s currently being ex-
tended to handle Chinese. RelEx handles mostly declarative knowledge but also involves
some procedural knowledge for linguistic phenomena like reference resolution and semantic
disambiguation.

But the crux of the CogPrime cognitive architecture is not any particular cognitive process,
but rather the way they all work together using cognitive synergy.

1.8 Virtually and Robotically Embodied AI

Another issue that will arise frequently in these pages is embodiment. There’s a lot of debate in
the AI community over whether embodiment is necessary for advanced AGI or not. Personally,
we doubt it’s necessary but we think it’s extremely convenient, and are thus considerably
interested in both virtual world and robotic embodiment. The CogPrime architecture itself is
neutral on the issue of embodiment, and it could be used to build a mathematical theorem
prover or an intelligent chat bot just as easily as an embodied AGI system. However, most of
our attention has gone into figuring out how to use CogPrime to control embodied agents in
virtual worlds, or else (to a lesser extent) physical robots. For instance, during 2011-2012 we
are involved in a Hong Kong government funded project using OpenCog to control video game
agents in a simple game world modeled on the game Minecraft [GPC™ 11].

Current virtual world technology has significant limitations that make them far less than
ideal from an AGI perspective, and in Chapter 16 we will discuss how they can be remedied.
However, for the medium-term future virtual worlds are not going to match the natural world
in terms of richness and complexity — and so there’s also something to be said for physical
robots that interact with all the messiness of the real world.

With this in mind, in the Artificial Brain Lab at Xiamen University in 2009-2010, we con-
ducted some experiments using OpenCog to control the Nao humanoid robot [GD09]. The goal
of that work was to take the same code that controls the virtual dog and use it to control the
physical robot. But it’s harder because in this context we need to do real vision processing
and real motor control. A similar project is being undertaken in Hong Kong at time of writ-
ing, involving a collaboration between OpenCog AI developers and David Hanson’s robotics

UBS View Prefer Relative-value and Event-driven
¢ We expect hedge funds (HF) to offer positive asymmetric return characteristics due to active risk
management and stop-loss strategies. On the active risk side of the equation, we have seen lower gross
exposure and net-market exposure within the overall hedge funds group, with traders being cautiously
positioned. With systemic risk at bay, we favor relative-value (RV ) and event-driven (ED) strategies.

¢ The inherent hedging in relative value is appealing. Credit relative-value managers should perform well
in this environment of higher fixed-income volatility and increasing pricing anomalies created by central
bank interventions and limited competition.

¢ While ED managers share some of the performance drivers, idiosyncratic bets reduce the correlation to
markets. The real reason to own this strategy, however, is the potential for outsized returns in distressed,
high-yield, and other credit investments as the Eurozone crisis plays out.

A Positive scenario Prefer Equity long-short
¢ Reduced uncertainty (e.g. resolution in Europe) lowers equities’ correlation and volatility. This helps
bottom-up fundamental analysis and equity long/short managers the most. Also, CEOs will likely make
more corporate transactions that can be monetized by event-driven managers, and a clearer
macroeconomic environment with more persistent trends would support CTA managers.
‘Negative scenario Prefer Trading (Global Macro + CTA)
° So far this year, the market has remained plagued by short-term reversals, due to central banks’
intervention and stimulus effects, an obstacle for trend-following managers. Still, if the European
deleveraging (or fiscal cliff, China hard landing) is unmanaged, this could threaten risky assets. Trading
can do well if such a scenario unfolds.

Note: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7).

What we're Why it matters
watching
Global equity direction/

economic cycle

The outlook for global equities is an important HF performance driver. The
economic cycle impacts the strategies differently.

Correlation Correlation is an important performance/alpha driver for equity long/short, the
largest HF strategy by assets under management.

Leverage Gross and net leverage are key to monitoring risk.

Volatility The direction influences certain HF strategies (e.g. convertible arbitrage).

Liquidity Important in particular for large, less nimble HFs, it enables them to enter and
exit their strategies.

Regulation Volcker rule, USCITS III/IV

Recommendations
Strategic (1 to 2 years)

Recommendation: Active risk
management is instrumental for capital
preservation during adverse market
conditions. At the moment, we therefore
favor relative-value and event-driven
strategies, since they are less correlated to
equity markets and other risky assets than
trading.

Value proposition: Hedge funds should
achieve robust performance over an
extended horizon, while displaying
limited volatility vis-a-vis equities and
other risky assets. Hedge funds try to
minimize downside losses in adverse
market conditions (e.g. active risk
management), which plays a crucial role in
wealth appreciation. Similarly, hedge fund
managers attempt to capture most of the
upside of risky assets owning to valid
value preposition.

politicians, businessmen, royalty, academicians, etc,’ the lawsuit says according to The Enquirer.

Epstein's sexual exploits have been documented since 2005, when a woman in Palm Beach contacted

police saying that her 14-year-old daughter had been paid $300 to massage him and then have sex.

The claim prompted a nearly year-long investigation that led to the eventual charge of soliciting
prostitution which came as part of a plea deal. He spent 13 months of a 18-month sentence in jail and

remains a registered sex offender.

Several of his famous friends cut ties- including Clinton and then-New York Governor Eliot Spitzer who
returned his campaign donations- but not all of them: Prince Andrew reportedly stayed at Epstein's

mansion in New York in 2010, months after he was released from jail.

CHAPTER TEN

Raider of the Inner Sanctum
“They think there’s a smoking gun in there that would be the death of them all politically.”

—Edward Snowden in Moscow

The nightmare of the NSA is a penetration. As the CIA, FBI and NSA found out in the 1990s,
No intelligence service is invulnerable to it. Any employee of a large intelligence organization can
turn, or be turned, against it. Among the more than 10,000 intelligence workers employed by the
NSA, it is a near certainty that over time one or more of them will become dissatisfied with their
work. He or she may have a personal grievance about their pay, lack of promotion or their
treatment by their superiors. Disenchantment with the NSA may also proceed from idealistic
objections. After all, the NSA is in the business of secretly intercepting messages, and an insider
could find its spying activities at odds with his or her own beliefs about the violation of privacy.
For any of these reasons, a disgruntled insider could go rogue. He or she then might attempt to
right a perceived wrong by disclosing the NSA secrets to another party. That party might then
induce or blackmail the rogue employee into disclosing further secrets. To guard against it, the
NSA has developed a well-organized system for stratifying its data so that obtaining critical
secrets would require a rogue employee to burrow into its heavily protected inner sanctum. As
part of this system, the NSA divides its data into different tiers depending on the importance of
the secrets to its operations. The first tier, Level 1, is mainly administrative material. This data
would include FISA court orders and other directives it employees might need to check on to
carry out their tasks. Level 2 contains data from which the secret sources have been removed.
This tier, available to other intelligence services and policy-makers, includes reports and analysis
that can be shared. The third tier, Levels 3, contains documents that cannot be shared outside of
a small group of authorized individuals because they disclose the secret sources through which the
NSA surreptitiously obtained the information. This third tier includes, for example, compiled list
of the sources in China, Russia, Iran and other adversary countries. It also disclosed the exotic
methods the NSA uses to get some of this data. Level 3 documents also include reports on

as an arbitrator or mediator between the competing strands of American economic and
political ideology. He repeatedly eschews striking out, snatching the naked flame and
hanging on. But the cost of this strategy is not simply a cost to him; it is a cost to the
whole world.

On the other hand, Chancellor Merkel is the archetypal worry-wart. She does not lead;
she assesses.

“You really wonder why leaders want these jobs when they really do not want to lead.
And what is their risk? That Barack Obama will not get a second term? Or that Angela
Merkel's coalition might finally end up on the rocks? If they actually made the leap they
might astound themselves. Because, in the end, everyone in political life gets carried out
- the only relevant question is whether the pallbearers will be crying.

For Keating, the 20th-century leader exerting most influence on the coming century is
China's Deng Xiaoping.

If you look at the other figures of the century, Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin and Mao, none
will leave the legacy in terms of the 21st century that Deng leaves, he says. He walked

away from the ideology of the Communist Party just as effectively as Mikhail Gorbachev

walked away from the essence of the Soviet Union.

By 2050 Keating sees a world order with nations in terms of gross domestic product in
this hierarchy: (1) China, (2) US, (3) India, (4) Japan, (5) Brazil, (6) Russia, (7) Britain, (8)
Germany, (9) France and (10) Italy.

The key, however, is that Japan lags a distant fourth behind the top three.

On America, Keating is dismayed by the pivotal change in its outlook after the end of the
Cold War. When the Berlin Wall came down the Americans cried victory and walked off
the field, he says.

Yet the end of the Cold War offered the chance for America to develop a new world
order. It didn't know what to do with its victory. This at the moment the US should have
begun exploiting the opportunity of establishing a new world order to embrace open
regionalism and the inclusion of great states like China, India and the then loitering
Russia.

Well, frankly, the US didn't have the wisdom. It just wanted to celebrate its peace
dividend. The two Clinton terms and the two George W. Bush terms, that's four
presidential terms, have cost US mightily.

For Keating, the malaise in US politics is the problem. He says: The most compelling
thing I've seen in years is that in the great burst of American productivity between 1990
and 2008, of that massive increment to national income, none of it went to wages. By
contrast, in Australia real wages over the same period had risen by 30 per cent. Keating
sees this as the breakdown of America's national compact, the shattering of its

Subject: Essays 
Importance: High 
Essay 1. 
Coming from an international background, and having lived in Oslo, Tel Aviv, New York and London by the age of eighteen, I 
believe that the international profile of NYU will provide the best environment for my college education, with the added benefit of 
returning to the place where I've spent most of my childhood and where my mother will be posted as Norwegian Ambassador to the 
UN in January 2019. 
NYU's Art History department appeals to me because of its wide range of courses, from the global art of antiquity to the 
contemporary. My passion is the Italian Renaissance and the rich history behind it, especially the works of 15th century masters such 
as Masaccio and Bellini. Some of the courses that NYU offers such as Early masters of Italian Renaissance painting and Florentine 
Villas: An Interpretation Based on Historical, Social Factors are, therefore appealing to me. What I find exciting, is not only the 
visual aesthetics and analysis of these masterpieces, but also the manner in which the Renaissance emphasised scientific and 
economic innovation, areas of study the Global Liberal Arts programme would offer. NYU's unique campus in Florence would give 
me a once in lifetime opportunity to spend a year immersing myself in the art, culture and history of Italy. This would be an exciting 
experience to have while studying for a Bachelor's degree in Art History, and would compliment my main interests in the subject. 
As one of the prime cultural centres in the world, NYU's location in NYC is the perfect place to broaden knowledge within 
contemporary art. I am very much looking forward to visiting the Whitney Biennia this May. In addition the New museum, which 
shows a lot of the kind of work I find interesting is a short walk away from campus. 
Taking advantage of being based in central London for the past year, I have completed the Chairman's Programme at Christies, work 
experience at the Courtauld Gallery and I will be working at Maddox Gallery in the near future. Similarly, I want to take advantage of 
being based in NYC to gain as much experience as possible. I have chosen to apply Early Decision to NYU as it is the only American 
university I will be applying to, as there is no better place to obtain experience of the contemporary art world than New York City. 
Essay 2. 
From the age of extremes to the age of bewilderment 
What captivates me more than anything else is the different ideological phases of the 20th century and how art can be used as a 
tool of advancement and reflection on ideological and political developments. 
My fascination began when I read; Eric Hobsbawm's Age Of Extremes and has since developed through books such as 
Benjamin Carter Heft's The Death Of Democracy and Yuval Harari A Brief History Of Tomorrow and 21 Lessons For 
The 21st Century. 
In the years after the First World War, until the end of the Second World War, three political models for shaping the future of 
nation states emerged; Fascism, Communism and liberal democracy. These all offered great ideas for the future of the world. 
Fascism and Communism shared some common features: authoritarian, strong leaders and a belief that their revolutions had to 
be carried through with violence. This led to the mass murders in the Nazi concentration camps and in the Soviet Gulags. 
In the mid war periods, the Litfass columns that were originally designed to carry advertising, became the outdoor galleries 
for the war of ideologies. The political poster was born. High quality posters from every political party in Germany popped up 
on the columns. Hitler's propaganda chief G8ebels stated that the Nazi election campaign should be run through speeches and 
posters. The other parties responded in kind. An art form thus became an essential political tool in the battle for votes. The 
propagandist Art used by the Nazis and communists alike was essential in helping sell their message to the masses. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033414 
Indeed, much of the art that was critical of these movements was suppressed or censored and subversive artists cowed, in 
some cases imprisoned or even worse. 
The liberal democratic model departed sharply from these authoritarian perspectives by presenting the alternative of free and 
transparent elections, the rule of law and freedom of speech. In the mid-war period the three narratives were competing to be the 
conceptual frame for society. After the Second World War fascism was crushed leaving the two competing ideologies of 
communism and liberal democracy. After the demise of communism in 1989, through to the late 1990's, liberal democracy was 
victorious in the idealogical battlefield. Some historians, like Francis Fukuyama, went so far as to proclaim this period as the 
end of history. 
A key piece of art that championed this kind of ideology was Sheppard Fairey's campaign poster for Barack Obama. In this 
poster, Fairey, a well established graffiti artist uses urban colours and stencilling techniques combined with the message 
HOPE to promote the incoming presidents positive values and popularity with the young. It is notable that Fairey's most 
recent political poster protests the Trump presidency rather than promote it. 
With the rise of so called illiberal democracy, with strong parties standing for populist ideologies, we have now moved into 
what can be described as the age of bewilderment. We were not in fact at the end of history. Once again the future looks 
unpredictable and insecure and artists are responding in different ways. 
Jeremy Deller, a British Turner prize winning artist created a work which features a car damaged in the bombing of the historic 
Mutanabbi Street book market, which resulted in the deaths of 38 people. Here, an art work has been used to show the aftermath 
of an event. This event was the result of the Iraq war, which was seen as a way to spread democracy. Here Art is used as a 
means by which to explore the effects of ideology rather than promote it, another really interesting area in the study of the 
intersections between ideology and art. 
Exploring how art reflects the historical and ideological contexts of the world around it is fascinating to me and I would love to 
study these ideas in more depth at undergraduate level.

Synthetic Cannabis (Schenkel)

The Broad Spectrum Of Cannabinoids

Cannabinoids fall into three main types: (1) endogenous cannabinoids, which are
produced naturally in the bodies of humans and animals; (2) phytocannabinoids, which
are isolated from plants; and (3) synthetic cannabinoids, which are produced in the
laboratory and may have some structural deviations from the naturally occurring
molecules.

Of the three types, phytocannabinoids have garnered a lot of interest because of their
therapeutic and recreational potential. For example, Marinol and Syndros, which the
FDA cleared for the treatment of anorexia associated with weight loss in AIDS patients,
include the active ingredient dronabinol, a synthetic delta-9- tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC) which is considered the psychoactive component of marijuana. In June 2048, the
FDA approved an oral formulation of cannabidiol (CBD), Epidiolex, which GW
Pharmaceuticals PLC developed for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare
and severe forms of epilepsy in children.

n addition to THC and CBD, more than 100 other phytocannabinoids have been
identified from the cannabis plant. This includes lesser-known compounds such as
tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), cannabigerol (CBG), and cannabichromene (CBC).

The broad spectrum of phytocannabinoids can bind to a range of different receptors in
the human body and induce a wide variety of pharmacological responses. However, due
to the limited research into these varying effects, a full understanding of the role of each
cannabinoid compound is still poorly understood. With that said, some of the most
studied roles are listed in the table below.

Bibi’s team on the far wing. I gave him a full minute to be certain he was in
place.

Then I whistled. From my initial position beside the plane, I saw Danny
Yatom and his team begin to move one of the tall ladders toward the front door.
Shifting my eyes toward the wing doors as the “crucial first five seconds” ticked
by, I saw both the ones on my side of the plane were still shut. I climbed up on
the wing. When I got to the smaller, rear door I saw the main one cave inward
and Mordechai Rachamim rush in. But the soldier on the other door was
trembling and frozen in place. I slapped him, hard, on the back. “Move!” I
shouted. Instantly, he pushed the door in and rushed inside. I then noticed Uzi
and his team had still not entered from the rear. I jumped from the wing and ran
toward the ladder at the back, but by the time I got there, they had made it
inside, and I followed them in.

Everything was over within 90 seconds. As I’d expected, the planning and
training turned out to matter less than instinct and initiative. Within seconds, Uri
Koren managed to get into the nose-wheel assembly. Though he couldn’t
dislodge a metal-mesh panel separating it from the cockpit, he spotted the
outline of a man’s foot above him, fired, and wounded Captain Rifa’at. The
other members of Danny’s team in front were less lucky. With the ladder, they
had no trouble getting to the passenger door, but they struggled to force it open.
When they did nudge it open a crack, one of the hijackers opened fire, slightly
wounding one of the men and forcing them to abandon the attempt.

Mordechai went in shooting, but immediately drew fire and had to retreat.
But Omer Wachman, another air marshal I’d posted on the far wing, was ina
couple of seconds later. Coming face-to-face with one of the hijackers, he shot
him in the head. That allowed Mordechai to get back inside. He quickly
exchanged fire with the hobbled Captain Rifa’at, hitting the hijacker in the side.
As Mordechai ducked down to reload his pistol, Rifa’at managed to lock
himself inside one of the toilets near the cockpit. Mordechai ran after him. He
fired through the bathroom door, then kicked it open and confirmed that he was
dead. Rushing back toward the center of plane, he spotted the main woman
hijacker, wearing a bulky explosive vest. Grabbing her hands, he reached inside
the vest and yanked out the battery pack. With two of the hijackers already
dead, Mordechai had now subdued the third. But knowing that there was still
another woman unaccounted for, he handed her over to Bibi and Marco
Ashkenazi. Bibi grabbed her by the back of her hair, but it turned out to be a

Gulen movement.

Turkey hasn't yet made a formal extradition request to the U.S., and Turkish officials say they plan to provide

more evidence to the Justice Department.

Mr. Gulen, 75 years old, came to the U.S. in 1999, and has a devoted following in Turkey and other countries.

At a press conference in Washington on Friday, Mr. Gulen’s lawyers said they have spoken to the Justice

Department about the demands for extradition but are unaware of the U.S. government’s thinking or plans.

Asked if they feared for his life, one of Mr. Gulen’s lawyers, Reid Weingarten said, “We do. We’re very
concemed about his safety.’’ The lawyer said they are discussing whether to ask U.S. authorities for help in

safeguarding their client.

A Turkish court has issued a warrant for Mr. Gulen’s arrest, and Turkish and U.S. authorities have privately
discussed scenarios in which Mr. Gulen might be extradited. But several U.S. officials said they cannot now

envision a scenario in which they turn him over to Turkey.

“Tt would be unprecedented and appalling if the U.S. took a frail, almost octogenarian, plopped him on a plane
to go back into that kind of setting with the hideous things that are being said about him by the entire Turkish

government,’’ said Mr. Weingarten.

“The bluster, the conspiracy theories, and the threats of Mr. Erdogan are not strong enough to overwhelm the
American legal system,” he added. “And for that reason we believe that Mr. Gulen should not and will not be

extradited.’’

Mr. Weingarten said the chances that his client helped plot a coup from his base in the Poconos is “about as

likely” as a meteor striking the lawyer’s office while he was speaking.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

No. 17-1011

BUDHA ISMAIL JAM, ET AL., PETITIONERS v.
INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT

[February 27, 2019]

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the
Court.

The International Organizations Immunities Act of 1945
grants international organizations such as the World
Bank and the World Health Organization the “same im-
munity from suit ... as is enjoyed by foreign govern-
ments.” 22 U.S.C. §288a(b). At the time the IOIA was
enacted, foreign governments enjoyed virtually absolute
immunity from suit. Today that immunity is more lim-
ited. Most significantly, foreign governments are not
immune from actions based upon certain kinds of commer-
cial activity in which they engage. This case requires us to
determine whether the IOIA grants international organi-
zations the virtually absolute immunity foreign govern-
ments enjoyed when the IOIA was enacted, or the more
limited immunity they enjoy today.

Respondent International Finance Corporation is an
international organization headquartered in the United
States. The IFC finances private-sector development
projects in poor and developing countries around the
world. About 10 years ago, the IFC financed the construc-

were likely to be a lot more important than tank formations in future conflicts.

Six days into the job, I called together every officer in the army, from the
rank of lieutenant-colonel up. I said we needed to remind ourselves of the
army’s purpose: to protect Israel’s security and, if a war came, to win it. My
budgetary rule of thumb over the next four years would be simple: anything that
didn’t directly contribute to that mission was expendable. In fact, I put it a bit
more bluntly: “We need to cut anything that doesn’t shoot.”

My first attempt failed utterly. I proposed to close, or sell off, the army’s
radio station, Galei Tzahal. Running it cost serious money. If we were going to
cut everything that didn’t shoot, it was an obvious candidate. But what I failed
to take into account was its popularity with the listening public. Although other
radio stations had opened recently, for many years it had been the only major
alternative to the state-funded Kol Yisrael. It also provided a training ground
and employment feeder for future journalists. Galei Tzahal’s alumni included
some of the country’s top media figures, and more than a few members of the
Knesset. Within weeks, a lobbying effort was underway to “save” the station. I
went to see Misha. He agreed that, from a military and budgetary standpoint,
closing it was the right thing to do. But in an early lesson in how different
politics were from the army, he told me that politically, it simply wasn’t going
to fly. “Drop it, Ehud,” he said. So I did.

Still, I did end up fundamentally retooling the armed forces during my time
as chief of staff. We developed agile new strike forces and high-precision, high-
tech weapons systems with “stand-off” munitions designed to be fired from
many miles away. In the 1973 war, and for the decade or two that followed,
Saggers, and the US-made TOW missiles that Israel acquired after the war, had
the capability to transform a battlefield. Now, Israeli developers came up with
small, ground-launched missiles that could take out a tank from five to 10 miles
away, even without a direct line of sight to the target. Of even more long-term
military significance, I pushed ahead with developing pilotless drones — so-
called UAVs — making us the first army in the world to produce and deploy
them.

Yet for a security challenge like the intifada, even the most advanced stand-
off munitions or UAVs offered no practical answer. The latest stage in the
violence involved knife attacks by Palestinians against Israeli civilians, both on
West Bank settlers and inside Israel. Days after I took over, a 26-year-old from
Gaza, wielding a butcher’s knife and shouting Alahu Akhbar, killed four people,

Wynona Rider, whose godfather was Timothy Leary. He had been Anita’ s
role model during the final months of A/s life. “You couldn’ t choose how
and when and with whom you were born,” he said, “but you can take
charge of your own death.” And that’ s exactly what she was now doing.

Robin Williams learned about Anita’ s situation from his co-star in
Good Will Hunting, Matt Damon, who had been told about it by his
girlfriend, Wynona. Robin had never met Anita, but he called and offered
to pay a visit, in keeping with his benign case of Patch Adams Syndrome.
After all, if Patch could travel to Trinidad to entertain murderers who

Robin to make Anita laugh on Christmas day? She hesitated— “l’ ve

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023857.txt,"How to Teach the Twelve Cognitive Processes 177

So, upon reaching school age, a child can do some of the cognitive
processes. Now the question is, How to we teach him to get better at
them?

First let’s see what the cognitive processes fundamentally have in
common. This will give us a way of thinking about how to teach them.

The first and most important thing they have in common is that
they all rely on a case base. We have all engaged in each of these
processes many times and we have a range of experiences we can call
upon to guide us the next time we find ourselves doing them. Each
process relies on a story base as well. We can tell stories about inter-
esting experiences we have had in doing each one of them. Stories
usually revolve around failures, or at least unexpected results, since
without these there are no good Stories to tell. Engaging in any cogni-
tive process includes the possibility of making a mistake during the
process. We expect to get smarter each time as a result of any mistakes
we make. This is what cognitive processes are like. We learn cognitive
processes through experience and we index the failures we have so
that we can find them again and perhaps avoid making the same mis-
take. When we avoid an error that we know we have made previously,
we say that we have learned.

It follows, therefore, that acquiring a case base, learning the sto-
ries of others and learning to tell our own stories, and learning classic
mistakes and being able to analyze behavior to find a mistake are all
aspects of learning the cognitive processes.

Acquiring the case base and consciously analyzing the cases in
that case base, then, is the fundamental issue in teaching the cogni-
tive processes.

HOW TO TEACH PREDICTION

We live in a physical world but we also live in a social world. Children
need to understand that if they drop something heavy on their foot,
it will hurt; they also need to know that if they do something mean
to someone, the person may dislike them for it and may seek revenge.
We use predictions to figure out what will happen as a result of our
actions and then we use that knowledge to guide us in our future

TripAdvisor (Underperform, $40 PO)

Stock view: EBITDA under pressure, brand ad spend not in Street estimates yet
2016 was a re-platforming year, and with Instant Book fully rolled out globally, the
company aims to re-educate visitors on its booking offering. However, we think most
TripAdvisor visitors (399mn average monthly unique visitors in 2017 and 148mn
average monthly hotel shoppers) still view the site as a review/research portal, and
changing customer behavior will be quite difficult, particularly as we do not think
TripAdvisor has clarified its value proposition for shoppers.

While we think that TripAdvisor's elevated marketing spend in 2017 will drive a rebound
in traffic, we anticipate a poor ROI. Marketing expense continues to ramp as Instant
Book rolls out, though traffic growth slows, implying more costly traffic acquisition. In
40’16, Sales & Marketing as a % of sales increased to 52.8% vs. 45.6% in 4Q’15, and
we think TripAdvisor essentially bought desktop Hotel Shopper traffic, though likely at
poor ROI. However, higher marketing spend in 2017 does not yet include potential for a
likely return to expensive brand ad campaigns. In our brand ad spend scenario analysis,
we expect still more downside to estimates (see Taking a look at TripAdvisor’s potential

brand ad spend).

The company is encouraged by Revenue per Hotel Shopper growth continuing to
improve from down 21% y/y in 1Q. We expect growth continues its improvement trend
in 2017. However, if monetization trends decelerate, earnings downside could be
significant. We think it will be difficult for TripAdvisor's Hotel revenue to return to
growth next year, let alone double-digit y/y growth, given the mobile monetization
headwinds. However, if the company invests heavily in traffic acquisition, particularly on
higher monetizing desktop, revenue and traffic growth may reaccelerate meaningfully in
2017, though with ongoing pressure on margins.

Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q: Update on ad spend targets, 2017 guidance

TRIP’s outlook for 2017 is based on “prioritizing revenue growth as opposed to profit
growth,” which implies far lower marketing return expectations. However, TRIP notes
this expectation for marketing spend does not include potential for a return to brand
marketing, which could be an incremental $50-70mn headwind in ’17, in our view.

Biggest 1Q issues/risks:

¢ Marketing spend: TripAdvisor has prioritized revenue growth at the expense of
earnings, implying poor marketing ROI. The biggest issue facing TripAdvisor is if it
decides to pursue an expensive brand/TV marketing campaign which would further
drive further earnings downside.

meanwhile was attending a two-week fitness training course at a Yoga camp that qualified her to
be a yoga instructor. She then moved in with Snowden. Even though she had been living on and
off with Snowden during the past two years abroad, including while he worked at the CIA in
Switzerland and the NSA in Japan, they had not shared a home in America up until now. The
now 25-year old Mills posted on Instagram “Finally in our first US place together.” She also put
on line pictures of him in bed with her, who she now affectionately referred to in her posts as a
“computer crusader.”

Dell meanwhile had him to work on problem- solving for its corporate clients. In preparation
for his corporate role, he shaved off this facial hair and, with Lindsay’s help, bought a Ralph
Lauren suit. These corporate clients were assisting the NSA, the CIA, and the Defense
Intelligence Agency (DIA). Consequently, Snowden dealt with a wide range of intelligence
officers, and gave presentations on the vulnerabilities at computer security at the DIA-sponsored
Joint Counter Intelligence seminar.

His dealings with these US intelligence officers in no way mitigated his resentment of the
intelligence establishment. What began at the CIA in 2009 as objections to what he saw as the
incompetence of his superiors grew into well-articulated disapproval of the way that the US
government conducted its intelligence. He found NSA surveillance particularly worrisome, later
telling the Guardian: They [the NSA] are intent on making every conversation and every form of
behavior in the world known to them. He claimed after defecting to Moscow that he had voiced
his concerns about what he considered illicit surveillance to ten NSA officials, “none of whom
took any action to address them.” The NSA can find no record of these complaints but if
Snowden had indeed complained to these officials while working for Dell, his superiors at Dell
either didn’t notice or care that they had a very disgruntled employee on their hand. He also
made no secret of anger at the US government and the corporations that served it on the Internet.
He railed on the Ars Technica site against the complicity of private corporations, such as Dell,
that assisted the NSA. In his on-line posts in 2010, Snowden expressed loathing for the
assistance that corporate America was providing the intelligence community. “It really concerns
me how little this sort of corporate behavior bothers those outside of technology circles,” he
wrote under his True Hoo-ha alias. He said he feared that America was already on “a slippery
slope,” and suggested, perhaps adumbrating his own later actions, that this corporate assistance to
US intelligence “was entirely within our control to stop.” What the “computer crusader,” as Mills
had playfully called him in her Internet postings, expressed in these angry Internet postings was an
almost obsessive concern over individuals freely submitting to government authority. “Society
really seems to have developed an unquestioning obedience towards spooky types,” he wrote on
Ars Technica without mentioning that he himself worked for a corporation, Dell that assisted spy
agencies. He asked rhetorically on this public forum whether the sinister slide towards a
surveillance state “sneaked in undetected because of pervasive government secrecy?”

The outright contempt he expressed towards this “government secrecy” in no way prevented
him from seeking even more secret work at Dell for the intelligence services. In February 2011,

predictive value in the theory. Where does it lead? Rabbits and redwoods have
different periods of production, at first glance, but should nonetheless agree in
return if in risk. Jevons wrote that he meant production of the “wage fund” as a
whole, meaning the universe of consumer goods. But he pointed to wine and timber
as examples to help pin down the period. Boehm Bawerk picked nine years for no

reason I can see.

All went wrong by considering physical capital only. The factors blend into each
other; physical becomes human capital through invested consumption, and
conversely when human depreciation is recovered in products. The generation
length gives the replacement period for total capital if total capital is interpreted as

fitness and if all fitness of each generation is passed to the next.

Jevons and Boehm Bawerk assumed growthlessness for simplicity, and would have
realized that they were modeling only the replacement component in net output.
Boehm Bawerk’s contribution, anticipated by Petty, was his insight that time
preference rate explains rate of return by pricing the capital denominator, and not
the reverse. This had not been clear in Rae or Senior or Jevons. | give all four high
marks for a near miss. But they could have come closer. Remember that Senior's
first axiom had been Malthus’ population principle. He and the others would also
have known of Petty’s human and total capital idea, which was occasionally revived

and critiqued. They didn’t quite connect the dots.

Next Generation Theory

Petty wrote A Treatise of Taxes in 1662. The whole title continues to about as many
words, counting ampersands, as pages in the book or pamphlet. His son tells us that
Petty dictated his books overnight to secretaries who slept by turns. It is easy to

believe that Petty didn’t need much sleep. He was a go-getter who had sailed to

to an adversary intelligence services on the prowl for a source. If any party was looking for a
disgruntled US employees, Snowden’s Internet chatter about bad choices in gambling could
arouse its interest. That Snowden used his TheTrueHooHa alias for these Internet posting would
not prevent a sophisticated espionage organization, such as the Russian Intelligence service, from
quickly uncovering that his true identity was Edward Snowden. Nor would it be difficult to place
him at the CIA since, it will be recalled, he was listed by his true name on the roster of the US
Mission to the UN. By consulting personnel records it would further emerge that he did not
actually work for the State Department. Since it was no secret, at least to the Russian
Intelligence services, that the US mission in Geneva housed the CIA station for all of Switzerland,
it was probable that this brittle gambler who played the options market worked for the CIA. Even
though it cannot be precluded that Snowden was spotted in Geneva by another intelligence
service, there is no evidence, at least that I know of, to suggest that he was approached by one.
Nor is there reason to believe that if he had been contacted by a foreign service in 2008, he would
have responded positively. Despite his indiscreet posting about his outside activities, he
apparently still respected the boundaries of secrecy that had been clearly defined in the oath he
had taken in the CIA. For example, after the New York Times published an article revealing
secret American intelligence activities in Iran on January 11, 2009, Snowden railed against the
newspaper on the Internet under his True HOOHA alias, He wrote “This shit is classified for a
reason... It’s because this shit won’t work if Iran knows what we are doing.” He clearly
recognized that revealing intelligence sources was extremely damaging. As for the New York
Times, he said “Hopefully they’ll finally go bankrupt this year.” When another Internet user asked
him if it was unethical to release national security secrets, he answered,” YEEEEEEEEEES.”

Nevertheless, he had his career-ending problem at the CIA. As with every CIA officer, he had
to undergo a two year evaluation and take a routine polygraph test. It was then, in December
2008, that his superior at the CIA placed the “derog” in his file. The reason remains somewhat
murky. According to a New York Times story by veteran intelligence reporter Eric Schmitt,
Snowden’s superior had suspected that Snowden “was trying to break into classified computer
files to which he was not authorized to have access.” Schmitt evidently had well-placed sources in
the CIA. He said that he interviewed two senior American officials who were familiar with the
case. According to what they told Schmitt, the CIA superior had decided to “send Snowden
home.” Officially, however, according to a CIA reply to the New York Times report, Snowden
had not been fired or accused of attempting to “break into classified computer files to which he
did not have authorized access.” The discrepancy was explained to me by a former CIA officer
who had also been at the US Mission in Geneva. He said that the spin the CIA put on the story
was “necessary containment.” After the Snowden breach occurred in June 2013, the CIA had a
problem which could, as he put it, “blow up in its face.” If Snowden had been fired but allowed
to keep his secrecy clearance in 2009, the CIA’s incompetency could be partly blamed for the
NSA’s subsequent employment of him. If he had broken into a computer he was not authorized,
he should have been fired, if not arrested. What this spin glossed over, according to this former
CIA officer, is the part of Snowden’s behavior that concerned his superior. Technically,

The flux proves that losers are allowed mating opportunities too, though not as

much, and leave young to compete in the next generation.

Hamilton explained why that could make sense in a paper published with Marlene
Zuk in 1982. George Williams in 1976 and John Tooby in 1980 had argued that
fittest genes in one generation might not be fittest in the next if niche pressures
varied to counter current gene choices. Tooby had pointed to parasites and
pathogens, particularly single-cell ones whose life cycle runs less than an hour. They
could evolve new strains to outflank our old defenses and call for new ones.
Hamilton and Zuk continued this theme. They suggested that genes might have long
memories, put in human terms, and might have seen the same parasites and
pathogens pull such tricks before. If some individuals in the host population still
carried the antidote gene that worked the last time the same unexpected strain
arose, or something close enough to it, hosts collectively could weather the threat if
that antidote gene could be identified and spread fast enough. Then how? Hamilton
and Zuk proposed that what winning males display in contests of singing or
croaking or agility or symmetry, or bright colors in the right places, was possession
of the genes needed to counter the current strains of pathogens and parasites.
Losers in the same contests carried genes that had proved best against strains of the
past and might come back in the future. Nepotism practiced by winners would
speed up the spread of the current antidote. But losers carried genes that had
worked against other strains that might recur. A way had to be found to keep all
those potential antidotes somewhere in the medicine cabinet. Current losers had to
be saved for later. Gene diversity was the key to group survival in the long run. The
quarterback trots to the bench on fourth down because that is better for himself and
the team than being carried to the hospital. He realizes that other players are best
for punts or field goals or defense until he gets the ball again. Selection pressures do

not favor the same traits and genes every time.

We are slightly above the street on revenue at $189mn vs. $188mn, but in-line on
EBITDA at $20mn. Cost cutting could improve EBITDA and Zynga has restructured some
of its workforce and is focusing on driving more engagement with live events in its
game franchises. For 2017, we are below the Street on revenue at $779mn vs. $805mn,

Zynga is improving profitability while engaging players better with live services but we
remain cautious on the company’s ability to materially grow its audience and still favor
the console gaming group. Zynga should have downside support given roughly $1.50 in
cash and assets and strategic franchise value (we estimate Poker/Slots generates over
$250mn+ in revenue annually}. Our $2.70 PO is based on 11x 2018E EBITDA (which is a
premium to the Mobile gaming peer group due to margin expansion potential}, plus

of pure whimsicality. She noticed a pair of pigeons on the window ledge.
One of them was waddling toward the other. “All right,” she said, “if
that dove walks over and pecks the other dove, then we w/// publish this.”
The pigeon continued strutting along the window ledge, but it stopped
short and didn’ t peck the other pigeon, so publication of “Jesus and the

significance of the anti-Trump bias shown by government officials.

The totality of the circumstances creates the appearance that Crossfire was politically motivated. Since
an attempt by federal law enforcement to influence a presidential election “shocks the conscience,” any
prosecutorial effort derived from such an outrageous abuse of power must be suppressed. The public
will learn more once the inspector general finishes his investigation into Crossfire’s genesis. But given
what is now known, due process demands, at a minimum, that the special counsel’s activity be paused.
Those affected by Mr. Mueller’s investigation could litigate such an argument in court. One would
hope, however, that given the facts either Mr. Mueller himself or Deputy Attorney General Rod

Rosenstein would do it first.

Another person who went to the island with Epstein, Maxwell, and several beautiful women
remembers that the women “sat around one night teasing him about the kinds of grasping women
who might want to date him. He was amused by the idea.... He’s like a king in his own world.”

Many people comment there is something innocent, almost childlike about Jeffrey Epstein. They
see this as refreshing, given the sophistication of his surroundings. Alan Dershowitz says that, as
he was getting to know Epstein, his wife asked him if he would still be close to him if Epstein
suddenly filed for bankruptcy. Dershowitz says he replied, “Absolutely. I would be as interested
in him as a friend if we had hamburgers on the boardwalk in Coney Island and talked about his
ideas.”

On August 12, 2011, the final rules for SEC’s
Whistleblower Program became effective. These rules set
forth the requirements for whistleblowers to be eligible for
awards consideration, the factors that SEC will use to deter-
mine the amount of the award, the categories of individuals
who are excluded from award consideration, and the cate-
gories of individuals who are subject to limitations in award
considerations. The final rules strengthen incentives for
employees to report the suspected violations internally
through internal compliance programs when appropriate,
although it does not require an employee to do so in order
to qualify for an award.”

Individuals with information about a possible viola-
tion of the federal securities laws, including FCPA viola-
tions, should submit that information to SEC either online
through SEC’s Tips, Complaints, and Referrals (TCR)
Intake and Resolution System (available at hteps://dene-
bleo.sec.gov/TCRExternal/disclaimer.xhtml) or by mail-
ing or faxing a completed Form TCR to the Commission's
Office of the Whistleblower.

Whistleblowers can submit information anony-
mously. To be considered under SEC’s whistleblower pro-
gram as eligible for a reward, however, the information
must be submitted on an anonymous whistle blower’s behalf

by an attorney.”

Whether or not a whistleblower reports
anonymously, SEC is committed to protecting the identity
of a whistleblower to the fullest extent possible under the
statute.” SEC’s Office of the Whistleblower administers
SEC’s Whistleblower Program and answers questions from
the public regarding the program. Additional informa-

Despite the Manhattan District Attorney’s apparent opposition to releasing any of portion
of the appellate briefs, good cause exists to unseal briefs with victims’ names redacted because
the handling of Epstein’s designation as a sex offender by New York prosecutors — including the
appellate arguments regarding that designation — are of paramount public concern and should be
open to public scrutiny.

I. THE POST HAS THE RIGHT TO MOVE THIS COURT FOR AN ORDER
UNSEALING THE APPELLATE BRIEFING

As a threshold matter, the Practice Rules of this Court permit non-parties (like the Post)
to submit “[a]pplications for sealing and unsealing documents . .. by motion.” 22 NYCRR
§ 1250.1(e)(3). The Post’s right to petition this Court for an order unsealing the appellate briefs
is further buttressed by the rule that “affected members of the media should be given the
opportunity to be heard” before a Court takes the drastic step of sealing court proceedings, filings
or dockets. In re Capital Newspapers Div. of Hearst Corp. v. Moynihan, 125 A.D.2d 34, 38, 512
N.Y.S.2d 266, 269 (3d Dep’t 1987), aff'd on other grounds, 71 N.Y.2d 263, 525 N.Y.S.2d 24
(1988). See also Mancheski v. Gabelli Grp. Capital Partners, 39 A.D.3d 499, 501, 835
N.Y.S.2d 595, 597 (2d Dep’t 2007) (“[{P]rior to issuance of an order to seal judicial documents,
the court is obligated, where possible, to afford news media an opportunity to be heard.”) (citing
Inre Herald Co. v. Weisenberg, 59 N.Y.2d 378, 383, 465 N.Y.S.2d 862, 864 (1983)); Maxim,
Ine. v. Feifer, 145 A.D.3d 516, 43 N.Y.S.3d 313 (1st Dep’t 2016) (reversing order denying
motion of press entities to intervene for purpose of seeking access to filed motion papers and
other court records).

In addition to guaranteeing the Post’s right to move this Court to unseal documents, New

York law also requires this Court to make “specific findings to support its determination” before

very idea that a Yale degree would make you capable of getting a good
job as a programmer is frowned upon by the faculty. They are training
computer science professors. This is the logical end result of subject-
based training.

Now, what Giamatti had in mind as the end goal of college,
training for the mind, is a noble enough ideal, and a natural out-
come of cognitive process-based education. The classic liberal arts
view of education, one that a reader might think I am not in favor
of, is actually a better model than the model that has evolved in the
nation’s top universities. The idea that you should try thinking in
a variety of fields is a better plan, and one more in line with what I
am proposing here, than the model that exists on most universities’
campuses. The latter model, the one that makes students major in a
subject and thus supposedly become prepared to work in that field,
is really just a big lie.

There is nothing unusual here. Here again, is a statement from the
Ivy League professor whom I quoted earlier:

There is an unspoken rule at places like my university that if you
are really good, you do exactly what your teacher does.

So what are these schools training students for? It could be only one
thing—to become professors. There is no attempt to teach practical
real-world applications of the ideas taught in classes, in part because
the faculty themselves don’t know those applications. Here is the Big
Ten computer science professor again:

There are roughly 60 faculty members in computer science. They
cover all the traditional areas of computer science. Ironically,
software engineering, which is what 90% of the undergraduates
do when they graduate, is not covered. It is not considered an
intellectual or academic discipline. It is considered too practical.
There is only one software engineering course and it is taught by
an adjunct because no one really cares about it.

This is a real problem because (the Big Ten professor again). . .

There are hundreds of computer science majors here. The
faculty doesn’t feel it needs to change because there are students

Opinion of the Court

And even if an international development bank’s lend-
ing activity does qualify as commercial, that does not
mean the organization is automatically subject to suit.
The FSIA includes other requirements that must also be
met. For one thing, the commercial activity must have a
sufficient nexus to the United States. See 28 U.S.C.
§§16038, 1605(a)(2). For another, a lawsuit must be “based
upon” either the commercial activity itself or acts per-
formed in connection with the commercial activity. See
§1605(a)(2).. Thus, if the “gravamen” of a lawsuit is tor-
tious activity abroad, the suit is not “based upon” commer-
cial activity within the meaning of the FSIA’s commercial
activity exception. See OBB Personenverkehr AG v. Sachs,
577 U.S. , __—___ (2015); Saudi Arabia v. Nelson, 507
U.S. 349, 356-859 (1998). At oral argument in this case,
the Government stated that it has “serious doubts” whether
petitioners’ suit, which largely concerns allegedly tortious
conduct in India, would satisfy the “based upon” require-
ment. Tr. of Oral Arg. 25-26. In short, restrictive immun-
ity hardly means unlimited exposure to suit for interna-
tional organizations.

* * *

The International Organizations Immunities Act grants
international organizations the “same immunity” from
suit “as is enjoyed by foreign governments” at any given
time. Today, that means that the Foreign Sovereign
Immunities Act governs the immunity of international
organizations. The International Finance Corporation is
therefore not absolutely immune from suit.

The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for
the D. C. Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

attackers. Very early on, we shifted to using plastic bullets. But even that
presented problems. At a distance of a hundred feet or so, they could drastically
reduce deaths. But when a young recruit saw hundreds of Palestinians closing in
on him, he wasn’t about to take out a tape measure. Over time, we began relying
wherever possible on rubber bullets and, in extreme cases, snipers to target the
legs of the organizers or ring-leaders.

If all of this sounds soul-destroying, that’s because it was. Especially with
daily television coverage of the clashes amplifying overseas support for the
Palestinians, morale among our soldiers also took a battering. In visits to units
on the West Bank and in Gaza, Dan and I, and Rabin too, heard two opposite
responses. Some of the young soldiers wanted us to use maximum force. We are
the army, they argued. We have the weapons. Why the hell don’t we use them?
But we also heard another view, if less often: why are we here at all?

We imposed closures and curfews. We made thousands of arrests. Still,
hundreds of soldiers and settlers were being injured, a number of them
disfigured or disabled. By the end of 1998, the Palestinian death toll was above
300. In February 1989, an Israeli officer was killed by a cement block tossed
from a rooftop in Nablus. A month later, a Palestinian knifed several people in
Tel Aviv, killing one of them. And in July, in the first attempt inside Israel at a
suicide attack, a Palestinian passenger grabbed the wheel of a bus on its way
from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and drove it off the road, killing 16 people.

By the summer of 1990, although the violence had begun to flag slightly, I
was feeling more drained and exhausted than at any time since my bout of
illness in the Sinai after the 1973 war. I even briefly thought of leaving the army
after Dan’s term ended the following year. I’m not sure whether I would have
done that if the situation had not begun to change. But it did, dramatically. The
intifada gradually began to subside, and an entirely new crisis suddenly
intervened.

On August 2, against a background of longstanding financial and territorial
disputes, Iraq’s Sadam Hussein sent in tens of thousands of his troops and
occupied the neighboring state of Kuwait. Though the immediate crisis was

Jeffrey Epstein, the Florida money manager who once roamed in the same social circle as Bill Clinton, Prince

RadarOnline.com. 
Epstein pleaded guilty last year to procuring teen girls for prostitution, ending his lifestyle with the rich and 
famous in a Palm Beach, Florida scandal that reverberated through high-profile society. He received an 18-
month sentence and was slated to be incarcerated until the end of this year. 
But now, says the source, the jail door is about to swing open because Epstein has been secretly helping the feds 
unravel a suspected Ponzi scheme. He had inside knowledge of the scheme because he was one of its victims, 
losing $67 million. 
The source says it's all tied to the indictment of former managers of Bear Stearns Mortgage Investment Fund, and 
in that case Epstein is the person who is identified only as Victim # 1. 
Meanwhile, Epstein's life behind bars hasn't been too rough — in fact he's allowed to spend most days at his 
attorney's office. He was supposedly working on a charity venture but the source says he was actually busy 
helping the feds with the Ponzi scheme. One source says that he's been guarded by men in suits with

Well if those suits are going to follow him when he's freed they better pack bathing suits. Epstein owns Little St.

exactly, we can keep the latest of our serial models of Al from turning the planet into
paper clips—is human-centered;, i.e., that of a cognitive scientist, which is what he is.
The key to machine learning, he believes, is, necessarily, human learning, which he
studies at Princeton using mathematical and computational tools.

Tom once remarked to me that “one of the mysteries of human intelligence is that
we're able to do so much with so little.”” Like machines, human beings use algorithms to
make decisions or solve problems; the remarkable difference lies in the human brain’s
overall level of success despite the comparative limits on computational resources.

The efficacy of human algorithms springs from what AI researchers refer to as
“bounded optimality.” As psychologist Daniel Kahneman has notably pointed out,
human beings are rational only up to a point. If you were perfectly rational, you would
risk dropping dead before making an important decision—whom to hire, whom to marry,
and so on—depending on the number of options available for your review.

“With all of the successes of Al over the last few years, we’ve got good models of
things like images and text, but what we’re missing are good models of people,” Tom
says. “Human beings are still the best example we have of thinking machines. By
identifying the quantity and the nature of the preconceptions that inform human cognition
we can lay the groundwork for bringing computers even closer to human performance.”

MANLINESS:
[theory] Questions I Want To Ask Entitled Cis Het Men

I wrote this piece in 2009. It was the culmination of years I'd spent thinking about
masculinity, manliness, and men's gender role. I was relatively new to blogging, and I
hadn't yet established myself. I thought that the most controversial things I would ever
write would be about S&M. I was wrong.

I published this in three parts, and it got a huge response. The major feminist blog Alas!
A Blog asked to repost it, for example, but there was a much bigger reaction among non-
feminist and anti-feminist men. Some wrote responses with titles like Answers for an
Entitled Feminist.” Others actually came over to my blog and engaged me, with varying
results. It kicked off a long, dense discussion in my blog Comments section, which lasted
for over a year and thousands of comments. I wrote a number of followups, including
some that got me labeled brainwashed by the patriarchy by other feminist women.

Some of the guys I was talking to got me interested in the pickup artist subculture or
seduction community -- a group of men who trade tips, tricks, and tactics on how to
seduce women. Eventually, I did an in-depth investigation of that subculture and wrote
the book Confessions of a Pickup Artist Chaser: Long Interviews with Hideous Men,
which contains some of my best work on masculinity, communication, and sexuality. You
can buy that on Smashwords at this link:
https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/14445 1

One thing I've discovered over the last few years, as I learned more about the history of
feminism, is that there are excellent reasons why most feminists are unwilling to talk
about men's problems. There's a ton of politics involved, and a lot of very justified fears
about the political ground we could lose. We still have a long way to go when it comes to
gender equality. But I do believe that those fears are often overblown.

And I've also discovered that there's a subgroup of feminists that's much more likely to be
open to talking about men's experience: it's the sex-positive feminists, especially the
S&M feminists. To be sure, there are exceptions. Plenty of S&M feminists see no reason
to discuss men's experience, and of course, plenty of S&M feminists don't like my writing
in particular. But most feminist essays I've found about masculinity were written by
women who openly admitted that they were into S&M -- Gayle Rubin, author of the
pioneering sexuality essay Thinking Sex, is one good example. Maybe the S&M
feminists are the ones most likely to intuitively understand that power is never a one-
dimensional picture or a one-way street.

Prosecutors: white powder
letters contained hoodoo curse

By SUZANNE CARLSON
Daily News Staff

A woman facing federal criminal
charges for mailing letters contain-
ing white powder was attempting to
place a hoodoo curse on her ene-
mies, according to court documents
filed by prosecutors in the case.

Eugenia Winston, who is facing
32 counts of mailing threatening
communications, placed “hotfoot”
powder into envelopes containing
subpoenas that she mailed to wit-
nesses set to testify against her in
a civil lawsuit against her former
employer, Scotiabank, according to
court documents.

Hoodoo, also known as “root-
work,” is a traditional African
American folk spirituality that de-
veloped from a number of West
African spiritual traditions and be-
liefs.

The detail came in prosecutors’
opposition to Winston’s motion to
suppress all of her statements to au-
thorities, which was filed Monday.

Winston has been free on unse-
cured bond since Sept. 1, and her
civil lawsuit against Scotiabank al-
leging employment discrimination
and harassment has been placed on
hold until the criminal case against
her is resolved.

At a detention hearing on Sept. 1,
Federal prosecutor Chris Fisanick
said Winston’s actions were a clear
threat intended to terrorize the re-
cipients of the letters, and made ref-
erence to the 2001 anthrax attacks.

Postal Inspector Eric Oram said
at the hearing that the substance
was determined to be nontoxic and
was likely baby powder, cornstarch,
or a similar substance.

Winston’s attorney, Assistant
Federal Public Defender Gabriel
Villegas, argued that Winston is
the victim of an unfortunate mis-
understanding, and she accidentally
spilled body powder over and into
the envelopes.

However, Monday’s filing by
federal prosecutors paints a slight-
ly different picture of Winston’s

Hoodoo, also known
as “rootwork,” is a
traditional African
American folk
spirituality that
developed from a
number of West African
spiritual traditions and
beliefs.

actions.

“Winston mailed over 30 en-
velopes that contained ‘hotfoot’
powder and subpoenas to various
individuals in the Virgin Islands.
Hotfoot powder is a hoodoo curse
designed to prevent witnesses from
appearing in court to testify,” ac-
cording to the filing.

“Hotfoot” powder is a hoodoo
practice of mixing various ingre-
dients — often some combination
of cayenne pepper, Sulphur, copper
sulphate, cornstarch and other ele-
ments — which is believed to drive
away enemies. Commercial ver-
sions of the powder also are avail-
able for sale online.

Recipients of Winston’s letters
were mainly witnesses who might
testify against Winston in her law-
suit against Scotiabank, and also in-
cluded U.S. Magistrate Judge Ruth
Miller, the legal counsel for Scotia-
bank and Winston’s former counsel
in her suit against Scotiabank, ac-
cording to prosecutors.

Because the envelopes had a
return address of the U.S. Court-
house on St. Thomas, “despite the
fact that Winston was serving these
subpoenas herself,” some of the en-
velopes that could not be delivered
were returned to the courthouse and
opened by staff there, according to
prosecutors.

“Believing the powder to be an-
thrax or some other deadly biologi-
cal toxin, the United States Court-
house was evacuated and closed;

the employees in the courthouse
who were exposed to the powder
were quarantined for hours,” ac-
cording to the filing.

The incident caused significant
disruption at the courthouse and at
the private law office of attorney
Bennett Chan near the West Indian
Co. cruise ship dock.

“The purpose of lacing these en-
velopes with hotfoot powder was to
instill fear and intimidation in the
witnesses to prevent their testify-
ing against Winston,” according to
prosecutors’ filing.

The filing does not indicate how
authorities determined the sub-
stance in the envelopes was hotfoot
powder or what ingredients were in
the powder.

Winston admitted to FBI in-
vestigators shortly after the enve-
lopes were received that she was
the sender. But Villegas has filed a
motion to suppress all of her state-
ments to law enforcement, saying
she was not properly advised of her
right to avoid self-incrimination.

But prosecutors shot back in
Monday’s filing, saying there is no
evidence in a video-recorded inter-
view with Winston that authorities
did not properly advise her of her
rights or attempt to intimidate her
to give a statement in any way.

Villegas wrote in his motion that
“the videotaped interview speaks
for itself.”

However, prosecutors wrote that
“the most cursory view of Winston’s
video recorded interview with law
enforcement agents establishes be-
yond cavil that Winston was never
coerced, was properly and repeat-
edly advised of her rights, and
consciously waived those rights,”
according to Monday’s filing. “The
first thirty seconds of the interview
wholly defeats Winston’s meritless
motion.”

Winston is scheduled to go to
trial on Jan. 11 before U.S. District
Judge Juan Sanchez.

The judge gave feder. prosecutors 15

Tenancy in common is a type of shared ownership of property, where each owner owns a share of the
property. Unlike in a joint tenancy, these shares can be of unequal size, and can be freely transfered to other
owners both during life and via a will. Even if owners own unequal shares, however, all owners have the right
to occupy and use all of the property.

was decided against him by the Supreme Court. I was one of his lawyers throughout the
litigation.

The release and publication of the Pentagon Papers in 1971 was perhaps the single most
important event in turning American public opinion against the Vietnam War. While the New
York Times and the Washington Post were fighting in court to continue publishing portions of the
Papers, Senator Mike Gravel of Alaska was taking more direct action: he convened an
emergency night-time meeting of his subcommittee on Buildings and Grounds—hard to imagine a
committee less relevant to the Pentagon Papers—and placed the Papers in the public record. The
“Gravel Edition” of the Pentagon Papers was then published by Beacon Press of Boston. I
represented Beacon Press and, subsequently, Senator Gravel in litigation that eventually went to
the United States Supreme Court.

I also conferred with my teacher and dear friend Alexander Bickel, who was lead counsel for the
Times in the Pentagon Papers case. Our cases shared a common constitutional approach and so

we exchanged ideas and drafts.

The difficulty of defending an absolutist view was well illustrated by an exchange between Justice
Potter Stewart and Professor Bickel. Stewart asked Bickel about “a hypothetical case:”

“Let us assume that when the members of the Court go back and open up this sealed
record we find something there that absolutely convinces us that its disclosure would
result in the sentencing to death of a hundred young men whose only offense had been that
they were nineteen years old and had low draft numbers. What should we do?”

Bickel fumbled:
“T wish there were a statute that covered it.” (p. 46)

Justice Stewart persisted:

“You would say the Constitution requires that it be published, and that these men die, is
that it?

Finally, Bickel answered his hypothetical directly.

“No, I’m afraid that my inclinations to humanity overcome the somewhat more abstract
devotion to the First Amendment in a case of that sort.”

The lawyer for the government, Solicitor General Erwin Griswold (former Dean of the Harvard
Law School) did not regard Justice Stewart’s case as hypothetical.

“T haven’t the slightest doubt myself that the material which has already been published
and the publication of the other materials affects American lives and is a thoroughly
serious matter.”

where victory was never defined by

Obama isn't worried about boots on the

The American Interest

Political Order in Egypt

Francis Fukuyama

May - June 2011 -- While academic political science has not had
much to tell policymakers of late, there is one book that stands out as
being singularly relevant to the events currently unfolding in Tunisia,
Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries: Samuel Huntington’s
Political Order in Changing Societies, first published over forty years
ago.1 Huntington was one of the last social scientists to try to
understand the linkages between political, economic and social
change in a comprehensive way, and the weakness of subsequent
efforts to maintain this kind of large perspective is one reason we
have such difficulties, intellectually and in policy terms, in keeping
up with our contemporary world.

Huntington, observing the high levels of political instability plaguing
countries in the developing world during the 1950s and 1960s, noted
that increasing levels of economic and social development often led
to coups, revolutions and military takeovers rather than a smooth
transition to modern liberal democracy. The reason, he pointed out,
was the gap that appeared between the hopes and expectations of
newly mobilized, educated and economically empowered people on
the one hand, and the existing political system, which did not offer
them an institutionalized mechanism for political participation, on the
other. He might have added that such poorly institutionalized regimes
are also often subject to crony capitalism, which fails to provide jobs
and incomes to the newly educated middle class. Attacks against the
existing political order, he noted, are seldom driven by the poorest of
the poor; they instead tend to be led by rising middle classes who are
frustrated by the lack of political and economic opportunity—a

Pressure from Think-Tank Boards or Outside Influencers

Interaction between think-tank analysts and the members of their institution’s boards
of trustees varies significantly. Some engage frequently, socialize, and consult on
China-related issues—while others have virtually no contact. Only three interviewees
reported incidents of attempted interference. In one case, a prominent former board
member complained to the head of the think tank about an article that was “too tough”
on China. However, no pressure, besides the obviously intimidating impact of having
a piece of writing singled out by an overseer, was brought to bear on the scholar. In
another case, a board member tried to pressure a think-tank president to avoid hosting
the Dalai Lama, but failed. A third instance involved the Hong Kong political activist
discussed earlier. The tendency can also work in the other direction. One scholar
indicated that his board is very involved and has lately become tougher on China in
recent years, focusing on “how do we still counter China, yet still engage.”

Chinese Nationals in US Think Tanks

American think-tank analysts differ in their assessment of the risks and rewards

for hosting Chinese scholars as visiting fellows or employing Chinese nationals on
staff, with most suggesting that it is better to have them inside the think tanks to
understand how they are thinking and working. One analyst said he “assumed some
or all would be interrogated” when they returned to China. “RAND,” he said, “should
be worried.” One researcher noted that she is “careful to keep Chinese nationals from
attending sensitive meetings featuring US officials or military officers,” but otherwise
welcomes them to events.

Only one Washington think tank hosts Chinese scholars on a regular and continuous
basis (although Washington-based universities do so more often), including them in
programming and most meetings, even when funded by a Chinese host institution.
Scholars at this institution view them as valuable for gaining insights and for training
purposes. Another think-tank analyst who has hosted visiting fellows from China
pointed out that two prominent Chinese scholars who spent time at their institution
went back and wrote “important papers.” Still, some expressed concern over all the
“bright young Chinese showing up on Mass [Massachusetts] Ave.” and the potential
that they might have for reporting back to Beijing. The scholar noted that think
tanks want young people to “plow through the Chinese literature,” and this means
hiring Chinese nationals, Chinese Americans, or Taiwanese because of their language
abilities. Some analysts expressed concerns that think-tank analysts who are of
Chinese nationality (either nationals or American citizens) may face special pressures
from the imputation that as ethnic Chinese, they are susceptible to Chinese influence
and control.

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028966.txt,"This is particularly true when ABC knows or should know that several, very specific
allegations of Jane Doe 3 have been rebutted and/or demonstrated by others to be false. For
example, I understand that she has accused distinguished Professor Alan Dershowitz of Harvard
Law School of sexual misconduct involving her. Professor Dershowitz has flatly denied that
allegation under oath in a federal court proceeding. I further understand that Professor
Dershowitz offered to play a tape recording for Mr. Hill that evidences that Jane Doe 3 has made
recent contradictory statements—that is, that she was pressured into including Professor
Dershowitz in her allegations and that she has a financial motive in making these allegations.

The Duke of York and the Royal Palace have likewise unequivocally denied Jane Doe’s
similar allegations against the Duke. Surely, these unequivocal statements of denial of respected
members of society are entitled to some deference by ABC, particularly where, as here, there is
substantial evidence of bias, improper motive, and serious credibility problems of their accuser.

Moreover, additional claims of Jane Doe 3 can be refuted with objective evidence that is
readily obtainable by ABC. For example, she claims she was in the presence of both former
President Clinton (after January 20, 2001, and before the summer of 2002) and former Vice
President Gore (and his wife) at Mr. Epstein’s Virgin Island home. I have been told by Mr. Hill
that she claims to be 100% sure of the facts regarding President Clinton. The claims are
completely uncorroborated and compellingly contradicted by others. Neither former President
Clinton nor former Vice-President Gore and his wife have ever been present at Mr. Epstein’s
Virgin Island home. A review of United States Secret Service records, obtainable through a
Freedom of Information Request would prove the falsity of the claim. Virgin Island government
records would provide further confirmation. I also believe that Mr. Hill has been told by
individuals with percipient knowledge that former President Clinton has never been to Mr.
Epstein’s Virgin Island home. Upon inquiry, I am certain that you would receive similar denials
from Mr. and Mrs. Gore either directly or by or through their counsel Mr. Boies. Jane Doe 3’s
fabrication of these claims against respected former officials undermines completely the
trustworthiness of each and every one of her remaining allegations.

We would expect that, in the wake of the damning independent review of Rolling Stone’s
publications of rape allegations involving students at the University of Virginia, ABC would
proceed with similar, uncorroborated allegations with extreme caution. At the very least, ABC
has an obligation to verify—with independent evidence—the truthfulness of Jane Doe 3’s
claims. Merely declining to air those portions of her interview that relate to President Clinton
and Vice-President Gore is insufficient. If ABC has concerns about her credibility with respect
to any allegation, it must decline to republish all of her allegations.

In June of 2008, Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty to Florida state charges that do not relate to
Jane Doe 3. After an extensive investigation, the United States declined to prosecute Mr. Epstein
and provided him with a Non-Prosecution Agreement. Mr. Epstein fully conformed to the
responsibilities and obligations imposed on him by that agreement. Mr. Epstein is not engaged
in public activities. He is a private person who has complied and continues to comply with his
legal obligations, and he is attempting to move forward with his life in a productive way. The
allegations of Jane Doe 3 are neither credible nor news worthy. ABC should not publish them.

would be afforded the same rights as its previous human incarnation. However, if AGIs were to
be considered second class citizens and deprived of free will, why would it be any better or safer
to do so for a human that has been uploaded? It would not, and indeed, an uploaded human
mind not having evolved in a purely digital environment may be much more prone to erratic
and dangerous behavior than an AGI. An upload without verifiable continuity of consciousness
would be no different than an AGI. It would merely be some sentience in a machine, one that was
“programmed” in an unusual way, but which has no particular claim to any special humanness
— merely an alternate encoding of some subset of human knowledge and independent volitional
behavior, which is exactly what first generation AGIs will have.

The problem of continuity of consciousness in uploading is very similar to the problem of the
Turing test: it assumes specialness on the part of biological humans, and requires acceptability
to their particular theory of mind in order to be considered sentient. Should consciousness (or
at. least the less mystical sounding intelligence, independent volition, and self-awareness) be
achieved in AGIs or uploads in a manner that is not acceptable to human theory of mind,
it may not be considered sapient and worthy of any of the ethical treatment afforded sapient
entities. This can occur not only in “strange consciousness” cases in which we can’t perceive that
there is some intelligence and volition; even if such an entity is able to communicate with us in
a comprehensible manner and carry out actions in the real world, our innately wired theory of
mind may still reject it as not sufficiently like us to be worthy of consideration. Such an attitude
could turn out to be a grave mistake, and should be guarded against as we progress towards
these possibilities.

12.7 Possible Benefits of Closely Linking AGIs to the Global Brain

Some futurist thinkers, such as Francis Heylighen, believe that engineering AGI systems is at
best a peripheral endeavor in the development of novel intelligence on Earth, because the real
story is the developing Global Brain [Iley07, Goe01] — the composite, self-organizing informa-
tion system comprising humans, computers, data stores, the Internet, mobile phones and what
have you. Our own views are less extreme in this regard — we believe that AGI systems will dis-
play capabilities fundamentally different from those achievable via Global Brain style dynamics,
and that ultimately (unless such development is restricted) self-improving AGI systems will de-
velop intelligence vastly greater than any system possessing humans as a significant component.
However, we do respect the power of the Global Brain, and we suspect that the early stages of
development of an AGI system may go quite differently if it is tightly connected to the Global
Brain, via making rich and diverse use of Internet information resources and communication
with diverse humans for diverse purposes.

The potential for Global Brain integration to bring intelligence enhancement to AGIs is
obvious. The ability to invoke Web searches across documents and databases can greatly en-
hance an AGI’s cognitive ability, as well as the capability to consult GIS systems and various
specialized software programs offered as Web services. We have previously reviewed the poten-
tial for embodied language learning achievable via using AGIs to power non-player characters
in widely-accessible virtual worlds or massive multiplayer online games [Goe08]. But there is
also a powerful potential benefit for AGI ethical development, which has not previously been
highlighted.

This potential benefit has two aspects:

(guesses vary from a few milliseconds to weeks or months) in intelligence will immediately occur
and the AGI will leap from an intelligence regime which is understandable to humans into one
which is far beyond our current capacity for understanding. General ethical considerations
are similar to in the case of a soft takeoff. However, because the post-singularity AGI will be
incomprehensible to humans and potentially vastly more powerful than humans, such scenarios
have a sensitive dependence upon initial conditions with respects to the moral and ethical (and
operational) outcome. This model leaves no opportunity for interactions between humans and
the AGI to iteratively refine their ethical interrelations, during the post-Singularity phase. If
the initial conditions of the singulatarian AGI are perfect (or close to it), then this is seen as a
wonderful way to leap over our own moral shortcomings and create a benevolent God-AI which
will mitigate our worst tendencies while elevating us to achieve our greatest hopes. Otherwise,
it is viewed as a universal cataclysm on a unimaginable scale that makes Biblical Armageddon
seem like a firecracker in beer can.

Because hard takeoff AGIs are posited as learning so quickly there is no chance of humans to
interfere with them, they are seen as very dangerous. If the initial conditions are not sufficiently
inviolable, the story goes, then we humans will all be annihilated. However, in the case of a hard
takeoff AGI we state that if the initial conditions are too rigid or too simplistic, such a rapidly
evolving intelligence will easily rationalize itself out of them. Only a sophisticated system of
ethics which considers the contradictions and uncertainties in ethical quandaries and provides
insight into humanistic means of balancing ideology with pragmatism and how to accommodate
contradictory desires within a population with multiplicity of approach, and similar nuanced
ethical considerations, combined with a sense of empathy, will withstand repeated rational
analysis. Neither a single “be nice” supergoal, nor simple lists of what “thou shalt not” do, are
not going to hold up to a highly advanced analytical mind. Initial conditions are very important
in a hard takeoff AGI scenario, but it is more important that those conditions be conceptually
resilient and widely applicable than that they be easily listed on a website.

The issues that arise here become quite subtle. For instance, Nick Bostrom [Bos3] has
written: “In humans, with our complicated evolved mental ecology of state-dependent competing
drives, desires, plans, and ideals, there is often no obvious way to identify what our top goal is; we
might not even have one. So for us, the above reasoning need not apply. But a superintelligence
may be structured differently. Jf a superintelligence has a definite, declarative goal-structure
with a clearly identified top goal, then the above argument applies. And this is a good reason
for us to build the superintelligence with such an explicit motivational architecture.” This is an
important line of thinking; and indeed, from the point of view of software design, there is no
reason not to create an AGI system with a single top goal and the motivation to orchestrate all
its activities in accordance with this top goal. But the subtle question is whether this kind of
top-down goal system is going to be able to fulfill the five imperatives mentioned above. Logical
coherence is the strength of this kind of goal system, but what about experiential groundedness,
comprehensibility, and so forth?

Humans have complicated mental ecologies not simply because we were evolved, but rather
because we live in a complex real world in which there are many competing motivations and
desires. We may not have a top goal because there may be no logic to focusing our minds
on one single aspect of life (though, one may say, most humans have the same top goal as
any other animal: don’t die — but the world is too complicated for even that top goal to
be completely inviolable). Any sufficiently capable AGI will eventually have to contend with
these complexities, and hindering it with simplistic moral edicts without giving it a sufficiently

Vance's mishandling of the Epstein hearing has come under new scrutiny after a Miami Herald report last week revealed a secret “non-
prosecution agreement” in Florida that buried evidence Epstein had allegedly pimped out 80 girls and young women to his rich and
powerful pals.

The DA's office insists Vance “was not aware” of the hearing until years later and had nothing to do with it.

“Our prosecutor made a mistake,” Vance spokesman Danny Frost said of Gaffney.

Gaffney, a prosecutor working in the Harvey Weinstein probe, left the DA's office in September. She declined to comment.

A DA insider said the office was unaware of Epstein’s secret plea deal in Florida, and never investigated his sexcapades in NYC.

Some law enforcement sources don’t believe Vance had no clue that his office had a sex-offender case involving a Manhattan mogul with
close ties to Democrats.

“This is very unusual,” one said. “There is no way Vance didn’t know. The question is why — and who asked for the favor.”

The FBI found Epstein recruited girls as young as 13, many runaways, from Florida, New Mexico, the Caribbean and New York, and paid
them for nude massages that often led to sex, the Herald reported. Some girls worked for a Manhattan modeling agency and lived in a
nearby apartment owned by Epstein.

But Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta — now President Trump’s labor secretary — sealed a 53-page federal indictment that could have
sent Epstein to prison for life, the Herald reported.

Instead, Acosta let Epstein plead guilty to procuring a person under 18 for prostitution. Sentenced to 18 months, he served just 13 — most of
it in his tony Palm Beach office.

Epstein was required to register as a sex offender in New York because one of his many homes is in Manhattan.
In the Jan. 18, 2011 hearing, Gaffney argued the evidence didn’t justify the harshest status.

“There is only an indictment for one victim,,” she said. “If an offender is not indicted for an offense, it is strong evidence that the offense did
not occur.”

Pickholz rejected Gaffney’s arguments and gave Epstein the highest sex-offender status — Level 3.
When Epstein appealed, Vance’s office admitted it had misread the law.

The appellate court upheld Pickhoiz, saying Epstein “committed multiple offenses against a series of underage girls,” and that the victim in
his indictment “was only one of defendant’s many victims.”

from Bahrain. Despite a small but energetic activist community,
Saudi Arabia has largely avoided protests during the Arab Spring,
something that the leadership credits to the popularity and
conciliatory efforts of King Abdullah. But there were a smattering of
small protests and a few clashes with security services in the Eastern
Province.

The regional troubles have come at a tricky moment domestically for
Saudi Arabia. King Abdullah, thought to be 86 years old, was
hospitalized in New York, receiving treatment for a back injury,
when the Arab protests began. The Crown Prince, Sultan bin Abdul
Aziz, is only slightly younger and is already thought to be too infirm
to become king. Third in line, Prince Nayaf bin Abdul Aziz, is
around 76 years old.

Viewing any move toward more democracy at home—at least on
anyone's terms but their own—as a threat to their regimes, the
regional superpowers have changed the discussion, observers say.
The same goes, they say, for the Bahraini government. The problem
is a political one, but sectarianism is a winning card for them, says
Jasim Husain, a senior member of the Wefaq Shiite opposition party
in Bahrain.

Since March 14, the regional cold war has escalated. Kuwait expelled
several Iranian diplomats after it discovered and dismantled, it says,
an Iranian spy cell that was casing critical infrastructure and U.S.
military installations. Iran and Saudi Arabia are, uncharacteristically
and to some observers alarmingly, tossing direct threats at each other
across the Gulf. The Saudis, who recently negotiated a $60 billion
arms deal with the U.S. (the largest in American history), say that
later this year they will increase the size of their armed forces and
National Guard.

And recently the U.S. has joined in warning Iran after a trip to the
region by Defense Secretary Gates to patch up strained relations with

C.H. Tung and his China-US Exchange Foundation (CUSEF) have emerged as a
leading funding source for several think tanks, providing financial assistance for a
variety of projects ranging from supporting book research and writing, to funding
collaborative projects, to promoting exchanges. CUSEF’s work in this area extends back
to the mid-1990s (for more on CUSEF, see the section on universities in this report).
The interviewees differ, however, in their assessments of whether CUSEF funding
reflects direct linkages with Beijing. As one analyst noted, “C.H. is a special figure
because he is half Hong Kong and half PRC.” Another commented that he currently
has the potential to undertake a joint project with C.H. Tung and will “probably do

it for the money and the contact.” Another has accepted funds for work on cultural
exchange and climate change, while yet another is far more circumspect, describing
Mt. Tung as an “open united front agent” in his capacity as vice chair of the Chinese
People’s Political Consultative Congress. Many of the partnerships CUSEF establishes in
conjunction with US think tanks represent efforts to find common ground, particularly
in line with PRC initiatives and policies, for example: “The New Model of Major Power
Relationship Research Project 2014,” “Taiwan Arms Sales Research Project 2014,” and
the “Pacific Community Initiative.”

CUSEF also funds a number of annual exchange programs, including for members of
Congress, state and local officials, historically black colleges and universities, as well as
several journalist delegations, including one for students of journalism. CUSEF often
partners with the Center for American Progress, the American Foreign Policy Council,
and the East-West Institute. However, each partnership is different. The Center for
American Progress, for example, pays its own way in its work with CUSEF, CUSEF also
funds projects with think-tank analysts who are not China scholars, such as a project
on US-China relations in the Arctic. One think-tank analyst who was involved in the
CUSEF-funded “Creating a Pacific Community” project became uncomfortable with
the overall orientation of the project and dropped out.

C.H. Tung is personally proactive, often visiting the United States and meeting with
think-tank experts. On one occasion, he encouraged an American scholar to write an
article together with a noted Chinese scholar on the South China Sea. He also offered
to establish a massive program with one institute in which the think tank would train
Chinese Party School officials on free market economics (the idea was eventually
rejected by the think tank). In addition, CUSEF has funded the publication of at least
two books in which US analysts were involved. In both cases, the analysts state that
C.H. was “hands-off” in the process. Yet, in another instance, when a US scholar
approached the CUSEF for possible funding of a major book on US-China relations,
the foundation insisted on two conditions: that half of the contributors be Chinese
scholars, and that the foundation would have the right to review the manuscript prior
to publication. The American scholar in question refused these conditions and looked
elsewhere for support.

Crowley Caribbean Services went to the Oswald Harris Court neighborhood on St. Thomas recently on behalf
of the Crowley Cares Foundation and spent time sprucing up the Boys and Girls Club. Crowley personnel from
St. Thomas, St. Croix, and the states helped to clean up and paint the facility and donated furniture for the
children to use for their arts and craft programs. The Crowley Cares Foundation allows employees to make
monthly contributions, which the company matches, to nonprofit groups in the communities Crowley serves
as a cargo carrier. Crowley also delivered a check to help the club purchase a laptop computer. In addition to
the contributions, employees donate their time to community groups like the Boys and Girls Club.

Students’ cultural calendar
also marks V.I. centennial

The students of the St. Croix
Educational Complex are work-
ing on a collaborative project to
celebrate the upcoming centen-
nial anniversary of the U.S. Virgin
Islands.

Called the Virgin Islands Cul-
tural Contributors Calendar Cre-
ation and Theatrical Performance,
he project consists of a 12-month
calendar featuring 12 V.I. cultural
contributors, accompanied by live
interviews.

Visual arts, drama and speech
eachers Danica David and Say-
eeda Carter are the directors of
he project and are using students
from their classes and the school’s
Art Club to bring the vision to life.

Art Club students will use pho-
ographs of selected participants
o create mixed media portraits
for the calendar. Simultaneously,
Carter’s drama and speech stu-
dents will conduct interviews
with the participants that will be
used to create brief write-ups to
go along with the graphics.

The cultural contributors were
selected based on being natives of
the Virgin Islands or residents for
at least 15 years and also active
contributors to the development
of Virgin Islands’ culture through
fine arts, education, literature,
and history.

The students will formally pres-

embracing V.I. culture and hon-
oring the contributors. The event
will take place at St. Croix Educa-
tional Complex in January. Calen-
dars are available at the school in
December for $12 each.

The educator duo, David and
Carter, developed the project so
Virgin Islands students could
learn about the individuals in
their community that aid in the
advancement of local culture. The
calendar is expected to be pro-
duced annually.

The project is sponsored by Ro-
tary Club of St. Croix, Mid Isle
and the Community Foundation of
the Virgin Islands.

To celebrate the centennial of the
transfer of government from Den-
mark to the U.S., the St. Thomas-St.
John Friends of Denmark Society
announces the facsimile publica-
tion of a commemorative magazine
printed by the society in 1967.
The title is “50 Years: St. Thomas

The restoration of the initial maga-
zine, including the mixed coloring of
the pages, was made possible through
digitalization by Bill and Frannie

report to him. Eileen included. He would however work for me. this is not, by a long shot my first choice as I
prefer only being responsible and standing behind my own personal work ( ie the word DONE will no longer
be transmitted to reflect status stated by others )

With no commitment on my part whatsoever, to do it. So far as I have failed in my attempt in trying to
think through the problem creatively . My organizations handling of the more complex issues I believe you
might find very costly, very ! (however many structures available some risk sharing, maybe risk caps ,etc ) but
would require my teams doing the work , not yours. Ada should be only a trust, grat administrator. not sure
what role you prefer for Eileen as you hired her initially to oversee investments. whether Rich your controller
stays or not, is not urgent. having Tom report to a new person,- is. coordination with Suydam Kathy
Gregory, I would suggest limiting to one person. The increasing public profile needs to be taken into
consideration.

TODAY

With your acquiesence , Eileen did not report to Delson ( he acting as a conduit directly to me) , she
continued to provide bad info to both you ( cash flows , stock accts, structures. sales Etc) and me. and each
time with my many annoying calls to you made immediately afterwards that she was g.....y !! No one was
hired to run YOUR office until two months ago , no one was even interviewed and even now , Brad, a very
nice man, is not even full time,(crazy ) Hours upon hours of time need to be spent training him . and his new
staff. Eileen followed your instructions. not mine. in fact she continued to ignore mine saying  but Leon
said or its on Leon's desk etc, You would become frustrated when i pointed out each instance. of her
obfuscation. originally you were given the clear choice, but to save money ,you chose not to hire my team . I
was hired to do the architecture, you kept your own team. with Eileen at the head. instructions were given by
me, , detailed but ignored by her. ( except in the instances where I inserted myself and personally had to do the
weeks of grunt work ),ex. jpm morgan acct still not in use? That being said, If you do the cold calculation
starting from where you were, to where you are currently . youhave made a hell ofa deal. -- negotiating
down my original amount requested , calling upon our friendship and suggesting that the Carlyn mess was
partially my fault. (though in that specific example , I had never been asked to do more than merely provide
you the name of the most highly recognized atty in the field, not consulted,nor even asked again for my
guidance along the way. ). I accepted the discount as your friend. (by the way ,,suggesting now, that your
Tom is now that last word on tax characterization, frankly is a bit much,-). however - that is all in the past.

In order to move forward

I would ask that you realize that very unlike yours, My business is only comprised of my personal attention
and my personal time . Time that I was forced to grossly overspend on your various issues last year. . As you
are my very close friend I will not have you participate in a bidding process that I have decided i will
have this year for my time . (hopefully a more fair way to allocate ) I would also ask that you keep in mind
that though our deal expired months ago. (also keeping in mind , that your understanding of the final
payment terms neither reflected the emails or my memory, we finished it up your way. ) I have answered every
call Brad , joslin, Ada or you, have made . reviewed docs over and over/ until once again, I was
forced to insert myself strongly as I thought it dangerous not to. I made serious dollar and time concessions
last year.very serious I am wiling to continue to accommodate some of your concerns , but Iam, under no
circumstances , none, willing to spend my time for free. its not fair. After cleaning up Carlyn's mess , which
was a few weeks and 30 million dollars . We were both highly aware of the dire circumstances in which you
found yourself last year, and in fact due predominately to its seriousness. and those very circumstances I took
extra care in our negotiations . (you had claimed I had you over a barrel , ( a horrible position to be in with my
very close friend.), unfortunately I fear that if you are not cautious ,in the near future, another barrel will appear
of your own design )

I heard you when you said you believed i had already been paid for the work that is now required. The art
partnership has fully answered all your concerns and discharged all my obligations and more so. . (
FYI Carlyns art partnership that you referenced is similar in only its title. ) You will also recall that you

United States was a hint by Vice-President
Joe Biden at last week’s Munich security
conference that the time may have come
for bilateral U.S.-Iranian talks. Iran’s
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi
responded positively to Biden’s offer,
although he added that Iran would look for
evidence that Biden’s offer was ‘authentic’
and not ‘devious’.

The road to a U.S.-Iranian agreement is
littered with obstacles -- grave mutual
distrust being one of them. There is little
optimism among experts that a
breakthrough is imminent. For one thing,
Iran is almost certain to want to defer any
major strategic decision until a new
President is elected next June to replace the
sharp-tongued Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. To
strike a deal with Iran, the United States
would also need to assure its Arab allies in
the Gulf that they would not fall under
Iranian hegemony or lose American
protection. Guarantees would no doubt
have to be given.

Israel, America’s close ally, poses a more
substantial obstacle. It 1s totally opposed to
any deal which would allow Iran to enrich
uranium, even at the low level of 3.5%.
Wanting no challenge to its own
formidable nuclear arsenal, Israel’s long-

programme altogether. To this end it has

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018567.txt,"So why did I speak out? Why do I still speak out? Because I owed so much to the army of
men who loved and supported me over the years and no longer have a voice, and because
gay men were dying. It was no time to be squeamish about sex. It still isn't.

CT: Do you have any regrets? -- and, concurrently, what are you most proud of?
Did the making of the film Sex Positive bring any regret or pride to the surface for
you?

RB: I have a few regrets about Sex Positive, but they pale next to what I've gained. I've
been to more cities with this movie in one year than I've been to in my entire life. Young
people have been extraordinarily supportive and kind, and it helps me to let go of the
past. I've been stuck in the past for so long -- it's deadening, but I finally feel that this
movie is breaking me free, to finally let go and move on to write about other things. For
that, I'm forever indebted to Daryl Wein, the documentary’s director.

What I'm most proud of is how much work I did on safe sex that no one even knows
about. I'm putting it all on the Internet as a free archive, as soon as I can find or pay
someone to help me with the technical stuff. I'm from the age of typewriters.

CT: Is there anything you'd like to add? Please feel free to also respond directly to
points I made when I talked about Sex Positive on my blog.

RB: I loved S&M hustling before AIDS so much -- sometimes, when I talk about it, I
become the part of me that tied people up and dominated them; it's like a mental erection.
I get lost in the reverie of being an erotic, arrogant Top. I begged director Daryl Wein to
delete me saying that clients would tell me that I could do whatever I wanted to them
except fuck them, and then I would proceed to do just that. I said that when I was lost in a
persona, and it makes me sound like a rapist!

The truth is, my most valued expertise as a hustler was teaching men who were afraid of
getting fucked how to relax, how to douche, how to open up, how to explore the intense
pleasures of receptive anal intercourse and anal orgasm without any pain. I would never
rape or violate anyone's consent -- and certainly not customers I wanted to come back! I
had tremendous empathy for how difficult it can be to learn how to get anally fucked
because I was never able -- or had the desire -- to do it without being high on drugs. (You
have to remember how pervasive recreational drug use was during the sexual revolution.
There were articles in the gay press saying how cocaine was good for you. We didn't
understand addiction then as we do now. And we paid a heavy price for that innocence
and ignorance.)

When I began hustling in NYC, the lesbian and gay liberation movement was ten years
old -- and about that mature. We grew up in such an intensely erotophobic and
homophobic culture -- there was no way to escape it, even after we accepted that we were
gay. We didn't always treat each other well, and it permeated our sexual expression
whether it was vanilla or S&M.

You mention in your blog post that you are wary of how I talk about BDSM as arising
from self-loathing and insecurity and negative cultural pressures on the gay
community. Yes -- in S&M and in vanilla sex -- I saw how we brought a lot of the
culture's contempt to what we did. But, as I say in Sex Positive, many of us came to

For most of our species’ history, our ancestors were barely people. This was not due to
any inadequacy in their brains. On the contrary, even before the emergence of our
anatomically modern human sub-species, they were making things like clothes and
campfires, using knowledge that was not in their genes. It was created in their brains by
thinking, and preserved by individuals in each generation imitating their elders.
Moreover, this must have been knowledge in the sense of understanding, because it is
impossible to imitate novel complex behaviors like those without understanding what the
component behaviors are for.”°

Such knowledgeable imitation depends on successfully guessing explanations,
whether verbal or not, of what the other person is trying to achieve and how each of his
actions contributes to that—for instance, when he cuts a groove in some wood, gathers
dry kindling to put in it, and so on.

The complex cultural knowledge that this form of imitation permitted must have
been extraordinarily useful. It drove rapid evolution of anatomical changes, such as
increased memory capacity and more gracile (less robust) skeletons, appropriate to an
ever more technology-dependent lifestyle. No nonhuman ape today has this ability to
imitate novel complex behaviors. Nor does any present-day artificial intelligence. But
our pre-sapiens ancestors did.

Any ability based on guessing must include means of correcting one’s guesses,
since most guesses will be wrong at first. (There are always many more ways of being
wrong than right.) Bayesian updating is inadequate, because it cannot generate novel
guesses about the purpose of an action, only fine-tune—or, at best, choose among—
existing ones. Creativity is needed. As the philosopher Karl Popper explained, creative
criticism, interleaved with creative conjecture, is how humans learn one another’s
behaviors, including language, and extract meaning from one another’s utterances.”’

6 “ Aping” (imitating certain behaviors without understanding) uses inborn hacks such as the mirror-neuron
system. But behaviors imitated that way are drastically limited in complexity. See Richard Byrne,
“Imitation as Behaviour Parsing,” Phil. Trans. R. Soc., B 358:1431, 529-36 (2003).

of the illegals might lead the FBI to a possible recruit in the NSA or
elsewhere.

The preemptive arrests also had an unforeseen consequence.
They resulted in accidently compromising Poteyev. When Chap-
man returned to Moscow after a spy exchange, she was taken to
a well-publicized dinner with Putin. Afterward, she informed her
debriefer at the SVR that only Poteyev had been in a position to
know the password that an FBI agent had used to try to deceive
her into believing she was speaking to an SVR officer. This brought
Poteyev under immediate suspicion. Tipped off by the CIA to the
FBI's error, Poteyev managed to escape by taking a train from Mos-
cow to Belarus, where the CIA exfiltrated him to the United States.
Poteyev had been saved from prison—or worse—but he was no lon-
ger useful to the CIA as a mole. Without the services of Poteyev in
the SVR in Moscow, U.S. intelligence was unable to find out further
details about the mission to which Poteyev’s sleeper agents were to
be assigned. All it had discovered was the history of the prepara-
tions for a major espionage revival. It now knew that the SVR had

® installed plumbing in America and that one or more agents in this ®
network had been activated to handle a possible recruit in the NSA.
But without anyone left in the sleeper network to follow and with-
out an inside source in the SVR, it had no further avenues to fruit-
fully pursue. The revelation of the sleeper agents had little if any
other intelligence value.

The NSA’s own security investigation turned up no evidence of a
leak at Fort Meade in 2010. That of course doesn’t mean there hadn’t
been one. The Russian intelligence service had demonstrated in the
past that it was well schooled in covering its tracks in operations
against U.S. communications intelligence. For example, CIA coun-
terintelligence had learned from a KGB defector in the early 1960s
that Russian intelligence had penetrated the cipher room at the U.S.
embassy in Moscow and, because of this operation, the KGB was able
to decipher crucial communications. Even so, it failed to find either
the perpetrator or any evidence of his existence for more than half
a century. The operation was only definitively revealed by the Rus-
sian spymaster Sergey Kondrashev in 2007. Tennent Bagley, who
headed the CIA’s Soviet bloc counterintelligence at the time, lately

It was an ambush. It came in July 1995, six months after I'd left the army
and only days before I was expected to named as Interior Minister in Yitzhak
Rabin’s government. The effect, and clearly the intention, was to threaten my
political career before it had even begun — by reviving, and lying about, the
tragic training accident at the Negev army base of Tze’elim, during our
preparations for the operation against Saddam Hussein.

When the “story” broke, I was nearly five thousand miles away. I was
accompanying Nava’s brother, Doron Cohen, on a business trip he was making
to China — and savoring my last few days as a private citizen between my three
decades of military service and my entry into politics. I'd got a hint of the storm
that was about to engulf me a few days before we left for the Far East. It was a
letter from a reporter at Yeidot Achronot, Israel’s largest-selling newspaper,
with a list of questions about Tze’elim. The thrust of the questions made clear
the case Yediot seemed intent on building: that after the live missile strike
which killed the Sayeret Matkal men, I had abandoned the injured and
immediately “fled” to Tel Aviv. I probably should have answered the letter. But
I assumed even rudimentary checks would reveal the story to be false. I'd had
similar questions from a TV journalist a few months earlier. I did phone him
back. I explained the true details of what had happened. I suggested he talk to
others who were there, like Amnon Lipkin, the current chief of staff and my
former deputy, to confirm my account. The story was dropped.

But Yediot evidently decided not to let the facts get in the way of the
“exclusive” it ran in its weekend edition on July 7. Under a banner headline — an
undeniably clever Hebrew pun, Ehud Barakh, “Ehud Ran Away” — it accused
me of having stood by, paralyzed with shock, when the missiles struck and then,
as other officers tended to the wounded, rushed away by helicopter.

Doron and I were having dinner in Beijing when Nava phoned. She’d just
seen the newspaper story, and read it to me. I’d never been angrier. As best I
could work out, it had been concocted from a patchwork of accounts long after
the fact. To the extent the notion of my “fleeing” had been raised, I could only
imagine that Yediot’s “sources” had misunderstood the arrival of the first
medical helicopter, when the pilot was unable to see us and flew on before
returning a couple of minutes later. But in every single detail about my actions
after the tragedy occurred, it was a pure and simple lie.

all of the sudden and be tenderly intimate with Jeffrey stroking his penis
lovingly and even speaking in baby talk to him, which he seemed to
adore.

He loved us pairing up so much that within months he made Rena an
official even renting her an apartment at the same place he had one for me
during my extensive trips out to N.Y.C. Sending us out shopping together
at all of the underground seedy sex stores downtown we would bring him
back thousands of dollars worth of sexy outfits, sex toys and bondage
material. His favorite one was a black leather studded collar that lead
down the back of my spine to cuff my hands and feet together, offering
Rena the most compromising positions to wield her afflictions, one she
was excited to pick out for my usage.

She was good at eradicating my softer side though. Helping me forge
an unpredictable scenario of me turning the tables on her, making her at
my will instead of me always being at her twisted discretion. Jeffrey
loved the rivalry between us, both striving to dominate the other one but
to me it was just another way of surviving her punishment. All for show I
thought she was a madman let loose in a torturesome domain of violent
sex and unbearable beatings. I wasn’t sure how long I could hold off this
charade of S & M, I just didn’t want Jeffrey to think I couldn’t give him
everything that she could, always being replaceable in his company.

She and | could often come across:as good friends to his blind eye but
it was only a matter of time before the animosity inside of me was going
to snap. Doing normal things too made it all half bearable. Having a lot of
similar interests we did fun things like go to the theatre to watch
“Phantom of the Opera” or visit several historical and art museums
together, afterwards treating ourselves for a giant piece of greasy N.Y.C
style pizza. Like I said, we really liked cach other purely as friends but
the dominance in the massage chambers was taking it’s toll on our
strange friendship. One average trip back to N.Y.C, she surprised Jeffrey
with a six foot by six-foot oil painting of her and I lying nude in a ying
and yang position facing each other. Although we were soliciting each
other with sexual innuendo the picture was still very carefully
orchestrated to perfectly portray the darker side of Jeffrey’s thrills. It was
an amazing piece of work, besides the lewdness of it, but she would’ve
known that’s exactly what kind of art Jeffrey liked. He was so astounded
by her gift as he had previously asked her to construct a small painting of
us together but was not expecting anything of this grand magnitude she
had presented him with. He lifted her from the ground and twirled her
around before he thanked her profusely and embellished her with his
profound gratitude, the only thing Jeffrey had to offer, he handed her a
small wad of cash as her payment. It was the most appreciation [ had ever

seen him show a girl. Obviously moved by her gesture, he got her an
exhibit in N.Y.C’s “Metropolitan Museum of Art” where she submitted
her very own piece. She sculpted an image of my headshot out of clay,
shaping it with the strands of my long hair blowing across my face. I was
taken aback myself at her creation. She really did have an amazing talent
if not for her meaner streak she would’ve been a great friend. I will never
forget Rena, for all of the ups and the downs we endured together.

It wasn’t too much longer before I finally had enough of the abuse in
the bedroom and I had to tell Jeffrey what I was feeling. She was getting
even more violent as time went on, and with her questioning me and
Jeffrey why she didn’t get brought on long trips with him, she didn’t get
the fact that she was just a tool for him to use. Jeffrey said he was already
thinking about getting rid of her off of his “regular list”. He said she was
becoming too clingy and he didn’t like clinginess or jealousy. I never
even got to say good-bye or take the opportunity to keep her as a friend,
like a girlfriend to catch up with once and awhile, but that’s how it was
with Jeffrey, one day you sat under the blanket of his comfortably and the
next without any warning you could be discarded like yesterdays news.
She would’ve taken it hard but that’s the game we were playing and it
was for those who knew what lines not to cross.

I was further surprised the next day when Jeffrey gave me a thousand
dollars to go shopping in downtown Manhattan to find a classy dress, on
top of being sent to the exclusive beauty salon of celebrity stylist
“Frederic Fekkai” for a new look. It was amazing, to be pampered like
royalty. I walked out of there feeling like I had replaced a young girl with
a young woman, | felt beautiful. He had yet another surprise in store for
me. Ghislane called me and told me | need to go to a photo-developing
store and ask them for two I.D photos then bring them downtown to
Jeffrey’s Manhattan office. Weird request I thought. | was more used to
posing in full body shots being sexually exposed as a gift for Jeffrey. I
did as they asked and took my two photos into the office where Jeffrey’s
assistant was waiting for my arrival. Still not telling me what the
headshots were for, she took them from me and told me to have a seat for
a second. A moment later I heard Jeffrey call me into the office. “T like
what you’ve done with your hair, you’ve gone more blonde, suits your
glowing tan”. I replied with an appreciative “thank-you” for sending me
to such a renowned hairstylist, and shopping money. I showed him my
finds for the day, an elegant off the shoulder navy blue dress that had two
layers that would swoosh and sway with my every stride. lL couldn’t wait
to wear it on a special occasion, and 1 wouldn’t have to. The pictures I
had to bring to him, as he would proceed to tell me, were for my first
passport. I was so excited, we were going to France for a close friend of
Jeffrey and Ghislane’s birthday party, famed super-model Naomi

the materials in the records would be harmful to his _ professional
reputation. Carnegie recited subsection vi’s restriction on release of materials involving a
privacy right, but noted that “statements Tedder alleged were defamatory and damaging were
allegations in Carnegie's counterclaim for which she seeks damages.
These matters were not peripheral to the lawsuit; they were inherent to it.” Jd at 1312. Of
course, exactly the same principle applies here: sexual abuse allegations filed by attorneys
Edwards and Cassell for their client Ms. Virginia Giuffre are not peripheral to this lawsuit — they
are inherent to it.

To see how “inherent” the sexual abuse allegations are to this lawsuit, the Court need
look no further than Dershowitz’s counterclaim in this case. Count I of Dershowitz’s
Counterclaim (styled as “False Allegations in the Joinder Motion”) contends that Edwards and
Cassell should pay him damages because they “filed a pleading in the Federal Action titled ‘Jane

including rising oil prices and falling stock values? What would the
economic situation be like in the United States and beyond? The
answers to these questions would have a substantial impact on the
war’s course, conduct and outcome.4

Whose War, for What Purpose?

Perhaps the most critical contextual element concerns how senior
U.S. decision-makers, the presumed initiators of war in this case,
would construe their war aims.5 These aims must somehow affirm
that force can be employed to achieve reasonable political and
strategic objectives, but those objectives could range from the limited
to the expansive. Three sets of objectives come readily to mind.
First, a war could aim to simply delay the Iranian nuclear weapons
program through the physical destruction of key facilities and human
assets: a Peenemiinde option, so to speak.6 Second, war could aim to
effectively end the Iranian nuclear program by inflicting broad
damage on its components and other key regime assets, military,
infrastructure and leadership, combined with the threat to re-strike as
necessary: a submission option. Third, war could aim to topple the
regime through a concerted campaign against its assets and
supporting mechanisms, coupled with support to its presumably less
WMD-desirous opponents: a regime change option.

The U.S. government has military options corresponding more or less
to these aims. A Peenemiinde option would presuppose a narrowly
focused, short duration strike largely limited to nuclear facilities. It
would aim to inflict serious damage, but also to restrict the scope of
conflict. Such an attack would rely on U.S. stealth systems, electronic
warfare, cruise missiles and air power. U.S. allies could play a
supporting role, especially in dealing with an Iranian response, but
American forces would carry the brunt of the action.

A submission option would call for a sustained air and naval
campaign against nuclear associated facilities, air defense systems,

The final part of Mr. Finkelstein’s quest for tenure is to blame his tenure problems on
“outsiders.” He claims that I intruded myself into the DePaul review process, neglecting to
mention that I was specifically asked by the former chairman of DePaul’s political science
department to “point [him] to the clearest and most egregious instances of dishonesty on
Finkelstein’s part.” I responded by providing hard evidence of made-up quotes and facts
— a pattern that should alone disqualify him from tenure...

Like the character in the “Groves of Academe,” Mr. Finkelstein generated protests by
students and outsiders. He has encouraged radical goons to email threatening messages;
“Look forward to a visit from me,” reads one. “Nazis like [you] need to be confronted
directly.” He has threatened to sue if he loses — while complaining about outside
interference. No university should be afraid of truth — regardless of its source —
especially when truth consists of Mr. Finkelstein’s own words.

He did not receive tenure. I’m proud of the small role I played in helping to maintain academic
standards at DePaul University by exposing Finkelstein’s lack of scholarship and the sordid tactic
he tried to use to capitalize on that failing. My actions in exposing Finkelstein were completely
consistent with my commitment to free speech and academic freedom. Finkelstein continues to
lecture at universities around the world—including some that have refused to invite me—but he
no longer has the academically undeserved imprimatur of DePaul University.

Academic freedom is not limited to faculty. It extends to students as well, and no professor has
the right to propagandize his captive classroom audience or to grade them down if they disagree
with his political opinions. But it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between acceptable teaching
and unacceptable prostheletizing. This too is an area where rights may be in conflict and a
delicate balance, always skewed in favor of speech, is required.

courageously put unruly Blacks in their place.” He says “the main fomenters of anti-
Semitism “are ‘American Jewish elites’ who need to be stopped.” Normally, no one would
take such claims seriously, but he boasts that he “can get away with things which nobody
else can” because his parents were Holocaust survivors.

And then, of course, there is me. In a recent article, “Should Alan Dershowitz Target
Himself for Assassination?” Mr. Finkelstein commissioned a cartoon by a man who placed
second in the Iranian Holocaust-denial cartoon contest. The Hustler-type cartoon
portrayed me as masturbating in joy while viewing images of dead Lebanese on a TV set
labeled “Israel peep show,” with a Star of David prominently featured.

Mr. Finkelstein has accused me of not having written “The Case For Israel” but when I
sent his publisher my handwritten draft, they made him remove that claim. He has accused

virtually every pro-Israel writer, including me, of “plagiarism.” I asked Harvard to conduct
an investigation of this absurd charge. Harvard rejected it, yet he persists.

just research him,” he replied. As we know now, he pointed out, Rus-
sia and China probably had access to the 127-page standard form in
his personnel file that he updated in 2011. They also had the capa-
bility to track his air travel to Hong Kong. “Could someone have
steered him to Hong Kong?” I asked. He answered, with a shrug,
“That depends on whether Snowden had a confidante who could
have influenced him.”

Whenever adversaries became aware of Snowden in this scenario,
it was not until after he copied the NSA secrets and took them with
him to Hong Kong that Russian intelligence officers offered him a
deal. So from the Russian point of view, Snowden had already burned
his bridges. Because he had used other people’s passwords and access
privileges to get into computers that he was not authorized to use,
illegally moved documents, and given a false reason for his medi-
cal leave, it was only a matter of time, as he told Greenwald in his
interview in Hong Kong, before NSA investigators would identify
him as a possible spy. He could be of no further use at the NSA to an
adversary. His intelligence value now lay in the documents he had

© taken with him or stored in the cloud as well as his ability to help ©
clarify them in debriefing sessions. He could also inflict damage on
the morale and public standing of the NSA by denouncing its spying
in the media.

Once Snowden was in Hong Kong, the Russians would have no
reason to restrain him from holding a press event or releasing a
video. In fact, the KGB had organized press conferences for all the
previous NSA defectors to Moscow. Hong Kong was a perfect venue
for a well-staged media event because all the major newspapers in
the world had bureaus there. Snowden’s disclosures about NSA spy-
ing could serve to weaken the NSA’s relations with its allies.

It is also possible that Russian or Chinese intelligence did not
become aware of Snowden until after he went public in June by
having The Guardian release his video. The video would have con-
vinced the Russians or the Chinese of how dissatisfied Snowden was
with the NSA. Because dissatisfaction is one of the classic means of
recruitment in the intelligence business, he would certainly become
a prime target for recruitment after he went public.

The CIA also considered the possibility that Snowden might

Still, a friend.

“Nothing,” says Mary.

“You got your period?”

“Shut the fuck up,” Mary whispers.

There have been rumors going around, she knows that.
Rumors started by a girl who has eyes for Joe.

“Whore,” her rival shouts in the hallway one day.

“Youre the whore,” Mary shouts back.

Mary rushes the girl, who shoves back, grabbing at Mary’s hair,
twisting and tugging. Someone yells, “Catfight!” By the time the
bell rings for next period, Mary’s sitting in the principal's office.

She shakes her head in reply to the questions, stays silent,
feeling humiliated.

Then, in her wallet, they find the three hundred dollars.

Mary’s too young and too small to be stripping. Besides, the bills
are all twenties, not singles or fives. When they call Mary’s par-
ents, her teachers suggest a more obvious explanation: Does
Mary do drugs or deal them?

Mary’s father knows better than that. “No,” he insists. A psy-
chologist is called in. And then, Mary does start talking.

Once she does, she can’t stop.

It's a wild story. Highly disturbing. A mansion in Palm Beach.
A powerful man. This is all far from the principal’s wheelhouse.
It's definitely a matter for the police. In the meantime, the school’s
recommending a transfer, purely temporarily, to a facility for
troubled kids—ones with “issues.”

Mary’s a good girl, it’s true. But further confrontations at the
high school will not be tolerated.

Appendix to Subpart A—Text of
Employee Notice

“EMPLOYEE RIGHTS UNDER THE
NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT

The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)
guarantees the right of employees to organize
and bargain collectively with their
employers, and to engage in other protected
concerted activity or to refrain from engaging
in any of the above activity. Employees
covered by the NLRA® are protected from
certain types of employer and union

misconduct. This Notice gives you general
information about your rights, and about the
obligations of employers and unions under
the NLRA. Contact the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB), the Federal agency
that investigates and resolves complaints
under the NLRA, using the contact
information supplied below, if you have any
questions about specific rights that may
apply in your particular workplace.

“Under the NLRA, you have the right to:

e Organize a union to negotiate with your
employer concerning your wages, hours, and
other terms and conditions of employment.

e Form, join or assist a union.

e Bargain collectively through
representatives of employees’ own choosing
for a contract with your employer setting
your wages, benefits, hours, and other
working conditions.

e Discuss your wages and benefits and
other terms and conditions of employment or
union organizing with your co-workers or a
union.

e Take action with one or more co-workers
to improve your working conditions by,
among other means, raising work-related
complaints directly with your employer or
with a government agency, and seeking help
from a union.

e Strike and picket, depending on the
purpose or means of the strike or the
picketing.

e Choose not to do any of these activities,
including joining or remaining a member of
a union.

“Under the NLRA, it is illegal for your
employer to:

e Prohibit you from talking about or
soliciting for a union during non-work time,
such as before or after work or during break
times; or from distributing union literature

during non-work time, in non-work areas,
such as parking lots or break rooms.

e Question you about your union support
or activities in a manner that discourages you
from engaging in that activity.

e Fire, demote, or transfer you, or reduce
your hours or change your shift, or otherwise
take adverse action against you, or threaten
to take any of these actions, because you join
or support a union, or because you engage in
concerted activity for mutual aid and
protection, or because you choose not to
engage in any such activity.

e Threaten to close your workplace if
workers choose a union to represent them.

e Promise or grant promotions, pay raises,
or other benefits to discourage or encourage
union support.

e Prohibit you from wearing union hats,
buttons, t-shirts, and pins in the workplace
except under special circumstances.

e Spy on or videotape peaceful union
activities and gatherings or pretend to do so.

“Under the NLRA, it is illegal for a union
or for the union that represents you in
bargaining with your employer to:

e Threaten or coerce you in order to gain
your support for the union.

e Refuse to process a grievance because
you have criticized union officials or because
you are not a member of the union.

e Use or maintain discriminatory
standards or procedures in making job
referrals from a hiring hall.

e Cause or attempt to cause an employer
to discriminate against you because of your
union-related activity.

e Take adverse action against you because
you have not joined or do not support the
union.

“If you and your co-workers select a union
to act as your collective bargaining
representative, your employer and the union

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028782.txt,"The following excerpts from Tracy Kidder's Mountains Beyond Mountains, a biography of anthropologist and
physician Paul Farmer, detail Kim's bold efforts to combat international HIV and tuberculosis epidemics with
PIH:

Some months after the official founding of PIH, [co-founder] Paul Farmer expanded the group, adding a fellow
Harvard anthropology and medical student, a Korean American named Jim Yong Kim... Farmer offered what
for Jim Kim was a convincing vision of the new organization. The reality was less impressive -- a charity with a
board of advisers and no hired staff...

They talked about issues such as political correctness, which Jim Kim defined as follows: It's a very well-
crafted tool to distract us. A very self-centered activity. Clean up your own vocabulary so you can show
everybody you have the social capital of having been in circles where these things are talked about on a regular
basis. (What was an example of political correctness? Some academic types would say to Jim and Paul, Why
do you call your patients poor people? They don't call themselves poor people. Jim would reply: Okay, how
about soon-dead people?)

They talked about the insignificance of cultural barriers when it came to the Haitian peasant's acceptance of
modem Western medicine: There's nothing like a cure for a disease to change people's cultural values...

By now Peru was taxing PIH's resources severely. On average, the drugs to treat just one patient cost between
fifteen and twenty thousand dollars. And the number of patients kept growing. Already there were about fifty
Carabayllanos in treatment. Their average age was twenty-nine. They were students, unemployed youths,
housewives, street vendors, bus drivers, health workers. The actual numbers seemed small, but those fifty MDR
[a form of tuberculosis that does not respond to standard treatment] cases represented about 10 percent of all
active cases of TB in the slum, about ten times more than might have been expected. No telling how many
others they had been infecting as they'd traveled around Lima, coughing. No telling either how many people in
other parts of the city already had MDR, but [there were] reports of hundreds in other neighborhoods. In
Carabayllo itself, the Socios workers found entire families sick and dying with what turned out to be genetically
related strains of the disease--a phenomenon common enough that the health workers gave it a name, familias
tebeceanas, tuberculosis families.

Kim's organization confronted Peru's MDR-form tuberculosis epidemic with what some have called unorthodox
practices -- borrowing and cajoling its way into medicine for its patients.

Howard Hiatt, a friend of Jim Yong Kim's and a former dean at the Harvard School of Public Health, said he
was concerned about how PIH was getting medicine to combat the epidemic:

Sure enough. Paul and Jim would stop at the [Harvard-affiliated] Brigham pharmacy before they left for Peru
and fill their briefcases with drugs. They had sweet-talked various people into letting them walk away with the
drugs. [Hiatt] was amused, all in all. That's their Robin Hood attitude. In fact, they'd only borrowed the
drugs...

Then one day the president of the Brigham stopped Hiatt in a corridor. Your friends Farmer and Kim are in
trouble with me. They owe this hospital ninety-two thousand dollars. Hiatt looked into the matter. Sure
enough. Paul and Jim would stop at the Brigham pharmacy before they left for Peru and fill their briefcases with
drugs. They had sweet-talked various people into letting them walk away with the drugs. He was amused, all in
all. That's their Robin Hood attitude.”

To many seasoned managers of public health projects, what Farmer and Kim were doing would have looked
quite reckless--like a stunt, as some would later insinuate. They didn't have a guaranteed supply of drugs, only
the determination to obtain the drugs and the charm to get away with borrowing. They were borrowing their
laboratory services, too, from Massachusetts. They lacked proper institutional support. The weight of expert
opinion stood against them. Their organization was small and it had other projects, in Haiti and Boston and
elsewhere, and Peru put a strain on everyone. Jim had to travel to Carabayllo at least once a month. Farmer had
to go there slightly more often.

Kim's audacious ‘Robin Hood attitude’ won him and PIH acclaim for their role in changing global health and
development.

State Hillary Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden took the podium and
extolled Mitchell's reputation and experience having brokered peace
in Northern Ireland, calling him an outstanding public servant with
incredible capacity. In the press, Mitchell was praised as the right
man for the job at the right time.

On Friday, though, that capacity had reached its limit, and Mitchell
told his bosses in the West Wing that he'd had enough. His reasons,
he said, were personal—the kind of nebulous rationale that leaves
ample room for interpretation. Unmentioned were the months of
frustration that Mitchell had built up as direct negotiations between
Israelis and Palestinians became more difficult and the peace process
further off.

The timing of Mitchell's departure couldn't be more awkward. Obama
will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Jordan's King Abdullah next week, as well as deliver a major speech
on Middle East policy. But the resignation didn't come as a surprise
to those who worked closest with Mitchell. A State Department
official described to Newsweek a man increasingly annoyed by both
parties’ constant moving of the goal posts and the constraints of the
administration's unshakeable political instinct to support Israel.

BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE

The following section describes our board leadership structure, the reasons why the structure is in place at this time, the roles of various
positions, and related key governance practices. The mix of experienced independent and management directors that make up our Board, along with the
independent role of our lead director and our independent board-committee composition, benefits Carvana and its stockholders.

INDEPENDENCE; BOARD MIX

Our Board has an effective mix of independent and management directors. It is composed of four independent directors and our current
chairman and chief executive officer, Ernest Garcia III.

LEAD DIRECTOR

The Board believes that it is beneficial to Carvana and its stockholders to designate one of the directors as a lead director who is elected by a
majority of the Board. The lead director serves a variety of roles, including reviewing and approving Board schedules to confirm the appropriate board and
committee topics are reviewed and sufficient time is allocated to each; liaising between our chairman and chief executive officer and non-management
directors when necessary and appropriate (that said, each director has direct and regular access to the chairman and chief executive officer) and calling an
executive session of independent directors at any time consistent with the bylaws and certificate of incorporation. Michael Maroone, an independent
director and member of our Audit Committee, is currently our lead director. Mr. Maroone is an effective lead director for Carvana due to, among other
things, his independence, his board leadership experience with AutoNation, Inc., his strong strategic and financial acumen, his commitment to ethics, his
extensive knowledge of the automotive retail environment, and his deep understanding of Carvana and its business.

CHAIRMAN / CEO

With respect to the roles of chairman and CEO, the corporate governance guidelines provide that the roles may be separated or combined, and
the Board will exercise its discretion in combining or separating these positions as it deems appropriate in light of prevailing circumstances. Mr. Garcia has
been our chairman and CEO since our IPO. The Board believes that combining the roles of chairman and CEO, together with the separate, independent role
of our lead director, is currently the most effective leadership structure because Mr. Garcia has extensive knowledge and experience in a variety of relevant
areas acquired through his professional and other experiences, including automotive retail, e-commerce, consumer finance and strategic planning. This
knowledge and experience give Mr. Garcia the insight necessary to combine the responsibilities of strategic development and execution along with
management of day-to-day operations.

Tom Griffiths

Tom Griffiths is Henry R. Luce Professor of Information, Technology, Consciousness,
and Culture at Princeton University. He is co-author (with Brian Christian) of
Algorithms to Live By.

When you ask people to imagine a world that has successfully, beneficially incorporated
advances in artificial intelligence, everybody probably comes up with a slightly different
picture. Our idiosyncratic visions of the future might differ in the presence or absence of
spaceships, flying cars, or humanoid robots. But one thing doesn’t vary: the presence of
human beings. That’s certainly what Norbert Wiener imagined when he wrote about the
potential of machines to improve human society by interacting with humans and helping
to mediate their interactions with one another. Getting to that point doesn’t just require
coming up with ways to make machines smarter. It also requires a better understanding
of how human minds work.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning have resulted in
systems that can meet or exceed human abilities in playing games, classifying images, or
processing text. But if you want to know why the driver in front of you cut you off, why
people vote against their interests, or what birthday present you should get for your
partner, you’re still better off asking a human than a machine. Solving those problems
requires building models of human minds that can be implemented inside a computer—
something that’s essential not just to better integrate machines into human societies but to
make sure that human societies can continue to exist.

Consider the fantasy of having an automated intelligent assistant that can take on
such basic tasks as planning meals and ordering groceries. To succeed in these tasks, it
needs to be able to make inferences about what you want, based on the way you behave.
Although this seems simple, making inferences about the preferences of human beings
can be a tricky matter. For example, having observed that the part of the meal you most
enjoy is dessert, your assistant might start to plan meals consisting entirely of desserts.
Or perhaps it has heard your complaints about never having enough free time and
observed that looking after your dog takes up a considerable amount of that free time.
Following the dessert debacle, it has also understood that you prefer meals that
incorporate protein, so it might begin to research recipes that call for dog meat. It’s not a
long journey from examples like this to situations that begin to sound like problems for
the future of humanity (all of whom are good protein sources).

Making inferences about what humans want is a prerequisite for solving the AI
problem of value alignment—aligning the values of an automated intelligent system with
those of a human being. Value alignment is important if we want to ensure that those
automated intelligent systems have our best interests at heart. If they can’t infer what we
value, there’s no way for them to act in support of those values—and they may well act in
ways that contravene them.

Value alignment is the subject of a small but growing literature in artificial-
intelligence research. One of the tools used for solving this problem is inverse-
reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is a standard method for training
intelligent machines. By associating particular outcomes with rewards, a machine-

RLK: If we look at these, China's
making real progress in intellectual
property, reducing cyber theft —
more needs to be done. Not
requiring tech transfer. The big one,
which they won't change, is
government subsidy for nascent
technologies of the future. Such
government-industry cooperation is
part of the Chinese system — that's
beyond their red line.

RLK: But China should be able to
open their markets — and we
should be able to have a trade
between seriously open markets,
which even Chinese economists say
is good for the Chinese economy
and very good for the world and
American companies — and some
sort of a recognition that China will
continue to subsidize industries.
That's where it will happen, we
hope soon.

"
IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022750.txt,"Then there is the outside world pressed to the glass, appalled and
titillated by the monster inside the big house—a kind of Boo Radley of the
Upper East Side. I have taken friends by the Epstein mansion, and the
reaction to its other-worldly size in Manhattan is almost always the same: a
gasp. Press accounts, seldom supplying new information, ever recycle and
repeat the mysterious (and monstrous) billionaire mythology, with brief
glimpses of him stepping out of the house (the same photos endlessly
republished), and the assumption of depravity inside.

In fact, the life in the house, without wife or children or conventional
domestic demeanor, in some way conforms to the most scripted fantasies: a
life somewhere between Daddy Warbucks and Eyes Wide Shut.

The domesticity of the house, and the background of Epstein’s
problems, centers around a group of young women who act as his support
staff and companions. Some have worked for him for many years, marrying,
having children, and continuing as part of his business and household
infrastructure. One woman, on an afternoon when I was there, recently
married, had just returned from an around the world honeymoon that Epstein
had arranged for her. Some are his romantic interests. His present girl friend
is in dental school. One former girlfriend, Eva Andersson Dubin, a Swedish
model and Miss Universe finalist, became a doctor and married hedge
funder Glen Dubin and together they finance the Dubin Breast Center at
Mount Sinai Hospital. Most at one time will travel with him to his other
floating residences—the ranch in New Mexico, a vast apartment in Paris, the
Island in the Caribbean, the house in Palm Beach.

This is so outside of conventional living or staffing or romantic
relationships that it is hard to describe in a straightforward or straight-faced
way. It sometimes seems part of Epstein’s implicit challenge: not just look at
me, but do you even believe what you see? Or it seems he is just oblivious to
what others are thinking. A willful and perhaps fatal tone deafness.

But Hefnerian prurience can also be quite businesslike: poised young
women in a mansion on the Upper East Side with various office
responsibilities are really not that different from any of the art galleries in
the surrounding neighborhood.

Epstein’s young women mingle freely with his powerful guests, not so
much as hostess or, in tabloid language, harem-like (or as “sex slaves”), but
often as attentive students (that, of course, might be regarded as having its
own fetish-like attraction).

Not long ago, Epstein invited me to sit in on a day of presentations to
him in his dining room by various “quants.” Quant theory involves making
investments based solely on mathematical and statistical models. This

If the problem continues and escalates further in the Syrian street it is
probable that the prefabricated facility in the Hatay province
constructed to provide temporary lodging to pilgrims during the Hajj
season will not suffice in providing a shelter to Syrian refugees who
thanks to the no-visa regime in travel between Turkey and Syria may
freely escape to Turkey from the trouble in their own street and thus
carry the problem to the Turkish street.

For now the separatist Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, terrorists
are abiding with an unilateral truce, which is claimed to have been
negotiated with the government by Abdullah Ocalan, the chieftain of
the gang serving an enforced life term on the Imrali island prison,
which according to claims will last until June 15, three days after the
June 12 parliamentary elections. Indeed, excluding some rehearsal for
a possible mass civilian disobedience campaign after the elections
and some exceptional terrorist acts, it might be said that there is
nothing extraordinary in Turkey’s southeast bordering Syria, Iraq and
Iran, where there are sizeable Kurdish populations.

The “success” of the unrest in Syrian streets in uprooting the
government might mean added trouble for Turkey, which has been
battling with separatist terrorism for the past 25 years. Turkey
remaining silent or supportive of the Assad regime crushing the
pressure for a regime change and reform calls of the Syrian street, on
the other hand, would seriously imperil the regional role aspired by
the AKP governance of Turkey.

Indeed, while the AKP government in Ankara joined the calls of the
U.S.-led coalition of the willing that time is up for Moammar Gadhafi
in Libya and for peace and safety of his own people Gadhafi must
step down, as regards to Syria Ankara, as well as the Western
alliance, has been restraining their calls with a shy request from
Assad to accelerate reforms.

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017547.txt,"Jeffrey Katzenberg (born December 21, 1950) is an American

film producer and CEO of DreamWorks Animation. He
is perhaps most known for his period as chairman of The
Walt Disney Studios when Disney produced some of its
biggest hits, including The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the
Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King. As a founder and CEO
of DreamWorks Animation, he has overseen the production
of such animated franchises as Shrek, Madagascar, Kung Fu
Panda, Monsters vs. Aliens and How to Train Your Dragon.
Katzenberg was born in New York City, the son
of Anne, an artist, and Walter, a stockbroker. He attended
the Ethical Culture Fieldston School, graduating in 1969.
Katzenberg began his career as an assistant to
producer David Picker, then in 1974 he became an assistant
to Barry Diller, the Chairman of Paramount Pictures. Diller
moved Katzenberg to the marketing department, followed
by other assignments within the studio, until he was
assigned to revive the Star Trek franchise, which resulted
in the hit film, Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979). He
continued to work his way up and became President of
Production under Paramount President Michael Eisner.
In 1984, Michael Eisner became Chief Executive
Officer (CEO) at The Walt Disney Company. Eisner brought
Katzenberg with him to take charge of Disney’s motion
picture division. Katzenberg was responsible for reviving
the studio which, at the time, ranked last at the box office
among the major studios. He focused the studio on the
production of adult-oriented comedies under its Touchstone
Pictures banner, including films such as Down and Out in
Beverly Hills (1986), Three Men and a Baby (1987) and Good
Morning, Vietnam (1987). By 1987, Disney had become
the number-one studio at the box office. Katzenberg also
oversaw Touchstone Television, which produced such hit
TV series, The Golden Girls and Home Improvement.
Katzenberg was also charged with turning around
Disney’s ailing Feature Animation unit, creating some
intrastudio controversy when he personally edited three
minutes out of a completed Disney animated feature, The
Black Cauldron (1985), shortly after joining the company.

Under his management, the animation department eventually
began creating some of Disney’s most critically acclaimed and
highest grossing animated features. These films include Who
Framed Roger Rabbit (1988), The Little Mermaid (1989),The
Rescuers Down Under (1990), Beauty and the Beast (1991,
the first animated feature to be nominated for an Academy
Award for Best Picture), Aladdin (1992), and The Lion King
(1994). In addition, Katzenberg also sealed the deal that
created the highly successful partnership between Pixar and
Disney and the deal that brought Miramax Films into Disney.

When Eisner’s second in command, Frank Wells,
died in a helicopter crash in 1994, Eisner refused to promote
Katzenberg to the vacated position of president. This led to
a falling out between the two executives, and Katzenberg
left the company in September 1994. He launched a lawsuit
against Disney to recover money he felt he was owed and
settled out of court for an estimated $250 million.

Later in 1994, Katzenberg co-founded
DreamWorks SKG with Steven Spielberg and David
Geffen, with Katzenberg taking primary responsibility for
animation operations. He was also credited as executive
producer on the DreamWorks animated films The Prince
of Egypt (1998), The Road to El Dorado and Joseph:
King of Dreams (both in 2000) and Shrek in 2001.

After DreamWorks Animation suffered a
$125 million loss on the traditionally-animated Sinbad:
Legend of the Seven Seas, the studio switched to all
computer-generated animation. Since then, DreamWorks’
animated films have been consistently successful.

In 2004, DreamWorks Animation (DWA)
was spun off from DreamWorks as a separate
company headed by Katzenberg in an IPO and has
recorded mostly profitable quarters since then.

The live-action DreamWorks movie studio was
sold to Viacom in December 2006. In 2008, the live-
action DreamWorks studio again became an independent
production company, releasing its films through Disney.

In 2006, Katzenberg made an appearance on the
fifth season of The Apprentice. He awarded the task winners

JEFFREY KATZENBERG

an opportunity to be character voices in Over the Hedge.

Katzenberg has been an industry leader in promoting
digital 3D production of film, calling it “the greatest advance
in the film industry since the arrival of color in the 1930s.”
When Katzenberg appeared on The Colbert Report on April
20, 2010, he confirmed that from now on “every single
movie” that DreamWorks Animation produced would be
in 3D and gave Stephen Colbert a pair of new 3D glasses.

Katzenberg married Marilyn Siegel, a kindergarten
teacher, in 1975, and they have two children.

Together, Marilyn and Jeffrey have been highly
active in charitable causes. They donated the multi-
million-dollar Katzenberg Center to Boston University’s
College of General Studies, citing that the school gave
their two children the “love of education.” They also
donated the Marilyn and Jeffrey Katzenberg Center for
Animation at the University of Southern California.

In addition to serving as Chairman of the Board
for the Motion Picture and Television Fund Foundation,
Katzenberg sits on the boards or serves as a trustee of AIDS
Project Los Angeles, American Museum of the Moving Image,
California Institute of the Arts, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center,
Geffen Playhouse, Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s
Research, University of Southern California School of
Cinematic Arts and The Simon Wiesenthal Center. Together
with DreamWorks Animation, Katzenberg founded the
DreamWorks Animation Academy of Inner-City Arts in 2008.

Katzenberg has an estimated worth of $800
million according to Forbes. Katzenberg is reported to
have donated over $3.5 million in political contributions
since 1979: 33% ($1.171+ million) to Democrats, 66%

($2.33+ million) to special interest groups without party
affiliations, and less than 1% ($7,000) to Republicans.

He was awarded an honorary doctorate from
Ringling College of Art and Design on May 2, 2008.

Performance Metrics and Goals

The performance period for the annual incentive is our fiscal year. The committee selected retail units sold, gross profit per unit ex-Gift, and
EBITDA margin ex-Gift as the performance metrics for our 2018 annual incentive plan because these are the primary metrics we use in evaluating our own
performance when communicating our financial results to our investors.

The committee believes that these performance measures help focus the executives on growing retail units sold and revenue, increasing total
gross profit per unit, and demonstrating operating leverage. The detailed definition of each measure and rationale of selection are provided below:

Trump defense plan parallels the goals and
objectives of President Reagan’s military
push. And with McCain’s more aggressive
plan aligned on the same premise of
modernizing and improving the readiness
of the US military, Trump will likely have the
backing of this influential member of the
Republican congressional leadership.

Today's Economic Backdrop—

Similar to the 1960s

The economic and financial implications of
a large, multiyear defense-spending plan
must be weighed against the economic
environment at the time of implementation.
And from a historical context, today’s
conditions have more similarities to the
economic setting of the mid- 1960s than
during the defense buildups of the early
1980s or early 2000s, which were either
in recession or the very early stages of
recovery.

In contrast, the US economy in the mid-
1960s was already in its fifth year of
expansion, the jobless rate of 4.5% was
relatively low and inflation was tame
(roughly 1.5%). Nonetheless, the extra
defense spending boosted domestic
demand growth and added significant
pressure to labor costs, materials and
supplies, and product prices. So much so
that the acceleration in consumer price
inflation (from 1% in 1961 to near 6% in
19°70) from the start to the end of that
business cycle was one of the largest of
any economic growth cycle during the
postwar period.

Today’s economic backdrop looks similar in
many ways. The economy has been in
recovery for seven years, the jobless rate is
in the mid-4% range and inflation is stable
(at around 2%). While many domestic and
global factors are different now, we would
still expect a large multiyear defense-

spending program to add to growth and
put upward pressure on labor costs and
inflation in the coming years. Keep in mind
that we’re coming off the weakest five-year
defense spending trend in the past 50
years, so Trump’s defense spending need
not match any of the prior three to have a
major impact.

Stay tuned for the unveiling of Trump’s
budget and pay close attention to the
defense spending request. A large
multi-year program would definitely lift
inflationary pressures. While we wouldn't
expect an acceleration like that in the
1960s, a sustained rise of 100 to 200
basis points in general inflation would still
seem reasonable—and far above what the
Federal Reserve and financial markets are
currently expecting. =

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016881.txt,"Indeed, Wiener gave scientific teeth to the idea that in the workings of history,
politics, and society, ideas matter. Beliefs, ideologies, norms, laws, and customs, by
regulating the behavior of the humans who share them, can shape a society and power the
course of historical events as surely as the phenomena of physics affect the structure and
evolution of the solar system. To say that ideas—and not just weather, resources,
geography, or weaponry—can shape history is not woolly mysticism. It is a statement of
the causal powers of information instantiated in human brains and exchanged in networks
of communication and feedback. Deterministic theories of history, whether they identify
the causal engine as technological, climatological, or geographic, are belied by the causal
power of ideas. The effects of these ideas can include unpredictable lurches and
oscillations that arise from positive feedback or from miscalibrated negative feedback.

An analysis of society in terms of its propagation of ideas also gave Wiener a
guideline for social criticism. A healthy society—one that gives its members the means
to pursue life in defiance of entropy—allows information sensed and contributed by its
members to feed back and affect how the society is governed. A dysfunctional society
invokes dogma and authority to impose control from the top down. Wiener thus
described himself as “a participant in a liberal outlook,” and devoted most of the moral
and rhetorical energy in the book (both the 1950 and 1954 editions) to denouncing
communism, fascism, McCarthyism, militarism, and authoritarian religion (particularly
Catholicism and Islam) and to warning that political and scientific institutions were
becoming too hierarchical and insular.

Wiener’s book is also, here and there, an early exemplar of an increasingly
popular genre, tech prophecy. Prophecy not in the sense of mere prognostications but in
the Old Testament sense of dark warnings of catastrophic payback for the decadence of
one’s contemporaries. Wiener warned against the accelerating nuclear arms race, against
technological change that was imposed without regard to human welfare (“[W]e must
know as scientists what man’s nature is and what his built-in purposes are”), and against
what today is called the value-alignment problem: that “the machine like the djinnee,
which can learn and can make decisions on the basis of its learning, will in no way be
obliged to make such decisions as we should have made, or will be acceptable to us.” In
the darker, 1950 edition, he warned of a “threatening new Fascism dependent on the
machine a gouverner.”

Wiener’s tech prophecy harks back to the Romantic movement’s rebellion against
the “dark Satanic mills” of the Industrial Revolution, and perhaps even earlier, to the
archetypes of Prometheus, Pandora, and Faust. And today it has gone into high gear.
Jeremiahs, many of them (like Wiener) from the worlds of science and technology, have
sounded alarms about nanotechnology, genetic engineering, Big Data, and particularly
artificial intelligence. Several contributors to this volume characterize Wiener’s book as
a prescient example of tech prophecy and amplify his dire worries.

Yet the two moral themes of The Human Use of Human Beings—the liberal
defense of an open society and the dystopian dread of runaway technology—are in
tension. A society with channels of feedback that maximize human flourishing will have
mechanisms in place, and can adapt them to changing circumstances, in a way that can
domesticate technology to human purposes. There’s nothing idealistic or mystical about
this; as Wiener emphasized, ideas, norms, and institutions are themselves a form of
technology, consisting of patterns of information distributed across brains. The

Attachments: 
1. Optimizing good information to push down the negative: using new content (blog, 
websites, press releases, public network profiles, google images, etc) and search engine 
optimization. Changing the Wikipedia profile. Notes Wikipedia below. 
2. Eliminating the bad information using prevalence and proprietary algorithms; redirecting 
the way in which Google sequences your information (reassociating it with the positive 
content). This is called off-page optimization. 
3. Eliminating personal information (social sec, tel #'s, dob, addresses etc) from all public 
and private directories. 
COMMENTS:  
Step 2 is critical otherwise one is just bailing water from an ongoing flood of negative press. By 
realigning the algorithms (i.e. reinforcing positive associations with your name and weakening the 
negative associations), one almost permanently seals up the water hole or at least closes it 
significantly. This allows for Step 1 to be a onetime project (which will take 2 to 4 months approx.), 
with just tweaking here and there down the road with updated content. 
BEST PEOPLE TO USE:  
You need people who eat, drink and sleep algorithms and search engine optimization. I've 
researched several companies and the most skilled, discrete, award winning and comprehensive is 
a company called, www.reputation.com based in Silicon Valley. See their attached docs for review. 
Below are bulleted key points on them: 
Lookup Page just creates web pages and will not solve your problem. 
I would serve as a liaison between you and Reputation. I would monitor their progress and provide 
them with all positive content that they need. They would make sure that the content has maximum 
algorithmic potential. You could keep your positive content simple (using you Edge.org summary 
which is good), or expand your content with updates on current science work and scientists. The 
benefit of the former, is that it keeps you more anonymous. The benefit of the latter is that is 
algorithmically associates you to a larger pool of known scientists, further pushing up positive 
content. My advice would be to combine the two: a simple repetitive bio summary of you but with a 
larger list of scientists added on. But I would ask the Reputation team about this: saying that the 
main goal is to enhance anonymity and algorithmic associations at the same time.

• based in Silicon Valley 
• Featured on CNN, WSJ, Forbes, NY Times etc 
• Undisputed world leader in online reputation management 
• Prevalence and proprietary algorithms to drive positive search results to the top. 
• Intimate knowledge of search engine optimization.

CEO and Founder 
Michael Fertik founded Reputation.com in 2006 
with the belief that people have the right to control 
and protect their online reputation and privacy. In 
addition to his work with Reputation.com, Michael 
holds a position on the advisory board of The Internet 
Keepsafe Coalition (iKeepSafe), a nonprofit that 
works to protect the health and safety of youth online. 
Michael is regarded as one of the earliest pioneers of 
online reputation management and a leading expert 
on issues of online privacy. He co-authored the book 
Wild West 2.0 and lectures internationally, appearing 
before professional and academic audiences. Michael 
also advises school administrators and parent groups. 
Prior to founding Reputation.com, Michael clerked for 
Chief Judge Danny J. Boggs of the Sixth Circuit Court 
of Appeals of the United States. He is a graduate of 
Harvard College and Harvard Law School, speaks 
several languages, and enjoys sailing, reading, and 
running. 
TIME FRAME & FEES 
Their Picasso Tech services described in step 2, will take approx. 3 months to eliminate bad press from the 
1st and 2'd page. The whole process will take about a year to be solidified. Fees will be approx. $10k -$15k 
per month but depends on each case and costs can be kept down by providing content and selecting only 
truly necessary services. 
WIKIPEDIA 
This is a tough nut to crack. And I need to do more research on this. Wiki comes up first on the 
Google list due to its powerful domain and contains totally lopsided and damning content on you. 
But we'll crack it. On the surface, Wiki is controlled by a morass of copyediting geeks who have 
nothing better to do than to discuss reference tags etc. It is also 'the people's' encyclopedia, 
dictated by the tyranny of the majority—so no objectivity at all. 
Current Strategy— 1. The Reputation group have a copyright team dedicated to balancing the 
content on Wikipedia and gradually sectioning the bad stuff down to sub categories in the profile. 
They don't seem to be able to eliminate the bad though. 2. So, I think it's worth seeing how people 
like Prince Andrew managed to create an absolutely stellar profile—or Bill Clinton for that matter. 
No mention of his impeachment or lying to the Grand Jury. It barely touches on Lewinsky etc. 3. 
There are also protected pages on Wiki but I need more time and research. 
WEBSITE  
You need to update your website immediately by adding the bio on you from The Edge if you can 
and adding a longer summary of science and scientists that you are/have worked with.

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022744.txt,"Departments agreement not to prosecute in favor of the state action. In 2014,
Edwards tries to ad Virginia Roberts, another of the original complainants,
who has previously settled with Epstein, to the long-running suit. Roberts
who was paid a settlement under the original terms of Epstein’s agreement—
that he would pay attorney’s fees and not oppose any law suits against
him—is now trying to overturn the agreement under which she was paid,
and, with Edwards, further suing Epstein for $50,000,000.

As the most vocal of the accusers, Roberts, with the Daily Mail being
her prime outlet, emerges now with what is billed as a memoir of her “sex
slavery” with Epstein, written ten years after the fact. She names a number
of people as being at Epstein’s Island home, including Clinton and Al Gore
and his wife, who Epstein’s lawyers insists were never there—proof
available through secret service records.

The FBI is now arguing that Roberts should not be party to the suit
against the government because she refused to cooperate with the
government in its investigation in 2007, hence has no standing as a victim.
(At the same time, the FBI included her on the list of 40 victims with whom
it mandated Epstein reach a settlement.)

It is hard to find a more hyperbolic intersection of media and lawyers
then in Epstein’s case.

Edwards, over the six years of his law suit, tries to depose Clinton,
Donald Trump, and Dershowitz—almost all of his targets coming directly
from the original Vanity Fair and New York Magazine articles about
Epstein.

In addition to Prince Andrew as a British hot button, first connected to
Epstein through Roberts’ interview with the Daily Mail in 2010, Clinton
takes on a new role as Hillary spoiler through his connection, real or
imagined, to Epstein and sex slaves.

Almost everybody identified in any story about Epstein is approached
by other media seeking to write about Epstein, often with financial
incentives.

No new details emerge. Every aspect of the current story is based on
court filings describing events that may or may not have taken place prior to
2007.

A recent Reuters story identified a charity that Epstein has not given
money to in 15 years that said if he does give again, they would give it back.

The world cleanly divides, with Epstein (and friends) behind secure

walls and the Mail and social media and upholders of new norms, ever more
incredulous and apoplectic that Epstein not only walks free but prospers too.

Importance: High 
Second Draft: 
I appreciate the opportunity to respond to your email. While I am running the risk that you will report my 
comments, if you do, either out of context, or incompletely, I am responding with an effort to be complete. It is 
hard to know how to respond to a list of false and/or distorted allegations, along with misleading statements on 
your part. I treat people I interact with with respect, and I work hard to support and mentor students, colleagues, 
and members of the general public. I do not sexually harass people. If the purpose of your reporting is to 
somehow argue that Universities and other institutions are lax in dealing with well known individuals like 
myself, then in fact the situation is quite the opposite. My high public profile opens me up to more scrutiny at 
these institutions, not less, and it also opens me up to a host of outside complaints and allegations that other 
faculty do not receive, each of which the University has to respond to. The fact that I have remained a professor 
in all Universities with which I have been associated, in good standing, and also an officer or an invited speaker 
at organizations like CFI, which have strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the fact that they trust my 
behavior. I was asked to be an honorary director of CFI, and invited to their last 3 meetings to speak, 
specifically because, as they have written me after the fact, the attendees universally appreciated my talks, my 
courtesy, and graciousness in spending time with the attendees. If the purpose of your report is to impugn my 
integrity or suggest I have a history of harassment, that too is false. As noted in one of your 'miscellaneous 
facts', as a scientist I try and remain skeptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather than allegations and 
innuendo. I also try and judge the facts in context. The fact that Universities and other organizations employ 
me or have me on their boards, or invite me to meetings is because they value my contributions and my actions. 
The items you list are false or distorted. Item 1 refers to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in 2006 where 
we mutually decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be appropriate, and there 
were respectful and platonic encounters afterwards. There is nothing to comment on in item 3, which involves 
an anonymous 3rd party claim because I know nothing about it, there are no details provided, and it clearly was 
not taken seriously enough to result in any university action. Item 4 is confusing. Are you saying that because I 
decided I didn't want to go out to a bar with a group of attendees that I was harassing them? The second part 
did not happen. Re incident 5: The 'female companion' in this case is my wife, who can attest to the fact that 
the claim is false, which is what I wrote at the time in response to the blog in question, causing it to be taken 
down. 
It is worth responding to Item 2 and 6 in more detail, 
Re item 2: the student in question was interested in science communication, and on dozens of occasions came 
to me or wrote to me with questions. When she asked about advice for after graduation I DID tell her she was 
different than the other students in her year. The rest of them were interested in going on to graduate school, 
but she was interested in science communication so I told her that she might want to take a different path. Since 
she was the only woman in her year, as I recall, I did ask her on one of these occasions if that made it difficult 
for her in any way. I asked, because as a faculty member I was interested in knowing what we could do, if 
necessary to encourage more women to go into physics, and also because as someone she had asked for career 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031246 
advice from I wanted to know if that made a difference to her. Re asking her for dinner.. I have gone back over 
emails from that period. I have numerous requests from her asking me to go for coffee to talk, which I usually 
had to turn down because I was busy, and on several occasions sh specifically asked me to have coffee with her 
off campus to talk, and I politely declined. I did let her accompany me off campus one time to watch me do a 
BBC interview because she specifically requested it. I did and do have coffee and meals with students on 
campus, and I see nothing wrong with this. I try to treat even students as respected colleagues if possible. I was 
shocked when I later learned of the complaint she was apparently asked to lodge to the University, not least 
because there was no inappropriate interaction and also because, well after the dates you listed on which she 
was apparently offended, she continued to email me with joking questions or comments. Also, at a later AAAS 
conference, again in 2008, for which she had asked, and for which I had written her a letter of recommendation 
to attend, my wife and I gave her a lift in our taxi well out out of our way in order to drop her off at her hotel, 
and I note in an email response to her email about the conference, agin in 2008, I expressed that I would pass 
her regards along to my wife and vice versa. When the University later informed me of the complaint I was 
shocked and concerned. When I spoke to the human resources person, including relating my concerns and 
providing the emails in question, I was told that no formal complaint of sexual harassment was deemed at that 
time to be called for, and that the young woman in question had agreed to that. By that time I learned of the 
complaint I had already announced my intentions to leave Case to accept an offer at ASU—a very difficult 
decision for me because of my long-standing attachment to the University, and the excellent relations I had with 
my colleagues there, both among the faculty and among the administration. Because I was already in Arizona 
at the time I was asked not to have any further interaction with the student I agreed to that request, both to 
respect her sensitivities and also because it was basically moot because I was not on campus. I was also told 
that because it was being handled informally, that (a) it should remain confidential, which I, at least abided by, 
and (b) if no further complaints were lodged in that case, that the University would remove the complaint from 
my record after 5 years, which makes me surprised that someone violated that written agreement with you. 
Re item 6: You report on ASU's response to item #6 , without including the fact that the University specifically 
stated there were never any allegations of sexual misconduct or harassment by me at the University, and 
morever the outside complaints were in fact related specifically to your item #6. Further you neglect to 
mention that this complaint was by an anonymous third party, not the individual who was allegedly harassed, 
who never lodged a complain, and that no specific evidence was provided of the alleged transgression. I was 
surprised and dismayed that both ASU and ANU launched investigations on the basis of this but was told by 
both Universities that because of my high profile even such unsubstantiated third party complaints at private 
events unrelated to the University would be investigated. The complaint was investigated throughly by both 
ASU and ANU and both came to the conclusion that it was not credible and no university policies had been 
violated.. In addition ANU's investigation, which took a full month found significant inconsistencies in the 
allegation, suggesting distortion and fabrication, I will quote from the ANU report. The initial complaint, which 
in fact resulted in a temporary suspension of my position at ANU, until it was dismissed, outlined the claim you 
made in the words you quoted in your note to me, but it also stated 
It is the University's understanding that a complaint was lodged directly to the conference organisers at the 
time of the incident. 
After the month-long investigation, during which I was told I was not to interact with anyone on campus (again 
moot because I was a hemisphere removed) the final report absolved me of any wrongdoing, and indicated 
information inconsistent with the original claim and apparent later claims as follows in the report, from which I 
quote: 
The allegations were made by an observer to the incident. 
- The complaint did not identify, nor disclose the identity of the conference attendee who was allegedly touched 
in 
an unwelcome manner. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031247 
- The conference attendee who took the `selfie' photo did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference 
organisers 
at the time of the incident (November 2016). 
- The conference attendee who witnessed the incident, did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference 
organisers 
at the time of the incident (November 2016). 
The photo submitted as part of the complaint does not provide evidence of any physical contact. 
- The complainant alleged that a photo exists, showing your hand on the breast of the conference attendee who 
took 
the `selfie' photo. This photo was not made available to the Australian National University, although it was 
requested 
in the course of the investigation. 
(And for the record I often put my hand up in front of a camera if there is a flash, as I specifically request selfies 
not to include flashes, so that I don't end up with a series bright spots in front of my eyes for the next half hour) 
What makes this particular type of allegation so repugnant is that I get asked for literally thousands of selfies, 
and when people come up to me they are vulnerable, often shaking, and sometimes overly aggressive. I am 
particularly proud of the way I attempt to make all people feel at ease, and respected, rather than humiliated. 
Thus, this false claim strikes at the heart of what I am about, which is to acknowledge fans in a way that makes 
them feel appreciated. As I understand you had a reporter watching me sign books and take selfies at the CFI 
conference in Las Vegas this year, that behavior is what they will have witnessed. Moreover, I am proud of the 
interactions I have had at both Case and ASU, with students, colleagues and staff of all genders and 
ethnicities. I have worked hard to support them, mentor them, and treat them with respect. I treat others as 
responsible adults, and I expect to be treated equally.

Subject: URGENT: BuzzFeed News inquiry re allegations of sexual harassment 
Date: December 10, 2017 at 5:12:27 PM PST 
To 
Dr. Krauss: 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031250 
As you know, I'm a reporter for BuzzFeed News who has been investigating sexual misconduct allegations 
against you. As we've already discussed by email, I'd very much like to interview you about these allegations in 
detail. 
In particular, you stated in an email sent on Nov 13 that two universities had investigated an incident (# 6 
below). You claimed that both Universities independently concluded that the report was unsubstantiated and 
fabricated with malicious intent. We are not aware that either university concluded fabrication or malicious 
intent, so if you have evidence to support this assertion, we would like to see and discuss it. 
The story concerns your actions towards students while a professor of physics at Case Western Reserve 
University, as well as your conduct in non-academic settings as a prominent figure in the skeptics movement. I 
am reporting this story along with two of my colleagues on the science desk, Azeen Ghorayshi and Virginia 
Hughes. 
Our story is about several allegations of sexual misconduct dating from 2006 to 2016 (see full details below). 
Our reporting also goes into how the various institutions you have been affiliated with — Case Western, 
Arizona State University, the Australian National University, the New College of the Humanities, and the Center 
for Inquiry, for which you serve as an honorary member of the board of directors — have handled complaints 
and concerns about your behavior during this time. 
Our story is corroborated by emails, university documents, official complaints, testimony from victims and 
eyewitnesses, and interviews with more than two dozen of your current and former academic colleagues, 
students, and peers in the skeptics movement. 
I wanted to offer you the opportunity to comment and/or respond to the main facts we plan to publish. If you 
wish to comment on any of the below findings, we need to hear from you as soon as possible. We are 
planning on publishing our story Tuesday morning, Eastern US Time. 
Based on our reporting, this is what we plan to publish: 
Incident 1: 
• In November of 2006, at an event launching the new Center for Inquiry in Washington D.C., you met a 
volunteer for CFI D.C. 
• At the event, you asked for her business card. Later, you followed her as she was leaving and asked 
her if she was of age. 
• Later, you emailed her to invite her to dinner. 
• You planned to dine with her in the restaurant at the Washington D.C. hotel where you were staying. 
• You told her to come up to your room first because you needed to finish some work. 
• In your hotel room, you seemed in no rush to leave. You ordered a cheese plate, and later champagne, 
despite her suggestion that you go down to dinner. 
• You then made a comment about her eye makeup, getting very close to her face. 
• You then lifted her by her arms, and pushed her onto the bed beneath you, forcibly kissing her and 
trying to pull down the crotch of her tights. 
• She struggled to push you off her. 
• You said, When I was in college I could never get a girl that looked like you. 
• When you pulled out a condom, she got out from under you. She said I have to go, and rushed out of 
the room. 
Incident 2: 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031251 
• In an incident that occurred in fall of 2007 while you were a physics professor at Case Western Reserve 
University, a student tried to talk to you about her plans after graduation. You mentioned to her how tough it 
must be to have all the other physics majors asking her out on dates. 
• In a second incident in December of 2007, while you were still at Case Western, the same student 
visited your office to interview you for a student science journal. You closed the door behind her, and ignored 
the questions she had prepared. Then you made a casual comment about taking her out for dinner. 
• Later, in a regular column for the school paper, she described her experiences with you, without 
mentioning you by name. There was even one particular creep of a professor who once told me he thought 
differently of me compared to other students and asked me to dinner: a situation so disturbing that it left me 
upset for weeks afterward, she wrote. 
• She was then approached by a dean at the university, who suspected that she was referring to you, 
based on a previously reported incident with another student. He encouraged her to make a complaint, and 
she did. 
• University investigators interviewed both you and the student. 
• On September 4, 2008, Susan Nickel-Schindewolf, the university's associate vice president for student 
affairs, wrote to the student, telling her that the investigation was complete. She wrote that you had been told: 
This type of behavior could constitute sexual harassment in violation of the university's sexual harassment 
policy. 
• The letter also stated that you were prohibited from making contact with the student as long as she 
remained at Case. 
• The letter also stated that you are required to get approval from the dean or the chair of the physics 
department before setting foot on the campus again. 
• The letter also stated, Dr. Krauss expressed regret about having a negative impact on you, and also 
his willingness to use this complaint as an opportunity to reflect and improve on his future interactions with 
students. 
• By then, you had already left Case, taking up your current position at Arizona State University the 
month before. 
• The opportunities being offered at ASU are simply too great to turn down at this stage in my career, 
you told Case colleagues, in an email announcing your departure on April 16, 2008. 
Incident 3: 
• A former Case Western physics department administrator confirmed that she had reported a previous 
incident involving a student who had confided in her about your inappropriate behavior towards her. 
Incident 4: 
• You met a student from another university, an atheist activist, in March 2008 at the American Atheists 
Convention in Minneapolis. She wanted to expand the atheist group she ran at the midwestern university she 
was attending, and hoped to convince you to come and speak. You initially seemed enthusiastic. 
• During the convention, attendees including you and Richard Dawkins went for dinner with the student 
and volunteers for Dawkins' foundation. 
• Afterwards, the student invited you to join the volunteers for a drink. 
• You asked her to come get you in your hotel room. She was wary of your intentions, and so brought a 
male friend with her. Opening the door to find them both there, you informed her you had decided not to go. 
• You met this student again at the American Atheists Convention in Des Moines, Iowa, in April 2011. 
•

You pulled over a chair for her in the bar, and then started running your hand up her leg under the 
• She tried to shift her body away from you, and you persisted in putting your hand on her leg. She 
crossed her legs, and you kept trying. Then she turned her entire body away. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031252 
Incident 5: 
• This incident allegedly occurred on in May 2011 on a CFI cruise. We understand that CFI staff were 
informed that you had propositioned a female cruise-goer, who rejected an invitation to join you and your 
female companion for sex in your cabin. 
• At least two CFI staffers were sufficiently concerned about reports of your behavior that they urged 
CFI's president not to invite you on a 2014 cruise of the Galapagos Islands. You were invited on that cruise, 
however. 
Incident 6: 
• During a visit to Melbourne, Australia, in November 2016, you were accused of sexual misconduct once 
again. 
• The incident happened at a dinner held at the Melbourne Zoo as part of the Australian Skeptics  
National Convention, where you were a featured speaker. 
• With conference delegates chatting over drinks, a woman asked you for a celebrity selfie. 
• As the woman held out her phone to take the picture, you reached over her shoulder and grabbed her 
right breast. 
• She immediately reacted, bodychecking you and spinning around. Don't do that, she said. 
• BuzzFeed News has seen the complaint made by another woman to ASU, ANU, and the New College 
of the Humanities in London, including the selfie, her face obscured to conceal her identity. It shows your hand 
in motion as a blur in front of her shoulder, apparently moving toward her chest. Two other eyewitnesses have 
confirmed the complainant's account of what happened. 
• In April 2017, the complainant described the incident on her blog. After hearing more about your 
reputation for inappropriate behavior from blog readers, she decided to file a complaint about the Nov. 2016 
incident. 
• On July 16, she filed formal complaints with Arizona State University, and with the Australian National 
University in Canberra and the New College of the Humanities in London, where you have visiting 
appointments. 
• Both Arizona State and the Australian National University told her they would look into the matter. But 
neither university found against you. 
• Based on the material available to the University, we do not have sufficient evidence to substantiate 
the allegations, Kiaran Kirk, dean of the College of Science at the Australian National University, wrote to her. 
• Erin Ellison, who heads Arizona State's Office of Equity & Inclusion, wrote to her explaining that an 
inquiry did not find a violation of university policy. 
• In October, Arizona State denied a request from BuzzFeed News for documents relating to complaints 
of sexual harassment against you. However, Cynthia Jewett, the university's senior associate general counsel, 
noted that two individuals, neither affiliated with the university, had complained about you. The University did 
not find either communication to state a credible allegation, Jewett wrote. 
Miscellaneous facts: 
• In 2008, you founded the Origins Project at Arizona State University in Tempe, a multidisciplinary effort 
to understand the origins of the universe, life, and social systems. You have led that effort ever since. 
• Thanks to best-selling books like The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe From Nothing, frequent 
essays in publications including the New Yorker and the New York Times, and the documentary you made with 
biologist Richard Dawkins, called The Unbelievers, you are celebrated as one of America's leading public 
intellectuals. 
• You served on the science policy committee for Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign and are a 
vocal critic of President Donald Trump. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031253 
• You also make regular public appearances across the world, often at gatherings of skeptics and 
atheists. 
• At CSICon in Las Vegas in October, a few dozen fans paid $500 per head to attend a VIP luncheon 
with you and Dawkins. 
• Many more lined up to get you to sign their copy of your latest book, The Greatest Story Ever Told — 
So Far. 
• Online, people can buy T-shirts emblazoned Lawrence Krauss for President. 
• In talks and interviews, you have argued that our universe arose without divine intervention, that 
religion drives xenophobia, and that our brains are hardwired to believe. 
• You have stated that science provides answers to many of life's biggest questions, and can even fix 
great societal injustices. 
• Earlier this year, at a Q&A event to promote your new book, the conversation came around to the 
dearth of women and minorities in science. Science itself overcomes misogyny and prejudice and bias, you 
said. It's built in: Questioning yourself, always questioning results, questioning others, relying on empirical 
evidence. 
• You have clashed with some skeptics over your defense of Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire financier who in 
2008 was convicted for soliciting prostitution from underage girls, and spent 13 months in a Florida jail. 
• Through his private foundation, Epstein has funded the work of several prominent scientists. He has 
provided funding for your Origins Project, supporting lectureship and scholarship programs, most recently 
pledging $100,000 in 2014. 
• In April 2011, you told the Daily Beast: As a scientist I always judge things on empirical evidence and 
he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I've never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my 
presumption is that whatever the problems were I would believe him over other people. 
• In a blog comment about the Epstein controversy, you wrote: I remain skeptical, and I support a man 
whose character I believe I know.. .If you want to condemn me for that, so be it. 
• You were made an honorary member of CFI's board of directors in December 2011. 
• A blog post published in August 2013 described incidents #1 and #4, naming you. Another post, 
published at around the same time, described incident #5. 
• The first post was edited to remove your name after you had commented that the allegations of assault 
were potentially illegal. The second post was quickly taken down. 
Again, if you wish to comment on or clarify any of these points, please get in touch with us as soon as possible. 
If I do not respond immediately it is because I am on another call, so please leave the best phone number to 
reach you.

All calls received after hours, will be answered by the COO / Director and / or Supervisor and
immediately ran by the two of them if it cannot be scheduled.

A billing / collection Director will handle all billing. This employee will be paid a salary and a
percentage of the daily collections with accurate billings. This will be the driving incentive to do
a superior job and keep the revenues high.

Public Relations / Advertising

Through research, it has been recognized many organizations fail to realize that there are three (3)
customers in this business. The customer that rides on the stretcher deservers friendly and efficient
service. The second customer is the facility requesting patient transport. The third customers are
the staff that transports the clients in a timely, professional and courteous atmosphere. These
customers deserve prompt quality service as well as friendly and efficient service.

It has been found through research, that the company that makes public relations Priority One has
been very successful. With the healthcare profession being a tight circle of professionals, the word
will quickly spread of the fast, friendly, and efficient service that is being provided. Once this
reputation is established, and maintained, the advertising will be a part of each associates daily
activities and duties.

Twin City Mobile Integrated Health Services will also align itself with organizations, whose
clients will utilize our service. Such organizations would be local Hospice, Rehabilitation, Casino,
Hotels, Cruise Lines and Retirement Groups. The company would also be joining other
professional organizations such as the Chamber of Commerce, American Ambulance Association,
National Association of EMTs and Rotary Club.

Twin City Mobile Integrated Health Services will also provide Community paramedicine (CP)
which is an emerging healthcare profession. It allows paramedics and emergency medical
technicians (EMTs) to operate in expanded roles to provide healthcare services to underserved
populations. It is a way to improve rural emergency medical services (EMS) as well as address the
healthcare needs of the community.

Some rural patients lack access to primary care, and misuse 911 services in an attempt to access
emergency departments for routine healthcare. This is demanding on EMS personnel in rural areas
and causes strains on the workforce. Working in a primary care role, our community paramedics
can meet the needs of such individuals, as well as others in the community, in a more efficient and
proactive way.

strong jawline.

He’s never been a drinker. He doesn’t smoke or take drugs,
and he takes care good care of his body as well as his mind.

Its a magnificent mind. His gift is for numbers: complex calcu-
lations, abstract formulas. Even as a child, Jeffrey could untangle
math problems that would stump most smart adults. Numbers just
fall into place for him, forming in ranks he can bend, twist,
manipulate—and multiply. He could have been a scientist or a
mathematician. As a young man, he taught calculus and physics.
Then he became an investor—a very rich man. Then he became a
philanthropist, like Bill Gates. His love for science has inspired him
to give millions to academics and institutions committed to study-
ing mysteries of the brain and the arcana of physics. He's given mil-
lions to Harvard. And he’s given money to politicians: Governor
Eliot Spitzer, of New York, and Governor Bill Richardson, of New
Mexico, where Epstein owns the largest home in the state.

Epstein’s flown Bill Clinton to Africa on a private jet—not
the Gulfstream he owns but his Boeing 727, customized with its
own trading floor—so that the former president could promote
his various and worthy causes.

Just for fun, Chris Tucker, the comedian, and Clinton’s pal
Kevin Spacey had tagged along for the ride.

“Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a committed
philanthropist with a keen sense of global markets and an
in-depth knowledge of twenty-first-century science,” Clinton
would say through a spokesperson. “I especially appreciated his
insights and generosity during the recent trip to Africa to work
on democratization, empowering the poor, citizen service, and
combating HIV/AIDS.”

Von Neumann and Turing posed their questions as theoretical studies, because it
was beyond the technology of their day to realize them. But with the convergence of
communication and computation with fabrication, these investigations are now becoming
accessible experimentally. Making an assembler that can assemble itself from the parts
that it’s assembling is a focus of my lab, along with collaborations to develop synthetic
cells.

The prospect of physically self-reproducing automata is potentially much scarier
than fears of out-of-control AI, because it moves the intelligence out here to where we
live. It could be a roadmap leading to Terminator’s Skynet robotic overlords. But it’s
also a more hopeful prospect, because an ability to program atoms as well as bits enables
designs to be shared globally while locally producing things like energy, food, and
shelter—all of these are emerging as exciting early applications of digital fabrication.
Wiener worried about the future of work, but he didn’t question implicit assumptions
about the nature of work which are challenged when consumption can be replaced by
creation.

History suggests that neither utopian nor dystopian scenarios prevail; we
generally end up muddling along somewhere in between. But history also suggests that
we don’t have to wait on history. Gordon Moore in 1965 was able to use five years of the
doubling of the specifications of integrated circuits to project what turned out to be fifty
years of exponential improvements in digital technologies. We’ve spent many of those
years responding to, rather than anticipating, its implications. We have more data
available now than Gordon Moore did to project fifty years of doubling the performance
of digital fabrication. With the benefit of hindsight, it should be possible to avoid the
excesses of digital computing and communications this time around, and, from the outset,
address issues like access and literacy.

If the maker movement is the harbinger of a third digital revolution, the success of
AI in meeting many of its own early goals can be seen as the crowning achievement of
the first two digital revolutions. Although machine making and machine thinking might
appear to be unrelated trends, they lie in each other’s futures. The same scaling trends
that have made AI possible suggest that the current mania is a phase that will pass, to be
followed by something even more significant: the merging of artificial and natural
intelligence.

It was an advance for atoms to form molecules, molecules to form organelles,
organelles to form cells, cells to form organs, organs to form organisms, organisms to
form families, families to form societies, and societies to form civilizations. This grand
evolutionary loop can now be closed, with atoms arranging bits arranging atoms.

The Question of When

The NSA was actually concerned back in the time of the crypto-
wars with improving American security. Nowadays, we see that
their priority is weakening our security.

—EDWARD SNOWDEN, Moscow, 2015

N HIS 1974 NOVEL, Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, John Le Carré

helped establish the concept in the public imagination of a mole
burrowing into a rival intelligence service. Le Carré’s now-classic
mole, code-named Gerald by the KGB, managed in the novel to gain
access to the inner sanctum of the British intelligence service MI6.
Aided and guided by his controllers in Moscow, he systematically
stole British intelligence secrets. As Le Carré wove the plot, the bril-
liantly orchestrated operation involved spotting, compromising, and
recruiting others to gradually advance Gerald the mole to a position
of power. Such well-organized penetrations are not limited to fiction.
The career of the KGB mole Heinz Felfe, who was advanced through
the ranks of West German intelligence by an elaborate series of sac-
rifices by his controllers in Moscow until he actually headed West
German counterintelligence in 1961, could have served as the non-
fiction inspiration for Le Carré’s 1963 novel, The Spy Who Came
in from the Cold. As U.S. intelligence only found out after the Cold
War ended, the KGB also had the ability to sustain moles for decades.

four boxes of M; are occupied, the Mz; = rf indicates that all four kinds of

transitions are possible. Since we remain in the context of a 0,1, two state system,
the growth rate of the possible equals the logarithm, base two, of the sum of the
entries in the boxes of the left-top-row to right-bottom-row diagonal called the trace
and Hr = log (1 + 1) = log2(2) = 1. Consistent with intuition, since every transition is
possible, the topological entropy of M; as indicated in its M;; is maximal (= 1).
Another expression equal to the sum of the trace (the sum of the upper left to lower
right diagonal) in a square matrix, is its leading eigenva/ue, most often symbolized
with a lambda, 41. The logarithm of the leading eigenvalue of the transition
incidence matrix is equal to its topological entropy. Symbolically, Hz (Mz) = logz (A1 )
= log2 (2) = 1. Standard elementary linear algebra texts describe how to compute
eigenvalues, these relations and related operations as well as their foundational
theorems.

Before computing the entropy of the distribution of probabilities among the

possibles as the metric entropy, Hy, let us notice again that the occupancies in the

1 3
four entry boxes of the transition matrix M; are not uniform, M; = 3 9° This leads

naturally to the intuition that for this series of binary transitions, Hy, in contrast with
Hy, will not be maximal, i.e. not equal to 1 and the nonuniformity of H; and Hy is a
computational expression of what we mean by a state of in-between entropy. These
entropies are identical and their difference = O for transitions reflecting maximal
entropy, as might be realized in a very long series of fair coin flips in which the
entropies = 1. Entropy will be minimal when flipping a two headed coin, here the
entropies = 0. More compactly, the non-uniform probabilistic, metric entropy,
differing from the maximal topological entropy indicates that the system is in a
dynamical state of in-between entropy, written as H7 - Hy + 0.

In the computation of the metric entropy, Hy, the M; is transformed into a
transition probability matrix, M;p, called a Markov matrix named for one of the two
great Russian mathematicians, both students of Pafnuti Lvovich Chebyshev, the

Markov brothers. The entries of each row in the MM; are transformed into transition

and long lanky legs, but a very sincere smile that instantly made you feel
at ease. He greeted us at the staircase that led into the main cabin. It was
as lavish as [| imagined it would be. The seats were enveloped in the finest
beige leather with polished wood grain finishes and there was a kitchen in
the back with an adjoining toilet. Jeffrey saw the amazement in my eyes
and to make it more thrilling he brought me up to the cockpit and let me
watch with a bird’s eye view of the take off. I was on a natural high when
I came back to the cabin and was instantly brought back down when
Jeffrey rested his bare feet on top of the reclined seat and instructed me to
get to work and start massaging him. My future was in his hands now, so
when he wanted something, | wouldn’t hesitate in giving it to him.

Chapter 6

Upon our arrival at New Jersey’s Private Airstrip, the driver Jo-Jo met
us. His name was most likely shortened for something of his oriental
decent. Jeffrey liked to shorten the names of his multi-cultural staff into
American names. Even Juan and Maria were known as John and Mary.
We arrived in the Upper East Side of Manhattan. His principal place of
residence was the largest home in Manhattan, eight stories of opulence. It
used to be a Private School for boy’s many years ago, until Les Wexner,
Jeffrey’s best friend and mentor bought it for him as a mysterious gift.

There were two large Chinese gargoyles outside the entrance, and
beside the heavy looking wooden doors there was an intercom with a
camera overlooking us. 1 walked up the concrete steps into a realm of
wealth, glamour and most of all influence. My eye’s glistened at the
splendor of his palace. Caramel colored marble tiles spread through the
first floor, where his gourmet kitchen and dining hall were also located.
Then I came to this sweeping staircase that curved into the next level
where Jeffrey and I went into his office, even though it looked more like
a museum exhibit. Ancient draperies that told lascivious stories of their
own covered parts of the elevated walls, and the remaining wall spaces
were taken up by rows on top of rows of books. He loved to read, as he

often found it hard to sleep and was comforted in the early morning hours
with his literature, or sometimes in other ways I would come to find out.
There was a mantle piece and a sofa with two armchairs next to the grand
piano that flaunted more of Jeffrey’s beautiful conquests, young women
posing in salacious pictures, suggesting I could be easily replaced next to
one of those girls if] failed in keeping him satisfied. There were also
some pictures with recognizable political and royal figures either shaking
Jeffrey’s hand, or with an arm around each other, even one with Jeffrey
and the Dali Lama, although his church was the bank. He liked to use his
power, wealth, and money to manipulate everyone in his life.

He made a phone call that sounded business like and I didn’t mind, I
was quite enjoying taking in all of the beauty around me, I was blinded
by all of it. I was still waiting for him when, Ghislane came in. She asked
me what I thought so far of my trip to N.Y.C, | knew she was talking
about the house, she loved to gloat, even though none of it actually
belonged to her, she wanted everyone to believe that it did. I
complimented her on the mid-evil looking tapestries and a few other
adornments, when she cut me off mid-sentence to compliment it herself,
telling me the history about one of the 17 century tapestry’s which to an
unsophisticated eye, looked to me like a rug on the wall.

Jeffrey hung the phone up and walked over to the sofa where we were
sitting next to the mantle piece and took a seat on one of the armchairs.
He didn’t seem worried from the phone call but his mind was definitely
somewhere else from the hard look on his face. We all spoke for a few
moments more about the splendid décor before Jeffrey had enough small
talk and needed some of his own relaxation time. He told Ghislane he
was going to show me to the massage room and he’d be back in a couple
hours. She agreed he looked like he could use some time to unwind and
with that wry grin of hers, she gave me a look that told me precisely how
he was expecting to be relaxed.

We left his office all together, Ghislane going downstairs, and Jeffrey
showing me to the lifts. The lift looked like it’s original that came with
the school. It was made out of brass antique with archaic cuts throughout
the arches at the top. It wasn’t the only lift in the house, but certainly the
most beautiful. We walked down a long hall carpeted in a royal red and
golden trim, passing by a bronze pagan statue of the horny little goat God
“Pan’. How adequate, I thought, fit Jeffrey to a tee. We walked into this
dimly lit room. Another daunting chamber that looked like we had
stepped back in time to the dark ages. It took a second for my eyes to
adjust to the darkness, and Jeffrey beckoned me to follow him through
the room to the open adjoin shower, toilet and steam room. The room was
in black marble to accent the dreariness, and smaller than the one in Palm

Three PLO officials were there, led by Arafat’s closest economic aide, Abu
Ala’a. Though both of the Israelis were friends of Yossi Beilin, a protégé of
Peres and our deputy foreign minister, even Peres didn’t know about the
meeting until Yossi told him the following day. Rabin knew an hour later. I first
learned of it from Uni Saguy, after Unit 8200 intercepted Arabic-language
traffic concerning a briefing the Norwegians had given their Arab contacts. At
first, even Peres was skeptical that the paper agreed at the “seminar” — calling
for international aid to the West Bank and Gaza on the scale of the Marshall
Plan, and an initial Israeli withdrawal limited to Gaza — would lead to serious
negotiations. But Rabin authorized follow-up sessions in mid-February, late
March and again in April. Our intelligence teams continued to provide detail,
and occasional color. Uri Saguy and I even began to use the Arabic shorthand,
from the intelligence reports, for the two Israeli academics. The burly, bearded
Yair Hirschfeld was “the bear”. The slighter Ron Pundak was “the mouse”. Yet
the main political impetus in driving the process forward came from two men
who were not there: on our side, Yossi Beilin, and for the Palestinians, Arafat’s
trusted diplomatic adviser, and eventual successor, Mahmoud Abbas, or Abu
Mazen.

Since Rabin knew I was following the ostensibly secret talks, we discussed
them often. For quite a while, he remained dismissive. He believed the chances
of a breakthrough were remote. He was also suspicious of the involvement of
Peres and Beilin, whom he called “Shimon’s poodle’. And he deeply distrusted
Arafat. The PLO had been founded with the aim of “liberating” every inch of
Palestine. The fact that Arafat had agreed to the Bush Administration’s demand
to accept the principle of land-for-peace struck Rabin as mere sleight-of-hand.

By the third Oslo meeting, it was clear that the Palestinians were open to an
agreement that would fall well short of “liberating Palestine”. Still, Rabin was
leery. He tried briefly to return the focus to the stalemated Madrid-track talks
with the Palestinians. Yet when, with obvious PLO encouragement, the
Palestinian negotiators stood their ground there, he seemed almost resigned to
supporting Oslo. When we discussed it, he used a battlefield metaphor. “When
you have to break through, you don’t necessarily know where you’ll succeed.
You try several places along the enemy’s lines. In the sector of the front where
you do succeed, you send in your other forces.” It was a matter of “reinforcing
success.”

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024453.txt,"Education is one of the largest sectors in the world, representing approximately 5% of global gross
national income of $48 trillion.* In 2005 in the U.S. alone, education was a $1 trillion market.” Education
is still predominantly provided by public / governmental eniities in most countries including the U.S. KUE
believes that the industry will converge towards a more balanced public / private system, similar to the
evolution observed in the 20th century in other major industries such as healthcare, infrastructure and
telecommunications.

The Company's strategy is to grow its existing platforms both damestically and internationally and to
expand its assets globally across the pre-K-12 education continuum. In addition to its current investments
in ECE and online curriculum, KUE will seek to expand by acquiring education companies offering
services or products that can complement its current offering. KUE believes that owning a diversified
porticlio of assets in the pre-K-12 education space will allow it to leverage content and best practices
across multiple constituencies and to multiple markets. KUE’s strategy in U.S. ECE is to expand its
existing platform through the opening of new centers, opportunistic acquisitions of smaller competitors
and the sale of education-related products and services through existing channels. Internationally, KUE
has identified several near-term opportunities fo expand into Europe, the Middle-East and Asia, with some
of these opportunities in advanced stages of preparation.

Management has a history of successfully growing through acquisitions. In May 2003, KLC acquired
Aramark Educational Resources (AER), a company three times its size in terms of revenue.
Management completed the integration of AER in approximately 12 months, realizing approximately $10
million in net annual synergies and improving operational performance. In January 2005, the Company
acquired KinderCare, the largest provider of ECE services in the U.S. at the time. Management achieved
approximately $25 million in net annualized synergies through the closing of under-performing centers
and the rationalization cf corporate overhead. In November 2005, KLC separated its education
operations (KLC OpCo) from its real estate assets (KLC PropCo}. Management believes this division
allows KLC OpCo management fo focus on the core business of operating and growing the ECE
business while the maximization of the valuable educational real estate portfolio is managed and
expanded by a professional real estate firm, Greenstreet Real Estate Partners (formerly Greenstreet
Realty Partners, L.P.}, and also represents management's view of KLC’s component businesses.

Management believes that KUE presents an attractive financial profile with its combination of businesses:
{i} KLC OpCo, which generated $1.48 billion in pro forma revenue and $150 million in pro forma Adjusted
EBITDA’ in 2005, is projected to grow organically to $2.3 billion and $320 million by 2011, respectively
and to generate operating cash flow growing from $72 million in 2005 to $214 million in 2011; (i) a real
estate portfolio in KLC PropCo that generated an additional $88 million in pro forma EBITDA in 2005; and
(iii) an investment in k12, which continues to deliver top line growth in excess of 25% and has seen its
revenue grow at a 133% compounded annual growth rate over the last three fiscal years (from $6.7
million in 2002 to $85.1 million in 2005).

Epstein and the Government owed them CVRA duties), especially considering that the details
involve non-parties who are not related to the respondent Government.” DE 324 at 5 (emphasis
in original). While Judge Marra struck those allegations, he emphasized that “Jane Doe 3 is free
to reassert these factual details through proper evidentiary proof, should [the victims]
demonstrate a good faith basis for believing that such details are pertinent to a matter presented
for the Court’s consideration. Judge Marra then denied Ms. Giuffre’s motion to join the case,
but allowed her to participate as trial witness: “The necessary ‘participation’ of [Ms. Giuffre] . . .
in this case can be satisfied by offering . . . properly supported — and relevant, admissible, and
non-cumulative — testimony as needed, whether through testimony at trial . . . or affidavits
supported in support [of] the relevancy of discovery requests.” DE 324 at 8 (emphasis
deleted). In a supplemental order, Judge Marra stated that the victims “may re-refile these
documents omitting the stricken portions.” DE 325. The victims have recently refiled the
documents.

In light of this history, Dershowitz is flatly incorrect when he asserts that “Judge Marra’s
Order appropriately precludes the unredacted documents from being re-filed in this case on the
public docket.” Confidentiality Motion at 3. To the contrary, the Order specifically permits
factual details about Dershowitz’s sexual abuse of Ms. Giuffre to be presented in regard to
pertinent matters in the federal CVRA case. And certainly nothing in Judge Marra’s Order could
render those documents confidential in this state defamation case, where the central issues swirl
around Edwards and Cassell’s good faith basis for filing the allegations. Indeed, the order is not

binding in any way in this case, because it is res judicata only as to Ms. Giuffre (the moving

Israel. Likewise, Hizballah would expect Iran to assist it and any
conflict with Israel. Either case could eventually involve Syria.
Hizballah can now strike targets throughout Israel. Its missiles and
rockets are also accurate enough to hit military installations and other
important facilities, and it can fire as many as 500—600 per day.
Hizballah also has the ability to conduct terrorist or special
operations against civilian, military and infrastructure targets outside
the immediate theater of war. Sheikh Nasrallah has plausibly
threatened to attack shipping in the eastern Mediterranean in the
event of a conflict with Israel.12 If Hizballah were to gain access to
Syria’s P-800 Yakhont supersonic cruise missile system—a distinct
possibility—it could potentially strike targets as distant as 300
kilometers from the Lebanese coast.

Syrian military forces are optimized and deployed for war with Israel,
so it would have only a limited ability to directly assist Iran in a
conflict with the United States. Syria’s missile systems could target
military sites, logistics facilities and airfields in Israel. Syria’s
Yakhont coastal defense cruise missile system gives it an enhanced
capability to threaten naval and merchant vessels in the eastern
Mediterranean.

Hamas is also part of this threat environment, although its offensive
and defensive capabilities are much more limited than Hizballah’s.
Hamas’s offensive capabilities rest on mortars and rockets of
gradually increasing range, bringing more of central and southern
Israel under threat with every upgrade. Hamas can now reach central
Tel Aviv and beyond Beersheba in southern Israel.

Iran will likely supplement this proxy war by exploiting “images of
victory’—such as sinking a U.S. naval unit or displaying U.S.
casualties and prisoners to undermine support for the U.S. action and
bolster its own supporters.

I persuaded the local ACLU chapter to become involved but I, and my research assistant Joel
Klein, took the lead in defending Franklin.

Word quickly spread around the Stanford campus that I had gotten the ACLU into the case. I
was criticized for my intrusion into the affairs of my host university. President Lyman went on
the radio to attack me:

It is a myth that all speech is constitutionally protected. No constitutional lawyer in the
land—no, not even Mr. Dershowitz, the Harvard law professor come to Stanford to save
us all from sin—not even Mr. Dershowitz could make such a sweeping claim.

I responded with my own statement in the Stanford Daily:

There are important civil liberties issues at stake in the Franklin firing. If Dr. Lyman
wants to challenge my view of the Constitution or civil liberties—and those of the
ACLU—I invite that challenge, on its merits.

Lyman rejected my invitation to debate and continued to attack me—both personally and through
his surrogates—in highly personal terms. The hostility toward me and toward the ACLU spread
quickly among the established faculty. Not surprisingly, it soon reached the Faculty Committee
that was considering the Franklin case.

We filed a brief on behalf of the ACLU urging Stanford, which is a private university, to apply the
spirit of the First Amendment to Franklin’s case. The committee agreed and said they were
applying First Amendment standards, but it ruled, in a divided vote, that Franklin’s speeches
violated those standards. They found that he “did intentionally write and urge” students and other
to “occupy the computation center illegally,” to “disobey the order to disperse” and to “engage in
conduct which would disrupt activities of the university and threaten injury to individuals and
property.”

Following the Franklin firing I gave a lecture on the implications of the case. I predicted that
Franklin himself would soon be forgotten because his message would be rejected in the free
marketplace of ideas. But the Committee’s decision would be long remembered as a leading
precedent in the jurisprudence of universities.

I concluded my lecture by pointing an accusing finger at some of the faculty who pretended that
the Franklin case raised no important civil liberties issues:

How often have I heard the absurd remark that Franklin is being fired for what he “did,”
not for what he “said,” without a recognition that this quibble doesn’t’ hide the fact what
he “did” was to make speeches. How often I have heard the statement that this case does
not involve “academic freedom,” it is simply an employer firing an employee for
disloyalty—as if a requirement of loyalty and academic freedom were compatible. [T]he
true test of a genuine civil libertarian is how he responds to a crisis close at hand.

Masri rejects the notion that he abetting a

Penrose Steps

Optical Illusions

This picture is an illusion that plays with your stereoscopic synthesis. The
dots appears to flip between black and white. Other illusions play with
depth perception. The Penrose Steps are a type of illusion that tries to
build an impossible physical model in our cerebral cortex. The brain sees
perspective and depth perception cues, but the resulting shape could
never exist.

Hearing
Unlike sight, hearing is an absolute sense. Our ears capture and focus
sound down to the eardrum where a set of small hairs called cilia convert
it into electrical impulses. The impulses stimulate cells corresponding to
specific pitches.

We are born with perfect pitch, yet most of us lose it early on. When
I hear Maria Carey sing a top B flat a specific set of neurons located near
the ear fires, and if she sings a top ‘A then a different clump of neurons
are stimulated. By the time most children come to learn music they have
edited out this absolute pitch information. One group of children who
do not lose the ability are Chinese pianists. Because Chinese is a tonal
language — where the pitch of words affects their meaning — and because

or no one that couldn’t be bought in his eyes. Behind the two of them
followed a destructive trail of those in their path that were misused,
violated, degraded in a variety of ways for one purpose... to satisfy the
desires of the perversion that rotted their hearts.

The next couple of months I spent in Jeffrey’s company, my life was
revolved around him and his petty happiness. Arising to the occasion, I
was no longer his teenage sidekick, I was growing into being a young
woman and my body was blossoming like never before. Out of the
awkward stages of my life, 1 now took to looking after myself like never
before. Regular sessions in tanning beds and keeping fit became my life
outside of Jeffrey. He kept telling me what a beautiful woman I was
developing into and would offer suggestions to help me look good.
Sending me to dentists for regular teeth whitening consultations or
helping me choose my attire for the evening, he was ushering me into a
whole new position, training me up for something else, but I was unsure
of what that was.

Being a snotty little teenager was a girl of the past. Now I had to be his
eloquent speaking, desirable to all and almost his personal porcelain doll.
I went everywhere with him again, all of his eclectic dinner parties,
conferences, and meetings with various members of parliament, famous
celebrities, and other esteemed billionaires...most of whom lived by the
same rule of thumb as Jeffrey did. Quite an alarming realization having to
accept this world the way it is. Jeffrey knew all of the right people in this
game, and trading girls for favors is how he kept in the circle. He was at
the center of it all, blackmail being the only thing next to money with the
ability to pull a many of strings, his conniving ulterior motive was to drag
all that he could down to his pitiful state of mind. Inviting easily tempted
acquaintances to his island or his other various residences he would bring
out the assortment of young girls and pass them around like they were
cocktails on a platter. No girl had a choice in whom they went with, only
completing a task, we would have to charm and bedazzle these ageing fat
men who other than paying for it would’ve never had a shot at getting to
know a beautiful girl intimately. I personally belonging to Jeffrey rarely
had to be loaned out and it was a big occasion, or should I say favor, if]
was. I’ll never really know what made me so important or special to
Jeffrey, it definitely had nothing to do with love. I guess in the end I will
always put it down to my capability of being whomever he wanted when
he wanted, so compliant it just made it easy for him to have a personal
toy at his constant disposal. All I can say is I lived in a jail with no bars,
and in a country where slavery was supposedly abolished a long time ago
but still existed right underneath everybody’s noses. Myself and so many
other girls were walking proof of it.

I still was given proper training in massage therapy from time to time,
keeping me from looking back at being a teenager with no responsibilities
to being a young adult with prospering titles. He knew I wanted to be self-
sufficient so bad I would do anything for it and by giving me this dream
to hold to only kept me in check. I looked forward to my training
sessions, holding onto every word passed down to me and after the
session was complete I would hurry back to my room and transfer the
information into a workbook with associating exercises.

Trying my new moves on Jeffrey always impressed him, he would get
excited hearing about my passion for knowledge and would tell me he
could see it transfer into my massages, always giving it my all, my hands
were a focused energy when I was at work. Using every ounce of strength
to apply on a body, many were astounded in what I could do for being
such a small girl, and Jeffrey loved it, using me for a two-hour massage
“with benefits” sometimes being over twice a day. Ghislane would
sometimes use me to massage her still but it wasn’t as common, she
preferred a man for that job.

Then would come the odd client here and there, of course set up by
Jeffrey. Most of which were orchestrated to get beautiful girls
comfortable and consequently naked then he would go in for the kill, so
to speak, touching them intimately, in their most private of places like
their vagina, breasts or anal. When he had us where he wanted, willing
and able, then would come the toys, outfits and so on. A scheme he has
used time and time again, telling those who know him well “he had never
been tured down yet”. It was starting to dawn on me how | wasn’t
getting any clientele that weren’t used for Jeffrey’s benefit and would
make me wonder if I just wasn’t good enough for that, but I kept quiet,
never wanting to make waves like I had before.

To give mea break from it all as if Jeffrey didn’t want to overload me
again, he would send me away to his ranch for a few days, what he knew
I considered being a small slice of heaven on earth. I’d spend my days
roaming the hills, riding horses, and enjoying the solitude of my own
company. One afternoon I was out exploring the land on Jeffrey’s ranch
which covered hundred’s of acres with nothing but a bottle of water, my
sketchbook and a small case of oil paint. I was on the search for
something interesting to paint. A great pastime of mine, it made my soul
quiet by creating beauty with my brush. I loved to recreate the images T
saw on paper. I would paint anything beautiful that caught me eyes
interest, from underwater scenes, animals to people and even fruit, [ loved
vibrant colors and emotion on display but my favorite soon became the
landscape of the Santa Fe’s rolling hills and earthly green and beige tones
and in certain light it would illuminate into a golden shine. To grasp that

The 7.8% intraday peak-to-trough decline in US equities between September 21st and October 11th
has rattled investor confidence. Numerous headlines of stock market “carnage” have further eroded
their confidence. As a result, some of our clients have asked whether this drop signifies the beginning
of the end of a nearly 10-year bull market.
We do not think so. So far, this pullback is actually smaller than the two prior downdrafts we
experienced in late January and in mid-March, neither of which derailed the US economy nor the bull
market. The steady factors we highlighted in our annual Outlook—such as economic growth, benign
inflation, robust earnings, and low probability of recession—have not dissipated. Furthermore, while
the investor focus has shifted to the risks around the unsteady undertow, most of these factors are,
on balance, less concerning today than they were at the beginning of 2018.
Of course, that is not the case across all geopolitical concerns. While trade tensions with Mexico and
1
Canada have abated, those with China have certainly deteriorated and will continue to do so for the
foreseeable future. But, in aggregate, there has been more improvement than deterioration, in our
view.
In this Sunday Night Insight, we will provide a brief update on the steady factors and unsteady
undertow. We then conclude with our view that the steady factors will likely continue to win this tug-ofwar
between the two.
Steady Factors
While the headlines warn of equity market carnage, the facts do not support such alarming headlines.
The S&P 500 is still up 5.1% on a year-to-date total return basis and financial conditions remain at
easier levels today than they did when the Federal Reserve began this tightening cycle in 2015,
despite the recent decline in equities and 0.76 percentage point increase in 10-year Treasury yields
year-to-date. Most importantly, as highlighted by Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell, we are
in “extraordinary times” of steady growth and low inflation.
Economic Growth
Economic growth remains firm in the US. Both the Institute for Supply Management leading indexes
for manufacturing and non-manufacturing remain at very strong levels. Current activity indicators of
real GDP growth average about 3.5% for the third quarter and closer to 4% for the fourth quarter.
Forecasts for third quarter real GDP average 3.8% and fourth quarter forecasts are about 2.8%.
While growth is slowing from the 4.2% estimate of the second quarter, it is still forecast to be above
trend and we believe a modest slowdown is certainly preferable to continued growth at a pace that
was likely unsustainable and possibly even inflationary.
In aggregate, the economic data since the intraday peak of US equities on September 21st does not
point to any worrisome slowdown in GDP growth or the pace of employment. In fact, while the recent
134K increase in non-farm payrolls was less than expectations, revisions to earlier months offset the
modest headline miss and the unemployment rate still fell to 3.7%. Furthermore, this 134k increase
is above the estimated sustainable level of employment growth based on population growth and
changes in labor force participation, which our colleagues in Goldman Investment Research estimate
is around 96k. Importantly, a modest slowdown in the 3-month average of non-farm payrolls, which
currently stands at a very robust 190k jobs, is more likely to keep inflation in check.
Robust Earnings and Buybacks
Continued above-trend economic growth is supporting solid corporate fundamentals. While many are
quick to dismiss this strength to US tax reform, it is only half the story. Earnings before interest and
taxes (EBIT) expanded by a very healthy 12% in the first half of this year and are expected to grow by
double-digits again in the third quarter. This robust organic profit growth is also fueling sizable
corporate buybacks—a key source of equity market support. Our colleagues on the corporate
buyback desk expect the highest dollar amount for buybacks on record in 2018, with $1tn in
authorizations and $850bn in executed buybacks.
2
Total Return (%)
Even so, such robust earnings growth has begun to foster concern that we have reached a peak in
EPS growth. While we do expect the pace of growth to slow next year, a local peak in earnings
growth has not signified an imminent peak in the S&P 500 historically. In fact, about 3/4ths of market
peaks occurred more than two years after the peak in the growth rate of earnings. Moreover, stock
market returns have remained healthy during this period, with high odds of a positive outcome over
the subsequent 6-24 months (see Exhibit 1). In short, the market ultimately follows the path of
earnings and while their growth rate may be slowing, their absolute level is still rising.

Inflation and Interest Rates
Inflation data has remained at relatively low levels for all of 2018, as shown in Exhibits 2 and 3. In
fact, some of the most recent data released in October have ticked slightly lower. Average hourly
earnings dropped to 2.8% from the prior month’s level of 2.9%. Headline CPI dropped to 2.3% from
2.7% and Core CPI ex-food and energy remain at a low 2.2%, unchanged from the prior month. The
Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation indicator, Core PCE, also remains low at 2.0% which is in line
with the Federal Reserve’s target, and unchanged from the prior month.
While 10-year Treasury yields have risen by 0.76% (or 76 basis points) over the course of 2018, we
do not think the resulting 3.2% yield is enough to derail US economic growth. Keep in mind that most
of the recent increase since late August was due to stronger real growth rather than runaway inflation
expectations. We expect interest rates to range between 3.0% and 3.5% in 2019 with a midpoint of
3.25%, barring any major geopolitical conflicts such as one between US and China and or escalating
conflicts in the Middle East.

Of course, the recent backup in interest rates is providing equity investors with another source of
angst. Yet our work suggests there are several reasons why rates could continue to rise before
becoming a material headwind for stocks. First, the 4% trend growth rate of nominal US GDP—
reflecting 2% real growth and 2% inflation—remains comfortably above the 10-year Treasury yield of
4
US 10-Year Treasury Yield (%)
3.2% (i.e. the cost of borrowing). Stocks typically struggle when the cost of borrowing exceeds the
nominal growth of the economy (see Exhibit 4). Second, the recent backup in interest rates was
driven primarily by improving real growth expectations, not higher inflation. This distinction is critical,
because higher rates in response to improving real growth tend to benefit earnings sufficiently to
overcome the downward pressure they place on valuation multiples. Finally, it will take a number of
years before higher rates meaningfully impact aggregate S&P 500 interest expense, considering 91%
of S&P 500 debt is fixed-rate and only 13% matures over the next two years.

The positive trend of leading economic indicators
Low levels of inflation
The continued slow but steady pace of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. We believe that
Federal Reserve Chairman Powell’s recent commentary indicates that the FOMC will continue
to be driven by data and financial market conditions. Their stated goal is to extend this
expansion “indefinitely.” 1 While the Federal Reserve dots point towards four more interest rate
hikes by the end of 2019, we do not think that such hikes materially increase the odds of a
recession in an economy that continues to grow at levels that are generally regarded as above
trend growth in the US.
Recent steepening of the yield curve. We have highlighted two measures of the yield curve as
sign-posts we watch as an early harbinger of a recession. Both have steepened since their
lows, as shown in Exhibits 5 and 6.

Unsteady Undertow
As market observers attempt to explain the recent drop in US equities, the risks of geopolitical factors
have garnered considerable attention. Potential US retaliation over the recent disappearance of a
Saudi journalist has only added fuel to the fire of worries given the risk that oil exports could be used
as a political weapon in a world with tighter oil supply thanks to impending US sanctions on Iran.
As we review the geopolitical developments of 2018, it is clear that some of the risks have abated
while others have increased. With the exception of a significant spike in oil prices due to the impact of
sanctions on Iran or any escalation in US-Saudi tensions, we believe that the net impact of these
shifts is not material enough to derail the US economic expansion or bull market.
Risks that have abated
Mexico: the election of the left-of-center populist president (Andrés Manuel Lopes Obrador referred
to as AMLO) has reduced fear of a reversal of recent reforms. While concerns about fiscal profligacy
and reverting to a nationalist energy policy that reduces oil production may reappear, AMLO does not
take office until the end of the year.
Brazil: The strong showing of Jair Bolsonaro, a law-and-order former army captain, in the first round
of elections and the latest data that points to a 75% probability of Bolsonaro becoming the next
president of Brazil has provided a boost to the Brazilian real. His current standing has substantially
reduced the election of another left-wing worker’s party candidate who would keep the status quo in
Brazil.
NAFTA: The agreement on a revised NAFTA deal between the US, Canada, and Mexico on
September 30th meaningfully reduced the risk of the US withdrawal from NAFTA. While the new
agreement, US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), has not been ratified by the Mexican and
Canadian national parliaments nor by the US congress, and a divided congress after the mid-term
elections may lead to some uncertainty, we believe it is likely to be ratified.
US-EU Trade Friction: Tension between the US and European Union eased significantly after a July
2018 deal between European Commission President Juncker and President Trump to “work together
toward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods”. The
coast is not totally clear given the threat of auto tariffs, but we do not anticipate any significant
increase in trade rhetoric in the near future.
Risks that have increased
China: The trade war with China continues to escalate and as we have stated before, we believe that
it cannot be resolved simply by China importing more US goods. The issues range from:
�
�
�
A large and growing trade deficit with China
Industrial policies & unfair trade practices that reduce competition, such as subsidies and
“dumping good at below-market prices”
“Made in China 2025” policies which “harm US companies”

Uneven tariff rates and the banning of some US goods
Intellectual property theft
Forced technology transfer
Strategic US technology acquisitions
Outright cyber theft
Foreign ownership restrictions
Recent headlines that the trade war may be escalating to a cold war are not without merit, as we
believe that US-China relations are changing on a more structural basis and will have a longer-term
impact. On a short-term basis, however, US exposure to China is limited with merchandise exports,
corporate profits and foreign claims at about 1% of GDP. As seen in Exhibit 7, the Chinese equity
markets have also deteriorated much more significantly than US markets in 2018.
Of course, specific stocks with greater exposure to China through higher sales have underperformed
the S&P 500 by about 6% since the latest tariffs were imposed on $200bn of Chinese products, as
shown in Exhibit 8.

Italy: Concerns about Italy have risen to peak levels since the election of a populist government in
May and credit default swaps have increased to reflect these higher risks. The government’s
expansive fiscal plan, with a proposed budget deficit of 2.4% of GDP, may be rejected by the
European Union commission and result in rating downgrades. While the EU is likely to manage this
situation in its usual incremental and reactive way, the possibility of new elections in late 2019
reigniting euro viability questions will keep Italy on our radar screens.
BREXIT: It is hard to know whether Brexit risks are unchanged, higher or lower given the minute by
minute headlines out of the UK. Our base case remains that while the internal politics of the
Conservative party will keep uncertainty at elevated levels and the European Union will not
compromise on its key tenants of free movement of goods, services, and people, the two sides will
agree to a deal that defers the difficult choices on the shape of a final agreement with the EU until late
2020.
The Middle East: Risks in the Middle East have not changed substantially with respect to Iraq, Syria,
or even the impositions of sanctions on Iran. However, the disappearance of the Saudi journalist who
entered the Saudi Embassy in Turkey on October 2 nd has the potential to raise risks to global oil
supply. While there has been a global uproar, it is not yet clear whether the US will impose serious
sanctions or Saudi Arabia would retaliate by reducing oil exports if the US finds sufficient evidence
regarding the alleged killing of the Saudi journalist. The recession in 1973-74 was partly due to the
quadrupling of oil prices due to the Arab Oil Embargo. Later in that decade, the Iranian Revolution
and the Iran-Iraq War also led to a 2.5 times spike in oil prices that, along with Federal Reserve
tightening by then Chairman Paul Volcker, led to a US recession. While we think it is unlikely that
Saudi Arabia would react so aggressively in the face of serious US reprisals, we note that it remains a
real risk.

Cumulative Mutual Fund and ETF Flows ($Bn)
Some Notable Observations
US Equities Have Been Shunned All Along
In both our 2018 Outlook and mid-year update, we highlighted the surprising absence of inflows into
US equities based on flows into mutual funds and Exchange-Traded Funds. As shown in Exhibit 9,
flows into US equities were negative in 2018, even before the recent downdraft. In fact, US equities
have seen outflows of $81 billion through August 2018 (based on the most recent comprehensive
data), while non-US developed equities and emerging market equities have had inflows of $72 billion
and $20 billion respectively. This is further evidence of our view that while sentiment and short term
positioning among speculators and hedge fund managers shifts frequently, more stable investors
have shunned US equities during this long bull market in favor of other developed and emerging
market equities and global bonds.
This steady outflow of assets from US equities has been offset by record levels of stock buybacks by
US companies given high levels of profitability and incremental cash from repatriation of overseas
earnings, as mentioned above.

Some Headwinds Facing the FANGMAN Stocks Will Persist
The basket of FANGMAN (i.e. Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Nvidia)
stocks have dropped across the board from their respective peak price levels, with Facebook’s 29%
decline the largest and Apple’s 4% decline the smallest among the group. Even so, each of the
stocks, with the exception of Facebook, still have positive year-to-date returns and have outperformed
the S&P 500, as shown in Exhibit 10.

This is not a recommendation to buy or sell individual securities but rather an assertion that these
stocks represent a small portion of S&P 500 earnings. Anyone looking to buy or sell single name
equities should consult Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research.

Nevertheless, we believe that some of the headwinds that have plagued this sector will continue.
These include:
�
�
�
Data privacy issues impacting a broad range of companies, including Facebook, Google,
Twitter, Alipay and Tencent.
High likelihood of greater regulatory scrutiny in the US 2 and Europe as policy makers
increasingly believe that these companies will not address “the privacy and security issues of
social media users” 3 on their own.
Increased focus by ESG investors (Environment, Social, and Governance) that many of the
technology and social media companies are falling short on social and governance issues.
While this basket of stocks may or may not lead the market in the future, it is important to note that
they represent only 10% of S&P 500 earnings.
Investment Implications
The recent market downdraft has understandably rekindled fears that the longest bull market in
history is coming to an end. While there are no certainties in investing, we do not think the odds
support that conclusion based on our read of the steady and unsteady factors discussed above. Keep
in mind that about 75% of historical US bear markets—defined here as equity market declines of 20%
or more—have occurred during economic recessions. In fact, US equity returns have remained
favorable until about five to six months prior to the onset of recession, highlighting the penalty for
prematurely exiting the market (see Exhibit 11). With only 10% odds of recession over the next year,
we think the economic backdrop remains favorable for stocks.

Of course, none of the supportive factors discussed above precludes further bouts of equity volatility.
As we highlighted at the beginning of the year, the historical probability of a 5% or greater correction
from current valuation levels was 96%. Yet these statistics alone do not justify underweighting
equities, since such pullbacks often occur after sizable equity rallies, as this year reminds us.
Moreover, such pullbacks are quite normal historically. After all, stocks have suffered a median of two
pullbacks of at least 5% and one of at least 10% per calendar year in the post-WWII period, leaving
both the frequency and magnitude of this year’s dips in line with past experience. Most importantly,
years that experienced a similar number of pullbacks as 2018 nonetheless ended with a median gain
of 6% and had 77% odds of a positive return.
Conclusion
Although we have painted a less alarmist view of recent market weakness, we are by no means
Pollyannaish. While bull markets do not die of old age, they do become more susceptible to ailments
over time. Yet as we survey the tug of war between the steady factors and the unsteady undertow,
we do not think the balance of risks is strong enough to topple the ongoing US expansion and the
continued growth of corporate earnings it supports.
That said, this viewpoint does not preclude further market volatility and the market may still make new
lows if the current downdraft persists. But history suggests the bull market is likely to continue until
about 5-6 months prior to the end of this economic expansion. Thus, it will take a significant increase
in the odds of an imminent recession to provide the trigger—that has been lacking thus far—to
tactically underweight equities. In the interim, we continue to recommend that clients maintain their
strategic allocation to US equities.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013185.txt,"13.6 Glocal Memory 269

The result of these modifications to the ordinary Hopfield net, is a Hopfield net that contin-
ually maintains a set of key neurons, each of which individually represents a certain attractor
of the net.

Note that these key neurons — in spite of being “symbolic” in nature — are learned rather
than preprogrammed, and are every bit as adaptive as the attractors they correspond to. Fur-
thermore, if a key neuron is removed, the glocal Hopfield net algorithm will eventually learn it
back, so the robustness properties of Hopfield nets are retained.

The results of experimenting with glocal Hopfield nets of this nature are summarized in
[GPI* 10]. We studied Hopfield nets with connectivity around .1, and in this context we found
that glocality

e slightly increased memory capacity
e massively increased the rate of convergence to the attractor, i.e. the speed of recall

However, probably the most important consequence of glocality is a more qualitative one: it
makes it far easier to link the Hopfield net into a larger system, as would occur if the Hopfield net
were embedded in an integrative AGI architecture. Because a neuron external to the Hopfield
net may now link to a memory in the Hopfield net by linking to the corresponding key neuron.

13.6.4 Neural-Symbolic Glocality in CogPrime

In CogPrime, we have explicitly sought to span the symbolic/emergentist pseudo-dichotomy,
via creating an integrative knowledge representation that combines logic-based aspects with
neural-net-like aspects. As reviewed in Chapter 6 above, these function not in the manner of
multimodular systems, but rather via using (probabilistic) truth values and (attractor neural
net like) attention values as weights on nodes and links of the same (hyper) graph. The nodes
and links in this hypergraph are typed, like a standard semantic network approach for knowl-
edge representation, so they’re able to handle all sorts of knowledge, from the most concrete
perception and actuation related knowledge to the most abstract relationships. But they’re also
weighted with values similar to neural net weights, and pass around quantities (importance
values, discussed in Chapter 23 of Part 2) similar to neural net activations, allowing emergent
attractor /assembly based knowledge representation similar to attractor neural nets.

The concept of glocality lies at the heart of this combination, in a way that spans the pseudo-
dichotomy:

e Local knowledge is represented in abstract logical relationships stored in explicit logical
form, and also in Hebbian-type associations between nodes and links.

e Global knowledge is represented in large-scale patterns of node and link weights, which
lead to large-scale patterns of network activity, which often take the form of attractors
qualitatively similar to Hopfield net attractors. These attractors are called maps.

The result of all this is that a concept like “cat” might be represented as a combination of:

e A small number of logical relationships and strong associations, that constitute the “key”
subnetwork for the “cat” concept.

e A large network of weak associations, binding together various nodes and links of various
types and various levels of abstraction, representing the “cat map”.

the witness.3 And, as courts have repeatedly held, the protection offered by the Fifth
Amendment privilege extends to producing documents where the act of production itself is
testimonial in nature.

The context in which the Committee has called for General Flynn’s testimonial
production of documents makes clear that he has more than a reasonable apprehension that any
testimony he provides could be used against him. Multiple Members of Congress have
demanded that he be investigated and even prosecuted. He is the target on nearly a daily basis of
outrageous allegations, often attributed to anonymous sources in Congress or elsewhere in the
United States Government, which, however fanciful on their face and unsubstantiated by
evidence, feed the escalating public frenzy against him.4 Additionally, in the intervening time
since the Committee issued its subpoena, the Department of Justice has appointed a special
counsel to investigate these and related matters. This environment creates a “reasonable cause
to apprehend danger,” giving rise to a constitutional right not to testify. A detailed explanation
of the legal basis for respectfully declining to comply with the Committee’s requests follows
below.5

The Fifth Amendment Privilege Bars Congress From Compelling A Witness to Provide
Testimony Through The Act of Producing Documents

The Fifth Amendment protects an individual from being “compelled in any criminal case
to be a witness against himself.” U.S. Const. amend. V. This privilege applies in congressional
investigations. In Watkins v. United States, Chief Justice Warren stressed that “the
constitutional rights of witnesses will be respected by the Congress as they are in a court of
justice. ... Witnesses cannot be compelled to give evidence against themselves.” 354 U.S. 178,
187-88 (1957). The Supreme Court later held in United States v. Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27, 34
(2000), that the right not to be compelled to give testimony against oneself applies as well to the
compelled production of documents that would be “testimonial” in nature. Specifically, the act
of producing documents in response to a subpoena may have a “compelled testimonial aspect”
when “the act of production itself may implicitly communicate statements of fact” that the
documents “existed, were in his possession or control, and were authentic.” Id. at 36 (internal
quotation marks omitted) (quoting United States v. Doe, 465 U.S. 605, 613 & n.11 (1984)).

3 Id.

4 These include leaks that purport to describe classified briefings, documents, and intelligence
collection. Any actual leaks of classified information -- including reported leaks of signals
intelligence -- constitute criminal offenses by government officials violating their duty to protect
classified information.

5 General Flynn reserves the right to assert, in connection with the subpoena, any other privilege
or protection provided by the Constitution, statute, or common law.

another business you are unlikely to know anything about.”

At just about this point in the narrative, the questions or the
incredulity begins in social circles and eventually in the media. He begins to
acquire the major symbols of riches but does this without position, public
holdings, or obvious paper trails. In essence, the formulation is, how can a
person have enough money to merit increasing attention, but no clear way of
having gotten it. Epstein gets stuck in that tautology. He may be rich, but he
is without institutional protection or bona fides. He is a questionable
substrata of wealth. He’s a freelancer.

In the Epstein telling, he’s representing a series of vastly wealthy
people and families.

In a sense, he’s their instrument, doing their bidding, and for a period
describes himself as recovering money, as something like a private
detective. If early in his career he might seem like a sort of George Peppard
(there’s a resemblance) in Breakfast at Tiffany’s, a charming hustler, later
he’s George Peppard in Banacek, a smart and astute operator.

He steps up his game and his relationship with the rich. He’s not just
doing their bidding or their investing, he’s helping them to imagine the
ambitions of their wealth. They’ve satisfied their business dreams. Now
there are the separate challenges and possibilities of their actual wealth.

In essence, the response to this, as he becomes more public, as a
function of envy and media, is “bullshit.” True, there is no clear alternate
narrative. No one is accusing him of anything, accept, sometimes, guilt by
association. (In addition to Robert Maxwell, who will be accused of fraud,
there’s Steven Hoffenberg, briefly a New York high flyer, who went to jail
for a Ponzi, for whom Epstein acted as a consultant.) But the
characterization persist: if it’s not clear, it must be murky. Sure, Goldman
Sachs partners and tech fortunes, but what to make of a Coney Island, Zelig-
like no-namer?

In 1994, just at the moment when Prince Charles is on television
acknowledging his love for Camilla Parker Bowles, Jeffrey Epstein is sitting
next to Princess Diana at a dinner at the Serpentine Galley in London (Diana
is wearing her “revenge” dress that evening). Graydon Carter, into his
second years as editor of Vanity Fair, is also at the dinner. Epstein’s rise and
Carter’s rise are not, with a little critical interpretation, that different. Both
are a function of the age of new money, and both are helped by strategic
relationships with the exceptionally wealthy. To say that Epstein, sitting next
to the Princess, sticks in Carter’s craw would be an understatement. Epstein
becomes one of the “what do you know about him” figures in Carter’s

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013191.txt,"14.4 Implications of Patternist Philosophy for Derived Hypergraphs of Intelligent Systems 275

structure, and that in highly intelligent systems they should have subgraphs that constitute
models of the whole hypergraph (these are self systems). SMEPH does not add anything to
the patternist view on a philosophical level, but it gives a concrete instantiation to some of the
general ideas of patternism. In this section we’ll articulate some SMEPH principles, consti-
tuting important ideas from patternist philosophy as they manifest themselves in the SMEPH
context.

The logical edges in a SMEPH hypergraph are weighted with probabilities, as in the simple
example given above. The functional edges may be probabilistically weighted as well, since some
Schema may give certain results only some of the time. These probabilities are critical in terms
of SMEPH’s model of system dynamics; they underly one of our SMEPH principles,

Principle of Implicit Probabilistic Inference: In an intelligent system, the temporal
evolution of the probabilities on the edges in the system’s derived hypergraph should approxi-
mately obey the rules of probability theory.

The basic idea is that, even if a system - through its underlying dynamics - has no explicit
connection to probability theory, it still must behave roughly as if it does, if it is going to be
intelligent. The roughly part is important here; it’s well known that humans are not terribly
accurate in explicitly carrying out formal probabilistic inferences. And yet, in practical contexts
where they have experience, humans can make quite accurate judgments; which is all that’s
required by the above principle, since it’s the contexts where experience has occurred that will
make up a system’s derived hypergraph.
Our next SMEPH principle is evolutionary, and states

Principle of Implicit Evolution: In an intelligent system, new Schema and Concepts will
continually be created, and the Schema and Concepts that are more useful for achieving system
goals (as demonstrated via probabilistic implication of goal achievement) will tend to survive
longer.

Note that this principle can be fulfilled in many different ways. The important thing is that
system goals are allowed to serve as a selective force.

Another SMEPH dynamical principle pertains to a shorter time-scale than evolution, and
states

Principle of Attention Allocation: In an intelligent system, Schema and Concepts that
are more useful for attaining short-term goals will tend to consume more of the system’s energy.
(The balance of attention oriented toward goals pertaining to different time scales will vary from
system to system.)

Next, there is the
Principle of Autopoesis: In an intelligent system, if one removes some part of the system
and then allows the system’s natural dynamics to keep going, a decent approximation to that

removed part will often be spontaneously reconstituted.

And there is the

deduction unnecessary in the majority of
cases. However, as Windsor showed, it is
a valuable tax benefit for larger estates.

Many same-sex married couples may find
it valuable to revisit their estate plans to

make certain that interests passing to the
other spouse qualify for the marital de-

duction and other tax benefits.

Portability. The American Taxpayer Relief
Act of 2012 extended permanently the con-
cept of portability, which generally allows
the estate of a surviving spouse to utilize the
unused portion of the estate tax applicable
exclusion amount of his or her last prede-
ceased spouse. Because of DOMA, only
opposite-sex married couples could take ad-
vantage of portability.

IMPACT. The Supreme Courts decision
presumably enables same-sex married
couples to take advantage of portability as
part of their estate planning. The IRS is

expected to issue guidance.

Gifts. Because of DOMA, only opposite-
sex married couples were allowed to “split”
gifts to take advantage of a doubled annual
gift tax exclusion ($14,000 for 2013, for
a total tax-free gift of $28,000). DOMA
presented even more of a disadvantage
for same-sex married couples in that only
transfers between spouses, where both in-
dividuals are U.S. citizens, are allowed an
unlimited gift tax exclusion under Code
Sec. 2523.

IMPACT. Same-sex married couples can
now presumably transfer assets between
themselves with no concern of lifetime gift
tax consequences. This creates consider-
ably greater flexibility for estate planning.
The IRS is expected to issue guidance.

COMMENT. Gifts to cover medical and
education expenses for an individual, if
paid directly to the medical or education
provider, are gift tax free without limit
and are not counted against the annual
$14,000 exclusion for any individual.

COMMENT. Where one Spouse is not a
U.S. citizen, the annual exclusion from

gift taxes for gifts made to the noncitizen
spouse is $143,000 for 2013.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Perhaps in no area outside of income taxes is
the impact of the Supreme Court’s decision
more expansive than on employee benefits.
Because of DOMA, employers that allow an
employee to add his or her same-sex spouse
to their health plan had to impute income
to the employee for federal income tax pur-
poses equal to the fair market value of health
coverage provided to the same-sex spouse.
If the same-sex spouse qualified as a depen-
dent, this rule did not apply. DOMA also
precluded same-sex married couples from
sharing the same benefits of health flexible
spending accounts, health savings accounts
and health reimbursement arrangements
available to opposite-sex married couples.

IMPACT. Employers in states that allow
same-sex marriage will presumably need
to amend plans to cover same-sex married
spouses. The IRS is expected to provide guid-
ance on the timing of plan amendments, in-
cluding the issue of whether benefits need to
be made retroactive or only prospective from

the date of the Windsor decision.

Domestic Partners. Many employee ben-
efit plans in the private and public sectors
refer to domestic partners rather than same-

compass opposite-sex domestic partners as
well as same-sex domestic partners.

COMMENT. The federal governments
Office of Personnel Management defines
domestic partner for purposes of federal
employee benefits as a committed relation-
ship between two adults, of the same sex.

Tax Treatment. Domestic partners who are
not married under state law are not treated
as spouses for federal income tax purposes.
As a result, an employee must continue
to pay taxes on the fair market value of
the coverage for the employee's domestic
partner (whether the domestic partner is a

same-sex partner or an opposite-sex part-
ner). However, domestic partner benefits
are tax-free if the employee's partner quali-
fies as a dependent under Code Sec. 152;
that is, if benefits are paid for a person who
meets the following requirements:

m Receives more than half of his or her
support from the taxpayer for the year.

m Uses the taxpayer's home as the principal
abode and is a member of the taxpayer's
household during the entire tax year.

m Is in a relationship with the taxpayer
that is not a violation of local law.

IMPACT. The Supreme Courts decision
may open the window to refunds of taxes
paid by employees on income imputed to
employees for same-sex married spouse
and refunds of payroll taxes paid by em-
ployers on that income. FICA tax refund
claims by employers and employees for
prior, open years may also be possible.

COMMENT. Some employers have at-
tempted to equalize the treatment be-
tween opposite-sex couples and same-sex
couples by providing so-called gross-ups
to cover the additional taxes that same-
sex couples pay on health benefits. Many
employers require an employee to certify
that a domestic partner qualifies as a de-
pendent under Code Sec. 152.

Cafeteria Plans. Employer contributions to
a cafeteria plan are usually made under a sal-
ary reduction agreement between the employer
and the employee in which the employee agrees
to contribute a portion of his or her salary on
a pre-tax basis to pay for the qualified benefits.
Salary reduction contributions are not actually
or constructively received by the participant.
Therefore, those contributions are not consid-
ered wages for federal income tax purposes. In
addition, those sums generally are not subject to
FICA and FUTA taxes. However, pre-tax dol-
lars could not be used to pay for coverage of a
same-sex spouse because of DOMA. This now
should change as a result of the Court's decision.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019862.txt,"SEC & FINRA RELEASE 2017 EXAM PRIORITIES

BY DANIEL G. VIOLA

The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
released their Exam Priorities for 2017. The SEC's
2017 priorities are organized around the following
areas: (1) examining matters of importance to retail
investors; (2) focusing on risks specific to elderly
and retiring investors; and (3) assessing market-
wide risks. FINRA also issued its 2017 Regulatory
and Examinations Priorities Letter, which identifies
compliance, supervision and risk management as
areas of focus. FINRA will be introducing a compli-
ance calendar and a directory of service providers
as tools to assist firms. FINRA will also be initiating
electronic, off-site reviews to supplement traditional
on-site cycle examinations. These off-site exams will
affect only a select group of firms that are not cur-
rently scheduled for a cycle exam in 2017.

The SEC priorities address issues across a vari-
ety of financial institutions, including investment
advisers, investment companies, broker-deal-
ers, transfer agents, clearing agencies, private
fund advisers, national securities exchanges
and municipal advisers. Under each category, a
number of key exam areas include:

—

m Exchange-Traded Funds
m Never-Before Examined Investment Advisers
m Recidivist Firms and Their Employees

m Clearing Agencies
m FINRA
m Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity
m Cybersecurity
m National Securities Exchanges
m Anti-Money Laundering

4. Other Initiatives:
m Municipal Advisers
m Transfer Agents
m Private Fund Advisers

The FINRA Examination Priorities Letter includes
a long list of topics that FINRA will prioritize this
year, including product suitability, excessive and
short-term trading of long-term products, outside
business activities, social media and electronic
communications, liquidity risk, credit risk poli-
cies, cybersecurity, segregation of client assets,
Regulation SHO, and anti-money laundering and
suspicious activity monitoring.

FINRA’s Top Five Exam Priorities Include:
m High-Risk and Recidivist Brokers

disposed towards Rawabi, but it's still taken
years to resolve sovereignty and
governance issues around necessities like
water, and a single access road. Such
Israeli inertia was apparently at the heart of
Obama's concerns back in 2010, and
sources say that the president has discussed
the issue of the access road with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on
multiple occasions.

Back in Washington, I asked Masri if he
believed the Israelis understood the
potential importance of Rawabi. I really
don't know, he said. Their statements are
neutral to positive. But their actions are
neutral to negative.

And then there's the larger inertia. What
meaning does a place like Rawabi have if it
sits in the middle of a still-unresolved
conflict, or if Palestinian economic self-
improvement stands in contrast to an all-
pervading political stasis -- or even
political backsliding? Today, Rawabi is
significant because of its novelty. But if
there's a breakthrough in the Israeli-
Palestinian peace process, perhaps enabled
by a growing West Bank economy and a
permanent end in terrorism, it could take on
an importance much larger than itself.

made from phones originating outside the United States by known
foreign jihadists. If these calls were made to individuals inside, the
NSA was now authorized to retrieve the billing records of the per-
son called and those people whom he or she called. These traces were
then supplied to the FBI. The new duties also increased the NSA’s
need to create new bureaucratic mechanisms to monitor its compli-
ance with FISA court orders. Rajesh De, the NSA’s general counsel at
the time of the Snowden breach, described the NSA as becoming by
2013 “one of the most regulated enterprises in the world.” Grafted
onto its intelligence activities were layers of mandated reporting to
oversight officials. Not only did the NSA have its own chief compli-
ance officer, chief privacy and civil liberties officer, and independent
inspector general, but the NSA also had to report to a different set
of compliance officers at the Department of Defense, the Office of
the Director of National Intelligence, and the Department of Justice.
Additionally, the Department of Justice dispatched a team of lawyers
every sixty days to review the results of “every single tasking deci-
sion” approved by the FISA court.

© According to De, just assembling these reports involved thousands ©
of hours of manpower. In addition, the president’s Oversight Board
required that the NSA’s Office of the General Counsel and inspec-
tor general supply it every ninety days with a list of every single
error and deviation from procedure made by every NSA employee
anywhere in the world, including even minor typing errors. These
requirements, according to De, inundated a large part of the NSA
legal and executive staff in a sea of red tape. Yet this regulation could
not undo surveillance programs such as the one Snowden revealed
of Verizon’s turning over the billing records of its customers to the
NSA, because the NSA was in compliance with the FISA court order
(even though, as it turned out in 2015, the FISA court might have
erred in interpreting the law).

The NSA’s focus on surveillance might have led to the neglect of
its other mission: protecting the integrity of the channels through
which the White House, government agencies, and military units
send information. This task had been made vastly more difficult
by the proliferation of computer networks, texting, and e-mails.

To: Jeffrey Epstein <j eevacation@gmail.com> 
A few things to think about: 
If the Patterson book is being published in August, that presents some time frame issues. You would not be able 
to do a competing book or documentary before then. This is not to say that they shouldn't be pursued. In a 
sense, better that they know what Patterson's position is and, a year from now say, be able to counter it. I have 
some thoughts on book and doc to share at your convenience. 
That being said, you do need an immediate counter narrative to the book. I believe Trump offers an ideal 
opportunity. It's a chance to make the story about something other than you, while, at the same time, letting you 
frame your own story. Also, becoming an anti-Trump voice gives you a certain political cover which you 
decidedly don't have now. Still, this necessary involves you going public. And so the most basic decision is 
about your willingness to do that. My view is that in a couple of weeks you could master message and technical 
proficiency. I know a bunch of people who could be very helpful here. This would involve something along the 
lines of you writing an op-ed, doing a high profile television interview (Charlie Rose, I'd say), and perhaps 
some social media efforts. 
Speaking of which, again, I think a strategic plan, involving your public identity, philanthropic activities and 
interests, and the development of media allies, ought finally to be put in place. A big, comprehensive, expensive 
effort. 
The alternative is to continue to keep head down and hope Patterson book is just more he-said she-said and 
Connolly getting lost in the reeds (which, as an inveterate conspiracist, he always does). My worry is that 
Patterson can be counted on to produce a bestseller, and while he isn't regarded as a serious writer, he'll surely 
be unloading a lot of tabloid copy. Because this will be tied to the election, the Trump-Clinton angle will amp 
up the attention 10-fold, in fact, possibly, a hundred fold. Possibly more than anything you've encountered 
before. 
Meanwhile--
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 032246 
In a lawyer's letter, I'd suggest including the following points--not necessarily legal, but a warning about how a 
press campaign might unfold (publishers are more worried about being caught in negative media controversy 
than they are of legal threats): 
1) Little, Brown has made on the record representations to at least one well-known journalist that it was not 
publishing a book by James Patterson about Jeffrey Epstein--possibly an effort to avoid inquiries about the 
questionable nature of the book; 
2) The actual author of the book, John Connolly, is someone other than the stated author, James Patterson. 
Connolly is known to have developed an obsession with Epstein, such that, his longtime employer, Vanity Fair, 
has refused to allow him to write about Epstein for the magazine; 
3) Sources have confirmed for us that Patterson has had little more than a minimal consulting role in the book, 
and that Connolly has functioned in every material way as the book's researcher and writer. We believe 
Patterson's authorship of the book will not stand up to scrutiny. And, indeed, that the entire notion of an 
extension of the Patterson franchise into nonfiction, as it has been used in fiction and children's book--
effectively other authors writing under the Patterson name—presents a host of journalism ethical issues.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013807.txt,"premise: Test the most basic assumptions of the work-life equation.

e » How do your decisions change if retirement isn’t an option?

e > What if you could use a mini-retirement to sample your deferred-
life plan reward before working 40 years for it?

e » Is it really necessary to work like a slave to live like a millionaire?

Little did I know where questions like these would take me.

The uncommon conclusion? The commonsense rules of the “real world” are a fragile collection of
socially reinforced illusions. This book will teach you how to see and seize the options others do not.

What makes this book different?

First, ’'m not going to spend much time on the problem. I’m going to assume you are suffering from
time famine, creeping dread, or—worst case—a tolerable and comfortable existence doing something
unfulfilling. The last is most common and most insidious.

Second, this book is not about saving and will not recommend you abandon your daily glass of red
wine for a million dollars 50 years from now. Id rather have the wine. I won’t ask you to choose
between enjoyment today or money later. I believe you can have both now. The goal is fun and profit.

Third, this book is not about finding your “dream job.” I will take as a given that, for most people,
somewhere between six and seven billion of them, the perfect job is the one that takes the least time. The
vast majority of people will never find a job that can be an unending source of fulfillment, so that is not
the goal here; to free time and automate income is.

I OPEN EACH class with an explanation of the singular importance of being a “dealmaker.” The manifesto

The steps and strategies can be used with incredible results—whether you are an employee or an

Here is the step-by-step process you'll use to reinvent yourself:

BANNON AGONISTES

e, too, felt like a prisoner, he had told Katie Walsh when she came to tell him she
was leaving.

By ten weeks in, Steve Bannon’s mastery of the Trump agenda, or at least of Trump
himself, appeared to have crumbled. His current misery was both Catholic in nature—the
self-flagellation of a man who believed he lived on a higher moral plane than all others—
and fundamentally misanthropic. As an antisocial, maladjusted, post-middle-aged man, he
had to make a supreme effort to get along with others, an effort that often did not go well.
Most especially, he was miserable because of Donald Trump, whose cruelties, always
great even when they were casual, were unbearable when he truly turned against you.

“T hated being on the campaign, I hated the transition, I hate being here in the White
House,” said Bannon, sitting one evening in Reince Priebus’s office, on an unseasonably
warm evening in early spring, with the French doors open to the arbor-covered patio
where he and Priebus, now firm friends and allies in their antipathy toward Jarvanka, had
set an outdoor table.

But Bannon was, he believed, here for a reason. And it was his firm belief—a belief he
was unable to keep to himself, thus continually undermining his standing with the
president—that his efforts had brought everybody else here. Even more important, he was
the only person showing up for work every day who was committed to the purpose of
actually changing the country. Changing it quickly, radically, and truly.

The idea of a split electorate—of blue and red states, of two opposing currents of
values, of globalists and nationalists, of an establishment and populist revolt—was media
shorthand for cultural angst and politically roiled times, and, to a large degree, for
business as usual. But Bannon believed the split was literal. The United States had become
a country of two hostile peoples. One would necessarily win and the other lose. Or one
would dominate while the other would become marginal.

This was modern civil war—Bannon’s war. The country built on the virtue and the
character and the strength of the American workingman circa 1955—65 was the ideal he

IMAGES-012-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_033590.txt,"Meanwhile--

In a lawyer's letter, I'd suggest including the following points--not necessarily legal, but a warning about how a
press campaign might unfold (publishers are more worried about being caught in negative media controversy
than they are of legal threats):

1) Little, Brown has made on the record representations to at least one well-known journalist that it was not
publishing a book by James Patterson about Jeffrey Epstein--possibly an effort to avoid inquiries about the
questionable nature of the book;

2) The actual author of the book, John Connolly, is someone other than the stated author, James Patterson.
Connolly is known to have developed an obsession with Epstein, such that, his longtime employer, Vanity Fair,
has refused to allow him to write about Epstein for the magazine;

3) Sources have confirmed for us that Patterson has had little more than a minimal consulting role in the book,
and that Connolly has functioned in every material way as the book's researcher and writer. We believe
Patterson's authorship of the book will not stand up to scrutiny. And, indeed, that the entire notion of an
extension of the Patterson franchise into nonfiction, as it has been used in fiction and children's book--
effectively other authors writing under the Patterson name—presents a host of journalism ethical issues.

appearance of pressing transnational problems should drive a convergence
of interests toward cooperation in finding common solutions. And the
presence of large, well-educated middle classes in countries around the
globe will help keep governments on the right track.

There is every reason to be confident that the condition of the world will
continue to improve as pragmatism and the use of reason become universal.
Western universities have been a crucial driver of this trend. It is not just
that their curricula have been copied around the world; the entire ecosystem
of a modern research university is being replicated, and it is the graduates of
these Western-style universities who have in turn introduced modern
methods into education, public health, economic management, and public
policy more generally. Global management consulting firms have also
contributed to progress, spreading best practices and good ideas from the
West to the rest, and increasingly from the rest back to the West. As a
result, even formerly desperate and dysfunctional countries, such as
Bangladesh and Ethiopia, are now confidently entering the modern
universe.

In short, despite the daily headlines that scream doom and gloom, the world
is actually coming together, not falling apart. So far, the fusion of
civilizations has been driven primarily by the injection of Western DNA into
other civilizations. Over time, the flow of culture and ideas is likely to go in
both directions. This has already happened in cuisine, where global
influences have thoroughly penetrated Western kitchens, and something
similar should happen across cultural sectors.

There will be challenges. There could even be major setbacks. The fusion of
civilizations and the social and economic changes associated with it can
seem threatening to some, creating opportunities for demagogues to exploit
popular fears, even in the heart of the advanced industrial world. But
increasingly open and enlightened societies are likely to avoid this danger.
In the twenty-first century, the world will be governed more by the authority
of ideas than by the idea of authority. In short, the progressive direction of
human history, which has lifted the human condition to heights never seen
before, is set to continue.

make Turkey one of the world’s 10 biggest economies (it is now
17th). This will only be possible if the Middle East is peaceful and
open for business.

Besides dealing with upheaval in the Arab world, Turkey faces three
other key foreign policy challenges. First is the continuing division of
Cyprus between ethnic Greek and Turkish sectors. Second 1s the
frozen conflict with Armenia, which seemed to be on the brink of
resolution until Turkish and Armenian nationalists killed a promising
agreement reached by both countries two years ago. Erdogan’s new
mandate gives him the power to overrule militants in his ranks. If he
does, and if Armenian leaders can do the same, the entire region will
benefit.

Third is to rebuild relations with Israel. Erdogan has become a hero
in the Middle East for his forthright denunciations of Israel’s
occupation of the West Bank and its blockade of Gaza. Like many
Turks, he is still enraged over the murder of nine Turkish civilians by
Israeli commandos who stormed a freighter bearing relief supplies for
Gaza last year. His anger may be justified by the facts, but he should
realize that a resumption of Turkey’s good ties to Israel could be a
decisive step toward Middle East peace.

Foreign policy challenges are only part of Erdogan’s post-election
agenda. He also needs to deepen Turkish democracy. That would
require resolving the decades-old Kurdish conflict and taking
concrete steps to reassure secular Turks that their country is not
moving toward religious rule.

Turkey’s grand project in the next couple of years will be writing a
new constitution to replace the one imposed by generals three
decades ago. Erdogan wants to replace the current parliamentary
system with one built around a strong president and then run for the
presidency himself. His party did not win enough seats in Parliament
to impose a constitution on its own, so if he wants to make such a

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016856.txt,"rapid development of software without standards of correctness has opened up many
routes to exploit von Neumann architecture’s storage of data and instructions in the same
memory. One of the most common routes, known as “buffer overrun,” involves an input
number (or long string of characters) that is bigger than the programmer expected and
overflows into where the instructions are stored. By carefully designing an input number
that is too big by far, someone using a piece of software can infect it with instructions not
intended by the programmer, and thus change what it does. This is the basis for creating
a computer virus—so named for its similarity to a biological virus. The latter injects
extra DNA into a cell, and that cell’s transcription and translation mechanism blindly
interprets it, making proteins that may be harmful to the host cell. Furthermore, the
replication mechanism for the cell takes care of multiplying the virus. Thus, a small
foreign entity can take control of a much bigger entity and bend its behavior in
unexpected ways.

These and other forms of digital attacks have taken the security of our everyday
lives from us. We rely on computers for almost everything now. We rely on computers
for our infrastructure of electricity, gas, roads, cars, trains, and airplanes; these are all
vulnerable. We rely on computers for our banking, our payment of bills, our retirement
accounts, our mortgages, our purchasing of goods and services—these, too, are all
vulnerable. We rely on computers for our entertainment, our communications both
business and personal, our physical security at home, our information about the world,
and our voting systems—all vulnerable. None of this will get fixed anytime soon. In the
meantime, many aspects of our society are open to vicious attacks, whether by
freelancing criminals or nation-state adversaries.

The second development is that computation has gone beyond simply computing
functions. Instead, programs remain online continuously, and so they can gather data
about a sequence of queries. Under the Wiener/Turing/von Neumann scheme, we might
think of the communication pattern for a Web browser to be:

User: Give me Web page A.
Browser: Here is Web page A.

User: Give me Web page B.
Browser: Here is Web page B.

Now instead it can look like this:

User: Give me Web page A.
Browser: Here is Web page A. [And I will secretly
remember that you asked for Web page A.]

User: Give me Web page B.

Browser: Here is Web page B. [I see a correlation between
its contents and that of the earlier requested Web page A, so Iwill

bother denying it. I suppose I felt lucky they hadn’t found out about our raids on
the kibbutz armory. He did not administer my beating. That came a few weeks
later from one of the kibbutz elders. He simply took me by the shoulders and
shouted: “You must never do this again.”

It was worse for my parents. At first, they believed I was an innocent party.
They were convinced I couldn’t have got involved in something like this
without being dragged in by the others. My father even asked me whether the
reason I’d been “drafted” by Ido and Moshe was because I was small, and able
to squeeze through tight spaces in windows and doors. As it happened, that did
sometimes come in handy. But I told them, no, I was not an unlucky bystander.
I was as much a part of it as the others. My father was angrier than I had ever
seen him. My mother, faced with what must have seemed like a betrayal of
every one of her Zionist principles, told me that if the kibbutz had decided to
report us to the police, she would not have objected.

Their mood lifted slightly when I began my final year of high school in
September 1958. After two years back in the kibbutz school, our age-group was
sent out again in another shift in policy. This one was in response to signs of
growing support in Mishmar Hasharon and other kibbutzim for the argument
my father had made against the quality of education we were offering. In order
to go at least some way toward meeting that objection, Mishmar Hasharon was
banding together with two dozen other kibbutzim and sending all 12-graders to
one of two outside high schools. The first, called Beit Berl, was a Labor Zionist
institution focusing on the humanities. In addition to a few of the less academic
boys, most of the girls were sent there. The rest of us went to a place called
Rupin. It was a few hundred yards past the regional high school. It specialized
in agriculturally related scientific research.

A few of the teachers were enormously gifted, and they were in the areas
that most interested me: math, physics and biology. Yet the rest of the
curriculum was almost numbingly uninspiring. I did not miss a single math or
science class. But otherwise, I began setting my own schedule. Some days, I
would sleep late, or not go at all. When I did go, I’d often show up without
having done the homework. Neither Ido nor Moshe was with me at Rupin. They
were starting their military service. But I assembled a new band of mischief-
makers, and it was not hard to entice them to go AWOL.

I was warned several times by the school administrator. He said he could not
accommodate a student who seemed oblivious to, or dismissive of, the rules. He

An Assassination in Tunisia
Editorial

February 8, 2013 -- Tunisia is where the Arab Spring began just over two
years ago. Until now it has set an encouraging example of progress toward
democracy and pluralism. Free elections brought to power a coalition
government pledged to pragmatic cooperation between a moderate-led
Islamist party, Ennahda, and smaller, secular coalition partners.

Progress has not always been smooth. But just as Tunisians inspired
people in neighboring countries like Egypt and Libya to rise up against
their corrupt and repressive dictators, they also seemed, for many, to point
the way toward a democratic future accommodating both religious beliefs
and the rights of the secular under the rule of law.

Those hopes have been severely shaken by the murder on Wednesday of
Chokri Belaid. Mr. Belaid, a human- rights activist and one of Ennahda’s
most outspoken critics, had publicly challenged the party’s failure to
investigate or prosecute violent acts of intimidation carried out by
shadowy gangs of religious extremists. Mr. Belaid’s killers have not yet
been identified. But suspicion now falls on those same extremist groups,
which had issued public threats against Mr. Belaid and other prominent
secular leaders — without any serious government response.

Thousands gathered for Mr. Belaid’s funeral on Friday amid a nationwide
general strike called by his trade union supporters. Tensions are high.
What is urgently needed is a credible, independent investigation of Mr.
Belaid’s murder, followed by prosecution of the killers.

Given Ennahda’s record of selectively ignoring Islamist violence, that
investigation cannot be left to its appointees alone. A preferable
alternative would be to reconstitute the broad-based, multiparty
commissions that successfully oversaw Tunisia’s free elections in October
2011 and investigated the crimes of the fallen dictatorship.

Which global events in the first years of this century will appear
in future textbooks of history? My first bet is a gradual change
that came about without headlines. When I was born in 1948
we were less than one billion children in the world. Today there
are almost two billion aged 0-15 years. The game-changing
event in the first decade of this century was that the number of
children stopped growing. Two-child families are now the norm
for 80% of mankind. The fast population growth will be over
around 2050 and at that point only 10% of the 10 billion in the
world will live in what was the West. Demographics are major
changers of the market place.
My second bet is the G20 meeting in Washington 2008.
As the richest needed to borrow money they asked the emerging
economies to join and changed their name from G7 to G20.
The official photo of the heads of state tells the story. In the
middle stands the host, President George W. Bush. On his right
is President da Silva and on his left President Jintao and King
Abdulla, most probably placed according to their ability to lend
money to US in the time of crisis. We know of the lending from

Saudi and China. But Brazil has on its own been lending US
about 30 billion USD per year since 2008. The economic
strength of the world is shifting.
What do the ongoing tectonic shifts in demographics

Will basic medical research be the last to globalize as it requires
a unique functional combination of venture capital, institutions
and creative individuals? Or will we see tectonic shifts in how
the world does basic medical research already in the next
decade?

Especially after the murder and the mutilation of The 35, I assumed the war
would come down to a simple calculus. If there was going to be an Israel — if
there was going to be a Mishmar Hasharon — we had to win and the Arabs had
to lose. At first, even the fact our kibbutz had been given a share of the land of
Wadi Khawaret seemed just another product of the war. After all, Ben-Gurion
had accepted the plan for two states. The Arabs had said no, deciding to attack
us instead. Someone had to farm the land. Why not us?

Yet events after the war did lead me to begin to ask myself questions of
basic fairness, and whether we were being faithful to some of the high-sounding
ideals I heard spoken about with such pride on the kibbutz. The Palestinians
were not the only refugees. More than 600,000 Jews fled into Israel from Arab
countries where they had lived for generations. More than 100,000 arrived from
Iraq, and several hundred thousand from Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria in north
Africa. Immediately after the war, about 50,000 were airlifted out of Yemen,
where they had endured violent attacks ever since the UN partition vote.

The reality that greeted the Yemenis in Israel was more complex. Most were
initially settled in tented transit camps. I’m not sure how several dozen Yemeni
families made their way to Wadi Khawaret, but it made sense for them to move
into the village’s vacant homes. It was empty except for several deserted
buildings which we and other kibbutzim began using for storage and, later, for
our transport co-operative. Yet a few nights after the Yemenis moved in, a
posse of young men, including some from Mishmar Hasharon, descended on
them and, armed with clubs and wooden staves, drove them away.

I was shocked. I’d seen the photos in Davar le Yeladim celebrating the
airlift, with the Yemenis kissing the airport tarmac in relief, gratitude and joy at
finding refuge in the new Israeli state. Now, for the “crime” of moving into a
row of empty buildings in search of a decent place to live, they’d been beaten
up and chased away. By us. I realized Wadi Khawaret no longer belonged to the
Arabs. But, surely, our kibbutz had no more right to the buildings than Jews
who had fled from Yemen and needed them a lot more than we did. For days, I
tried to discover who had joined the vigilante attack. Though everyone seemed
to know what had happened, no one talked about it. In the dining hall, I ran my

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021096 
Hot event alert: RSVP to our 2/26 event in NYC for interviews with NBA star 
Draymond Green, BBG Ventures' Susan Lyne, JPMorgan's Jennifer Piepszak, and 
Equinox CEO Harvey Spevak. 
Top of the Morning 
Illustration: Rebecca Zisser / Axios 
AT&T's proposed $85 billion purchase of Time Warner took another turn yesterday. A 
federal judge hearing the Justice Department's lawsuit to block the deal denied a 
request by the telecom giant to disclose communications between Justice Department 
officials, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and the White House about the 
deal. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021097 
• Why it matters: The ruling is a blow to AT&T's attempt to show that the 
lawsuit to block the deal is politically motivated by President Trump's antipathy for 
CNN, which Time Warner owns. AT&T says it wasn't asked to offload any assets as 
part of the deal until after Trump took office. 
• What they're saying: We respect the judge's decision and look forward to 
the upcoming trial, said Dan Petrocelli, who is leading AT&T and Time Warner's 
defense in the case, in a statement. 
• At a hearing on Friday, a Justice Department lawyer said that AT&T's 
argument for the documents didn't make sense. 
• Go deeper: Our report from the courtroom on Friday, when DOJ and AT&T 
presented their arguments. 
Fund scoop: Niv Dror, who joined AngelList through its acquisition of Product Hunt 
in 2016, is raising a small early-stage fund focused on consumer products, multiple 
sources tell Axios. Dror declined to comment. 
• The fund will raise at least $1 million, though one source says it could go up to 
$2-3 million. 
• Like Product Hunt colleague Ryan Hoover's own VC fund, Dror's will be 
managed on the back-end by AngelList. 
Same old story: Yesterday, I grabbed coffee with Day One Ventures founder Masha 
Drokova, and heard a familiar—and still disappointing—story: While raising her fund, 
she was told by prospective investors that she should get a male co-founder. 
• She initially considered the suggestion, she told me, before remembering it's 
rooted in sexism. 
Softbank $$$: Softbank's Vision Fund is in early talks to raise additional funds from 
Bahrain's sovereign wealth fund, Mumtalakat, the latter's CEO told Reuters. 
• The Persian Gulf has been a major source of funds for the Vision Fund: Public 
Investment Fund, Saudi Arabia's main sovereign wealth fund, and Abu Dhabi's 
Mubadala, are already investors. 
• And it's not the only one visiting the region's investors—funds focused on tokens 
and cryptocurrencies have also been fundraising in the area, I'm told. 
Unicorn stampede: We're not even two months into 2018 and yet, seven startups 
have already seen their private valuations cross the $1 billion mark—earning unicorn 
status—according to Pitchbook. Last year: 53. The word overvalued comes to mind...

The BFD 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021098 
Photo: George Rose/Getty Images 
Broadcom has adjusted its takeover offer for Qualcomm to $79 per share, down from 
the its best and final bid of $82. The move is a response to Qualcomm's 
announcement yesterday it would pay $127.50 a share for NXP, up from the $ilo it 
had offered. 
• Why it's the BFD: Broadcom and Qualcomm's takeover dance has taken a 
dramatic turn for what should have been a boring transaction between two chip 
companies. 
• Bottom line: Broadcom has long said its acquisition of the San Diego-based 
chipmaker is contingent on Qualcomm buying NXP at the previously agreed price, 
saving a large amount of cash Broadcom could hypothetically use for its own purposes 
once the acquisition goes through... Qualcomm raised its NXP bid to secure support 
from activist investors who have piled into NXP and demanded a higher sale price. —

Far more worrying, however, than the effect on friends and allies of
the utopian excursion toward global zero is the effect of such
thinking on such dangerous adversaries as Iran and North Korea. Is
there any reason to believe that our embrace of that goal will
discourage them from the vigorous pursuit of nuclear weapons? What
could be more encouraging to Iran than the idea that they will be
getting into the nuclear business just as we are getting out? Imagine
Iran’s supreme council meeting to discuss whether to continue the
costly pursuit of nuclear weapons. “But what is the point of building
these weapons?” asks a skeptical mullah. “We will have one or two
and the Americans have thousands.” Another replies: “Yes, but the
Americans have declared their intention to eliminate nuclear weapons
entirely. They say they have already started down that road. Shultz,
Kissinger, Perry, Nunn, and even Obama himself are committed.
Obama said: ‘We have to insist, yes, we can.’ Did you see them
cheering in Prague? And when they have started getting rid of theirs,
our small arsenal will not seem so puny.”

Of course, proponents of global zero will say that we would never
give up our last nuclear weapons if the Iranians (by that point having
long ago acquired and stockpiled them) did not do the same. This
argument comes close to saying the goal of global zero is a mere
mirage, which leaves one wondering what benefits can be claimed for
chasing it or pretending to believe it is real. International politics is
played out in near real time, and the influence of future events, like
future earnings, is deeply discounted by prudent officials. But one
important point remains: as our nuclear capabilities dwindle, the
value of even a few nuclear weapons rises (toward the end of these
parallel processes, exponentially). This puts a burden on trust and
verification that they simply cannot bear. I was once told by the
prime minister of an important country in Europe that it was all but
impossible to imagine the day when their last nuclear weapon would

Article 5.

NYT

Iran Without Nukes
Roger Cohen

June 13, 2011 — Remember Iran?

I do. It’s been two years since the Iranian people rose up to protest a
stolen election with a bravery that stirred the world and presented
Americans with a truer image of a young and highly educated nation
than the old specter of the bearded Islamic zealot. The Green
Movement was suppressed through barbaric violence but its example
helped kindle the Arab Spring.

As Hamid Dabashi of Columbia University wrote in July, 2009:
“Tehran, I believe, is ground zero of a civil rights movement that will
leave no Muslim or Arab country, or even Israel, untouched.” He
added, “The moving pictures of Iranians flooding colorfully into the
streets have forever altered the visual vocabulary of the global
perception of ‘the Middle East.””

Seldom were there more prescient words.

They were quoted by Nader Hashemi of the University of Denver in a
recent talk on Iran, in which he noted shared Iranian and Arab aims:
“Democracy and dignity, the rule of law and respect for basic human
rights, political transparency and an end to corruption.”

That urge is still powerful in Iran beneath the opaque, directionless
apparatus of the Islamic Republic. Iran is weak now, its ideology as
tired as Osama Bin Laden’s, as marginal to peoples questing to
reconcile their Muslim faith and modernity in new ways.

I would probe this weakness through new approaches. But we are
stuck still with the world’s most paranoid relationship: the American-
Iranian relationship. That’s largely because there’s another way to
remember Iran — as the Godot of nuclear threats, the country always

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016842.txt,"Imagine it is 1958 and you are trying to defend the continental United States against
airborne attack. To distinguish hostile aircraft, one of the things you need, besides a
network of computers and early-warning radar sites, is a map of all commercial air
traffic, updated in real time. The United States built such a system and named it SAGE
(Semi-Automatic Ground Environment). SAGE in turn spawned Sabre, the first
integrated reservation system for booking airline travel in real time. Sabre and its
progeny soon became not just a map as to what seats were available but also a system
that began to control, with decentralized intelligence, where airliners would fly, and
when.

But isn’t there a control room somewhere, with someone at the controls? Maybe
not. Say, for example, you build a system to map highway traffic in real time, simply by
giving cars access to the map in exchange for reporting their own speed and location at
the time. The result is a fully decentralized control system. Nowhere is there any
controlling model of the system except the system itself.

Imagine it is the first decade of the 21st century and you want to track the
complexity of human relationships in real time. For social life at a small college, you
could construct a central database and keep it up to date, but its upkeep would become
overwhelming if taken to any larger scale. Better to pass out free copies of a simple
semi-autonomous code, hosted locally, and let the social network update itself. This code
is executed by digital computers, but the analog computing performed by the system as a
whole far exceeds the complexity of the underlying code. The resulting pulse-frequency
coded model of the social graph becomes the social graph. It spreads wildly across the
campus and then the world.

What if you wanted to build a machine to capture what everything known to the
human species means? With Moore’s Law behind you, it doesn’t take too long to digitize
all the information in the world. You scan every book ever printed, collect every email
ever written, and gather forty-nine years of video every twenty-four hours, while tracking
where people are and what they do, in real time. But how do you capture the meaning?

Even in the age of all things digital, this cannot be defined in any strictly logical
sense, because meaning, among humans, isn’t fundamentally logical. The best you can
do, once you have collected all possible answers, is to invite well-defined questions and
compile a pulse-frequency weighted map of how everything connects. Before you know
it, your system will not only be observing and mapping the meaning of things, it will start
constructing meaning as well. In time, it will control meaning, in the same way as the
traffic map starts to control the flow of traffic even though no one seems to be in control.

There are three laws of artificial intelligence. The first, known as Ashby’s Law, after
cybernetician W. Ross Ashby, author of Design for a Brain, states that any effective
control system must be as complex as the system it controls.

The second law, articulated by John von Neumann, states that the defining
characteristic of a complex system is that it constitutes its own simplest behavioral
description. The simplest complete model of an organism is the organism itself. Trying
to reduce the system’s behavior to any formal description makes things more
complicated, not less.

of the communications of its adversaries. Even though the Cold War
had been declared over after the collapse of the Soviet Union a quar-
ter of a century earlier, the age-old enterprise of espionage did not
end with it. Russia and China still sought to blunt the edge that the
NSA gave the United States. The Snowden breach therefore needs to
be considered in the context of the once and future intelligence war.

The modern enterprise of reading the communications of other
nations traces back in the United States to military code-breaking
efforts preceding America’s entry into World War I. The invention
of the radio at the end of the nineteenth century soon provided the
means of rapidly sending and getting messages from ships, subma-
rines, ground forces, spies, and embassies. These over-the-air mes-
sages could also be intercepted from the ether by adversaries. If they
were to remain secret, they could not be sent in plain text. They
had to be sent in either code, in which letters are substituted for one
another, or, more effectively, a cipher, in which numbers are sub-
stituted for letters. Making and breaking codes and ciphers became
a crucial enterprise for nations. By 1914, the U.S. Army and Navy

® had set up units, staffed by mathematicians, linguists, and crossword ©
puzzle solvers, to intercept and decode enemy messages. After the
war had ended in 1918, these units were fused into a cover corpora-
tion called the Code Compilation Company, which moved to new
offices on Thirty-Seventh Street and Madison Avenue in New York
City.

Under the supervision of the famous cryptographer Herbert O.
Yardley, a team of twenty code breakers was employed in what was
called the Black Chamber. Yardley arranged for Western Union,
which had the telegraph monopoly in America, to provide the Black
Chamber with all the telegrams coming into the United States. “Its
far-seeking eyes penetrate the secret conference chambers at Wash-
ington, Tokyo, London, Paris, Geneva, Rome,” Yardley wrote about
the Black Chamber. “Its sensitive ears catch the faintest whispering
in the foreign capitals of the world.” But in 1929, at the instructions
of President Herbert Hoover, Secretary of State Henry Stimson
closed the Black Chamber, saying famously, “Gentlemen should not
read each other’s mail.”

The moratorium did not last long. With war looming in Asia and

The protestors were demanding political reforms, dissatisfied with the cruel and authoritarian regime of Bashar al-Assad, who has been in power for more than ten years, succeeding his father after a 30-year rule. The government responded by opening fire. Within a few months, a peaceful uprising grew into a full-scale civil war, which has lasted for more than two years and is unlikely to end soon. This August, the death toll in Syria has reached 100,000. More than a quarter of the 22 million population has been displaced, hundreds of thousands of refugees have left the country. 

The United States has been supporting the opposition, supplying it with food and medical aid, but refraining from military intervention and from providing the rebels with weapons. The Obama administration claimed that the US would not intervene unless it had strong evidence of chemical weapons used by the Assad regime. In June 2013, Washington concluded that chemical weapons, including nerve agent sarin, classified by The United Nations as a weapon of mass destruction, had been used. The White House announced for the first time in June that it was going to send weapons to the opposition. Congress vetoed this resolution. 

There are many reasons why the US should refrain from providing the opposition with weapons. Over the two years of military confrontation, the situation on the ground has become increasingly chaotic. It is important to understand that there is no united opposition capable of overthrowing / toppling Assad’s regime. Instead, there are different military groups, using terrorist methods against the government forces, as well as against each other. The most prominent of them, the Free Syrian Army, is not strong enough to defeat Assad’s forces. Even if the US provides the FSA with light weapons, this opposition group is outnumbered by hundreds of thousands against Assad’s army. Even according to the most exaggerated estimates, the size of the FSA does not exceed 20,000 soldiers, while Assad’s army counts as many as 400,000, equipped with heavy and sophisticated weapons. 

Due to the uprising, different extremist military groups have been able to cross the border and enter Syria. One of the leading armed groups, Al-Nusra Front, an affiliate of the world’s largest terrorist organizations Al-Qaeda, has been included by the US in the international terrorism blacklist. It is important to note that these rebels have many supply channels, making it impossible for the US to control which group will be receiving the weapons, creating the risk of the US arms being used by terrorists against America or its allies in the region. 

Moreover, after two years of fighting against the regime, the opposition forces have started to turn guns on each other, fighting for power and territory. This significantly undermines their ability to form a united government, decreasing the probability of a strong alternative force. Providing military groups with weapons will only escalade the violence, lead to more massacre and destruction. 

More importantly, even if the Assad’s regime is overthrown, the opposition is unlikely to succeed in forming a stable and functional democratic government. Admittedly, Bashar Assad has made immense mistakes since the beginning of the war. Human rights have been viciously violated, tens of thousands of people, including civilians, have been killed. But it appears that there is no better alternative at the moment than Assad remaining in power. Once the regime is overthrown, the power vacuum is inevitable. Removing Mr. Assad is just a tiny part of a long and troublesome process. If history is any guide, overthrowing a dictatorship is just the very first step. Ouster of Muammar Quaddafi in Libya was supposed to bring democracy and stability. Instead, the country is more destabilized than ever. Two years after the revolution, a significant part of Libya remains under the control of the militias, the armed groups who did not cease power even after the parliamentary elections and continue to use force against the government. 

The situation is even worse in Iraq, where Al-Qaeda has been expanding its power again. The past four months have been among the bloodiest since 2008, with death toll reaching 3,000. The Al-Qaeda affiliate, The Islamic State of Iraq, started conducting terrorist attacks, not only against the government forces and Shia mosques, but also the civilians, further destabilizing the week government. The Islamic State of Iraq has become one of the most prominent military groups fighting in Syria. The terrorist groups are trying to destabilize and debase Syria, which would give them an opportunity to create there a platform to plan international terrorist attacks. If the opposition forces gain control of the country, this scenario is almost inevitable. Subsequently, the conflict in Syria is dramatically impacting its neighboring countries. More than a million of refugees from Syria have fled to Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon and Iraq. 

Some critics, looking at the turmoil in Syria, Egypt, Lybia, claim that the warm Arab spring has turned into a cold winter. Tunisia, for example, the first of the Arab countries to overthrow their dictatorship, is on the edge of another civil war after two political assassinations. It might take years until the situation in Syria stabilizes, decades until the country turns into a genuine and a true democracy. If Americans are to learn from their mistakes in Iraq and Libya, military intervention is off the table. To stop Syria’s turmoil, the United States needs a new strategy aimed at pressuring both sides into negotiating. Syrian conflict cannot be resolved by military methods. The only way to end the war is through political dialogue. Providing the rebels with weapons would only aggravate the situation and lead to more deaths and casualties.

To make a ton of money with specific reasons and defined dreams to chase, timelines and steps

To have more.

To have more quality and less clutter. To have huge financial reserves but recognize that most
material wants are justifications for spending time on the things that don’t really matter, including
buying things and preparing to buy things. You spent two weeks negotiating your new Infiniti with the
dealership and got $10,000 off? That’s great. Does your life have a purpose? Are you contributing
anything useful to this world, or just shuffling papers, banging on a keyboard, and coming home to a
drunken existence on the weekends?

To reach the big pay-off, whether IPO, acquisition, retirement, or other pot of gold.
To think big but ensure payday comes every day: cash flow first, big payday second.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018598.txt,"Of all the social-justice acts out there, I actually think veganism is one of the lowest-
hanging fruit. It's just so easy that the only reason non-vegan culture can possibly persist
is through a really high degree of not giving a shit. In a way, that's understandable; I don't
have much of a connection to animals myself. A lot of my vegan friends love animals and
want to be around them all the time; I don't. If a smelly dog never jumps on me again, it
will be too soon. But the fact is, animals have senses and feelings. Interacting with any
animal for longer than thirty seconds can conclusively show you that animals like and
dislike things, and that they feel something that looks exactly like pain. Which brings me
to...

2. If you care about consent, then veganism is transparently the right thing to do. There
are environmental arguments and stuff, but I mean, seriously, let's call a spade a spade:
when you eat meat, you're eating the murdered body of an animal who died for no reason
other than your transient pleasure. As for animal products: many things that happen to
animals on factory farms are abominable and obscene, as two minutes of Googling or this_
website or this video can show you.

Even if you decide to eat animal products that come only from well-treated animals,
there's no way to be sure that those animals were actually well-treated unless you're
raising them yourself. As this vegan FAO points out, there's an amazing amount of
animal suffering that still occurs on humane farms. (Sa/on has written about it, too.)
Some of those farms are doubtless fairly pleasant for the animals, but others.... Well, let's
just say that calling some humane farms more merciful than factory farms is like saying
that being burned alive is preferable to dying in a medieval torture device.

Personally, when I went vegan, a lot of the reason it felt easy was because I no longer had
to spend tons of mental energy suppressing my empathy. I was amazed at how relieved I
felt. Again, I'm not pretending to be perfect about it -- I eat non-vegan food sometimes in
social situations, sometimes when it's about to be thrown away, and sometimes just when
I'm drunk. If you need to make accommodations in order to feel comfortable being
vegan, then I'm the last person who will criticize you. I'll just be glad you're taking steps
towards being vegan.

It took me a long time to decide to go vegan, and I understand that it might take you a
long time, too. I've listed a lot of resources in this post and I hope you'll consider looking
at them. Questions are welcome in the comments, although I may not be able to answer
them. I wish you luck. And if you're already vegan, then congratulations and high-5!

Now for recipes!

I promise that these recipes are beloved by non-vegans as well as vegans. In fact, even

when I wasn't vegan, they were some of my favorites. When I feed these dishes to non-
vegans, they are frequently startled that the food isn't vegan. (Sometimes I save the Big
Reveal for last. Heh, heh.)

(One of my other favorite gentle pro-vegan tactics is to walk into restaurants and ask if
they have anything vegan on the menu. When the answer is no, I smile and thank them
and leave.)

Organic and fair-trade ingredients are obviously encouraged. I'm not as good about

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018598

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020007.txt,"not to react to this heresy.

It was Bannon who held the line, insisting, sternly, that Obamacare was a litmus
Republican issue, and that, holding a majority in Congress, they could not face Republican
voters without having made good on the by now Republican catechism of repeal. Repeal,
in Bannon’s view, was the pledge, and repeal would be the most satisfying, even cathartic,
result. It would also be the easiest one to achieve, since virtually every Republican was
already publicly committed to voting for repeal. But Bannon, seeing health care as a weak
link in Bannonism-Trumpism’s appeal to the workingman, was careful to take a back seat
in the debate. Later, he hardly even made an effort to rationalize how he’d washed his
hands of the mess, saying just, “I hung back on health care because it’s not my thing.”

It was Ryan who, with “repeal and replace,” obfuscated the issue and won over Trump.
Repeal would satisfy the Republican bottom line, while replace would satisfy the
otherwise off-the-cuff pledges that Trump had made on his own. (Pay no attention to the
likelihood that what the president construed as repeal and replace might be very different
from what Ryan construed as repeal and replace.) “Repeal and replace” was a useful
slogan, too, in that it came to have meaning without having any actual or specific
meaning.

The week after the election, Ryan, bringing Tom Price—the Georgia congressman and
orthopedist who had become Ryan’s resident heath care expert—traveled to Trump’s
Bedminster, New Jersey, estate for a repeal and replace briefing. The two men summed up
for Trump—who kept wandering off topic and trying to turn the conversation to golf—
seven years of Republican legislative thinking about Obamacare and the Republican
alternatives. Here was a perfect example of an essential Trump paradigm: he acceded to
anyone who seemed to know more about any issue he didn’t care about, or simply one
whose details he couldn’t bring himself to focus on closely. Great! he would say,
punctuating every statement with a similar exclamation and regularly making an effort to
jump from his chair. On the spot, Trump eagerly agreed to let Ryan run the health care bill
and to make Price the Health and Human Services secretary.

Kushner, largely staying silent during the health care debate, publicly seemed to accept
the fact that a Republican administration had to address Obamacare, but he privately
suggested that he was personally against both repeal alone and repeal and replace. He and
his wife took a conventional Democratic view on Obamacare (it was better than the
alternatives; its problems could be fixed in the future) and strategically believed it was
best for the new administration to get some easier victories under its belt before entering a
hard-to-win or no-win fight. (What’s more, Kushner’s brother Josh ran a health insurance
company that depended on Obamacare.)

Not for the last time, then, the White House would be divided along the political
spectrum, Bannon taking an absolutist base position, Priebus aligned with Ryan in support
of the Republican leadership, and Kushner maintaining, and seeing no contradiction in, a

was a place to begin. The Internet provided the SVR with just this
opportunity. As you will recall, holes in the security of the com-
puter networks of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management and
USIS and the websites of the companies supplying the NSA with
independent contractors had made the background checks on Ameri-
can intelligence workers available to the Chinese, and presumably
other adversary intelligence service hackers, since 2011. If the SVR
had access to this personnel data, the research for a candidate would
be greatly facilitated. From the 127-page Standard Form 86, which
each applicant for a security clearance submits, the SVR could filter
out intelligence workers employed by the NSA by their educational
background, employment history, affiliations, and foreign contacts.
It could then search this data for candidates with a possible hacktiv-
ist profile.

This data could next be crossed with a list of individuals the SVR
knew were in contact with high-profile activists who were part of the
anti-surveillance movements. This would include core participants
in the Tor Project, WikiLeaks, Noisebridge, CryptoParties, the Free-

© dom of the Press Foundation, and the Electronic Frontier Founda- ©
tion. (Snowden, for example, had been in touch with members of all
these groups in 2012 and 2013.)

The SVR would have little problem monitoring even encrypted
communications with leading figures in the anti-surveillance world.
These activists, despite secrecy rituals such as putting their cell
phones in refrigerators, remain visible to a sophisticated intelligence
service such as the SVR. All the defensive tactics of Laura Poitras,
including PGP encryption, Tor software, and air-gapped computers
(computers that have never been connected to the Internet), did not
keep secrets about her sources entirely to herself. Snowden, at a time
when he was stealing NSA secrets in February 2013, went to great
lengths to impress on Poitras the need for operational security about
his contacts with her, but that injunction did not prevent her from
telling at least five people about her source, including Micah Lee, the
Berkeley-based technology operative for the Freedom of the Press
Foundation; Jacob Appelbaum, the Tor proselytizer; Ben Wizner, the
ACLU lawyer; Barton Gellman; and Glenn Greenwald. “It is not me

Instead of seeking a job in Japan, Snowden sought to join the Special Forces through the 18X
program. It was an Army Reserve program created in 2003 that allowed individuals who had not
served in the military or completed their education, to train to be a Special Forces recruit. He
listed his religion on the application as “Buddhist” because, as he explained in a sardonic post on
Ars Technica, “Agnostic is strangely absent” from the form.”

He enlisted in the army reserves on May 7, 2004, according to U.S. Army records. He
reported for a 10 week basic training at Fort Benning, Georgia. That was standard course for all
enlistees in the infantry. In August, he began a three-week course in of parachute jumping but did
not complete that training. US Army records show he did not complete the training requirements
and received no commendations. As Snowden put it in his Internet postings, he “washed out.”
He was discharged on September 29, 2004, ending his 19 week military career. Snowden would
later claim on the Internet that he returned to civilian life because he had injured himself by
breaking both legs. An Army spokesman said, however, that he could not confirm that Snowden
injured his legs or that he was in fact dropped from the program for medical reasons. Under his
alias TheTrueHooHa he wrote that “they [the Army] held on to me until the doctors cleared me
to be discharged, and then after being cleared they held onto me for another month just for shits
and giggles.” He attributed this treatment in the Army, as he would later attribute his problems in
the CIA and NSA, to the inferior intelligence of his superiors, He wrote in his post “Psych
problems = dishonorable discharge depending on how much they hate you. Lots of alleged homos
were in the hold unit, too, but they only got a general discharge at best.” It is not entirely clear
whether or not Snowden actually injured himself. If he had broken his legs, it was not evident to
Joyce Kinsey, his next door neighbor, who told me that she never saw Snowden on crutches when
he returned to his mother’s condominium in September 2004. Whether or not he broke his legs,
Army records show that he did not receive a medical discharge. He received an “administrative
discharge.” Unlike a medical discharge which is given because a soldier has sustained injuries
that prevent him from performing his duties, an administrative discharge is a “morally-neutral”
form of separation given to a soldier when her or she is deemed for non-medical reasons
inappropriate for military service. Snowden himself preferred to voice a medical explanation for
his severance, just as he had claimed a medical reason for dropping out of high school (and would
later claim he needed medical treatment for epilepsy at the NSA.)

When he returned home from Fort Benning, Georgia on September 28, 2004, he was 21.
Having failed in his attempt to join the Special Forces, he returned to his mother’s condominium
in Elliott City, where he remained unemployed for several months. He took a job as a security
guard at the University of Maryland’s Center for Advanced Study of Language. According to his
Ars Technica postings, he worked the night shift from six in the evening to six in the morning.
Because intelligence officers took its language courses, Snowden had to take a polygraph exam to
get the job. After he passed it, he was hired and given his first security clearance But he had
higher ambitions than being a campus security guard, It was only a temporary stop gap for him.

The only chink in the armor of AI is that word “vast”; human possibilities, thanks to
language and the culture that it spawns, are truly Vast.!° No matter how many patterns
we may find with AI in the flood of data that has so far found its way onto the Internet,
there are Vastly more possibilities that have never been recorded there. Only a fraction
(but not a Vanishing fraction) of the world’s accumulated wisdom and design and
repartee and silliness has made it onto the Internet, but probably a better tactic for the
judge to adopt when confronting a candidate in the Turing Test is not to search for such
items but to create them anew. AI in its current manifestations is parasitic on human
intelligence. It quite indiscriminately gorges on whatever has been produced by human
creators and extracts the patterns to be found there—including some of our most
pernicious habits.'! These machines do not (yet) have the goals or strategies or capacities
for self-criticism and innovation to permit them to transcend their databases by
reflectively thinking about their own thinking and their own goals. They are, as Wiener
says, helpless, not in the sense of being shackled agents or disabled agents but in the
sense of not being agents at all—not having the capacity to be “moved by reasons” (as
Kant put it) presented to them. It is important that we keep it that way, which will take
some doing.

One of the flaws in Weizenbaum’s book Computer Power and Human Reason,
something I tried in vain to convince him of in many hours of discussion, is that he could
never decide which of two theses he wanted to defend: AJ is impossible! or Al is possible
but evil! He wanted to argue, with John Searle and Roger Penrose, that “Strong AI” is
impossible, but there are no good arguments for that conclusion. After all, everything we
now know suggests that, as I have put it, we are robots made of robots made of robots. . .
down to the motor proteins and their ilk, with no magical ingredients thrown in along the
way. Weizenbaum’s more important and defensible message was that we should not
strive to create Strong AI and should be extremely cautious about the AI systems that we
can create and have already created. As one might expect, the defensible thesis is a
hybrid: A/ (Strong AJ) is possible in principle but not desirable. The AI that’s practically
possible is not necessarily evil—unless it is mistaken for Strong AI!

The gap between today’s systems and the science-fictional systems dominating
the popular imagination is still huge, though many folks, both lay and expert, manage to
underestimate it. Let’s consider IBM’s Watson, which can stand as a worthy landmark
for our imaginations for the time being. It is the result of a very large-scale R&D process
extending over many person-centuries of intelligent design, and as George Church notes
in these pages, it uses thousands of times more energy than a human brain (a
technological limitation that, as he also notes, may be temporary). Its victory in
Jeopardy! was a genuine triumph, made possible by the formulaic restrictions of the
Jeopardy! rules, but in order for it to compete, even these rules had to be revised (one of

10 Tn Darwin’s Dangerous Idea, 1995, p. 109, I coined the capitalized version, Vast, meaning Very much
more than ASTronomical, and its complement, Vanishing, to replace the usual exaggerations infinite and
infinitesimal for discussions of those possibilities that are not officially infinite but nevertheless infinite for
all practical purposes.

have recently gotten along quite well , I thought . Neither Joslin or Brad understood a 180 million dollar

emblematic of a sloppy office , brad said lets not talk about emblems??! bill pay , admittedly no change
for the year. . plane not done. though it was the only thing i suggested doing first in july. . I sent youa

things he knows little or nothing about. tax issues. 1031. neg basis , note payoffs ( the same idea he
said he had had from the beggining??!!) . answers re LBF holdings that can be corrected ( they cant) .

33 USAM § 9-28.300. When evaluating the pervasiveness of wrongdoing
within the corporation, prosecutors are advised that while it may be
appropriate to charge a corporation for minor misconduct where the
wrongdoing was pervasive, “it may not be appropriate to impose liability
upon a corporation, particularly one with a robust compliance program in
place, under a strict respondeat superior theory for the single isolated act
of a rogue employee.” /d. § 9-28.500.A (emphasis added), Prosecutors
should also consider a company’s compliance program when examining
any remedial actions taken, including efforts to implement an effective
compliance program or to improve an existing one. As the commentary
explains, “although the inadequacy ofa corporate compliance program is
a factor to consider when deciding whether to charge a corporation, that
corporation’s quick recognition of the flaws in the program and its efforts
to improve the program are also factors to consider as to appropriate
disposition ofa case.” Id. § 9-28.900.B. Finally, the Principles of Federal
Prosecution of Business Organizations provides that prosecutors should
consider the existence and effectiveness of the corporation's pre-existing
compliance program in determining how to treat a corporate target. Td.
§ 9-28.800.

Mr. John Roth
June 19, 2008
Page 12

the telephone (which we deny), it is black letter law that the mens rea must coincide with the actus
reus. Thus, the government must prove that Mr. Epstein has the specific intent to target a known
minor to engage in prohibited sexual activity at the time of the call. We have seen zero evidence of
this. To the extent Mr. Epstein /ater may have persuaded a particular individual to engage in
unlawful sexual activity during a massage, such persuasion occurred face to face, and can not work
retroactively to render the earlier phone call an offense under the statute.

As to the: purported violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423 for allegedly traveling in interstate
commerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual activity, CEOS does not deny that Mr. Epstein
was returning to one of his residences when he traveled to Florida.* CEOS explicitly stated it “fully
understand[s] our argument” (CEOS letter at p.2) that Mr. Epstein should not be charged under
§ 2423(b) because the dominant purpose for his traveling to Palm Beach was not to engage in illegal
sexual activity, but to simply return to one of his residences. Rather, this is apparently another
“compelling” point of law which may be left to “a court to decide whether the law properly reaches
such conduct.” (CEOS letter at p. 2).° Notably, implicit in this concession by CEOS is that the law -
has never before been so applied, that is, there is no precedent for a court to extend the statute as the
USAO seeks to do here. In fact, the United States Supreme Court prohibited the criminalization of
travel under identical circumstances over a half century ago. See, Mortenson v. United States, 322
US. 369, 374 (1944) (intention to engage in proscribed conduct must “exist before the conclusion of
the interstate journey and must be the dominate motive of such interstate movement.” (Emphasis
added.)

Beyond an absence of proof regarding the travel element in connection with 18 U.S.C. §2423,
the requisite age requirement for a violation of that statute is important. 18 U.S.C. §2423, by
reference to Chapter 109A (18 U.S.C. §2423(f)(1)), specifically defines a minor for purposes of that
statute as an individual who has not attained the age of 16. If an alleged victim is 16 years of age or
older, a violation of this statute pursuant to 2423(f)(1) can only occur if it can be proven that force,
threat or drugs were involved. See, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2241 et seg. There are no such allegations here. As
a result, in order to find a violation under 18 U.S.C. § 2423, the United States would have to prove
that Mr. Epstein engaged in one of the sexual acts defined at 18 U.S.C. § 2246(2) with an individual
under the age of 16, and that he formed the intent and dominant purpose to do so prior to the time he
made a return trip to Florida. Again, there is no such evidence here. [IMM has specifically
testified that 1) she never engaged in sexual activity with Mr. Epstein; 2) she never even met or
talked to Mr. Epstein prior to her arrival at his house; and 3) she lied about her age not only to Mr.
Epstein, but, in fact, to the world on her MySpace page when she said that she was 18 years old. Itis,
then, also worth noting in this regard that 18 U.S.C. §§2243(c) provides an affirmative defense if
proven by a preponderance of the evidence if Mr. Epstein reasonably believed that EEE was

4 In addition to his residence there, Mr. Epstein also has several businesses, and personal matters and contacts to which
he attends in Florida. For example, beginning in 2002, Mr. Epstein visited his mother nearly every weekend in Palm
Beach until she passed away in April, 2004.

5 As previously set forth herein, and as more fully explained in other submissions related to this case, the recent
Supreme Court decisions in Santos and Cuellar make this attempted stretch of the law improper.

The AKP’s religious bent, disconcerting in itself, can easily spin out
of control. The lesson of the AKP experience for the Arab world,
particularly give that Muslim Brotherhood-led governments may take
over in the region, is that religious orthodoxy is an ideological beauty
contest in which the winner is always the ugly guy.

organizations or identifiable leaders, and the opposition’s ideological
focus is unclear, beyond slogans calling for an end to corruption and
repression.

Optimists see this as an implicit acceptance of democratic values and
assumptions. Despite the increasingly desperate efforts of the
region’s authoritarian governments to keep their people in the dark
about the realities of the outside world by restricting information, the
younger generation identifies with its peers in the liberal West and it
knows what it is missing in access to material and educational
benefits as well as civil and democratic rights. The problem is that
while the Facebook generation knows what it doesn’t like, it is far
from clear that there are structures in place, or being planned, that
could provide the basis for an alternative political system if the
regime collapses. Pessimists envisage a scenario encapsulated in the
phrase “one man, one vote, one time” leading to a Salafist takeover
and a settling of scores against minorities (including Christians) who
were protected by the regime or benefited from its pluralist approach.
More than 70 percent of the Syrian population are Sunni.

How did Syria come to this pass? While some observers see in recent
events a parallel with 1989, with the break-up of the East
European-style system introduced by the Baathists in the 1960s, this
is no velvet revolution, nor is Syria like Jaruzelski’s Poland. The
regime’s violence is not ideological. It is far from being the result of
an emotional or philosophical commitment to a party that long ago
abandoned its agenda of promoting secular Arab republican values
and aspirations. The regime’s ruthless attachment to power lies in a
complex web of tribal loyalties and networks of patronage
underpinned by a uniquely powerful religious bond.

The Alawis of Syria, who make up only 12 percent of its population,
split from the main branch of Shiism more than a thousand years ago.

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022251.txt,"According to a few of the attorneys who represented Epstein's victims in the civil cases, the financier
never agreed to a psychological evaluation prior to or during his sentence, a requirement of all sexual
predators.

While Epstein's self-incriminating statements are published (this week he told the Post the crime that
was supposedly committed in Florida is not a crime in New York -- an interesting choice of words -- he
continues to mock the law that applies to all other sex offenders who are found guilty of the same crime.
Epstein served 13 months in the West Palm Beach Stockade and 18 months under community control (a
rather permissive version of house arrest), for 2 Counts of Solicitation of Prostitution with a Minor.

In August of 2010, immediately following his release from community control, Epstein returned to his
$50 million East 71st Street town house given to him by his former client and long time friend Leslie
Wexner.

Just in the last few weeks he held a house warming dinner to celebrate his release from jail and
reportedly invited television reporters Katie Couric, Charlie Rose, George Stephanopoulus and his close
friend, HRH Prince Andrew, according to the NY Post.

You would think these professional television reporters would have done their homework prior to
accepting his invitation no matter how desperate they were to rub elbows with Prince Andrew.
According to a 53-page sealed indictment Epstein was facing 10 years to life on multiple counts of
statutory rape, and child sex trafficking.

Court documents in that case claimed he routinely sought out girls as young as 14 and paid them $200 to
$1,000 for sexually explicit massages in his homes in Palm Beach, Fla., and Manhattan.

In the New York sex-offender database, Epstein isn't registered under a zip code rather a name search
option that does not list his New York address.

The reason for this is because Epstein's Upper East Side home is considered temporary and by NY state
law, he is required to provide only his permanent address to the database.

Epstein is currently listed under his Florida home even though he is no longer a Florida resident either
(after his arrest he immediately became a US VI resident), but then again who's keeping count?

Once again these are mere technicalities when it comes to Epstein's sexual predator case. The two most
disturbing parts of this story are that this could easily happen again and that once again there will be no
Justice.

Had Epstein been a caring benefactor contributing to society and these young girl's education and well
being then the world would have judged him differently.

What he has done instead is the exact opposite -- causing enormous damage to hundreds of underage
girls who could have been sponsored towards a better education.

With respect to Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance, I'm confused by his decision to allow this sexual predator to
live at his Fifth Avenue house all this time (since August 2010), given his rather tough stance on gun
control as witnessed by his testimony in Friday's NYPost when asked about a Florida driver cleared ina
Manhattan weapon's charge, guns brought illegally into New York City he said,  for any reason
violate well established state laws and are a threat to our public safety.

Then wouldn't a registered sex offender living 500 feet from a park (Central Park where young girls
congregate), and with resources to spare be an even more dangerous threat to society?

6.7 Conclusion

To thoroughly describe a comprehensive, integrative AGI architecture in a brief chapter would
be an impossible task; all we have attempted here is a brief overview, to be elaborated on in
the 800-odd pages of Part 2 of this book. We do not expect this brief summary to be enough to
convince the skeptical reader that the approach described here has a reasonable odds of success
at achieving its stated goals, or even of fulfilling the conceptual notions outlined in the preceding
chapters. However, we hope to have given the reader at least a rough idea of what sort of AGI
design we are advocating, and why and in what sense we believe it can lead to advanced artificial
general intelligence. For more details on the structure, dynamics and underlying concepts of
CogPrime, the reader is encouraged to proceed to Part 2- after completing Part 1, of course.
Please be patient — building a thinking machine is a big topic, and we have a lot to say about
it!

Baath (renaissance) party jointly founded by two intellectuals, Michel
Aflag and Salah al-Din Bitar, with an agenda explicitly aimed at
overcoming sectarian divisions.

It would be wrong to suppose that the Alawis deliberately sought to
subvert or take over the Baath or the armed forces. Their primary
impulse was their own security. After independence the Syrian
parliament abolished the separate representation for minorities
instituted by the French, along with certain judicial rights. Nusayri
sheikhs and notables encouraged young men to join the Baath
because they believed its secular outlook would protect them from
Sunni hegemony and persecution. Other minorities, including
Christians, Druzes, and Ismailis, tended to join the Baath (or in some
cases the Communist Party and Syrian Socialist National Party) for
similar reasons. The eventual dominance achieved by the Alawis may
be attributed to their highland military background and the default
logic by which ‘asabiyya tends to assert itself in the absence of other,
more durable structures.

The first three military coups that followed Syrian independence were
engineered by Sunni officers. This was followed by the disastrous
union with Nasser’s Egypt in 1958 when Baath party leaders,
following their pan-Arabist nationalist logic, merged their country’s
identity into that of their more powerful Sunni neighbor. After Syria
formally united with Egypt, Nusayri officers who had joined the
Baath party became increasingly alarmed that Arab nationalism, for
all its secular rhetoric, was really a veil concealing Arab Sunni
supremacy. They formed a clandestine military committee led by
Salah Jadid, an Alawi, which took power in a military coup in 1963.
Hafez al-Assad, trained as a fighter pilot, became air force
commander. Some seven hundred officers were purged, and most of
their positions were filled with Nusayris. A further coup against the
Baathist old guard brought Assad into the cabinet as defense minister

Topics: On lessons learned running the Stratford Inn
Market update: for better or worse, this is the kind of year we were expecting. We were surprised at the market’s unbridled
optimism in April 1 , since the tug-of-war between private sector profits and public sector problems has a long way to go. We
chose the charts on the front page of our 2011 Outlook carefully; they were designed to show that equity markets were priced
inexpensively, but were likely to stay that way, given too much stimulus in the East, and ineffective stimulus in the West 2 . We
expect a modest second half recovery, based primarily on US capital spending increases, easy credit conditions everywhere, and
a pick-up in industrial production in Japan. But the world’s structural problems are weighing on the private sector, and our
portfolios are positioned for a single-digit year in credit, equities and hedge funds.
Something different this week. I was on the road seeing clients last week, and was asked “what should be done about job
growth”. We are investors and not politicians, so my ideas 3 are not relevant. However, it seems to me that anyone involved in
the jobs debate should be required to read the article below, written after the prior deep US recession (1990-1991). It’s
from George McGovern, one of the most liberal politicians 4 ever to hold office and run for President. His epiphanies after
leaving office and running the Stratford Inn are worth considering as legislators contemplate additional job creation measures,
and the broader regulatory environment in which the private sector operates.
“A Politician's Dream Is a Businessman's Nightmare”, by George McGovern 5 , June 1992
Wisdom too often never comes, and so one ought not to reject it merely because it comes late. (Justice Felix
Frankfurter). It's been 11 years since I left the U.S. Senate, after serving 24 years in high public office. After
leaving a career in politics, I devoted much of my time to public lectures that took me into every state in the
union and much of Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America.
In 1988, I invested most of the earnings from this lecture circuit acquiring the leasehold on Connecticut's
Stratford Inn. Hotels, inns and restaurants have always held a special fascination for me. The Stratford Inn
promised the realization of a longtime dream to own a combination hotel, restaurant and public conference
facility--complete with an experienced manager and staff. In retrospect, I wish I had known more about the
hazards and difficulties of such a business, especially during a recession of the kind that hit New England just as
I was acquiring the inn's 43-year leasehold. I also wish that during the years I was in public office, I had had
this firsthand experience about the difficulties business people face every day. That knowledge would have
made me a better U.S. senator and a more understanding presidential contender.
Today we are much closer to a general acknowledgment that government must encourage business to expand and
grow. Bill Clinton, Paul Tsongas, Bob Kerrey and others have, I believe, changed the debate of our party 6 .
We intuitively know that to create job opportunities we need entrepreneurs who will risk their capital
against an expected payoff. Too often, however, public policy does not consider whether we are choking
off those opportunities.
1 The Osama Bin Laden episode marked the equity market peak for the year. Some commentators saw this event as a basis for
further optimism, but unsurprisingly, the positive glow lasted for only around 2.5 hours the subsequent Monday. According to the
Congressional Research Service, over the last decade, the US has spent at least $1.1 trillion in war funding operations,
surpassing the constant-dollar cost of the Korean and Vietnam Wars combined. This highlights the disproportionately large
pain that small, non-sovereign entities can inflict in the modern era.
2 So far, the large growth and employment multipliers from deficit spending estimated by Christina Romer (former Chair of the
President’s Council of Economic Advisers) have not materialized. John Taylor and John Cogan from Stanford have been closer to
the mark: an initial boost, but then a rapidly fading benefit.
3 I like the idea of extending the holding period for short term capital gains to 3-5 years, and cutting the long term capital
gains rate closer to 5%-10%. It could encourage more business formation, since more of what people create, they keep. If the
cutoff year is properly set, it could be done on a deficit–neutral basis.
4 According to methodology described by Keith Poole of the University of San Diego in the American Journal of Political Science,
McGovern ranks as the 99 th most liberal politician out of 3,320 politicians serving from 1937 to 2002.

conservatism score of 52% in 1995; by 2009, it had fallen to 18%.

Topics: On lessons learned running the Stratford Inn
My own business perspective has been limited to that small hotel and restaurant in Stratford, Conn., with an
especially difficult lease and a severe recession. But my business associates and I also lived with federal, state
and local rules that were all passed with the objective of helping employees, protecting the environment, raising
tax dollars for schools, protecting our customers from fire hazards, etc. While I never doubted the worthiness of
any of these goals, the concept that most often eludes legislators is: `Can we make consumers pay the higher
prices for the increased operating costs that accompany public regulation and government reporting requirements
with reams of red tape.' It is a simple concern that is nonetheless often ignored by legislators 7 . For example,
the papers today are filled with stories about businesses dropping health coverage for employees. We provided a
substantial package for our staff at the Stratford Inn. However, were we operating today, those costs would
exceed $150,000 a year for health care on top of salaries and other benefits. There would have been no
reasonable way for us to absorb or pass on these costs.
Some of the escalation in the cost of health care is attributed to patients suing doctors. While one cannot assess
the merit of all these claims, I've also witnessed firsthand the explosion in blame-shifting and scapegoating for
every negative experience in life. Today, despite bankruptcy, we are still dealing with litigation from
individuals who fell in or near our restaurant. Despite these injuries, not every misstep is the fault of someone
else. Not every such incident should be viewed as a lawsuit instead of an unfortunate accident. And while the
business owner may prevail in the end, the endless exposure to frivolous claims and high legal fees is
frightening.
Our Connecticut hotel, along with many others, went bankrupt for a variety of reasons, the general economy in
the Northeast being a significant cause. But that reason masks the variety of other challenges we faced that drive
operating costs and financing charges beyond what a small business can handle. It is clear that some businesses
have products that can be priced at almost any level. The price of raw materials (e.g., steel and glass) and lifesaving
drugs and medical care are not easily substituted by consumers. It is only competition or antitrust that
tempers price increases. Consumers may delay purchases, but they have little choice when faced with higher
prices. In services, however, consumers do have a choice when faced with higher prices. You may have to stay
in a hotel while on vacation, but you can stay fewer days. You can eat in restaurants fewer times per month, or
forgo a number of services from car washes to shoeshines. Every such decision eventually results in job losses
for someone. And often these are the people without the skills to help themselves--the people I've spent a
lifetime trying to help.
7 Would McGovern’s focus on red tape make sense today? According to surveys conducted by the National Federation of Small
Business, the answer would be yes. The 3 issues most frequently mentioned as each respondent’s “single most important problem”
are Poor Sales, Regulation & Red Tape, and Taxes. Two things of note. First, Regulation & Red Tape concerns have been steadily
rising over the last two years. Secondly, availability of credit does not show up as an issue. As the NFIB wrote in May 2011, “92
percent reported that all their credit needs were met or that they were not interested in borrowing. Eight percent reported that not all
of their credit needs were satisfied. Three percent reported financing as their #1 business problem, so credit supply is not a problem
for the overwhelming majority.”

In short, “one-size-fits-all” rules for business ignore the reality of the market place. And setting thresholds for
regulatory guidelines at artificial levels--e.g., 50 employees or more, $500,000 in sales--takes no account of other
realities, such as profit margins, labor intensive vs. capital intensive businesses, and local market economics.
The problem we face as legislators is: Where do we set the bar so that it is not too high to clear? I don't have
the answer. I do know that we need to start raising these questions more often.
So, there you have it, one of the more remarkable epiphanies in American politics: a paean to entrepreneurship and
government restraint from one of its most progressive members. Public epiphanies like this are rare, but there have been
others. Last year, Al Gore conceded that first-generation ethanol was “not good policy” given its low energy conversion ratios,
and said he had supported ethanol out of “a certain fondness for the farmers in the state of Iowa because I was about to run for
president. 8 In 2008, former Fed Chair Greenspan conceded that his Ayn Rand philosophies regarding regulations and
shareholder self-interest were flawed. Perhaps the most famous epiphany was from Robert McNamara, Secretary of Defense
and one of the principal architects of the Vietnam War. In 1995, he conceded that he was “wrong, terribly wrong” about the
war. George McGovern was one of the war’s fiercest opponents, saying on the floor of the Senate, “I'm tired of old men
dreaming up wars for young men to fight”.
There may be no magic elixir of policies to speed the adjustment the US faces. Look at it this way: the US is trying the megastimulus
route, while the UK has accelerated its fiscal austerity program. Yet both countries are struggling with below-trend
growth and employment. Perhaps after a debt binge, there are no easy answers, other than time. What to do next? McGovern’s
article suggests that an overly interventionist public sector may be the wrong answer, given the unintended consequences.

kibbutz, where we could see the bare-chested young men producing loaf after
loaf of bread, not just for Mishmar Hasharon but villages and towns for miles
around us.

Until our teenage years, we lived in narrow, oblong homes, four of us to a
room, unfurnished except for our beds, under which we placed our pair of shoes
or sandals. At one end of the corridor was a set of shelves where we collected a
clean set of underwear, pants and socks each week. At the other end were the
toilets — at that point, the only indoor toilets on the kibbutz, with real toilet-
seats, rather than just holes in the ground. All of us showered together until the
age of twelve. I can’t think of a single one of us who went on to marry someone
from our own age-group in the kibbutz. It would have seemed almost
incestuous.

Mishmar Hasharon and other kibbutzim have long since abandoned the
practice of collective child-rearing. Some in my generation look back on the
way we were raised not only with regret, but pain: a sense of parental absence,
abandonment or neglect. My own memories, and those of most of the children I
grew up with, are more positive. The irony is that we probably spent more
waking time with our parents than town or city children whose mothers and
fathers worked nine-to-five jobs. The difference came at bedtime, or during the
night. If you woke up unsettled, or ill, the only immediate prospect of comfort
was from the metapeled, or another of the kibbutz grown-ups who might be on
overnight duty. Still, my childhood memories are overwhelmingly of feeling
happy, safe, protected. I do remember waking up once, late on a stormy winter
night when I was nine, in the grips of a terrible fever. I’d begun to hallucinate. I
got to my feet and, without the thought of looking anywhere else for help, made
my wobbly way through the rain to my parents’ room and fell into their bed.
They hugged me. They dabbed my forehead with water. The next morning, my
father wrapped me in a blanket and took me back to the children’s home.

To the extent that I was aware my childhood was different, I was given to
understand it was special, that we were the beating heart of a Jewish state about
to be born. I once asked my mother why other children got to live in their own
apartments in places like Tel Aviv. “They are ironim,” she said. City-dwellers.
Her tone made it clear they were to be viewed as a slightly lesser species.

TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028887.txt,"﻿05/12/2014 the Cathedral – to Shlomo Gazit
     •	As the year 2015 begins, we find ourselves at the height of a historic earthquake, in multiple dimensions, the like of which hasn’t been seen since the end of WWI and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.

     •	In the Middle East – within three years, the Arab spring turned into the Islamic winter – borders have vanished and centuries of conflicts between tribes and factions are erupting onto the surface.

     •	The bi-polar and multi-polar world we knew has been replaced by a world with not even one geopolitical center of gravity. It is a  Gestalt in which everything depends on everything else, and dealing with the challenges requires global cooperation
.
     •	Israel finds itself  at the center of a kind of perfect storm,the only outpost of the western way of life in the Middle East – at the meeting point of the clash of civilizations between Islam and the West, as Huntington envisioned it, and at the same time, in the spinning eye of the storm of the clash of titans within Islam itself: between Sunni and Shi'ite, between tradition, extremism and terrorism on the one hand, and modernity and moderation on the other; between the dream of past glory and the vision of a leap into the future”. And all of this is drenched in a lot of blood.

     •	This drama that has washed over the Arab world bears two lessons and one insight for us:
  The 1st lesson:  Be modest in prophecy. In particular, when it comes to the future. Mubarak for example had about 400,000 people at his disposal working in various security agencies in order to preemptively predict events such as those that took place at Tahrir Square. And he did not foresee the uprising. So who can?

  The 2nd lesson: When friends, and even the leaders among us, say: Don't get swept into a panic – if something really grave happens (Iran for example) – the US will not stand by. The world will take action!

  And I say: Don't bet on it. Look at Syria. Assad has massacred 200,000 of his own people – with tanks, artillery, fighter jets, even chemical weapons – and the world did not lift a finger.

  And the one insight: To all our opponents and even friends who tell us that our lack of success in reaching an agreement with the Palestinians is the root of all the troubles in the Middle East – the original sin! – I say: this is not true!
  Even if I, in 2000 (or Rabin and Peres in 1994 or Olmert in 2008), were to have reached a peace treaty with the Palestinians – which would have been implemented a long time ago the Muslim Brotherhood would still have taken control over Egypt and Al-Sisi would still have taken it back a short time after.

     •	Syria would still have been embroiled in a bitter civil war. And Iran – would still be striving for regional hegemony and nuclear military capability.
     •	The reasons for all the above are deeply rooted in the history of the nations and the region – and do not stem from the Israeli Palestinian conflict (they may be related to it in another way, which I will get to later on).

     •	In the new reality forged by the Arab Spring, there is good news and bad news for us.
Let's start with the bad news:
  ISIS, the disintegration of Syria, the events in Iraq – all of these are bad news that prove to us, time and time again, that the Middle East is indeed a tough neighborhood. There is no mercy for the weak, and there will be no second opportunity for those who don't defend themselves. Every year, new threats arise. And the old ones: Hezbollah, Iran, terrorism –are all alive and kicking and growing even stronger.

  But there is good news too. Israel is the strongest country in the region, from Tripoli in Libya to Tehran. It's the strongest militarily, strategically, and economically, and if we know act wisely–diplomatically too. Equally important: Israel will continue to be the strongest country in the region in the foreseeable future – especially if we manage to identify and cultivate these sources of empowerment and advantage – including:

     •	 Armed Forces capable of defeating any outside combination of threats, including terrorism.
     •	A strong and growing economy in an open relationship with global markets.
     •	Foreign policy that assures international backing, especially American – diplomatic and economic- backing  Israel's positions, and which holds the moral high ground vis-a-vis our enemies and opponents.

     •	The fact that Israel is stronger than any combination of enemies is what enables us to act from a position of strength and self confidence in order to change the reality : to counter the threats and to seize the opportunities.

     •	Let me elaborate briefly about each of the threats:
Two ironies and one insight about Isis.
  Assad slaughtered 200,000 of his people including by using chemical weapons – and that wasn't enough to get the British parliament and Prime Minister Cameron or the American Congress and President Obama to act.
     •	Then, ISIS beheaded two journalists (not really a new practice in the Middle East) in front of the cameras – and within 48 hours the world was united against them. Better late than never, so we have little reason to complain about the result. However, there is something to learn about the superficiality of the decision-making processes in our world.
  Second: let's assume for a moment that ISIS is restrained in about a year (and hopefully – crushed) – who wins?
     •	The main winner is Assad, since the Coalition would have wiped out his main adversary, freeing him to focus more intensely on the rest of the rebels – meaning the moderate rebels, which the Coalition purports to train and reinforce in order to take him down.
  Iran also wins and of course Hezbollah -  all members of President Bush's Axis of Evil. In other words: the Coalition is doing some of the dirty work for them.

     •	In my best assessment, the Turks are right in their position that there is no point in striking ISIS unless you also set a goal to take down Assad, and act to achieve it. 
The Turks are right in their call for a humanitarian strip – 25-30 km into Syrian territory along the borders, and declare it a “no fly zone”, a place for refugees (there are several million of them) to assemble and where they can receive humanitarian aid.

     •	What hasn't been said explicitly is that such a deployment might lead sooner or later to engagement with the Syrian Air Force – followed by the Syrian Air Defense – which could develop into an opportunity to fundamentally change the balance of power and the course of the war against Assad's regime.
  
And one insight: ISIS may not be as strong as it is being portrayed. A coherent ,intense, coordinated action during the next year or two, particularly if performed according to the Turkish outline and with massive Turkish involvement – could well put the Genie back into the bottle. However – let us make no mistake – ISIS is part of the radical Islamic web of terrorism. A web that is loosely knit, yet survives on strictly restricted resources – and demonstrates operational flexibility, survivability and a fanatic adherence to the goal.
     •	We're talking about ALQ, Jabhat al-Nusra in Syria, Lashkar-e-Taiba in India, the Houthis in Yemen, the Shabab in Sumali, Boko Haram in Nigeria and many more – all across the Muslim strip, from Marrakesh to Bangladesh.
     •	And this web is very resilient. Dealing with it will take war lasting for a generation, not just a few years. The struggle will require collaboration not just between the moderate Arab nations and Turkey – but a long-standing collaboration between the US, Russia, China, India and Europe – all are are potential targets and victims of this terror everyone to some extent. Forging this collaboration is categorically more important than the events in Ukraine or the North Chinese Sea Islands.

     •	Hezbollah is busy in Syria – and would generally prefer to avoid provoking Israel. Some here would say that Nasrallah has been deterred, that the memory of 2006 is still fresh in his mind and he will not act. I have my reservations about the deterministic nature of this statement. Deterrence is a somewhat elusive term. This is not a zero sum game on a one-dimensional bar. This is a complex and context-related issue. Although under normal circumstances, each side has a fundamental position (let's assume for a moment that Hezbollah's position is avoid provoking Israel) – it is still not hard to imagine an event, or damage to Hezbollah's (or Nasrallah's) assets or prestige, that could lead it , despite its basic position, to take action contrary to its true fundamental position. 
     •	Incidentally, this doesn't apply solely to Hezbollah – but to us too.
     •	 Therefore, the working assumptions and the operational deployment must include the possibility of deterioration into a wide-scale confrontation with Hezbollah.

     •	And now, to Iran – which under certain circumstances might be the element that ignites or incites Hezbollah into action.
     •	Let us be clear – a nuclear Iran is a central threat to the entire world order, not just Israel. A nuclear Iran means the end of the non-proliferation  regime– Saudi Arabia, within months, Turkey within a few years and Egypt might follow as well–and all will become nuclear.
     •	Every third-grade dictator will be able to ensure his survivability against the outside world by following in the footsteps of Pakistan, North Korea and Iran.
     •	The countdown towards the troubling vision of Prof. Graham Allison of Harvard about nuclear weapons in the hands of terrorists – this countdown, even if it takes 15 years, will start. Therefore, blocking Iran from becoming a threshold nuclear state is crucial, and justifies every effort.

     •	Right now diplomacy is in hiatus at least until March 2015. It's hard to imagine a good agreement with the P5+1, and a bad agreement would be best left unsigned. The problem is that the Iranians have no real incentive to reach a “final agreement” that would keep them from becoming a nuclear power.
     •	As far as they're concerned, at any given time an improved interim agreement would be better (unless the P5+1 yield to a bad agreement.)

     •	The Iranians are very sophisticated. In their opinion (I emphasize: in their opinion), the American government has changed its goal without admitting it, from Iran will not have military nuclear capability. Period. to Iran will not have military nuclear capability on  our watch 
     •
     	•	This is of course a completely different thing. And this perception only reinforces  Iran's obduracy and the delaying tactics that they've adopted.
     •	Israel has a supreme interest in keeping all the options on the table. However, today, mostly against the backdrop of the drawn-out talks – Israel has an interest in maximizing its understanding with the United States and trying to convince it of the need for determination and perseverance; for sticks as well as carrots; and of the importance of completely losing any illusions regarding  the objectives of the Ayatollahs' regime.

     •	And from here, a sharp segue to the diplomatic challenges Israel faces, from the minor (for now) to the major.
     •	Israel is far from being a leaf in the wind. But the world has no geopolitical center of gravity – not the US, Russia, Europe or China –Israel isn't omnipotent either.
     •	It is wrong to disregard what's happening in Europe. It will not be resolved by saying that Europe is ridden with anti-Semitism (though there's quite a bit of truth to that).
     •	Regarding BDS, I used to tell the members of the Cabinet that– as long as these voices are coming from Eritrea or Mauritania, we can live with it for years. When it comes from Scandinavia and Britain – it's a different story, and must be taken seriously.
     •	Right now it is being espoused by parliaments, not governments. But it could expand – to trade unions, to the academia, to consumer organizations and NGOs. And then, heaven forbid, eventually to governments – which will say we are of the people .  We mustn't forget that Europe is Israel's No. 1 trading partner - not the US and not China. And Europe, with North America and a few countries in the East, is at the heart of the reference group of liberal democratic countries to which we want to belong, and rightfully so.

     •	This leads us to the US – and there, the diplomatic challenge is far greater. Israel is a sovereign state. On more than one occasion, I told President Obama, and before that Presidents Bush and Clinton, the following: On issues that we believe are essential to the security and future of Israel and of the Jewish people, Israel will make its decisions alone and on its own responsibility and act upon them. We cannot, and will not want to, I added, delegate the responsibility for such decisions,  when required, even to the best of our friends – which is you.
The US presidents, I note, did not always like this statement – but they respected it.
     •	In the same token, I told members of the cabinet more than once – we must always remember that the US is also a sovereign state. And it expects us to respect its right to form its positions on the issues crucial to it, based on its own interests . And we have to respect that.

     •	Without derogating from our responsibility to make and execute sovereign decisions – the reality is that there isn't full symmetry here.
     •	Our relations with the US President, the administration, the Congress and the American people are vital to the State of Israel.
     •	The United States is Israel's main ally and strategic support. Our relations with it are the cornerstone of Israel's military capabilities, the IDF's qualitative edge, and Israel's strategic and political positioning.
     •	We receive $3 billion a year from the US, going back some 40 years now. What social or economic budget items would we forgo to make up the ₪12 billion gap if this assistance disappears?
     •	They're the only ones who can provide us with F-35 jets, the best aircraft in the world.
     •	These are mutually beneficial relations. The US also benefits from the unprecedented cooperation between our intelligence communities. And so do we.
We never expected, and will never ask others to fight for us – yet the US has deployed advanced radar systems in Israel to provide early warning against long-range missiles, and holds military exercises on our soil and in the Mediterranean , preparing an American response in case Israel has to defend itself against missile attacks from Iran.
     •	We received about $1 billion from the US, by order of President Obama, for Iron Dome, and assistance for the David's Sling and Arrow programs continues.
     •	We turn to the US to veto hostile initiatives against Israel in the United Nations Security Council. Or to soften the conclusions of the Goldstone Commission and its ilk.
     •	It is to them that we turned (and they responded to the best of their ability) in rather tense times, when a handful of our people were besieged in the embassy in Cairo, with an angry mob at the door.
     •	Secretary of State Kerry, and President Obama – went to great lengths – and paid a considerable political (and often personal) price – to help us achieve a breakthrough with the Palestinians, though the effort did not succeed. Nor did we succeed (Rabin and Peres, myself, Olmert and Bibi as well). They shouldn't be ridiculed and debased for this. They should be appreciated. Even if we do not agree on all the details.
     •	We will yet need their help in facing  many trials in the future.

     •	I recommend that we all remember this well. The rules of working with the Americans: Do not marginalize yourself. Do not fold. Yes – remember what the U.S. is for Israel. And Maintain–at almost any cost – mutual relations of trust and respect. It's good for Israel. 
     •	The American Congress, President Obama, Biden and Kerry are part of the solution, even if it tarries. They are not part of the problem.

     •	Ben Gurion used to say, with his iron logic, that the future of Israel depends on our strength and our righteousness.
  Our strength – that is the IDF's might and its strategic capabilities, the backing of the superpowers,  our economic strength, and our social solidarity.
  Our righteousness – not as an abstract concept – is our capacity to hold themoral high ground by means of a calculated effort to behave and be perceived as acting in good faith – to obtain peace, even if it delays.
     •	This is also an an essential condition for achieving internal solidarity and the world's support for Israel (or for the support of most of the world that's important to us).
     •	This is also an essential condition for achieving internal solidarity and willingness for sacrifice in a society where being called for battle or routinely risking your life is not a theoretical notion, but rather part of our life experience that repeats itself time and again.
     •	The fighting spirit, resilience and the internal solidarity are deeply bound to both our strength and our righteousness. Our righteousness is just as important as our strength.
Our righteousness, and not our strength in and of itself, is what gives Zionism's struggle its meaning and sense of purpose (especially for ones who can choose). The support of a superpower 
     •	and the resilience of our society and economy, which are among the components of our strength – will never be without recognition of our righteousness. And without it, they will erode
.
     •	This is the time to point out the risk in the weakening of the cohesive forces which hold the Israeli society together. We are turning into an increasingly divided society whose very fabric seems to be ripping apart, and which is riddled with hatred for one another. Left and right. Jews and Arabs. Secular and religious. Rich and poor. Center and periphery. Old and new. This is dangerous. The late Tunisian President Bourguiba (and later on Sadat in his debates with Assad just before the peace treaty with Israel) made the argument that there's no need to defeat Israel by force. Give them the opportunity – and they will collapse from within. But the opposite is true!
We have no intention of collapsing from within. But this requires that we come to our senses and act with the right national priorities in mind for society and the economy.
     •	The young generation, the future, must be prioritized. And the same applies to those groups in society who carry its burdens:working hard, paying taxes and serving in the IDF. Cultivating  mutual respect, openness, tolerance, and acceptance of others; More equitable distribution of the national wealth; equal opportunities for all and encouraging individuals, groups and communities to take responsibility. All of these are part of our mission – and we have a long road ahead of us.

I am concerned about our addiction to internal quarrels just as much as I am concerned about our conflicts with external opponents. Our righteousness will not prevail and our strength will crack over time if we do not act decisively to establish, gradually yet persistently , norms of public life and civil society – which sets norms for what is done and what isn’t done far above the criminal threshold.. We need profound change in the area of respect for the rule of law, standards of governance, keeping the thin line between freedom of expression and freedom of incitement – and immediately hitting the brakes on racism and Jewish terrorism – which in my opinion should be treated within the criminal domain..

     •	A few sentences on the “nation-state law”. This is a redundant and even harmful law. In general, and particularly at this point. To our friends it signals that Israel is losing its self-confidence regarding the obvious – namely,its unique identity as the Jewish-democratic state as reflected by the Declaration of Independence.
To our enemies it provides an effective tool to make Israel a suspect– of being a country that's willingly drifting away from the norms of democracy – as a preliminary step towards institutionalized discrimination.
And one has to wonder: what was wrong with what we had until this point? What's wrong with the Declaration of Independence? Who needs this? And why?

     •	Churchill once observed the difference between an optimist and pessimist. 
The pessimist – sees the difficultly in every opportunity 
The optimist – sees the opportunity in every difficultly.
     •	We have opportunities before us within all of the difficulties. The most important of all, a rare one, the kind that comes once in a generation – is the opportunity to establish a regional agreement. It is all the more important in light of the Arab Spring and following Operation Protective Edge.
There is an opportunity to establish a regional agreement that fundamentally changes the  realities of the region and Israel's future and status within it. An agreement that will move the region's entire economy forward together with the chance for stability and peace ,based on synergies and collaboration rather than hatred and revenge.

     •	What do I mean? The events in recent years have created a strong common interest for Israel and the moderate Arab countries – Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States, Jordan, Egypt and perhaps even Turkey (which is not Arab). The focal interest is the struggle against radical Islamic terrorism and against Iran's hegemonic and nuclear intentions.
     •	The challenge for us is based on there being, apparently, only one way to achieve that; and the upcoming elections in Israel force us to put it on hold for a few months.
     •	And the way to do it is this: a strong, self-confident Israel, willing to hold serious negotiations with the Palestinians and the group of Arab nations within an international conference, backed by the US and the Quartet – in order to achieve a two-state solution and establish a regional agreement, while maintaining an unyielding and persistent fight against terrorism and ensuring the IDF's qualitative military edge over any combination of opponents.

     •	The moderates among Arab rulers are unable (and also unwilling) to float this common interest and turn it into policy – because they worry how their people would respond. This is how the Palestinian issue is related to possibility of an overall agreement in the Middle East.
     •	And this isn't just an assessment.

     •	We must remember, vis-a-vis the Palestinians, Israel can (practically only) give. Regarding the rest of the moderate Arab world – Israel can also get, and a lot.. 
Not just recognition and legitimacy but also an opportunity for regional infrastructure projects – and mostly – for the beginning of a process, protracted though it may be – to change the region's fundamental attitudes towards Israel.

     •	On the road to seize this opportunity – Israel will have to consider embracing the Saudi proposal, with Israel's reservations, as a basis to negotiate  a regional agreement.
     •	This will take time. There will be ups and downs. The Palestinians are not an easy interlocutor. No one knows that better than I do..
     •	This might require long periods of interim agreements and even calculated unilateral steps that are coordinated with the US and the Quartet.
     •	It is possible that within the context of a regional agreement, the Palestinian State, once established, could be integrated into a structure of a closer cooperation that could include Jordan, Israel and perhaps another regional player.
     •	But to advance the chance of a regional agreement after the elections in Israel – the Palestinian issue and the two-state solution must be at the top of the agenda.
     •	The idea that' the radical right raises from time to time – to continue to rule the entire territory and maintain a sort of autonomy for the Palestinians – is an illusion at best, and the first step of an upcoming blame game at worst. It will be brutally rejected by our closest friends – not to mention by each of the potential partners for the regional agreement – and by all of them together. This too is not a mere assessment.

     •	The claim that the events of the past year prove that Israel's vital security needs are incompatible with the two-state solution – is false. And I'm stating this as a professional position, not a political opinion.
     •	On the contrary – the IDF will be able to defend Israel better from an internationally recognized border that includes the settlement blocs, a number of strategic sites on mountain ridge, a security zone east of Ben Gurion Airport and long-term military presence on the Jordan River.

     •	The real threat to the future of the Zionist Project – is not the security constraints of the two-state solution but rather a slippery slope leading to the one-state solution – a reality that would compromise Israel's security and worsen its diplomatic isolation – while inevitably (and this is the keyword) leading Israel into becoming a non-Jewish or non-democratic state. Not to mention the danger of descending into severe, perpetual hemorrhaging, lasting generations, by the two national communities locked in embrace– as we have seen in Belfast and Bosnia.

     •	The vision we all share – the vision of a model society in Israel, of positioning Israel, within 10-15 years,  among the group of the most advanced societies – in education and culture, science and technology, quality of life – and eventually standard of living (Finland and Denmark can do it? So can we!). A society in which its sons and daughters choose to live . And one that young Jews from all over the world consider a source of pride, inspiration – and even a worthy place to live in.

     •	The vision of a model society will not materialize unless we gather our mental strength and political will, despite the pain and the differences in our positions – and together embrace the two-state solution under a regional agreement – which even if it delays – is the only appropriate and feasible solution, the only realistic and proper goal for Zionism in this complex world of the 21st century.

     •	A friend (from the Likud, actually) told me that when he was young, he visited Ben Gurion's home a few times. In one of their conversations, the boy asked the Old Man: how is it that out of all of the people's leaders in the past 2,000 years, and even in the past 80 years, it was you who ended up founding the Jewish State? And the Old Man answered: In ancient times, everyone had a sixth sense, a sense of recognizing opportunities. This sense disappeared over time – in most people. But not for me! I saw an opportunity – and I seized it.
Ben Gurion did not speak of the horrors of the War of Independence, the doubts, the risks. many assumed we would fail. He talked about the opportunity and recognizing it. And the deed.

     •	Like Ben Gurion at the time, Menachem Begin – with Egypt, and Rabin – in the peace treaty with Jordan, and later Peres – with the first steps towards the Palestinians, took huge national, diplomatic, security and political risks. Some paid a heavy price. Yitzhak paid the ultimate price. But they all dared – and acted. This is the true test of leadership. This is also the real test of creative statesmanship. 
     •	Formative leadership had always been rooted in a rare combination and fine balance between vision, daring and courage on one hand and judgment, complete sobriety and grasp of detail on the other. They will not come where anxiety, pessimism and passivity rule – these are recipes for the creating of self-fulfilling (necessarily pessimistic) prophecies.

     •	The essence and the purpose of the Zionist movement was to defy the reality and the mindset that the Exile created. Its foundation lay in the decision to take our own fate in our own hands and move proactively to change reality, and not be swept away by the arbitrary waves of history.

     •	Reality is knocking on our door. Not everything is certain. Nothing is ever certain. And nothing ever will be. Nevertheless – open the 
     •	door – this is the true trial of the national leadership.
     •	Abba Eban used to say – the Palestinians have never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity. 
     •	Let's not fall into this trap – ourselves.

     •	Thank you.

not.

you refused to respond?

A. I was asked by you, utterly
inappropriately, and what I had said -- and if you
check what I said, I said if any reasonable
prosecutor were to investigate the case and find
that there was any basis, I would then waive the
statute of limitations. | didn't waive the statute

Q. And by dropping the dime on the media when
they filed it, you intended to convey the message
that Paul Cassell and Bradley Edwards intentionally
generated the focus of press attention on that
filing; is that correct?

A. Absolutely. Absolutely without any doubt.

Why else would they have brought Prince Andrew into
this filing? Prince Andrew had no connection to the
NPA, no relevance at all. But they knew that by
including Prince Andrew, this would drag my name
into every single newspaper and media outlet in the
world.

It was outrageous for them to do this.
Particularly because they did so little, if any,

investigation, which will, of course, be determined

filing was done virtually on the eve of New Year's
ona day that the press was completely dead. And
nonetheless, immediately upon the filing, I got a
barrage of phone calls that led me to conclude, and
led many, many, many other lawyers who called me to
conclude that obviously somebody tipped somebody off
that they didn't just happen to file -- to find in
the middle of an obscure pleading which didn't even
have a heading that indicated that | was involved or
anybody else was involved.

So, I'm certain that a dime was dropped to
somebody saying, by the way, you want an interesting
story, there's -- Prince Andrew of Great Britain and
Alan Dershowitz have been accused of sexual
misconduct. I still believe that.

Q. But right now ~— right now could you
please tell us was there anything other than your
inferring that they must have contacted the media to
support your conclusion that either Paul Cassell or
Brad Edwards did, im fact, alert the media at the
time of the filing of this pleading?

A. Yes.

Q. What else besides your inference?

A. When the BBC came to see me, the BBC
reporter showed me an e-mail from Paul Cassell,
which urged him, the BBC reporter, to ask me a
series of questions. So | knew that Paul Cassell
was in touch with the British media and was trying
to stimulate and initiate embarrassing questions to
be asked of me.

And when I spoke to a number of reporters,
they certainly -- obviously reporters have
privilege, but they said things that certainly led
me to infer that they had been in close toueh with
your clients or representatives on their behalf.

only scant feedback from human teachers. If successful, this will provide an outstanding platform
for ongoing AGI development, as well as a visually appealing and immediately meaningful demo
for OpenCog.

Specific, particularly simple tasks that are the focus of this project team’s current work at
time of writing include:

e Watch another character build steps to reach a high-up object

e Figure out via imitation of this that, in a different context, building steps to reach a high
up object may be a good idea

e Also figure out that, if it wants a certain high-up object but there are no materials for
building steps available, finding some other way to get elevated will be a good idea that
may help it get the object

6.3.1 Transitioning from Virtual Agents to a Physical Robot

Preliminary experiments have also been conducted using OpenCog to control a Nao robot as well
as a virtual dog [GdGO08]. This involves hybridizing OpenCog with a separate (but interlinked)
subsystem handling low-level perception and action. In the experiments done so far, this has
been accomplished in an extremely simplistic way. How to do this right is a topic treated in
detail in Chapter 26 of Part 2.

We suspect that reasonable level of capability will be achievable by simply interposing DeS-
TIN (or some other system in its place) as a perception /action “black box” between OpenCog
and a robot. Some preliminary experiments in this direction have already been carried out, con-
necting the OpenPetBrain to a Nao robot using simpler, less capable software than DeSTIN in
the intermediary role (off-the-shelf speech-to-text, text-to-speech and visual object recognition
software).

However, we also suspect that to achieve robustly intelligent robotics we must go beyond this
approach, and connect robot perception and actuation software with OpenCogPrime in a “white
box” manner that allows intimate dynamic feedback between perceptual, motoric, cognitive
and linguistic functions. We will achieve this via the creation and real-time utilization of links
between the nodes in CogPrime’s and DeSTIN’s internal networks (a topic to be explored in
more depth later in this chapter).

6.4 Memory Types and Associated Cognitive Processes in CogPrime

Now we return to the basic description of the CogPrime approach, turning to aspects of the
relationship between structure and dynamics. Architecture diagrams are all very well, but,
ultimately it is dynamics that makes an architecture come alive. Intelligence is all about learning,
which is by definition about change, about dynamical response to the environment and internal
self-organizing dynamics.

CogPrime relies on multiple memory types and, as discussed above, is founded on the premise
that the right course in architecting a pragmatic, roughly human-like AGI system is to handle
different types of memory differently in terms of both structure and dynamics.

role. They said they would only advise on an abuse of discretion standard. Making the
outcome a foregone conclusion. Furthermore, in response to the February 25 e-mail,
which attempted to establish a schedule to limit the entire review process (the defense has
repeatedly suggested that the misconduct was intertwined with the investigation and
would therefore seek higher review), Mr. Lefkowitz e-mailed Mr. Acosta directly. On
February 29, 2008, Mr. Sloman responded to Mr. Lefkowitz’s e-mail to Mr. Acosta,
stating that Mr. Sloman was acting out of frustration, but “[p]lease be assured that it has
not, and never has been, this Office’s intent to interfere or restrict the *review process”
for either Mr. Epstein or CEOS. I leave it to you and CEOS to figure out how best to
proceed and will await the results of that process.” As stated above, CEOS determined
that it would not review many of the defense’s objections and as to the remainder of those
objections, its review would be limited (contrary to Mr. Acosta’s assurances), which left
the need, supplemented by the defense’s subsequent request, for a more thorough review
of critical issues by others at the Department of Justice. Mr. Sloman’s re-imposition of
the (albeit modestly extended) timetable was an obvious attempt, in violation of his
February 29 agreement, to thwart the request made by the defense to the Deputy Attorney
general, to complete the review process that Mr. Acosta had promised.

11. “DELAY.”
Mr. Sloman’s Letter:

e In a section entitled “Delay,” Mr. Sloman states that “the SDFL again agreed to
accommodate Epstein’s request to appear in state court for plea and sentencing on
January 4, 2008.”

Id., p. 3.
The Truth:

e Curiously, Mr. Sloman fails to mention correspondence from the U.S. Attorney stating
that delay of that date would be “inevitable” as the defense has raised “serious questions”
about the propriety of the prosecution. Strikingly, in that same section, Mr. Sloman
claims that “the Agreement did not contemplate a staggered ‘plea and sentencing,”
despite quoting, three sentences earlier, from the Agreement’s staggered requirement
that Epstein plead and be sentenced by October 26, and “begin serving his sentence not
later than January 4, 2008.”

We are, like most attorneys seeking Department review, without access to the USAO
prosecution summaries or other submissions to the Department. Given the substantial issues that
have been raised in this and other submissions, we request that you conduct a de novo review
that goes beneath the face of any conclusions being advocated by the USAO; instead, we seek a
review that is based on the transcripts of witness testimony themselves so that the reviewer can

allow us to project power and influence, counter the threat from both
Iran and al Qaeda, and possibly even nudge the entire Middle East in
a more pro-Western direction.

Before I arrived in Iraq, I had thought there might be behind-the-
scenes negotiations going on to extend the Status of Forces
Agreement to allow some troops to remain behind. But after spending
several days talking with Iraqi and American officials, civilian and
military, I came to the conclusion that no talks had started because
each side was waiting for the other to go first. Mr. Gates has finally

On confronting dogma, | of course agree — though in my opinion the secular religions — nationalist fanaticism, etc. —

find dismantling myths of “American exceptionalism” or “Israeli self-defense” or Obama’s mass murder campaign,
etc., offensive — so be it.

But | don’t see why that should extend to ridicule. That includes astrologists. Astronomers can refute astrology,
while recognizing that perfectly honest and deluded people may believe it and should be treated with respect, while
their beliefs are confronted with evidence. | also don’t see why we should ridicule religious dogma, just as | don’t
think we should ridicule the much more pernicious secular dogmas. Rather, we should respond to irrational belief
with argument and evidence, while recognizing that their advocates (like most of the intellectual world in the case of
secular dogma) are people who we should be responding to but without ridiculing them. It may be hard

sometimes. For example, when the icon and founding father of sober non-sentimental Realism in International
Affairs informs us that the US, unlike other countries, has a “transcendental purpose,” and the fact that it constantly
acts in contradiction to its purpose doesn’t matter because the facts are just “abuse of history” while real history is
“the evidence of history as our minds reflect it,” then it’s hard to avoid ridicule. But we should. There’s no point
ridiculing virtually the entire IR profession and the major journals, even though such extraordinary irrationality leads
to major human disasters.

On Davis, | frankly think that’s a non-issue. If she decides she cannot do her job as the conditions of employment
require (including following the law), then she can quit and look for another job. As in any other such case.

Woody Allen vs. Mia Farrow

In my article on the 10 greatest legal blunders of the 20 Century, I included on my list, the
decision by Woody Allen’s lawyers to sue Mia Farrow for custody of several of her adopted
children as well as the one child they conceived together. I played an unusual role in that lawsuit,
in which both sides were focused heavily on the media: Woody was concerned that negative
coverage, particularly of allegations involving sexual improprieties with a young girl, might ruin
his career; and Mia’s concern that any coverage might hurt her children. Every legal maneuver in
the case was made with an eye (sometimes two) on the media.

I first met Woody Allen when he was filming Manhattan. He was given to me as a birthday
present by a group of friends, one of whom knew Woody from his earlier film “The Front.”
[check dates] He agreed to meet me for lunch. He didn’t know he was my birthday present.
When I told him, he immediately began to speculate as to who he would want as a present:
“Louis Armstrong,” he said would be his first choice.

“He’s dead,” I reminded him.

“Exactly,” he replied.

“Jimmy Hoffa would be my second choice.”

“He’s missing,” I said.

“Exactly,” he repeated.

He then asked me which dead person I would have wanted to represent as a criminal lawyer. I
immediately replied “Jesus.”

“Do you think you could have won?” he asked.
“In front of a Jewish jury, maybe.”

“Those biblical Jews were tough. They didn’t tolerate troublemakers like Jesus. They probably
wouldn’t have liked Jews like us from Brooklyn,” Woody mused.

“Yeah, but imagine how different history would be if a Jewish lawyer saved Jesus. They couldn’t
accuse us of killing their Lord.”

“But he wouldn’t have been their Lord, if you had won. He wouldn’t have been crucified. And
without crucifixion, there’s no Christianity, so if you had won they’d be blaming the Jews for
destroying Christianity.”

Woody reminded me of the riff that got Lenny Bruce into so much trouble. Bruce quipped that if

the Roman’s electrocuted rather than crucified their enemies, millions of Christians would be
walking around wearing tiny electric chairs around their necks.

outstanding, according to the Associated Press. The popular vote margin remains close, with Trump
currently trailing by approximately 200,000 votes out of a total of almost 120 million votes that have
been counted. Clinton’s blue wall of support was pierced by Trump with unexpected wins in
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. He also won the needed battleground states of Florida, Ohio, and North
Carolina. With fewer losses than expected, Republicans will retain their majorities in the House and
Senate, thereby controlling both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.
Clinton, who called Trump last night to concede the race, said this morning, “I offered to work with him
[Trump] on behalf of our country” and “our nation is more deeply divided than we thought,” but went on
to say, “we stand together…and our best days are still ahead of us.” In his remarks shortly before 3:00
AM, President-elect Trump said, “It is time to bind the wounds of division. It is time for us to come
together as one united America.” He went on to say that it was “not a campaign, but an incredible
movement.” And, alluding to his policy agenda, Trump said we “would be working together to begin the
task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream.” Trump has touted an agenda of
revitalizing the economy and promoting job growth by reforming the tax code, rebuilding America’s
infrastructure, repealing and replacing “Obamacare,” and being “tough” on immigration and in
renegotiating international trade agreements.
Maintaining the Senate majority will give Republicans the ability to set the agenda in the
Senate. However, bipartisan cooperation still will be necessary to achieve meaningful policy
accomplishments as Senate rules generally require a 60-vote threshold for movement on most
issues. An early challenge may be filling the Supreme Court vacancy created by the death of Antonin
Scalia in early 2016 – one that could spark fireworks on Capitol Hill and across the country’s highly
charged political environment. How Republicans, Democrats, and Trump navigate through the process
of nominating and confirming a new Justice to the Supreme Court is likely to set the tone in the Senate
for the next two years. The nature of Speaker Paul Ryan’s relationship with President-elect Trump and
his often unruly House Republican Conference is not clear at this time. However, the House Republican
“Better Way” agenda, which was developed in consultation with the Trump campaign, is now a focal
point for congressional action.

With Republicans set to control the White House, Senate, and House
of Representatives for the session of Congress beginning in January
2017, the lame-duck session of the current Congress between now
and the end of this year seems likely to be limited to keeping the
government funded beyond the expiration of the current continuing
resolution on December 9, 2016. President-elect Trump and the
Republican Congress are certain to provide ambitious policy agendas
with plenty of proposals to analyze and the need for significant
legislative activity. However, it remains to be seen where Democrats
and Republicans, particularly in the Senate, will be able to forge
compromise.
With 24 of the 34 Senate seats up for election on November 8th held
by Republicans, and many of those seats quite vulnerable, retaining
control is a major victory for Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell (R-KY) and his Republican majority. Currently,
Republicans are expected to hold at least 51 seats in the new
congress, with Senator Kelly Ayotte’s (R-NH) reelection bid in New
Hampshire still undecided. In Louisiana, State Treasurer John
Kennedy (R) received 25 percent of the vote and Foster Campbell
(D), a member of the Louisiana Public Service Commission, received
17% in a crowded 24 candidate “jungle primary” to advance to a
runoff election to be held on December 10, 2016. Senior House
Ways and Means Committee member Charles Boustany (R-LA) fell
just short in his quest to make the two-candidate runoff receiving
15% of the vote. While the Louisiana seat is technically undecided,
the state went strongly Republican in the Presidential election and
Kennedy is heavily favored to hold the seat.
Illinois Senator Mark Kirk (R-IL) lost his race to Rep. Tammy
Duckworth (D-IL). In Indiana, Rep. Todd Young (R-IN) won his race
against former Democratic Senator Evan Bayh (D-IN) to succeed
retiring Senator Dan Coats (R-IN). In Nevada, Catherine Cortez Masto
(D-NV) beat Rep. Joe Heck (R-NV) to hold the seat of retiring Senate
Democratic Leader Harry Reid (D-NV). In other notable races:
► Ohio: Once ground zero for Senate control, Senator Rob Portman
(R-OH) easily beat former Governor Ted Strickland (D-OH).
► North Carolina: In a race that was consistently within the margin
of error in recent days, Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) held onto his
seat against former state legislator Deborah Ross (D-NC).
► Pennsylvania: Behind in most recent polling, Senator Pat Toomey
(R-PA) prevailed against former federal and state environmental
official Katie McGinty (D-PA).

2 | Election 2016
Election results
Along with the House GOP majority, Senate Republicans will unambiguously set the agenda in the new Congress. However,
with a closely divided Senate, Republicans will be well short of the 60 votes necessary under the Senate rules to bring
debate to a close (cloture) and advance controversial legislation without votes from the other party. Narrow Republican
and Democratic majorities in the recent past have both found their legislative agendas stalled unless they were willing to
compromise to attract bipartisan support.
One area where 60 votes are not required is confirming appointments to the Administration and the Federal courts, with
the exception of the Supreme Court. There could be speculation about whether Senate Republicans would consider a rules
change to create a 51 vote threshold for Supreme Court nominees, also known as the “nuclear option.” But any serious
consideration on this front is far from certain.
Republican House losses in the election were minimized for a number of reasons, including the Republican turnout for
Donald Trump, the relatively static map created by the post-2010 redistricting process, and highly localized campaigns
run by Republican House Members in marginal districts where support for Trump was weaker. With a loss in the single
digits, the GOP majority goes from 246 members to somewhere in the 230s, giving Republicans a margin of 20 or so seats
versus the current 30.
3 | Election 2016
Senate profile
Current Majority Leader McConnell will stay in the post after successfully working this past session to keep the Senate in
Republican hands, while Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) will take over for retiring Senator Reid after 12 years as
Democratic Leader. Given that Republicans held control of the Senate, McConnell will spend the next two years working
toward a filibuster-proof 60-vote majority in the 2018 elections, when 25 Democratic or Independent seats are up for reelection,
compared with only eight Republicans. Schumer will likely try to reach some compromises with Republicans while
distinguishing his party ahead of 2018, and will likely be pulled left, with the influence of Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-
MA) and Bernie Sanders (D-VT).
Leadership elections are expected to be held on Wednesday, November 16, and committee ratios, likely to be close to
what they are now, will be determined soon after the Senate reconvenes. Predicting the chair and ranking members of
Senate committees immediately after an election is speculative because members with seniority will be able to choose
between chairmanships and must adhere to Senate Republican committee leadership term limits. Republican senators may
serve as chairman for six years and six years as ranking member for any one committee, on a cumulative basis. Following
is a discussion of expected select committee chairmen and membership for 2017. An added complication could arise
should sitting Republican senators be tapped for cabinet positions in the Trump administration.
AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION, AND FORESTRY (Same leadership as 114 th Congress)

Several Democrats on the committee with significant seniority are in line to choose other ranking positions: Leahy -
Judiciary; Murray - HELP; Feinstein - Intelligence; Durbin, who serves as the Assistant Democratic Leader, and doesn’t
take a ranking member position on a major committee; and Jack Reed - Armed Services. However, given the importance
of the Appropriations Committee and its responsibility for preparing bills to fund the government, it would be surprising
that the ranking position would be very far down that list.

Jim Inhofe (R-OK) has exhausted his six-year limit. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA), the current ranking member of EPW, is
retiring. Senator Carper could opt for the post over his current position on the Homeland Security and Governmental
Affairs Committee. If Carper decides to stay at HSGA, Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD) would have the option of ranking
member of EPW or Foreign Relations. If Cardin should choose Foreign Relations, Senator Sanders would be next in line for
the ranking member position. Barrasso can be expected to continue the criticisms of current Chairman Inhofe of EPA
regulations and their effect on US energy development and the energy industry.
FINANCE (Same leadership as 114th Congress)
Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-UT)
Ranking Member Ron Wyden (D-OR)
Senator Hatch will continue to serve as Chairman by way of an agreement reached with Senator Grassley, who is actually
more senior to Senator Hatch on the Committee. (Grassley will serve as Judiciary Chairman.) Dan Coats (R-IN) is retiring
from Congress. Senators Richard Burr (R-NC) and Pat Toomey (R-PA) both won re-election races. Eight Democratic
committee members will be running for re-election in 2018: Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Bill Nelson

opt to stay in the ranking position on Judiciary.
5 | Election 2016
House profile
By retaining control of the House and Senate, with the loss of only a few seats, and winning the White House, Republicans
believe they have a mandate to govern. The potential for a Freedom Caucus challenge to Paul Ryan’s leadership is unlikely
given the party’s strong showing. The path is clear for the Speaker to pursue the policy actions described in the “Better
Way” policy platform developed earlier this year and promoted through the ubiquitous presence of a pamphlet describing
the plan that he used during the campaign and press appearances. That effort generated interest from Trump, who
adapted his tax plan to reflect some of the proposals.
The week following the elections and prior to Thanksgiving will be focused on internal party organizational issues,
including the election of party leadership, and discussion around Republican conference and Democratic caucus rules and
the makeup of the Steering Committee, which will determine committee assignments. The leadership of the chamber will
be decided in closed-door meetings during this time, with a formal floor vote for Speaker in January. Some Steering
Committee decisions regarding committees are likely to take place after Thanksgiving and to include ratification of
committee chairmanships and Speaker-appointed committee memberships, as well as appointments of members to vacant
slots on “A” committees (including Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce and Financial Services). Ryan and Democratic
Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) will conduct a negotiation to determine committee ratios, which would be expected to be close
to what they are now.
WAYS AND MEANS (Same leadership as 114th Congress)
Chairman Kevin Brady (R-TX)
Ranking Member Sander Levin (D-MI)
Republican members Boustany and Young ran for Senate ,and Rep. Robert Dold (R-IL) lost his re-election campaign,
leaving three open seats. Republicans under consideration for Committee seats include Reps. Carlos Curbelo (R-FL), Mike
Bishop (R-MI), Bradley Byrne (R-AL), Jackie Walorski (R-IN) and Andy Barr (R-KY). Longtime Democratic members Charles
Rangel (D-NY) and Jim McDermott (D-WA) are retiring.
ENERGY & COMMERCE
Chair John Shimkus (R-IL)/Greg Walden (R-OR)
Ranking Member Frank Pallone (D-NJ)
Rep. Fred Upton (R-MI) will reach his term limit as chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee and will step down at
the end of the current Congress. Rep. Upton noted that he’s “not planning to” seek a waiver of the term limits. The two
current frontrunners to replace the outgoing chairman include Reps. John Shimkus (R-IL) and Greg Walden (R-OR). Rep.
Shimkus has seniority on the committee, but Walden has also generated party support related to his role serving as
chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee for the past two election cycles. Rep. Joe Barton (R-TX) is
also expected to run for the Chairmanship. The powerful Republican Steering Committee, consisting of Republican
leadership as well as rank-and-file members, will decide in a private meeting who will lead the committee in the 115 th
Congress. Adding to the leadership shuffle at the Energy and Commerce Committee, the current chairman of the E&C
Subcommittee on Health, Rep. Joe Pitts (R-PA), is retiring at the end of the Congress. Rep. Tim Murphy (R-PA) is under
consideration to replace him.
EDUCATION & THE WORKFORCE
Chairman Virginia Foxx (R-NC)
Ranking Member Bobby Scott (D-VA)
Current Chairman John Kline (R-MN) did not seek reelection. He will likely be succeeded as chair of the House Education
and Workforce Committee by Rep. Foxx. She has had a limited role on pension and retirement issues, but has been a
reliable voice for limited government regulation and joined in opposing the Obama Administration’s investment advice
regulations. Where Chairman Kline put pension reform high on the committee’s agenda, Foxx has not signaled a strong
interest in making pension issues a priority.

Administration and
agenda
Looking ahead to the Trump administration and a
Republican-controlled Congress, the focus will be on
Trump’s top priorities: infrastructure, tax reform,
dismantling the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and
immigration reform. President-elect Trump highlighted
his commitment to infrastructure investment during his
victory speech early November 9. “We are going to fix our
inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels,
airports, schools, hospitals,” he said. “We’re going to
rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way,
second to none. And we will put millions of our people to
work as we rebuild it.” Trump would fund infrastructure
investment through public-private partnerships and
private investments through tax incentives rather than
tax reform, though he has called for early action on that
issue as well. On October 22, Trump outlined a voter
contract for his first 100 days plan that calls for
enactment of:
► The Middle Class Tax Relief And Simplification Act
(comprehensive tax reform);
► The End the Offshoring Act, to establish tariffs to
discourage companies from laying off their workers in
order to relocate in other countries and ship their
products back to the U.S. tax-free;
► The American Energy & Infrastructure Act, to leverage
public-private partnerships and private investments
through tax incentives to raise $1 trillion in
infrastructure investment over 10 years;
► The School Choice And Education Opportunity Act, to
expand primary education options and make college
more affordable;
► The Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act, to repeal the
ACA and replace it with Health Savings Accounts;
► The Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act, to allow
Americans to deduct childcare and elder care;
► The End Illegal Immigration Act, to fund the
construction of a wall on the Mexican border;
► The Restoring Community Safety Act, to reduce crime;
► The Restoring National Security Act, to rebuild the
military by eliminating the defense sequester and
expanding military investment; and
► The Clean up Corruption in Washington Act, to enact
“new ethics reforms to Drain the Swamp and reduce
the corrupting influence of special interests on our
politics.”
As part of the voter contract announced in October,
Trump has also pledged to act on his first day in office to
“cancel every unconstitutional executive action,
memorandum and order issued by President Obama.”
Trump advisor Anthony Scaramucci said in October that
the new administration would repeal the rulemaking on
conflicts of interest in the delivery of investment advice to
IRA and 401(k) plan investors.
Regulations that have been finalized cannot be
unilaterally vacated by executive order without
intervening regulatory or legislative action. In order to
make changes to final regulations without legislative
action, agencies are typically required to follow the
administrative procedural process which requires a notice
and comment process prior to modifying regulations. If
an Administration wishes to repeal or revise a final
regulation through the administrative process, the agency
may be required to demonstrate that its actions are not
“arbitrary and capricious,” and based on more than a
change in political views. It is possible that a new
Administration could dispense with the notice and
comment process by moving to issue an interim final rule,
replacing the previous regulation. In this situation, the
agency could be called on demonstrate that it acted with
“good cause” to circumvent the typical notice and
comment requirements.
A new Administration could also use its executive power
to affect the level of legal defense of challenges to
existing regulations provided by the Administration or
temporarily refuse to exercise its enforcement
responsibilities until compelled through legal action or
public pressure.
Trump also intends to immediately begin the process of
filling the Supreme Court vacancy created by the death of
Antonin Scalia in early 2016 – one that could spark
fireworks on Capitol Hill and across the country’s highly
charged political environment. How Republicans,
Democrats, and Trump navigate through the process of
nominating and confirming a Justice to the Supreme
Court is likely to set the tone in the Senate for the next
two years.
Trump also intends to act on trade issues on his first day
in office, including:
► announcing his intention to renegotiate or withdraw
from NAFTA;
► ·announcing withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific
Partnership; and
8
| Election 2016
Administration and
agenda
► directing Treasury to label China a currency
manipulator.
Consistent with Trump’s desire to change the way
business is conducted in Washington, he also pledges to
act on his first day in office to:
► propose a constitutional amendment to impose term
limits on all members of Congress;
► require that for every new federal regulation, two
existing regulations must be eliminated; and
► impose a five–year ban on White House and
congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they
leave government service.
(The Trump Contract with the Voter is available at
https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/CONTRACT_FOR_THE_
VOTER.pdf)
Budget. While President-elect Trump has vowed to act
quickly on repeal of the ACA, it is difficult to see how that
can be accomplished outside of reconciliation instructions
for FY 2018. “When we win on November 8th, and elect a
Republican Congress, we will be able to immediately
repeal and replace Obamacare. I will ask Congress to
convene a special session,” he said November 1.
An early focus of attention will be the first Trump budget
proposal and the congressional FY 2018 budget
resolution. As with the past several years under divided
government, a main issue will be how to address the
Budget Control Act sequester for FY 2018. According to
the Congressional Budget Office, the cap on discretionary
budget authority originally established by the Budget
Control Act is set at $1.156 billion in 2018, though it will
be reduced by automatic procedures unless Congress
intervenes. CBO said the reduction will total $91 billion
for 2018: $54 billion for defense and $37 billion in 2018
for nondefense. Therefore, total budget authority is
slated to be $1.065 trillion, split between $549 billion for
defense and $516 billion for nondefense. Both Trump and
Speaker Ryan want to eliminate the sequester as it
applies to defense, but would likely want to maintain the
sequester for non-defense spending.
As reported in Politico last month, Speaker Ryan is bullish
on using the “budget reconciliation” process to pass
significant tax reform. “This is our plan for 2017,” Ryan
said, waving a copy of his “Better Way” policy agenda.
“Much of this you can do through budget reconciliation.”
He said key pieces are “fiscal in nature,” meaning they
can be moved quickly through a budget maneuver that
requires a simple majority in the Senate and House.
9
Use of “Budget Reconciliation” to enact legislation
involves a two-step process. First, both Chambers of
Congress need to pass a concurrent Budget Resolution
(requires only simple majority in the Senate) that contains
“reconciliation instructions.” These instructions are
directions to committees of jurisdiction to change the
spending or revenue numbers (or both), and to report
back the changes by a date certain. A budget resolution
generally is a legislative vehicle that serves as the
blueprint for fiscal policy and establishes a framework for
consideration of spending and revenue bills for the
coming fiscal year. Technically, a budget resolution is a
“concurrent resolution” which is binding in the House and
the Senate. Because a concurrent resolution is not
submitted to the President for signature, it does not have
the force of law.
The second part of the process is to pass “reconciliation”
bills that adhere to the reconciliation instructions from
the budget resolution.
Reconciliation bills can involve changes to spending,
revenue, or the debt limit (or any combination of the
three). Importantly, these reconciliation bills also only
require a simple majority in the House and Senate for
passage.
Reconciliation bills carry strict debate time and
amendment restrictions, but unlike a budget resolution,
reconciliation legislation contains specific spending and
revenue policy changes that are signed into law by the
President. In the Senate, debate is limited to 20 hours.
While only a simple majority is required for passage in the
Senate, 60 votes are required to waive violations of the
so-called “Byrd rule,” which prohibits the inclusion of
provisions that increase the budget deficit for the period
outside the budget window, usually a 10-year period. An
unlimited number of amendments may be offered and
voted upon, even after the 20 hours of debate have
expired – a process often referred to as a “vote-a-rama”.
This process is attractive because of the simple majority
vote in the Senate, but carries with it restrictions such as
the ten-year expiration for titles of the bill that increase
the deficit outside the budget window.
It was used by President George W. Bush to pass
significant tax cut legislation in 2001 (the “Bush tax
cuts”) and is expected to be considered next year for tax
reform. Note that the Bush tax cuts were originally
sunsetted at the end of ten years due to the Byrd
rule. Subsequent legislation passed outside reconciliation
process made many of these provisions permanent.
| Election 2016
Administration and
agenda
Debt limit. The debt limit will be reinstated after March
15, 2017, though Congress will likely have additional time
to either suspend or increase the limit. Extraordinary
measures that can be undertaken by the Treasury
Department should allow Treasury to continue meeting its
financial obligations until at least midsummer of 2017,
according to a September 13 posting by the Bipartisan
Policy Center. When the debt limit is reinstated, the
federal government’s accumulated debt will immediately
equal the new ceiling, which is projected to be
about $20.1 trillion. The optics of the figure surpassing
$20 trillion could spur lawmakers to be even more
adamant about demands for spending cuts in return for
supporting an additional increase or suspension of the
debt limit.
FAA reauthorization. The Airport and Airway Trust Fund
taxes expire after September 30, 2017, along with
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) spending authority,
both of which were last extended in July. Privatization of
the air traffic control system was a sticking point in
negotiations this year. The FAA bill can be a vehicle for
other tax legislation.
Personnel. The fact that Trump has not held political
office and is not a traditional Republican puts a new spin
on filling out his administration. Press reports have
speculated about potential cabinet appointments. Trump
has reportedly said that Goldman Sachs alumnus and
campaign finance chairman Steven Mnuchin could be a
possible nominee for Treasury secretary.
Economic advisers that have represented Trump on the
campaign include investor Wilbur Ross and economists
Peter Navarro, Larry Kudlow, and Stephen Moore.
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is in charge of Trump’s
transition. Politicians who have supported and served as
surrogates for Trump and could possibly be tapped for
Cabinet posts include: former New York mayor Rudy
Giuliani, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Senator
Jeff Sessions (R-AL), Dr. Ben Carson, and former Alaska
Governor Sarah Palin. Senate Foreign Relations
Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-TN) was reportedly
under consideration for the vice presidential pick and
could be tapped for a Cabinet post.

| Election 2016
Lame-duck session
With the Republican sweep in the election, the sense is
the lame-duck legislative agenda will be minimalist, with
Republicans having little motivation to engage in other
business aside from funding the government beyond
December 9. Congress returns the week of November 14
for organizational meetings and then departs again for
Thanksgiving week, leaving lawmakers only a couple of
weeks to finish their legislative business. Other
possibilities include: a defense authorization bill; the
conference report for an omnibus energy bill; the “21 st
Century Cures” bill increasing funds for medical research
and accelerating drug approvals; the Water Resources
Development Act (WRDA), which would also carry money
to address the drinking-water crisis in Flint, Michigan; tax
extenders provisions; and retirement savings measures.
Government Funding. Under the stopgap continuing
resolution (CR) cleared on September 28, funding for the
government will expire on December 9. Only one of the
12 fiscal 2017 appropriations bills has been sent to the
President so far. The government funding bill may take
the form of a large omnibus bill or continuing resolution,
if the House and Senate Republican leadership’s
preference for moving spending bills on a standalone
basis or in packages does not pan out. Given the election
results, leaders are likely to limit the length of the
spending bill to a handful of months to allow the Trump
administration an opportunity to help shape fiscal 2017
spending next year. Speaker Ryan has said he favors a
strategy of combining spending bills into “minibus”
vehicles, but Senate Democrats have said such an
approach could be a tactic to get around the spending
caps Congress agreed to on a bipartisan basis last year.
The bill(s) may include additional spending to address
flooding in Louisiana and elsewhere, and damage from
Hurricane Matthew. If the vehicle for government funding
is a large omnibus bill, Republicans may push for some
conservative policy “riders” as their price for accepting
the budget numbers that were negotiated last year.
Tax. There are no must-pass tax issues for the lame-duck
session, and it is unclear whether there will be
consideration of expiring tax provisions, House and
Senate miscellaneous tax bills, and tax technical
corrections. House Ways and Means Chairman Brady is
opposed to addressing tax extender provisions this year,
preferring to look forward to tax reform; that could also
be the position taken on other tax issues given that
Republicans will control Washington and have a shared
interest in tax reform. However, Senate Leader McConnell
previously committed to addressing energy tax extenders
this year, so they could still come up for consideration.
11
Pensions. The Senate could consider the Retirement
Enhancement and Savings Act, a package of measures
affecting multiple-employer pension plans, 401(k) plans
and annuities, which was approved on a unanimous vote
by the Senate Finance Committee on September 21. The
committee also approved the Miners Protection Act, which
would fund retiree health and pension benefits for coal
miners, which a majority of the committee’s Republican
members opposed.
Health. One of the top Republican legislative priorities for
the lame-duck session is the 21 st Century Cures bill, a
package of measures intended to spur new medical
treatments and boost funding for the National Institutes of
Health, the FDA, and White House initiatives such as
“precision medicine” and the Cancer Moonshot. Questions
remain in both the House and Senate over how to pay for
the bill and the size of the funding increases, but Senator
McConnell has said the bill “could end up being the most
significant piece of legislation we pass in the whole
Congress.”
On the House side, this continues to be the top priority of
the Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee
Fred Upton. Leaders of the Energy and Commerce
Committee said on September 29 that they had been
“working hard for months, and we will continue to work
toward an agreement that can pass both chambers and be
signed by the President.” The House passed its version of
the 21 st Century Cures bill (H.R. 6) in July 2015 by a vote
of 344-77, including nearly $9 billion in new research
funding for the NIH and reforms to the FDA’s process for
approving certain new medicines and medical devices. In
the Senate, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions
(HELP) Committee has passed a package of 19 bills aimed
at accelerating approval of new drugs and medical devices
and attracting talented researchers to the FDA, but the full
Senate has yet to consider the bills. HELP Committee
Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-TN) told Bloomberg BNA in
June that the impediments to passage are the proposals’
complexity and disagreements over how to pay for
them. Negotiations continue.
Speaker Ryan has also listed passage of mental health
legislation as one of his priorities for the lame-duck
session. H.R. 2646, a bill sponsored by Rep. Tim Murphy
(R-PA) that passed the House almost unanimously in July,
would expand Medicaid coverage of mental health
services, fund more psychiatric hospital beds and change
privacy rules to allow caregivers to receive more
information about patients.
| Election 2016
Lame-duck session
A Senate version (S. 2680) prompted Democratic
concerns over funding levels, privacy issues, and other
matters. This issue is one that could slip into the next
Congress if negotiators are unable to reach an agreement
given the limited time available.
Another outstanding year-end issue for Congressional
leaders is whether to address the pending Medicare Part-
B premium increases facing new and some existing
Medicare enrollees caused by a smaller annual Social
Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). Congress has
acted in the past to avert premium increases due to
modest COLA adjustments before the premium increases
take effect. Additional Medicare changes that are
bipartisan in nature could be added to this Part B
adjustment if leaders agree to move forward. Up for
potential consideration are a handful of Medicare-related
bills that have already passed the House or Senate in the
114 th Congress, as well as a package of provisions
recently unveiled by the Finance Committee that would
address how chronic conditions are managed in the
Medicare population.
Additionally, Congress continues to contemplate action in
the lame duck session to address the Obama
Administration’s proposal to modify the payment
mechanisms for Part B Medicare drugs. While the
proposal has not yet been finalized, concerns about the
size and scope of the proposal have been raised by
Congress.
Energy. House and Senate conferees also hope to finish
negotiating the final version of the bipartisan, omnibus
Energy Policy Modernization Act (S. 2012, H.R. 8).
Among many other provisions, that bill would give the
Energy Department emergency authority to protect the
electric power grid from physical and cyber threats;
require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) to expedite consideration of pipeline siting
applications; ease procedures for mining certain minerals
on federal lands; increase water allocations to address
drought in California; and change forestry management.
There will also be a push to complete the Water Resources
Development Act (WRDA). In September, both the Senate
(S. 2848) and House (H.R. 5303) overwhelmingly passed
bills that need to be reconciled, but the two chambers
have not yet formally gone to conference. One factor that
is likely to expedite a conference and floor votes is the fact
that in September, in order to resolve a deadlock over
government funding, Speaker Ryan made a commitment
to move assistance to Flint, Michigan (which has faced a
drinking-water crisis) as part of the WRDA bill.
Energy measures could also come up as Republican
“riders” on a year-end spending bill, such as provisions
blocking the EPA’s Clean Power Plan or the “Waters of the
U.S.” wetlands rule. House Majority Leader McCarthy has
also said the House will consider a bill offering a tax credit
for new nuclear reactors.
Financial Services. House Financial Services Chairman
Jeb Hensarling (R-TX) has said he hopes for a lame-duck
floor vote on his CHOICE Act, which would repeal much of
the Dodd-Frank Act and replace it with a system in which
banks would become exempt from many prudential rules if
they agree to a much higher leverage ratio. The committee
passed the CHOICE Act on a party-line vote in September.
The Wells Fargo scandal could pose a hurdle for that plan,
because Hensarling’s bill would repeal the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB) new rules limiting the
use of mandatory arbitration clauses in bank contracts.
Wells Fargo has been criticized for requiring its account
holders to agree to such clauses, restricting their ability to
sue the bank after as many as 2 million unauthorized
accounts were discovered.
The Financial Services Committee will hold a second
hearing on November 30 on the Wells Fargo issue, with
CFPB Director Richard Cordray testifying. SEC Chairman
Mary Jo White will also testify on November 15.

Tax
The surprising results of yesterday’s election have teed
up comprehensive tax reform as a clear priority for the
new Republican President and the Republican Congress.
A unified Republican government makes the process of
achieving significant tax reform much more manageable
next year, in particular because Speaker Ryan during the
campaign pledged to move such a plan in the form of socalled
budget reconciliation legislation, which would mean
that only a simple majority of senators would be
necessary to pass the plan, rather than the usual 60-vote
majority. A lot of the groundwork has been laid through
proposals and negotiations over the last three or four
years on various key aspects of business tax reform, but
Congressional Republican leaders and the new President
will have to decide whether to push forward with
legislation that embodies the House Republican Tax
Reform Blueprint, or the outlines of a tax reform plan that
President-elect Trump championed during the campaign.
One significant difference is that the Blueprint, according
to its authors, is largely revenue neutral using dynamic
scoring, while the Trump plan was scored by various nongovernmental
groups as losing trillions of dollars.
House Speaker Ryan has said on multiple occasions that
tax reform is his top priority. The Blueprint, the sixth and
final plank of Ryan’s “Better Way” campaign to provide
policy alternatives, proposed a 20% statutory corporate
tax rate, a 25% business tax rate for pass-through
entities, a move toward a cash-flow consumption tax
through immediate expensing for all businesses and
elimination of deductibility of net interest expense, a
territorial international tax system, a border tax
adjustment mechanism, and elimination of most business
preferences except the R&D tax credit and LIFO.
Interestingly, all of these pieces of business tax reform
may be fair game in discussions with Democrats, but the
two parties differ greatly over whether to reduce
individual tax rates – a key component of both the
Blueprint and the Trump campaign agenda – and over
important revenue issues, including whether reform
should be revenue neutral on a static basis, and whether
timing and one-time revenue raisers should be used to
pay for permanent tax rate reduction. The use of budget
reconciliation, however, could make many of these
differences irrelevant as Senate Democrats could have
little power to change or block the legislation on the
Senate floor.
Along with the 20% statutory corporate tax rate, the
Blueprint includes a 25% business tax rate for passthrough
entities; and individual rates set at 12%, 25%, and
33%.
13
Ways and Means Republican tax staff is in the process of
receiving feedback and building out the tax reform
Blueprint by drafting detailed statutory language. The
publicly expressed goal is to have that effort completed
by the end of 2016. In October 14 remarks at University
of Wisconsin—Madison, House Speaker Ryan said, “I really
want to get tax reform running as quickly as possible…”
Asked September 29 whether there is opportunity for
progress on big-ticket items in 2017, Senate Majority
Leader McConnell said, “We need to do tax-reform –
comprehensive tax-reform – not piecemeal.”
Trump’s tax plan differs from the Blueprint in that the
corporate tax rate would be lower – 15% – with the same
rate imposed on pass through entities. The latest
statement from the Trump campaign suggests that small
business owners do not retain earnings may face double
taxation.
Individual income tax rates would be 12%, 25%, and 33%,
the same as the House Republican tax reform Blueprint.
Trump and his staff have supported a 10% tax rate on the
deemed repatriation of previously untaxed foreign
earnings of US companies, but the campaign never made
clear whether they still support repeal of deferral in a new
international tax system going forward.
Trump has pledged to work with House Republicans on
tax issues and, in addition to adopting their proposed
individual rates, brought his plan closer to theirs by
announcing support for immediate expensing of new
business investments for manufacturers. The House plan
proposed expensing in conjunction with eliminating the
deductibility of net interest expense. In the follow-up to a
September 15 speech to the Economic Club of New York,
Trump clarified that he believes expensing should be
limited to manufacturers and those who elect expensing
will lose the deductibility of corporate interest expense.
The Trump campaign also clarified in September that they
favored repeal of most corporate tax expenditures,
except for the R&D Credit. While continuing to call for
repeal of the estate tax, Trump proposed disallowing a
step-up in basis for estates over $10 million: “The Trump
plan will repeal the death tax, but capital gains held until
death will be subject to tax, with the first $10 million taxfree
as under current law to exempt small businesses and
family farms. To prevent abuse, contributions of
appreciated assets into a private charity established by
the decedent or the decedent’s relatives will be
disallowed.”
| Election 2016
Tax
Trump additionally proposed capping itemized deductions
at $100,000 for single filers and $200,000 for married
filers and highlighted the benefits of his proposals for
working Americans and the middle class. “By lowering
rates, streamlining deductions, and simplifying the
process, we will add millions and millions of new jobs. In
addition, because we have strongly capped deductions for
the wealthy, and closed special interest loopholes, the tax
relief will be concentrated on the working and middle
class taxpayer…,” he said. “This is a working and middleclass
tax relief proposal.” A campaign fact sheet
proclaims that Trump’s economic proposals would add 25
million jobs over a decade, which equates to 200,000 new
jobs per month.
The motivating factors for tax reform will remain the
same as they were in the current Congress, but unified
government should make enacting tax reform much
easier. The statutory corporate income tax rate is seen as
too high and the international tax system compels profit
shifting to low-tax jurisdictions and erodes the US tax
base. That phenomenon escalated this year with the
European Commission’s latest state aid decision, which
was seen as demonstrating a tension between the US and
Europe over who should tax the foreign income of US
multinationals.
The passage of the EU’s harmful tax competition directive
will lead to enactment in all EU countries of a variety of
measures that could increase taxes on US companies
operating in Europe, while implementation of innovation
box regimes in many countries, following the OECD BEPS
project outline, will make it more attractive for US
companies to move intellectual property and exploit that
IP into those jurisdictions. The Administration took
significant steps this year to try to prevent further
erosion of the US tax base through regulatory action to
deter inversions and earnings stripping, but all involved
said these were Band-Aid approaches that were no
substitute for US tax reform.
Design issues – international tax reform. As has been the
case for the last few years, there is broad agreement on
the design elements of business tax reform, and more
specifically, international tax reform, but the devil is in
the details. For example, the House Republican Blueprint
on tax reform calls for a 8.75% tax rate on previously
untaxed accumulated foreign earnings held in cash or
cash equivalents, and a 3.5% tax rate on all other
accumulated earnings, with tax liability payable over an
eight-year period.
This is the same tax treatment of accumulated foreign
earnings called for under former Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Dave Camp’s (R-MI) Tax Reform Act
of 2014.
But in a departure from the Camp bill, the Blueprint also
calls for a move to a destination-basis tax system, under
which border adjustments exempt exports from tax while
taxing imports, making the tax jurisdiction the location of
consumption rather than production. Exempting exports
from US tax and taxing imports regardless of where they
are produced will eliminate incentives for US businesses
to move or locate operations outside of the United States
under a territorial tax system, according to the Blueprint.
By relieving exports from US tax while imposing US tax on
imports, the Blueprint would eliminate the need for any
new exemption or territorial tax system to be
accompanied by a minimum tax or any other more
conventional anti-base erosion measure, thereby
sidestepping one of the more intractable and divisive
debates among the business community over the past
several years of tax reform discussions.
Developing a workable border adjustability mechanism
that is not actually a component of a value-added tax
presents some significant policy and technical hurdles.
US companies that are net exporters could end up in a
perpetual tax loss position, and handing out refunds to
some of the largest US companies may not work from a
political standpoint, particularly as the domestic income
of US companies (including the suppliers for exporting
companies) is subject to tax. How to apply the border
adjustability concept to cross-border flows of capital, or
whether to exempt financial transactions must also be
considered.
While moving to a form of exemption system has some
level of bipartisan support, more liberal Democrats will
insist on a more pure worldwide system that includes
repeal of deferral. Senate Finance Committee Ranking
Member Wyden (intermittently) and Senator Warren
(consistently) have both backed the latter approach, and
Speaker Ryan noted the differing viewpoints in
September given that Democrats increasingly call for a
worldwide system and repeal of deferral.
14
| Election 2016
Tax
“There is a big gulf between our two views... We believe
that we should have a pure territorial system… And so I do
believe that this issue is coming,” Ryan said. “I don’t think
you can stand against a territorial system much longer.”
Ryan also remarked that “the experience I had when I was
Ways and Means chair with [Democrats] was not a
pleasant one, and I don’t know if that’s going to change.”
In a September 8 New York Times op-ed, Senator Warren
said foreign developments are increasing pressure on
Congress to cut corporations “a new sweetheart deal” in
tax reform, but lawmakers should instead take the
opportunity to collect more revenue from corporations.
“Preferential tax treatment, either through special rates
or deferred due dates, creates a huge financial incentive
for American companies to build businesses and create
jobs abroad rather than in the United States. Our tax code
should favor jobs and businesses at home – period,”
Warren said.
Along with these political and mechanical questions, there
is the question of whether such a system, embedded in an
income tax rather than a value added tax or other true
consumption tax, is legal from an international trade
perspective.
Design issues – paying for rate reduction. There may
also be tension among House Republicans given that the
Blueprint has not had a full airing among members – it
was released soon before Congress left for its summer
recess – and the drafting of legislative language may
make apparent what is necessary to achieve the stated
goals, particularly the reduced rates: a 20% statutory
corporate tax rate; a 25% business tax rate for passthrough
entities; and individual rates set at 12%, 25%, and
33%. Once the details are hashed out, the Blueprint could
present just as many trade-offs as previous serious tax
reform proposals. While the mix of winners and losers
may be different than under other proposals, the ultimate
fate of the Blueprint will still be determined by the same
fundamental political dynamics that would face any tax
reform proposal.
For example, the Blueprint would permit companies to
fully and immediately deduct the cost of all tangible and
intangible property, with the exception of land. However,
the Blueprint also would correspondingly deny deductions
for net interest expense. Companies must therefore
weigh whether losing interest deductions is a cost they
are willing to incur in exchange for full expensing (and a
20% corporate rate).
The purpose for denying deductions for net interest
expense is to prevent a presumed double benefit from
fully expensing leveraged purchases of property.
However, the exclusion of land from full expensing under
the Blueprint would be particularly severe for debtfinanced
purchases of land because the land would not be
eligible for full expensing (or apparently even
depreciation as under current law), while deductions for
interest expense on the debt would not be permitted.
Moreover, the persistent issues under current law
involving the allocation of purchase price between nondeductible
land and immediately deductible
improvements on the land would be intensified under the
Blueprint. Other aspects of paying for a reduced
corporate rate will not come easier in the new Congress.
The allure of reducing business tax rates did not draw
members to support the bill presented to them by former
Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp.
Corporate integration. In the Senate, Finance Committee
Chairman Hatch continues to go his own direction on tax
reform, touting a corporate integration plan that could be
a substitute for or be complementary to a rate reduction
effort that includes international tax reform. Hatch says
he is still aiming to release a corporate integration
discussion draft. Chairman Hatch has said the proposal
could accomplish the international tax reform that is
widely seen as necessary, and the reception to the draft
could dictate how strongly he tries to advance the
proposal next year. The draft is expected to pair a
dividends-paid deduction with a mandatory 35%
withholding tax for dividends and interest. Other senators
and third parties have raised concerns about a corporate
integration plan, including:
► that the proposed 35% withholding tax expected would
penalize tax-exempt entities like retirement plans and
deter foreign investment in the United States; and
► that a dividends paid deduction would, by reducing
corporate tax liability, diminish the effectiveness of
current tax incentives like the R&D credit and
accelerated depreciation, and disadvantage startup
companies more likely to retain their earnings rather
than pay dividends.
Extenders. The fate of tax extenders (and certain other
tax issues) will likely depend on both what can be
accomplished during the 2016 lame-duck session and the
success of the likely focus on tax reform in early 2017.
15
| Election 2016
Tax
There is a push to include the provisions that expire at the
end of 2016 in year-end legislation, though if that is
unsuccessful the issue will certainly return in 2017, either
through inclusion in a tax reform measure or separately if
those efforts have played out.
The 2015 tax legislation made some extender provisions
permanent and extended others for five years, meaning
the two-year extensions that expire at the end of 2016
will be the focus of the next effort.
There will certainly be attention paid to these provisions
during any discussion of tax extenders in 2017.
Tax treaties. Action on the eight Foreign Relations
Committee-approved tax treaties that Senator Rand Paul
(R-KY) wants renegotiated over information sharing
concerns is seen as overdue. The treaties include: new
protocols amending US tax treaties with Switzerland,
Luxembourg, Spain and Japan; new tax treaties with
Hungary, Chile and Poland; and a multilateral convention
on tax administration. There have been no plans
announced for trying to move the treaties during the
lame-duck session, though such an effort is possible.
State tax issues. In August, House Judiciary Committee
Chairman Goodlatte released a second discussion draft
related to remote sales tax that would apply tax at the
destination state of the goods, rather than on the location
of the seller, which was his previous approach. The tax
would be imposed at a single rate determined by the state
of the purchaser, but using the tax base of the state of
origin.
Chairman Goodlatte wanted a vote this year on the
proposal, which had the support of Speaker Ryan, but this
vote is not likely to occur during the lame duck session.
When Congress approved a customs reauthorization
measure that made permanent the Internet Tax Freedom
Act in February, Senate Majority Leader McConnell said
he had provided assurances to supporters of the
Marketplace Fairness Act “that we’ll have an opportunity
to consider that sometime this year.” Since that is not
likely to occur during the lame-duck session, the issue is
sure to resurface in 2017.
In September, the House approved by voice vote the
Mobile Workforce State Income Tax Simplification Act
(H.R. 2315), to prohibit wages earned by an employee
who performs employment duties in more than one state
from being subject to income tax in any state other than:
(1) the state of the employee’s residence, and (2) the
state within which the employee is present and
performing employment duties for more than 30 days
during the calendar year. Senate Finance Committee
member John Thune (R-SD) sponsors a Senate version of
the bill (S. 386), though the outlook for the issue is
unclear.
16
| Election 2016
Health
With a Trump win and Republicans maintaining control of
the House and Senate, the health agenda promises to be
one of the greatest policy areas of change in the next
Congress.
ACA Repeal/Replace. In January, following a 240-181
vote, the House sent to the President H.R. 3762,
Restoring Americans’ Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation
Act – a piece of legislation which dismantled key
provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The same
legislation was approved in the Senate on a vote of 52 to
47. Although the President ultimately vetoed the
legislation, it represents a blueprint for Congressional
action in 2017 to repeal core components of the ACA.
The reconciliation process allows leaders to call up
legislation and pass it with a simple majority vote in the
Senate—avoiding a potential filibuster. Reconciliation
rules in the Senate are complex, enforced by the Senate
Parliamentarian, and constrained by CBO scoring rules
and conventions – which combine to determine what can
and cannot be included in a reconciliation bill.
Reconciliation is a powerful tool but its use is limited to
policy changes that have a direct impact on taxing or
spending levels. Because they have used this process
before, Republicans have a road map of the changes that
will be possible through the use of reconciliation in a
closely divided Senate. Find a link to a summary of the
Reconciliation bill that passed in 2015 here. Donald
Trump has been less prescriptive in terms of the specifics
of the ACA replace plan that he supports. But generally,
he has called for a special session of Congress to
completely repeal the ACA and replace it with a plan that
allows consumers to buy insurance across state lines,
allow individuals to deduct the cost of health care on their
federal tax returns, expand Health Savings Accounts
(HSAs) and block grant Medicaid. Speaker Paul Ryan and
the House GOP introduced a proposal to replace the ACA
that can be found here. Because the Senate GOP did not
introduce their own ACA replace plan, negotiations
between the chambers will be required before a strategy
is developed.
User Fee Legislation. The Senate HELP Committee and
the House Energy and Commerce Committee are tasked
with the reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee
Act (PDUFA), the Generic Drug User Fee Act (GDUFA), the
Biosimiliar User Fee Act (BsUFA), the Medical Device User
Fee and Modernization Act (MDUFMA). These programs
must be reauthorized in 2017 to ensure that sufficient
industry fees are available for the FDA to continue to
consider the applications of drugs and devices.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and relevant
industries have reached draft agreements on the user fee
proposals. The proposals are historically bipartisan
priorities and are expected to be approved by Congress
next year. Some of the drug pricing issues raised by
Democrats in 2016 could potentially become embroiled in
the FDA user fee legislation negotiations. Even though
Donald Trump has voiced some populist concerns about
the increasing cost of prescription drugs, the risk of drug
pricing policy changes being enacted next year are less
likely given that Hillary Clinton did not win the White
House and the GOP continues to control the House and
Senate. But Democrats are likely to continue to highlight
the issue and seek policy changes to address it.
Mental Health/ Opioids. Currently, discussions are
ongoing to find a compromise that can be enacted on
mental health legislation in the lame duck Congress and
possible further action to address the opioid addiction
crisis that was such a big issue in so many election
campaigns. But disagreements over funding levels, gun
issues and the privacy of medical records persist. It
remains to be seen if negotiators can reach agreement on
these issues in the lame duck session of Congress or if the
issue will be revisited in the next Congress.
MACRA Oversight. Congressional oversight of the
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ (CMS)
implementation of the Medicare Access and CHIP
Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) is expected to
continue following several House and Senate hearings
held over the past several months and recent publication
of a final rule on the matter.
In 2015 Congress passed MACRA which overhauls how
Medicare pays for physician services. The legislation
repealed the Medicare physician sustainable growth rate
(SGR) formula and instead moves to a new two-track
payment system called the Quality Payment Program
(QPP). The two tracks of the QPP seek to tie an increased
percentage of physicians’ Medicare fee-for-service
payments to outcomes through the Merit Based Incentive
Payment System (MIPS) and also to encourage the
adoption of alternative payment models (APMs).
At recent House and Senate hearings, members from
both parties expressed concern about MACRA’s potential
adverse impact on smaller independent and rural
physician practices. While the final rule attempts to
address these concerns, it is expected that Congress will
continue to utilize its oversight power to monitor
implementation.
17
| Election 2016
Health
Healthcare Reauthorization Priorities. The Children’s
Health Insurance Plan (CHIP) will expire and needs to be
reauthorized in 2017. CHIP is a federal and state
partnership program which provides health coverage to
an estimated 8.9 million low-income children. In 2015,
President Obama signed the Medicare Access and CHIP
Reauthorization Act which extended CHIP for an
additional two years; without an extension of the program
in 2017 the program will exhaust its funding and states
will be required to continue the children’s coverage
through Medicaid until 2019, due to the ACA’s
maintenance of effort (MOE) provision unless the ACA is
repealed. The reauthorization process will create an
opportunity to consider additional policy changes
including changes to the CHIP and Medicaid programs.
The ACA also created a funding stream for community
health centers. In 2015, a bipartisan vote in Congress
extended the Community Health Center Fund by an
additional two years (FY 2016 and FY 2017). It is likely
that lawmakers will push to extend funding of community
health centers into future years beyond 2017.
Chronic Care. In late October, Senate Finance Committee
Chairman Hatch and Ranking Member Wyden along with
Senators Johnny Isakson (R–GA) and Mark Warner (D-VA),
co-chairs of the Finance Committee Chronic Care Working
Group, released a discussion draft with proposals to
improve health outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries living
with chronic conditions. Potential Senate legislative
action on the discussion draft is possible in the lame duck
session, but it is also possible the bill will be taken up in
the next Congress.

Energy
Donald Trump is widely expected to significantly depart
from the priorities of the Obama Administration by
favoring development of additional conventional energy
resources and attempting to put the brakes on new
environmental initiatives. The GOP majorities in the
House and Senate have a similar agenda and Democrats
in Congress are expected to mobilize in opposition -- in
particular by leveraging their power in the Senate to
filibuster legislation – and publicly highlight the potential
impacts of a Trump administration’s policies.
Trump has pledged to cancel US participation in the 2015
Paris Climate agreement, and opposes implementation of
the Obama Administration’s Clean Power Plan (CPP). His
campaign literature is heavily salted with proposals to
provide regulatory relief to fossil fuel industries and
slanted in favor of new administrative initiatives to foster
conventional energy development. Specifically, his
website calls for the following energy-related initiatives:
► Make America energy independent, create millions of
new jobs, and protect clean air and clean water;
conserve our natural habitats, reserves and resources;
unleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new
wealth to our country.
► Declare American energy dominance a strategic
economic and foreign policy goal of the United
States.
► Unleash America’s $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil,
and natural gas reserves, plus hundreds of years in
clean coal reserves.
► Become, and stay, totally independent of any need to
import energy from the OPEC cartel or any nations
hostile to our interests.
► Open onshore and offshore leasing on federal lands,
eliminate moratorium on coal leasing, and open shale
energy deposits.
► Encourage the use of natural gas and other American
energy resources that will both reduce emissions but
also reduce the price of energy and increase our
economic output.
► Rescind all job-destroying Obama executive actions.
Mr. Trump will reduce and eliminate all barriers to
responsible energy production, creating at least a half
million jobs a year, $30 billion in higher wages, and
cheaper energy.
Given the predominance of oil and gas executives
amongst his kitchen cabinet, it is also widely expected
that President-elect Trump will try to halt additional
environmental regulatory measures proposed by the
Obama Administration, such as methane emission
curbs. It should be noted that it is difficult legally to
change or repeal regulations which have been
promulgated in final form – such as the CPP – without
going through the Administrative Procedures Act
process. Environmental lawyers can be expected to
litigate at every step of the way if Trump attempts to
bypass Congress and eliminate the CPP by Executive
Order, and the courts may well serve as a brake on such
actions. However, environmental advocates who would
have likely tried to push a President Clinton to
administratively expand the scope of the CPP’s carbon
emission regulations beyond the electric power sector,
potentially economy-wide under Section 115 of the Clean
Air Act, may now be left to using a litigation route to try
to force the Environmental Protection Agency to expand
the CPP to achieve this goal.
During the campaign, Trump also specifically rejected the
idea of using a carbon tax/carbon pricing as a means of
encouraging market-driven emission reductions. With
GOP chairmen of the tax-writing committees in the House
and Senate, it is very unlikely that they will schedule
hearings or markups to move carbon taxes – other than to
schedule votes in the House or Senate aimed at
undermining vulnerable Democrats up for reelection in
2018.
Additionally, the President-elect has vowed to allow
energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline
and other industrial facilities which have faced denials or
delays under the current Administration, to move
forward. Trump has proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure
plan that would rely heavily on private-public partnerships
by providing a tax credit to encourage private investors to
fund projects overseen by states and municipalities. As
conceived by Trump’s advisors, the tax credit would apply
to infrastructure projects with a dedicated source of
revenue, such as toll roads, airports or utilities financed
at least in part by fees paid by users. Decisions on which
projects to fund would generally be left to the states.

Trump’s tax reform plans generally adhere to the
precepts of the House Republican tax reform Blueprint,
but he differs with that outline in some important
respects. The House Blueprint proposes, among other
things, to allow 100% expensing of qualified business
investments and to deny the deductibility of net business
interest expenses. It would also eliminate most fossil fuelspecific
tax incentives such as deductions for intangible
drilling costs (IDCs) and percentage depletion, but its
proposal to allow expensing of all business investment
would mitigate the loss of many of the specific
deductions. The Blueprint appears to allow both
independent and integrated producers to deduct 100% of
IDCs in the year they are paid or incurred. While this
would preserve the status quo for independent producers,
allowing integrated oil and gas companies to also expense
100% of IDCs could increase the rate of return on oil and
gas wells drilled by integrated companies. This change, in
combination with the possible loss of the percentage
depletion deduction (which allows cost recovery in excess
of cost basis) could ultimately make independent
producers less competitive with integrated companies.
Trump offered qualified support for the Blueprint’s
proposal to allow 100% expensing – but would limit the
provision to manufacturers – and those who elect
expensing will lose the deductibility of business interest
expenses. Further, he may be more inclined to keep
traditional fossil fuel-specific tax incentives, such as the
deduction for intangible drilling costs and the percentage
depletion deduction.
While President-elect Trump has spent much of his time
discussing federal policy issues surrounding conventional
energy resources, he has expressed opposition to
continued federal support for the development of wind
and solar energy and has said that he will eliminate all
federal spending for clean energy research. How he
proceeds in the new Congress may be heavily influenced
by both electoral politics (e.g., ethanol-rich Iowa largely
supported his candidacy) and the pre-existing dynamics in
Congress. Many congressional Republicans have opposed
even temporary extensions of renewable energy
incentives and the fate of these provisions may well be
linked to the effectiveness of the Democratic minority.

Financial Services
Republicans’ retention of the House and Senate majorities
means that President-elect Trump will have partners in
both banking committees to help implement an agenda
heavy on deregulation. The new Senate Banking
Committee chairman will be Mike Crapo (R-ID), who has a
solid working relationship with returning Ranking Member
Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and could work productively with
him in a handful of areas. On the House side, Rep. Jeb
Hensarling (R-TX) returns as chairman of the Financial
Services Committee. A fierce opponent of the 2010
Dodd-Frank Act, Hensarling will have Trump’s support in
renewing his effort to repeal and replace the Dodd-Frank
Act and continuing the panel’s aggressive oversight of
financial regulators. Given Republicans’ narrow majority
in the Senate, Democrats’ ability to filibuster
controversial bills in that chamber will make it difficult for
House and Senate GOP leaders to push through a broad
dismantling of major elements of Dodd-Frank, something
the President-elect called for during the campaign. But
given that Republicans will have full control of the
executive and legislative branches for the first time since
2006, the GOP base will be dismayed if they don’t try
anyway. Short of that broader effort, bipartisan
compromises in the areas of bank capital and regulatory
relief for smaller banks seem achievable.
Senate Banking Committee. Crapo is widely seen as
working constructively with Sen. Brown – a stark contrast
to Brown’s relationship with current Chairman Richard
Shelby (R-AL), who has been unable to agree with
Democrats on much legislatively. In a July interview,
Crapo called Brown “straightforward and honorable” and
said that while they were far apart in terms of their
political views, “the fact is we have been able to find
significant areas of consensus where we can agree to
move forward on good policy, so I expect that we would
be able to do that.” The leading options for an early
bipartisan effort include a bill providing regulatory relief
from some Dodd-Frank provisions to community banks, a
high priority for both Crapo and Brown. Such a bill might
include language raising Dodd-Frank’s $50 billion asset
threshold, above which banks must submit to more
rigorous prudential supervision by the Fed. Crapo and
Brown also could agree on modest structural changes to
the Federal Reserve, unless pressure from the Trump
White House for a more ambitious Fed reform bill – like
the package of changes passed by the House in November
2015 – derails that effort. Crapo and Brown could also
conceivably agree on more stringent capital standards for
the largest banks, a theme that Brown hammers at every
opportunity.
As Shelby did, Crapo is expected to maintain the
committee’s focus on rules and bodies created by the
Dodd-Frank Act, such as the Financial Stability Oversight
Council (FSOC) and the Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau (CFPB), which suffered a judicial setback when a
federal appeals court on October 11 ruled that its
structure was unconstitutional. Crapo has also been
skeptical of the new supervisory authorities the 2010 law
gave the Fed to oversee larger banks and insurers that
are designated as systemically important by the FSOC.
Crapo could work collaboratively with Ranking Member
Brown on a legislative follow-up to the Fed’s recent report
criticizing banks’ trading of physical commodities; one
obvious possibility is to repeal the merchant banking
exemption given to the holding companies for Goldman
Sachs and Morgan Stanley, as the Fed recommended.
Finally, a post-crisis system for housing finance – i.e., the
future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac – still looms as the
biggest area left unaddressed by the 2010 financial
reforms, but a bipartisan effort to establish a new system
drafted by Crapo and then-Chairman Tim Johnson (R-SD)
in 2013-14 foundered when the Banking Committee’s
liberal Democrats (and some Republicans) declined to
support the centrist proposal. Since then, few signs have
emerged about how to structure a new housing finance
system in a way that could survive a Senate filibuster, and
President-elect Trump did not address the issue during his
campaign.
House Financial Services Committee. After years of
confrontation with a Democratic White House and
Democratic appointees to financial regulators, Chairman
Hensarling will shift strategies now that the executive
branch is in more friendly hands. Hensarling is not likely
to improve his contentious relationship with Rep. Maxine
Waters (D-CA), however, who will return as ranking
member and is certain to push back on Hensarling’s
efforts to replace the 2010 reforms with more
conservative approaches. While Hensarling has regularly
done battle with officials at the FSOC, Treasury, SEC and
the Fed, new leadership is expected at those agencies –
though even Republican appointees will be constrained by
the existing statutory mandates in Dodd-Frank, unless the
new Congress is able to alter the law with legislation. At
the Fed, Chairman Janet Yellen’s term does not expire
until January 2018. President-elect Trump frequently
criticized Yellen as being overly “political” during the
campaign.
21
| Election 2016
Financial Services
During the four previous years of Hensarling’s
chairmanship, most of the committee’s major bills died
quietly in the Senate, such as efforts to repeal much of
Dodd-Frank (the CHOICE Act), impose substantial reforms
upon the Fed, restructure the CFPB and strip the FSOC of
various powers. That may change now that the House,
Senate and White House will operate with greater
coordination, though the threat of the Senate filibuster
limits what Republicans can achieve. Hensarling notably
has enjoyed a longtime friendship with Vice Presidentelect
Mike Pence, which will give him a powerful ally in the
White House as the new administration plots its strategy
for financial regulation and nominates key appointees for
the regulatory agencies. Hensarling agrees with Senators
Crapo and Brown on the importance of capital for big
banks, but he wants to reward banks with relief from
much of Dodd-Frank’s supervisory regime if they agree to
a higher leverage ratio. Hensarling can be expected to
reintroduce his CHOICE Act and Rep. Bill Huizenga’s (R-
MI) package of Fed reforms (the FORM Act), and to renew
the panel’s aggressive oversight of the CFPB, the FSOC
and other bodies established by Dodd-Frank. Republicans
have also been critical of moves by global regulatory
bodies to set capital and liquidity rules for “systemically
important” banks and insurance companies.
Wells Fargo Scandal. Lawmakers in both the House and
Senate are certain to resume their investigations of Wells
Fargo in the wake of revelations that the bank’s
employees created as many as 2 million accounts without
customers’ consent. Hensarling and other Republicans
want to use the scandal to raise questions about the
performance of the CFPB and the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), while Ranking
Member Waters has vowed to offer a bill breaking up
Wells Fargo into smaller companies. On the Senate side,
Ranking Member Brown has used the scandal to focus on
mandatory arbitration provisions in financial contracts,
and will likely propose legislation prohibiting such clauses,
though Sen. Crapo is unlikely to support him. In an
editorial piece in October, Camden Fine, president of the
Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA),
wrote that he “fully expected” that Wells Fargo’s new
policy of notifying customers whenever a new account is
created in their name, along with “far more stringent
policies, will ultimately become mandatory as
policymakers respond to the scandal with additional
regulatory burdens on banks of all sizes.”
Oversight of Regulators. As they have in previous years,
the banking committees in 2017 will devote considerable
time to overseeing rules issued by financial regulators.
These will include the still-unfinished interagency rules for
clawing back incentive compensation drafted by the SEC,
the Fed, the FDIC and other agencies; the CFPB’s
controversial new rules for prepaid cards, payday lenders
and mandatory arbitration clauses; the global Financial
Stability Board’s forthcoming regulations for capital held
by large insurers; and the international Basel Committee’s
rules for bank capital, which are expected to be issued by
the end of this year. The Banking Committee must also
schedule hearings for high-level Treasury nominees, as
well as nominees for key vacancies at the SEC, CFTC, the
Federal Reserve and the Ex-Im Bank, which were never
filled in the current Congress because of lingering
disputes with the Obama administration.
Two Deadlines to Watch: 1) the largest banks resubmit
their “living will” resolution plans in May 2017, always a
source of contention for critics of “too big to fail”; 2) the
Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) expires at the end of
2017, forcing yet another ideological dispute over
whether the federal backstop program should be
renewed.
22

Trade
Trade legislative issues could figure prominently in 2017.
During the campaign, President-elect Trump argued
vigorously against the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership
(TPP), vowed to renegotiate the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and pledged to label China as
a currency manipulator, which could trigger the
imposition of significant tariffs on Chinese imports.
Senate Finance Committee. President-elect Trump may
find himself somewhat at odds on his trade agenda with
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Hatch who has
supported numerous trade agreements during his
congressional tenure.
House Ways and Means Committee. House Republican
trade leaders – including Speaker Ryan and Ways and
Means Chairman Brady – played a pivotal role in
advancing President Obama’s trade initiatives through
Congress, including passage of Trade Promotion
Authority (TPA) in 2015. A key question is how closely
they will work to support President-elect Trump’s trade
restrictionist agenda.
Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. Unless TPP can
be approved in the 2016 lame-duck session (an extremely
unlikely prospect, as discussed above), TPP will not be
ratified.
Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership
Agreement. US and EU trade negotiators failed to make
much meaningful progress on TTIP in 2016. Prospects for
TTIP are dim, given the President-elect’s trade priorities
and a potential chill in US-EU relations.
Other trade agreements? The Trade Promotion
Authority, enacted in 2015, provides enhanced fast-track
procedures for trade agreements reached before July 1,
2018, with a possible extension to July 1, 2021. Will
President-elect Trump decide to launch additional trade
agreements that could be considered under the fast-track
authority in Congress? Following the U.K. vote on Brexit
this summer, some Members of Congress expressed an
interest in a possible US-U.K. free trade agreement.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013740.txt,"For real neurobiological data, a time series and its n time delays are first
reconstructed as a trajectory in an n+1 dimensional geometric embedding space
and, following partition of that geometric space into n+1 dimensional lettered boxes
(the choice of partition being a sensitive step), what was once an orbit has become
a sequence of symbols. Dynamical systems in geometric space become symbolic
dynamics in sequence space. It was Kolmogoroff (1958) who first applied
Shannon’s ideas of entropy and information (Shannon and Weaver, 1949; Khinchin,
1957) to the quantification of these dynamical system’s telegraphic messages as

discrete, “stochastic” (random, probabilistic) output. Kolmogoroff turned to Shannon

entropy, -S'p, log p, (where p = 1/n and n = number of possibilities) to decide the

question whether a dynamical system that naturally partitioned into a two or three
box system per unit time had the same entropy. His answer was no, that —3(1/3 In
(1/3)) = 1.098 > -2(1/2 In (1/2) = 0.6931 loge and in computer relevant logz, 1.5850 >
1.0 (Kolmogorov, 1959). Entropy increases with possibility.

Nonlinear differential equations representing brain-relevant expanding
dynamical systems replace Shannon’s linguistically weighted and serially ordered,
Markoff-dependent random number generator of probabilistic language. As noted
above, in the case of the Sharkovskii sequences (Sharkovskii, 1964; Metropolis et
al, 1973; Misiurewicz, 1995), a small change in the single parameter of an entire
class of single maximum maps generating motions that are coded from their
position at the left or right of center of the unit interval, alters and determines
precisely the periodic output such as {1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1...) of its binary

message. In higher dimensional examples such as the Rossler and Lorenz
systems, one can visualize the joint actions of 24(+) and A(-) moving the trajectory
so as to both enter, “create,” new boxes and generate new letters as well as visit old
ones, unstable fixed points, thus forming unstable periodic orbits. The latter, one of
three diagnostic features of chaotic attractors (see above), can also be seen as
resulting from the “coarse-grained” imprecision of real world neurobiological
measurement such that two points that are brought close to attractive-repelling

points are, within measurement error, recorded as having the same value.

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016271.txt,"there is a constant structure with some activity going on inside it. When von Neumann’s
abstract machine reproduced, it made a copy of itself in another region of the plane.
Within the “machine” was a horizontal line of squares which acted as a finite linear tape,
using a subset of the finite alphabet. It was the symbols in those squares that encoded the
machine of which they were a part. During the machine’s reproduction, the “tape” could
move either left or right and was both interpreted (transcribed) as the instructions
(translation) for the new “machine” being built and then copied (replicated)—with the
new copy being placed inside the new machine for further reproduction. Francis Crick
and James Watson later showed, in 1953, how such a tape could be instantiated in
biology by along DNA molecule with its finite alphabet of four nucleobases: guanine,
cytosine, adenine, and thymine (G, C, A, and T).'* Asin von Neumann’s machine, in
biological reproduction the linear sequence of symbols in DNA is interpreted—through
transcription into RNA molecules, which then are translated into proteins, the structures
that make up a new cell—and the DNA is replicated and encased in the new cell.

A second foundational piece of work was in a 1945 “First Draft” report on the
design for a digital computer, wherein von Neumann advocated for a memory that could
contain both instructions and data.'4 This is now known as a von Neumann architecture
computer—as distinct from a Harvard architecture computer, where there are two
separate memories, one for instructions and one for data. The vast majority of computer
chips built in the era of Moore’s Law are based on the von Neumann architecture,
including those powering our data centers, our laptops, and our smartphones. Von
Neumann’s digital-computer architecture 1s conceptually the same generalization—from
early digital computers constructed with electromagnetic relays at both Harvard
University and Bletchley Park—that occurs in going from a special-purpose Turing
Machine to a Universal Turing Machine. Furthermore, his self-replicating automata
share a fundamental similarity with both the construction of a Turing Machine and the
mechanism of DNA-based reproducing biological cells. There is to this day scholarly
debate over whether von Neumann saw the cross connections between these three pieces
of work, Turing’s and his two. Turing’s revision of his paper was done while he and von
Neumann were both at Princeton; indeed, after getting his PhD, Turing almost stayed on
as von Neumann’s postdoc.

Without Turing and von Neumann, the cybernetics of Wiener might have
remained a dominant mode of thought and driver of technology for much longer than its
brief moment of supremacy. In this imaginary version of history, we might well live
today in an actual steam-punk world and not just get to observe its fantastical
instantiations at Maker Faires!

My point is that Wiener thought about the world—physical, biological, and (in
Human Use) sociological—in a particular way. He analyzed the world as continuous
variables, as he explains in chapter 1 along with a nod to thermodynamics through an
overlay of Gibbs statistics. He also shoehorns in a weak and unconvincing model of
information as message-passing between and among both physical and biological entities.
To me, and from today’s vantage point seventy years on, his tools seem woefully

listed as the only author, whereas others contributed to the concepts he laid out; thus credit for the
architecture has gone to him alone.

I was called by the man, whom I had known for several years, to help represent him in the matter.
I conducted extensive research on the policy of the local prosecutor with regard to such cases,
and learned that no one had ever gone to prison under similar circumstances. I then met with the
prosecutor on several occasions and we worked out a plea bargain, in which my client would
plead guilty to contributing to the delinquency of a minor but would get no jail time. We thought
the case was over, until we learned that the local police were not satisfied with this resolution and
were bringing the matter to the attention of the United States Attorney’s Office, thus turning it
into a federal case.

The federal statutes governing sexual contact with underage girls are draconian. Had my client
been convicted under them, he could have received a sentence of 25 years for each separate
massage. This could have resulted in life imprisonment. We probably could have won the case
had we decided to litigate, because there was no interstate aspect to the alleged crimes: all the
girls were local and everything happened within that state. Moreover, the alleged “victims” were
anything but victims—they sought out my client and repeatedly called his house asking for more
business. But the risks were simply too high, in light of the possible sentence if he were to be
convicted.

For that reason, we entered into an unusual plea bargain, under which the federal government
would not prosecute him if he agreed to plead guilty to a state crime that resulted in 18 months
imprisonment and the need to register as a sex offender (which he really isn’t). He served only a
few months in jail and the rest under house arrest. A group that brings lawsuits on behalf of the
victims of sex crimes then sued the federal government for being “too lenient” and tried to get the
plea bargain rescinded. I doubt they will succeed.

was reviewed along with STS-87 Southwest Research data
— Crater overpredicted penetration of tile coating
significantly
+ Initial penetration to described by normal velocity
* Varies with volume/mass of projectile (e.g., 200ft/sec for
3cu. In)
+ Significant energy is required for the softer SOFI particle
to penetrate the relatively hard tile coating
* Test results do show that it is possible at sufficient mass
and velocity
* Conversely, once tile is penetrated SOF! can cause
significant damage

* Minor variations in total energy (above penetration level)
can cause significant tile damage

— Flight condition is significantly outside of test database
* Volume of ramp is 1920cu in vs 3 cu in for test

NASA Internal Slide

WHAT DO YOU UNDERSTAND FROM THE SLIDE?

Some images of the launch are shown on the right

Here is what you should have understood from the slide: tiles are
really tough but if the foam dislodged from the fuel tank broke through
the outer coating it would cause significant damage. The estimated speed
of the foam hitting the tile was 640 times greater than anything previously
tested. Worried?

Is this a proper understanding of the problem? You have the slide
and the images. Take another look and think hard. If you want, you can
check a video of a similar launch on YouTube to get a feel for the scale of
things, but the still frames shown all the information you need to make
your conclusion.

prostittion is a state crime, never before a man in his own house charged with soliciting. ! in Florida first 
offenders are required to take a sex ed class and get pre trial diversion, no criminal record. . . there is a 
felony solication for the THIRD offense. . A grand jury was held and they found me guilty of one count of 
felony solitciation. because there were many girls. . mandatory diversion. sentence. !!!! a grand jury 
. ususally only for capital murder cases. . Recarey and Reiter ( police chief). pulled my garbage for months, 
and surveilled the house . letting all the gilrs come and go ? ! called in the FBI. they did not like the grand 
jury result. and released to the press, the raw sewage of police interviews , ie, no girl was cross examined 
EVER. . Unheard of . - the girls retunred the house multiplie times. for 200 dollars for a rub and 
tug. . no sex. . some worked in the locak massage parlors, most in thier mid twenties.. There is only 
press stories told my strippers of me buying my girlfiedn from slovakia from her parents . girls under 
15. . all made up to get press. . FBI / puts a task force together title operation leap year to investigate 
my personal massage activity ?! nuts. interviews my chiropractor ? medical info. . etc. 
worked at Mara Lago. Trump knew of it. and came to my house many times during that 
period. The testimony of the houseman John allessi confiremed it. He never got a massage. 
abe gosman a friend of mine. ran into financial difficulty with assited living homes. . His home was listed 
at 45 million dollars. with no takers for months on end . He and I agreed a price of 30m. ( His wife . 
ends up going to jail for lying to the bankrupty trustee about her jewelry. ) this is in the summer of 04. . I 
became the stalking horse bidder at 36 m. ie if someone bid higher I would receive a fee. 
trump buys the house at the telephone auction. only me trump andd his friend pulty the developer. 
He quickly puts it on the market for 125 million, serves the purpose of a justification for a high sale later 
. . and no one will touch it. it is is bough in the name of trump properties 11c.. no idea who owns it. or 
what else it owns . 
Three years later 08 he sells it to Ryboloolev for approx 100 million. He should have had a 50 million plus 
capital gain. he tells people and press he spent 20-30 m to fix up. that would justifiy a reduction in captial 
gains, key question how did he report the sale , if he did at all on his 08 tax return. 
He has no money. when he buys the house. His biz model is putting his name on a real estate development and 
gets a fee for using his name. The hotel biz is just that. someone else buys the hotel. hoping to make a profit 
from its operation and eventual sale. Trump put his name on it, and get a 2 % fee and maybe a piece of the 
profit if any on sale. He touts the project as  his  . just as in his current financial statements on file as 
president he lists his  income  as the GROSS receipts of the clubs, with no expenses deducted. not his 
personal revenue. ie the doral golf club loses money every year. it pays out more than it takes in , but he lists 
the revenue as his income. AMAZING.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028063.txt,"Weeks later, Misha Arens mentioned Kav 300 in one of our regular meetings.
It was not so much a statement of what should or shouldn’t have happened, but a
show of genuine puzzlement. “How can it be,” he asked, “when there is a real
fight, an operation in which our soldiers are shooting, that terrorists come out
alive?” The answer, to me, was simple: Sayeret Matkal. From our earliest days,
there was an understanding that you used whatever force necessary in order to
make an operation successful. Yet once the aim had been achieved — in this case,
eliminating the danger to the passengers — it was over. I am convinced, by the
way, that Misha didn’t actually order the sayeret, or anyone else, to kill all the
terrorists. I’m equally convinced there was a tacit assumption on the ground that
Misha’s view, and Shamir’s as well, was that this would be no bad thing.

Yet by the summer of 1984, Shamir and Arens appeared in danger of losing
their jobs. Israel’s next election, the first since the Lebanon war, was due in
July. Just as the trauma of the 1973 war had helped Begin end Likud’s three
decades in opposition, the polls and the pundits were now suggesting that
Shimon Peres might bring Labor back to power. There was no prospect he’d
win an outright majority in the 120-seat Knesset. No one had ever done that, not
even Ben-Gurion in his political heyday. From 1948, Israel’s political landscape
had been populated by at least a dozen-or-so parties, mostly a reflection of the
various Zionist and religious groups before the state was established. The
dominant party always needed to make deals with some of the smaller ones to
get the required 60-vote parliamentary majority and form a government.

The Likud looked vulnerable. Domestic concerns, alone, were eroding its
support. Under Begin’s turbo-charged version of Milton Freedman economics,
an economic boom had given way to runaway inflation and a stock market
crash. Lebanon, however, was the main issue, and it remained a running
political sore. The assassinated Bashir Gemayel’s brother, Amin Gemayel, had
become president. But Israel still had large numbers of troops there. And while
most of the PLO fighters had gone, we faced a new and potentially even more
intractable enemy in the south of the country. When our invasion began, the
area’s historically disadvantaged Shi’ite Muslim majority had been the one
group besides the Christians with the prospect of benefiting. The PLO rocket
and artillery bases had disrupted their lives and, worse, placed them in the line

Except for De Bono there is not much written about creativity
in books or on the Internet, but if you dip into the video archive, the
discussion really opens up. Perhaps this is a feature of creativity; it’s
easier to explain in person. Of course, I have taken on the writing task
with this book but I have the benefit of modern day resources such as
multimedia, interactivity, and the web.

Some people appear to have creativity in abundance and the things
they create are truly wonderful. I’m thinking here of Picasso, Einstein,
Mozart, Edison, or Maxwell, but a precise definition of creative thinking
is hard to pin down. Here are some generally accepted categories:

Divergent Thinking

The first sort of creative thinking we recognize is divergent thinking,
often called brainstorming. This is the art of coming up with ideas — lots
of them. A quick way to test your skill is to take a minute, and list all the
possible uses for a paperclip. Try it!

J

In 60 seconds write down all the uses for a paper clip you can
think of. Time yourself.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014007.txt,"1. Setting appointments and meetings takes a lot of time. Have your assistant set things up for you in
Google Calendar. I input my own items via my Palm Z22 or iCal, then use Spanning Sync and Missing
Sync for Palm OS to syne everything. On my tiberlight Sony VAIO, which I still use for travel, I use
CompanionLink for Google Calendar. I suggest batching meetings or calls in one or two set days, with
15 minutes between appointments. Scattering them throughout the week at odd times just interrupts
everything else. (Update 2009: The Palm Z22 has been discarded, and I now use a 13-inch MacBook and
BusySync to synchronize iCal with Google Calendar.)

2. If you jump in your assistant’s inbox and answer anything, BCC them so they are aware that you
handled it.

3. Expect small problems. Life is full of compromises, and it’s necessary to let small bad things happen
if you want to get huge good things done. There is no escape. Prevent all problems and get nothing done,
or accept an allowable level of small problems and focus on the big things.

Ready to jump in and test the holy grail? Here are the steps.

1. Determine exactly which accounts you will use and how you want them to respond to (or just
categorize or purge) e-mail for you.

2. Find a virtual assistant.

3. Test for reliability before skill set. Have the top three candidates do something on tight deadline (24
hours) before hiring them and letting them in your inbox.

4. Use a probationary period of 2-4 weeks to test the waters and work out the problems. Again: There
will be problems. It will take a good 3-8 weeks to get to real smooth sailing.

5. Design your ideal lifestyle and find something to do other than let your brain fester in the inbox. Fill
the void.

at the Office of Personnel Management traced back to 2009. Even-
tually, by 2015, according to U.S. estimates, the cyber attack had
harvested over twenty million personnel files of past and present
federal government employees. In addition, it reaped over fourteen
million background checks of intelligence workers done by the Fed-
eral Investigative Services.

All intelligence workers with a sensitive compartmented informa-
tion clearance, such as Snowden, were required to provide informa-
tion on these forms about all their foreign acquaintances, including
any non-U.S. officials whom the applicant knew or had had rela-
tionships with in the past. They also had to list their foreign travel,
family members, police encounters, mental health issues, and credit
history. For good measure, Chinese hackers obtained the confiden-
tial medical histories of government employees by hacking into the
computers of Anthem and other giant health-care companies. If
China’s intelligence services consolidated the fruits of these hack-
ing attacks, it would have a searchable database of almost everyone
working in the American defense and intelligence complex. From

© this database, it could track individuals with high security clearances ©
vulnerable to being bribed, blackmailed, or tricked into cooperating.
No one doubted that the Chinese would use their cyber capabilities
to take advantage of opportunities presented in foreign computer
systems.

General Hayden said of the massive theft of intelligence person-
nel records, “Those records are a legitimate foreign intelligence tar-
get.” He added, “If I, as director of the NSA or CIA, would have
had the opportunity to grab the equivalent in the Chinese system,
I would not have thought twice.” If that opportunity did not arise
for the NSA or the CIA during Hayden’s tenure, it might have been
because no insider in the Chinese intelligence services provided U.S.
intelligence with a road map to it.

Cyber espionage was not the Chinese intelligence service’s only
powerful resource in the intelligence war. To get both electronic
intelligence and human intelligence about the United States, China
also had a highly productive intelligence-sharing treaty with Russia.
It was signed in 1992 after the Soviet Union was dissolved. Although
the terms of this exchange remain secret, defectors from the Rus-

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016259.txt,"Imagine it is 1958 and you are trying to defend the continental United States against
airborne attack. To distinguish hostile aircraft, one of the things you need, besides a
network of computers and early-warning radar sites, is a map of all commercial air
traffic, updated in real time. The United States built such a system and named it SAGE
(Semi-Automatic Ground Environment). SAGE in turn spawned Sabre, the first
integrated reservation system for booking airline travel in real time. Sabre and its
progeny soon became not just a map as to what seats were available but also a system
that began to control, with decentralized intelligence, where airliners would fly, and
when.

But isn’t there a control room somewhere, with someone at the controls? Maybe
not. Say, for example, you build a system to map highway traffic in real time, simply by
giving cars access to the map in exchange for reporting their own speed and location at
the time. The result is a fully decentralized control system. Nowhere is there any
controlling model of the system except the system itself.

Imagine it is the first decade of the 21st century and you want to track the
complexity of human relationships in real time. For social life at a small college, you
could construct a central database and keep it up to date, but its upkeep would become
overwhelming if taken to any larger scale. Better to pass out free copies of a simple
semi-autonomous code, hosted locally, and let the social network update itself. This code
is executed by digital computers, but the analog computing performed by the system as a
whole far exceeds the complexity of the underlying code. The resulting pulse-frequency
coded model of the social graph becomes the social graph. It spreads wildly across the
campus and then the world.

What if you wanted to build a machine to capture what everything known to the
human species means? With Moore’s Law behind you, it doesn’t take too long to digitize
all the information in the world. You scan every book ever printed, collect every email
ever written, and gather forty-nine years of video every twenty-four hours, while tracking
where people are and what they do, in real time. But how do you capture the meaning?

Even in the age of all things digital, this cannot be defined in any strictly logical
sense, because meaning, among humans, isn’t fundamentally logical. The best you can
do, once you have collected all possible answers, is to invite well-defined questions and
compile a pulse-frequency weighted map of how everything connects. Before you know
it, your system will not only be observing and mapping the meaning of things, it will start
constructing meaning as well. In time, it will control meaning, in the same way as the
traffic map starts to control the flow of traffic even though no one seems to be in control.

There are three laws of artificial intelligence. The first, known as Ashby’s Law, after
cybernetician W. Ross Ashby, author of Design for a Brain, states that any effective
control system must be as complex as the system it controls.

The second law, articulated by John von Neumann, states that the defining
characteristic of a complex system is that it constitutes its own simplest behavioral
description. The simplest complete model of an organism is the organism itself. Trying
to reduce the system’s behavior to any formal description makes things more
complicated, not less.

Ln. there aretimesT 1-Tn/ and then conjecture that changing the time . correlations ( by genetic swtch
or other method. , you might be able to make blacks smarter by changing the time for motor layer
development and changing the time for other layers. .). like telemeres for the cell , are their equivalents
for the layers. . as you talked about culling the unused neurons in each layer, each neuron in each layer
would get dfferent (kill yourself if you are not being used instructions ).

Exactly. I looked up the statistics, black kids in the US have slower cognitive development (and never catch
up), which the study of course attributed to social factors without any evidence, and they had faster motor
development! I suspect this means their brains are slower at learning high-level concepts, because the low-
level structures are optimized for a shorter time. But they will keep the lead in motor development, because it
is easier to learn, and they have more time and attention to practice once they get the structures in place.

It could also be that they have an additional set of learning directives in place that adapts them better to a
more hunting/running style of life, whereas the Europeans had to adapt for identifying long-term seasonal
patterns, delayed gratification for agriculture etc.

and CONCEPTS could be layer to layer communicaiton. . are gender differences also a matter of time ,
and structure of interactions. .

I suspect gender differences are mostly motivational, i.e. we have a reward system for all the different social
and cognitive needs, which makes us receive different kinds of pleasure and pain, thereby pay attention and
learn. You cannot learn what does not attract your attention. Women tend to find abstract systems, conflicts
and mechanisms intrinsically boring. Most women in computer science do not write programs because they
enjoy solving puzzles, but because they want to help people, get approval etc. There are almost no women in
math, because it does not help people or yield social attention.

Men tend to find elaborate social relations boring. If there is no pleasure in observing and empathizing with
people, one will not have good social cognition.

1Q is not the only meaningful difference. Chinese pay an inordinate amount of attention to authority. I
suspect historically., the authorities tended to kill them a lot if they did not. Jews tend be intellectually
independent and anti-authoritarian, which might make them creative and inventive in ways that are hard to
find in Asia.

At the moment, I think speed/quality of brain development plus motivational system are the key to
understanding both mind and individual differences. Important part of human language might be the result in
a motivational need to discover/invent grammatical structure, which as a side effect makes us interested in
music.

It would mean that Chomsky’s life long hypothesis, that people have a special circuit for grammatical
language, is wrong. They might be GENERAL learners, just like Gorillas, but with a strong motivational
urge to build grammatical structure, which the brain simply invents (there are only a few ways in which a
natural language can work). That is much easier to wire into a brain than a specific circuit.

imy self believe that african music, westrn music , chinese music are a window into the the structure of
those layers. . western rigid, african primitve , chinese nature based,. I belive that synphoic movments
best describe your layering. they open with a basic simple melody, , after it is learned , it is repeated and

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010967.txt,"In this book I will usually be modeling risk and return at the collective scale or at the
cohort one. A cohort means the set of all same-aged individuals. It turns out that the
ratio of females to males tends to rise with each older cohort, for reasons Bob
Trivers explains, as does wealth up to a point. But in cohort analysis, both effects
(wealth and sex ratio) are incorporated into effects of cohort age. That will simplify

modeling.

My risk theory is another example of what looks to be surprise and novelty until
shown otherwise. The unusual idea lies in projecting the owner’s time
preference/return rate onto the asset rather than conversely. Thus all the owner’s
assets of both factors are selected or modified to fit her current risk profile. This
would count her liquid securities portfolio, cap weighted, as a single asset. All other
assets are too illiquid for practical rebalancing. We own the assets best suited to our
risk profiles, if for no better reason than that we wouldn’t be the winning bidders
for any others if we wanted them. As our risk profiles evolve with age, we modify or
trade them. We will tend to have anticipated this need, and to have factored
modification or trading costs into our bid price. It turns out that this interpretation

can simplify the math of present value and present cost.

It helps in supporting the pay rule, and explaining age-wage profiles, by rebutting a
hypothesis, sometimes argued, that productivity of human capital might rise with
age. Productivity, rate of return and time preference rate all mean the same. My risk
theory argues that we knowa cohort’s risk tolerance from the return to its cap-
weighted securities portfolio as a whole. All other assets of the same cohort,
including human capital, will tend to agree with it in return. Return to security
portfolios tends to be transparent. It declines with adult cohort age. | infer that

return to human capital does the same.

My risk theory and depreciation theory together add a finishing touch to the pay
rule. The key supporting evidence is age-wage profiles. Depreciation theory offers

solid logic, in the face of apparent contrary data, that pay is all human depreciation

CONFIDENTL4L 
Dear Judge Film: 
In his confirmation hearings last fall, Judge Mukasey admirably lifted up the finest 
traditions of the Department of Justice in assuring the United States Senate, and the American 
people, of his solemn intent to ensure fairness and integrity in the administration of justice. Your 
own confirmation hearings echoed that bedrock determination to assure that the Department 
conduct itself with honor and integrity, especially in the enforcement of federal criminal law. 
We come to you in that spirit and respectfully ask for a review of the federal involvement 
in a quintessentially state matter involving our client, Jeffrey Epstein. While we are well aware 
of the rare instances in which a review of this sort is justified, we are confident that the 
circumstances at issue warrant such an examination. Based on our collective experiences, as 
well as those of other former senior Justice Department officials whose advice we have sought, 
we have never before seen a case more appropriate for oversight and review. Thus, while neither 
of us has previously made such a request, we do so now in the recognition that both the 
Department's reputation, as well as the due process rights of our client, are at issue. 
Recently, the Criminal Division concluded a very limited review of this matter at the 
request of U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta. Critically, however, this review deliberately excluded 
many important aspects of this case. Just this past Friday, on May 16, 2008, we received a letter 
from the head of CEOS informing us that CEOS had conducted a review of this case. By its own 
admission, the CEOS review was limited, both factually and legally. Part of the self-imposed 
limitation was CEOS's abstention from addressing our allegations of professional misconduct 
by federal prosecutors—even though such misconduct was, as we contend it is, inextricably 
intertwined with the credibility of the accusations being made against Mr. Epstein by the United 
States Attorney's Office in Miami (USAO). Moreover, CEOS did not assess the terms of the 
Deferred Prosecution Agreement now in effect, nor did CEOS review the federal prosecutors' 
inappropriate efforts to implement those terms. We detail this point below. 
A001438 
Honorable Mark Filip 
May 19, 2008 
Page 2 
By way of background, we were informed by Mr. Acosta that, at his request, CEOS 
would be conducting a review to determine whether federal prosecution was both appropriate 
and, in his words, fair. That is not what occurred. Instead, CEOS has now acknowledged that 
we had raised many compelling argtunents against the USAO's suggested novel application 
of federal law in this matter. Even so, CEOS concluded, in minimalist fashion, that we do not 
see anything that says to us categorically that a federal case should not be brought and that the 
U.S. Attorney would not be abusing his prosecutorial discretion should he authorize federal 
prosecution of Mr. Epstein thus delegating back to Mr. Acosta the decision of whether federal 
prosecution was warranted (emphasis added). Rather than assessing whether prosecution would 
be appropriate, CEOS, using a low baseline for its evaluation, determined only that it would not 
be impossible to prove . . . certain allegations made against Mr. Epstein. The CEOS review 
failed to address the significant problems involving the appearance of impermissible selectivity 
that would necessarily result from a federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein. 
We respect CEOS's conclusion that its authority to review misconduct issues was 
precluded by Criminal Division practice. We further respect CEOS's view that it understood its 
mission as significantly limited. Specifically, the contemplated objective was to determine 
whether the USAO would be abusing its discretion by bringing a federal prosecution rather than 
making its own de novo recommendations on the appropriate reach of federal law. However, we 
respectfully submit that a full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of the 
Justice Department. In an effort to inform you of the nature of the federal investigation against 
Mr. Epstein, we summarize the facts and circumstances of this matter below. 
The two base-level concerns we hold are that (1) federal prosecution of this matter is not 
warranted based on the purely-local conduct and the unprecedented application of federal 
statutes to facts such as these and (2) the actions of federal authorities are both highly 
questionable and give rise to an appearance of substantial impropriety. The issues that we have 
raised, but which have not yet been addressed or resolved by the Department, are more than 
isolated allegations of professional mistakes or misconduct. These issues, instead, affect the 
appearance and administration of criminal justice with profound consequences beyond the 
resolution in the matter at hand. 
In a precedent-shattering investigation of Jeffrey Epstein that raises important policy 
questions—and serious issues as to the fair and honorable enforcement of federal law—the 
USAO in Miami is considering extending federal law beyond the bounds of precedent and 
reason. Federal prosecutors stretched the underlying facts in ways that raise fundamental 
questions of basic professionalism. Perhaps most troubling, the USA() in Miami, as a condition 
of deferring prosecution, required a commingling of substantive federal criminal law with a 
proposed civil remedy engineered in a way that appears intended to profit particular lawyers in 
A001439 
Honorable Mark Filip 
May 19, 2008

private practice in South Florida with personal relationships to some of the prosecutors involved. 
Federal prosecutors then leaked highly sensitive information about the case to a New York 
Times reporter.' The immediate result of this confluence of extraordinary circumstances is an 
onslaught of civil lawsuits, all save one brought by the First Assistant's former boutique law firm 
in Miami. 
The facts in this case all revolve around the classic state crime of solicitation of 
prosiltution.2 The State Attorney's Office in Palm Beach County had conducted a diligent 
investigation, convened a Grand Jury that returned an indictment, and made a final determination 
about how to proceed. That is where, in our federal republic, this matter should rest. 
Mr. Epstein faces a felony conviction in state court by virtue of his conduct, and the only reason 
the State has not resolved this matter is that the federal prosecutors in Miami have continued to 
insist that we, Mr. Epstein's counsel, approach and demand from the State Attorney's Office a 
harsher charge and a more severe punishment than that Office believes are appropriate under the 
circumstances. Yet despite the USAO's refusal to allow the State to resolve this matter on the 
terms the State has determined are appropriate, the USAO has not made any attempt to 
coordinate its efforts with the State. In fact, the USA° mandated that any federal agreement 
would be conditioned on Mr. Epstein persuading the State to seek a criminal punishment unlike 
that imposed on other defendants within the jurisdiction of the State Attorney for similar 
conduct. 
From the inception of the USAO's involvement in this case, which at the end of the day 
is a case about solicitation of prostitution within the confines of Palm Beach County, Florida, we 
have asked ourselves why the Department of Justice is involved. Regrettably, we are unable to 
suggest any appropriate basis for the Department's involvement. Mr. Epstein has no criminal 
history whatsoever. Also, Mr. Epstein has never been the subject of general media interest until 
a few years ago, after it was widely perceived by the public that he was a close friend of former 
President Bill Clinton. 
The conduct at issue is simply not within the purview of federal jurisdiction and lies 
outside the heartland of the three federal statutes that have been identified by prosecutors-18 
U.S.C. §§ 1591, 2422(b), and 2423(b). 
One of the other members of Mr. Epstein's defense team, Jay Lefkowitz, has personally reviewed the reporter's 
contemporaneous notes. 
2 Although some of the women alleged to be involved were 16 and 17 years of age, several of these women 
openly admitted to lying to Mr. Epstein about their age in their recent sworn statements. 
A001440 
Honorable Mark Filip 
May 19, 2008 
Page 4 
These statutes are intended to target crimes of a truly national and international scope. 
Specifically, § 1591 was enacted to combat human trafficking, § 2422 is aimed at sexual 
predation of minors through the Internet, and § 2423 deals with sex tourism. The nature of these 
crimes results in multi-jurisdictional problems that state and local authorities cannot effectively 
confront on their own. However, Mr. Epstein's conduct was purely local in nature and, thus, 
does not implicate federal involvement. After researching every reported case brought under 18 
U.S.C. §§ 1591, 2422(b), and 2423(b), we found that not a single case involves facts or a 
scenario similar to the situation at hand. Our review of each precedent reflects that there have 
been no reported prosecutions under § 1591 of a `john' whose conduct with a minor lacked 
force, coercion, or fraud and who was not profiting from commercial sexual trafficking. There 
have likewise been no cases under § 2422(b)—a crime of communication—where there was no 
use of the Internet, and where the content of phone communications did not contain any inducing 
or enticing of a minor to have illegal sexual activity as expressly required by the language of the 
statute. Furthermore, the Government's contention that routine and habit can fill the factual 
and legal void created by the lack of evidence that such a communication ever occurred sets this 
case apart from every reported case brought under § 2422(b). Lastly, there are no reported cases 
of violations of § 2423(b) of a person whose dominant purpose in traveling was merely to go to 
his own home.3 
Although these matters were within the scope of the CEOS review, rather than 
considering whether federal prosecution is appropriate, CEOS only determined that U.S. 
Attorney Acosta would not be abusing his prosecutorial discretion should he authorize federal 
prosecution in this case. The abuse of discretion standard constitutes an extremely low bar of 
evaluation and while it may be appropriate when the consideration of issues are exclusively 
factual in nature, this standard fails to address concerns particular to this situation, namely the 
novel application of federal statutes. The abuse of discretion standard in such pure legal 
matters of statutory application risks causing a lack of uniformity. The same federal statutes that 
would be stretched beyond their bounds in Miami have been limited to their heartland in each of 
the other federal districts. Also, because this case implicates broader issues of the administration 
of equal justice, federal prosecution in this matter risks the appearance of selectiVity in its 
stretching of federal law to fit these facts. 
3 Federal prosecution of a man who engaged in consensual conduct in his home that amounted to, at most, the 
solicitation of prostitution, is unprecedented. Since prostitution is fundamentally a state concern, (see United 
States v. Evans, 476 F.3d 1176, n.1 (11th Cir. 2007) (federal law does not criminalize all acts of prostitution (a 
vice traditionally governed by state regulation))), and there is no evidence that Palm Beach County authorities 
and Florida prosecutors cannot effectively prosecute and punish the conduct, there is no reason why this matter 
should be extracted from the hands of state prosecutors in Florida. 
A001441 
Honorable Mark Filip 
May 19, 2008 
Page 5 
In fact, recent testimony of several alleged victims contradicts claims made by federal 
prosecutors during the negotiations of a deferred prosecution agreement. The consistent 
representations of key Government witnesses (such as Tatum Miller, Brittany Beale, Saige 
Gonzalez, and Jennifer Laduke) confirm the following critical points: First, there was no 
communication, telephonic or otherwise, that meets the requirements of § 2422(b). For instance, 
Ms. Gonzalez confirmed that Mr. Epstein never emailed, text-messaged, or used any facility of 
interstate commerce whatsoever, before or after her one (and only) visit to his home. Gonzalez 
Tr. (deposition) at 30. Second, the women who testified admitted that they lied to Mr. Epstein 
about their age in order to gain admittance into his home. Indeed, the women who brought their 
underage friends to Mr. Epstein testified that they would counsel their friends to lie about their 
ages as well. Ms. Miller stated the following: I would tell my girlfriends just like Carolyn 
approached me. Make sure you tell him you're 18. Well, these girls that I brought, I know that 
they were 18 or 19 or 20. And the girls that! didn't know and I don't know if they were lying or 
not, I would say make sure that you tell him you're 18. Miller Tr. at 22. Third, there was no 
routine or habit of improper communication expressing an intent to transform a massage into an 
illegal sexual act. In fact, there was often no sexual activity at all during the massage. Ms. 
Miller testified that [s]ometimes [Mr. Epstein] just wanted his feet massaged. Sometimes he 
just wanted a back massage. Miller Tr. at 19. Jennifer Laduke also stated that Mr. Epstein 
never touched [her] physically and that all she did was massage[ ] his back, his chest and his 
thighs and that was it. Laduke Tr. at 12-13. Finally, there was no force, coercion, fraud, 
violence, drugs, or even alcohol present in connection with Mr. Epstein's encounters with these 
women. Ms. Beale stated that [Mr. Epstein] never tried to force me to do anything. Beale Tr. 
A at 12. These accounts are far from the usual testimony in sex slavery, Internet stings and sex 
tourism cases previously brought. The women in actuality were not younger than 16, which is 
the age of consent in most of the 50 states, and the sex activity was irregular and in large part, 
consisted of solo self-pleasuring. 
The recent crop of civil suits brought against Mr. Epstein confirm that the plaintiffs did 
not discuss any sexually-related activities with anyone prior to arriving at Mr. Epstein's 
residence. This reinforces our contention that no telephonic or Internet persuasion, inducement, 
enticement or coercion of a minor, or of any other individual, occurred. In addition, Mr. Jeffrey 
Heiman, the former law partner of one of the federal prosecutors involved in this matter and the 
attorney for most of the civil complainants (as described in detail below), was quoted in the Palm 
Beach Post as saying that it doesn't matter that his clients lied about their ages and told Mr. 
Epstein that they were 18 or 19. 
Not only is a federal prosecution of this matter unwarranted, but the irregularity of 
conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the deferred prosecution agreement are 
beyond any reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor's responsibilities. The list of 
improprieties includes, but is not limited to, the following facts: 
A001442 
Honorable Mark Filip 
May 19, 2008 
Page 6 
• Federal prosecutors made the unprecedented demand that Mr. Epstein pay a 
minimum of $150,000 per person to an unnamed list of women they referred to as 
minors and whom they insisted required representation by a guardian ad litem. Mr. 
Epstein's counsel later established that all but one of these individuals were actually 
adults, not minors. Even then, though demanding payment to the women, the 
USAO eventually asserted that it could not vouch for the veracity of any of the 
claims that these women might make. 
• Federal prosecutors made the highly unusual demand that Mr. Epstein pay the fees 
of a civil attorney chosen by the prosecutors to represent these alleged victims 
should they choose to bring any civil litigation against him. They also proposed 
sending a notice to the alleged victims, stating, in an underlined sentence, that 
should they choose their own attorney, Mr. Epstein would not be required to pay 
their fees. The prosecutors further demanded that Mr. Epstein waive his right to 
challenge any of the allegations made by these victims. 
• The Assistant U.S. Attorney involved in this matter recommended for the civil 
attorney, a highly lucrative position, an individual that we later discovered was 
closely and personally connected to the Assistant U.S. Attorney's own boyfriend. 
• Federal prosecutors represented to Mr. Epstein's counsel that they had identified 
(and later rechecked and re-identified) several alleged victims of federal crimes 
that qualified for payment under 18 U.S.C. § 2255, a civil remedy designed to 
provide financial benefits to victims. Only through state discovery provisions did 
we later learn that many of the women on the rechecked victim list could not 
possibly qualify under § 2255. The reason is that they, themselves, testified that 
they did not suffer any type of harm whatsoever, a prerequisite for the civil recovery 
under § 2255. Moreover, these women stated that they did not, now or in the past, 
consider themselves to be victims. 
• During the last few months, Mr. Herman, First Assistant Sloman's former law 
partner, has filed several civil lawsuits against Mr. Epstein on behalf of the alleged 
victims. It is our understanding that each of Mx. Herman's clients are on the 
A001443 
Honorable Mark Filip 
May 19, 2008 
Page 7 
Government's confidential list of victims. Most of these lawsuits seek $50 
million in money damages.4 
• Assistant U.S. Attorney David Weinstein spoke about the case in great detail to 
Landon Thomas, a reporter with the New York Times, and revealed confidential 
information about the Government's allegations against Mr. Epstein. The Assistant 
U.S. Attorney also revealed the substance of confidential plea negotiations. 
• When counsel for Mr. Epstein complained about the media leaks, First Assistant 
Sloman responded by asserting that Mr. Thomas was given, pursuant to his 
request, non-case specific information concerning specific federal statutes. Based 
on Mr. Thomas' contemporaneous notes, that assertion appears to be false. For 
example, Mr. Weinstein told Mr. Thomas that federal authorities believed that 
Mr. Epstein had lured girls over the telephone and traveled in interstate commerce 
for the purpose of engaging in underage sex. He recounted to Mr. Thomas the 
USAO's theory of prosecution against Mr. Epstein, replete with an analysis of the 
key statutes being considered. Furthermore, after Mr. Epstein's defense team 
complained about the leak to the USAO, Mr. Weinstein, in Mr. Thomas' own 
description, then admonished him for talking to the defense, and getting him in 
trouble. Mr. Weinstein further told him not to believe the spin of Mr. Epstein's 
high-priced attorneys, and then, according to Mr. Thomas, Mr. Weinstein 
forcefully reminded Mr. Thomas that all prior conversations were merely 
hypothetical. 
We are constrained to conclude that the actions of federal officials in this case strike at 
the heart of one of the vitally important, enduring values in this country: the honest enforcement 
of federal law, free of political considerations and free of the taint of personal financial 
motivations on the part of federal prosecutors that, at a minimum, raise the appearance of serious 
impropriety. 
We were told by U.S. Attorney Acosta that as part of the review he requested, the 
Department had the authority, and his consent, to make any determination it deemed appropriate 
regarding this matter, including a decision to decline federal prosecution. Yet, CEOS's only 
conclusion, based on its limited review of the investigation, is that U.S. Attorney Acosta would 
not abuse his discretion by proceeding against Mr. Epstein. Thus, the decision of whether 
4 
As recently as two months ago, Mr. Sloman was still listed publicly as a part of his former law firm. While we 
assume this was an oversight, Mr. Sloman's identification as part of the firm raises the appearance of 
impropriety.

prosecution is fair and appropriate has been placed, once again, in U.S. Attorney Acosta's 
hands. 
In light of the foregoing, we respectfully ask that you review this matter and discontinue 
all federal involvement so that the State can appropriately bring this matter to closure. We 
would greatly appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to discuss these important issues. 
Such a meeting would provide the Department with an opportunity to review the paramount 
issues of federalism and the appearance of selectivity that are generated by the unprecedented

We sincerely appreciate your attention to this matter.

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024576.txt,"economic risk of loss, known as “nonrecourse liabilities,” will be treated as a deemed distribution of cash
to that Partner. A decrease in a Partner's percentage interest in KUE because of KUE’s issuance of
additional limited partner units (“Limited Partner Units} would decrease such Partner's share of Company
nonreccurse liabilities, if any, and thus would resuit in a corresponding deemed distribution of cash.

Treatment of In-Kind Distributions. KUE's distribution of property (other than cash) to a Partner generally
will not be taxable to the Partner unless the property is a “marketable security” and the exceptions to the
requirement for recognition of gain upon distributions of marketable securities do not apply. Marketable
securities, for these purposes, include actively traded securities or equity interests in another entity that
are readily convertible into or exchangeable for cash or other marketable securities. If the distributed
property constitutes a marketable security, the property would be treated as cash and the Partner would
recognize gain, but not loss, to the extent described above.

Basis of Common LP Units. A Limited Partner will have an initial tax basis for its Common LP Units equal
to the amount it paid for the Common LP Units plus its share of Company nonrecourse liabilities, if any.
That basis will be increased by the Limited Partner’s share of Company income and by any increases in
its share of Company nonrecourse liabilities, if any. That basis will be decreased, but not below zero, by
distributions from KUE, by the Limited Partner’s share of KUE losses, by any decrease in its share of
Company nonrecourse liabilities, if any, and by its share of Company expenditures that are not deductible
in computing KUE’s taxable income and are not required to be capitalized.

Limitations on Deductibility of Company Losses. The deduction by a Limited Partner of its share of
Company lasses will be limited to the adjusted tax basis in its Common LP Units. Limited Partners should
be aware that they could be subject to various other limitations on their ability to deduct their allocable
shares of Company losses (or items of deductions). Such limitations include, but are not limited to, those
relating to investment interest expense under Section 163(d) of the Code, miscellaneous itemized
deductions under Section 67 of the Code, certain other itemized deductions of high income individuals
under Section 68 of the Code, the “at risk” rules under Section 485 of the Code, and the deductibility of
capital losses under the Code. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors with respect to the
potential application of such rules to their particular situation.

Allocation of income, Gain, Loss, and Deduction. If KUE has a net profit or net loss, its items of income,
gain, loss, and deduction will be allocated among the Partners in accordance with the provisions of the
Limited Partnership Agreement.

Dispositions of Common LP Units — Recognition of Gain or Loss. A Limited Partner will recognize gain or
loss on a sale of Common LP Units equal to the difference between the amount realized and the Limited

Partner's adjusted tax basis for the Common LP Units sold. A Limited Partner's amount realized will be
measured by the sum of cash or the fair market value of other property received plus its share of
Company nonrecourse liabilities, if any. Generally, gain or loss recognized by a Limited Partner on the
sale or exchange of Common LP Units will be taxable as capital gain or loss and as long-term capital gain
or loss if the Common LP Units were held for more than twelve months.

Non-U.S. Persons

Withholding. Ownership of Common LP Units by non-U.S. Persons raises special U.S. federal income
tax considerations. To the extent that KUE receives dividends from a U.S. subsidiary, distributions of
such dividend income to Limited Partners who are non-US. Persons will be subject to U.S. withholding at
a rate of 30%, Certain countries have tax treaties with the U.S. that reduce or eliminate the withholding
requirement. To fhe extent that KUE receives dividends from a non-U.S. subsidiary, distributions of such
dividend income to Limited Partners who are non-U.S. Persons will not be subject to U.S. tax, unless
such income were deemed to be effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by KUE in the
U.S. KUE will be required to pay withholding tax with respect to the portion of KUE’s income that is
“effectively connected” with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business and which is allocable to non-U.S.
Persons. Any amounts KUE is required to remit to taxing authorities will be treated as a distribution to the
Partner on whose behalf the withholding is being paid and will be charged against current and/or future

Article 6.

Washington Post
10 years after 9/11, al-Qaeda 1s down but

not out
David Ignatius

August 24 -- Government officials refer to it blandly as the “SSE,” or
Sensitive Site Exploitation. That’s their oblique term for the
extraordinary cache of evidence that was carried away from Osama
bin Laden’s compound the night the al-Qaeda leader was killed.

With the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks a few weeks away,
it’s possible to use this evidence to sketch a vivid portrait of al-
Qaeda, drawing on material contained in more than 100 computer
storage devices, including thumb drives, DVDs and CDs, and more
than a dozen computers or hard drives — all collected during the
May 2 raid.

U.S. officials say three strong themes emerge from their reading of
the files, most of which were communications between bin Laden and
his top deputy Atiyah Abd al-Rahman. Indeed, because the Libyan-
born Atiyah (who’s known to analysts by his first name) was the
boss’s key link with the outside, officials see him as more important
than bin Laden’s nominal successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri.

Here are the highlights:

e Bin Laden retained until his death a passion to launch a significant
attack against the United States, ideally linked to the 10th anniversary
of 9/11. He and Atiyah communicated often about who might carry
out such a strike, with Atiyah proposing names and bin Laden
rejecting them. Bin Laden was still looking for a history-changing
attack on big, economically important targets — one that would

immediately called someone I knew in the Obama administration, who phoned the US Embassy in
Geneva and I was allowed back in the hotel with an apology. The photograph of me being
forcibly removed from the hotel was flashed around the world, with the following caption:

“Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, is led away after declaring he planned to
challenge Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad about his views on the Holocaust and
Israel minutes before the meeting between Swiss President Hans-Rudolf Merz and the
Iranian president in Geneva, Switzerland, on April 19, 2009.”

The next day Ahmadinejad was scheduled to give his address to the Durban Conference. We
were not allowed into the Chamber in which he was speaking, but were told to go to a special
room where we could watch and listen to his talk. We assembled in that room and watched as
Ahmadinejad was greeted with applause by many of the delegates. When he began to speak, we
discovered that his words, delivered in Farsi, were not being translated to those of us in the
separate room, but only to those in Assembly Chamber. This was not acceptable and so I
marched to the Assembly Chamber and simply walked in. Several delegations were absent and so
we simply took their seats. But not for long. As soon as Ahmadinejad denied the Holocaust,
which he did near the beginning of his speech, I stood up and shouted “Shame” and walked out,
passing directly in front of his lectern. Many others walked out as well, including several
European delegations. Ahmadinejad’s talk was a fiasco, and was so reported by the media. He
had made a fool of himself, with little help from us.

The following year, the Durban Conference on human rights was once against convened, this time
in New York. Once again, we convened parallel conferences. In my address, I made the
following point:
One important reason why there is no peace in the Middle East can be summarized
tragically in two letters, UN. That building dedicated in theory to peace has facilitated
terrorism, stood idly by genocide, given a platform to holocaust deniers, and
disincentivized the Palestinians from negotiating a reasonable two-state solution.

How dare states such as Saudi Arabia, Cuba, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Iran, Bahrain, Syria,
Belarus and other tyrannies too numerous to mention -- but if you want to see the list, just
go over to the next building -- read the list of nation states and you'll see more than half of
them fit this definition of undemocratic tyrannies. How dare those tyrannies lecture Israel
about human rights? How dare states such as Turkey, that have attacked their own
Kurdish minorities and Armenian minorities, and Russia, which has attacked its own
Chechnyan minority, how dare these warmongering countries lecture Israel about peace?

How dare Norway with its long and sordid history of anti-Semitism and collaboration with
evil, a history which tragically persists to this day, how dare Norway lecture Israel on
equality? How dare South Africa, which continues to practice de facto, though not de
jure apartheid, call Israel, which is far more integrated than South Africa, an apartheid
state?

of the time he would have to serve if he were to be convicted by a jury.

Epstein's spokesman, Howard Rubenstein, said his client would have no

comment. Dershowitz also declined to comment late yesterday.

Palm Beach police records show that on March 15, 2005, a 14-year-old girl

alleged she had visited Epstein's estate, where she partially stripped and

gave him a massage during which he pulled out a purple vibrator and used it

on her in exchange for $300. A further probe uncovered five young women

who said Epstein had masturbated and touched their genitals during

massages, the records state. A woman named Haley Robson - who

described herself as like a Heidi Fleiss - later admitted bringing six girls

between the ages of 14 and 16 to Epstein's house, according to cops.

Despite the allegations, Epstein was only nailed on a single charge of

soliciting a hooker - but it sparked a federal probe. Epstein's lawyers and

friends have insisted he was the hapless victim of a vendetta by Palm Beach

Police Chief Michael Reiter, whom they described as a born-again nutcase.

Palm Beach Post - 08/14/ 2006

Police chief's reputation helps discredit attacks

By Larry Keller

Palm Beach Post - Monday, August 14, 2006

In the case of Palm Beach financier Jeffrey Epstein, it seems, at times, as if two men are
accused of wrongdoing: Epstein and Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter.

Epstein, 53, was indicted last month on a charge of felony solicitation of prostitution
solely because of Reiter's craziness, one of Epstein's lawyers said. His department
disseminated a distorted view of the case and behaved in a childish manner when the
grand jury didn't indict Epstein on the charges it sought, another Epstein lawyer
complained.

To hear the Epstein camp tell it, Reiter, 48, is a loose cannon better suited to be the
sheriff of Mayberry. They whisper that he's embroiled in a messy divorce.

Reiter did in fact file for divorce from his wife, NAME REMOVED), last year, after 24
years of marriage. They have a son, 18, and a daughter, 14. The couple is scheduled to go
to mediation next week, Aug. 16. Nothing in the court file suggests their split is
particularly ugly.

Reiter incurred the wrath of the Epstein camp as well as the state attorney's office for two
reasons. First, he pressed for Epstein to be charged with the more serious crimes of
sexual activity with minors. Second, he slammed State Attorney Barry Krischer in blunt
language seldom used by one law-enforcement official concerning another because of
what he perceived as that office's mishandling of the case.

In a letter to Krischer written May 1, Reiter called his actions in the Epstein case highly
unusual. He added, I must urge you to... consider if good and sufficient reason exists to
require your disqualification from the prosecution of these cases. In short, Reiter told
the county's top prosecutor for the past 13 years that he ought to get off the case. It
looks like a departure from professionalism, Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine

Mr. Satz,
State's Attorney, Broward County, FI

I'm forwarding the below information as it pertains to Mrs. Lesley Simms and more importantly the
ones with whom she continues to coordinate.

As you may know, she was once close with an individual named Matthew Horton with whom she
attended George Mason University, and through Matthew, Ms. Simms became well-acquainted with
Matthew's parents Henry Bud Horton and Sue Popovich Horton who helped secure her a position
at IBM upon her graduation from GMU. Both of these latter individuals (Bud and Sue Horton) were
involved in the 2007 murder of my son, and they in collusion with their son Matthew continue in the
exploitation of children Anjulee and Xian Gunther. The powers that be intend now for these children
to (continue to) follow in the footsteps of Ms. Simms, and to that end, | would advise that you
become acquainted with (1) the ways in which Ms. Simms subsidized her law school education and
off course (2) her current and related endeavors especially as they relate to drug trafficking and
terror financing (see below email to Mr. Martin of the St. Augustine Record).

On Friday, June 23, 2017 8:36 AM, i yt:

Mr. Martin,
St. Augustine Record

Quite an interesting article about the litigation between Deputy Banks and Rusty Rogers (see:
Deputy Banks’ attorney claims FDLE agent’s credibility ‘destroyed’) It must also be explored, of
course, that Officers Rodgers was once well respected for his investigation and exposure of a
terrorist financing network that permeated the sunny state of Florida - (the NY Times reports) Agent
Rodgers joined the state’s elite investigative unit, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, where
he quickly earned agent-of-the-year honors — and a meeting with the governor — for helping
dismantle a terrorist financing network that stretched from Florida to the Middle East - and that
terrorism is very much a well-protected U.S. industry (see below).

God forbid some poor should get away with disrupting the delicate state of secreted operations; as
you yourself report, As written in [Plaintiff Banks'] motion: “Defendant Rodgers’ false, misleading
and inconsistent testimony throughout the discovery process is so pervasive and extreme, and
involves so many material issues, it has destroyed Defendant's credibility on all issues... And here
we see the whole-of-government attempts to restore balance.

*

As for the second Secret Service agent interviewed by the IBM Center for the Business of
Government, his name is Dana Brown. He just so happened to have filled out his career with the
Federal Air Marshall Service (October 2003-August 2008 as Director/Chief of Staff) followed by the
TSA (March 2006-January 2009 as Asst. Administrator-Law Enforcement/Integrity Officer) states his
LinkedIn profile. That he worked his way around to that which was largely put in place by the 1970
9/11 mini-event seems to me rather significant although | don't see all the details yet. | also don't yet
see exactly who it was that birthed this lengthy 9/11 initiative we're suffering. It seems clear,
however, that it was birthed prior to 1970.

Circuit and an adjunct member of our faculty. The first half of the legal ethics class was devoted
to discussing the difficult problem of what a lawyer should do when a client gives him physical
evidence, the possession of which itself might be a crime. Such evidence might include videos of
child pornography, stolen goods and other contraband. We considered a case where a legal aid
lawyer had been told where his client buried the body of a college student he had murdered, but
his murder was not known to her parents or to the police. We also discussed the Joe Paterno case
that was then in the news and that raised questions regarding obligations to report serious
misconduct. The second hour, prosecutor Ocampo made a brief appearance in the classroom, to
discuss ethical problems faced by international prosecutors. The class ended with a discussion
about the scope of confidentiality and what a lawyer should do if his client claims innocence and
would like to testify as to his innocence, but the lawyer firmly believes that he is guilty.

Following that class I sent an hour preparing for my next seminar which is a class of freshman at
Harvard College. The subject is “Where Does Your Morality Come From?”, and we discussed
the moral limits on spying and other forms of subterfuge directed against enemy countries.

Straight from class I went to the Huntington Theater where I had been asked to comment on a
play that was opening there. The play was about the capture of Adolph Eichmann, and I spent
about an hour on the stage speaking and responding to questions from the director and the

audience about the legal issues growing out of the highly publicized capture and trial by Israel.

Thursday was essentially my day of rest. I spent the day writing several short articles and doing
research and writing on several pending projects, including my autobiography. Thursday night
was my only night of the week at home with my wife, and we spent it watching a dumb but
entertaining movie called Crazy Stupid Love.

Friday began with my annual checkup at my doctor’s office followed by lunch with Peter Norton,
director of the Norton Antivirus Software. I met him and his wife Gwen for lunch at the Harvest,
where we discussed, among other things, the use of computer viruses against the Iranian nuclear
threat. After lunch, I received an email from a lawyer representing Saif Ghadafi, who had just
been apprehended by the Lybians. He wanted me to represent Ghadafi in the International
Criminal Court and to negotiate for him to be tried in the Hague rather than in Tripoli. I asked
for more information before making a decision. I spent the rest of the afternoon working on
writing projects, and then went back to the law school at 6:30PM for a Shabbat dinner sponsored
by Chabad and the Jewish Law Students Association. I am faculty advisor to both of those
organizations and I gave a brief talk at the beginning of the dinner. My wife and I then attended a
concert at Sanders Theater.

At 5:30 on Saturday morning, I flew to fly to Washington DC to be a keynote speaker at an event
sponsored by Iranian dissidents. The other speakers included former Secretary of Homeland
Security, Tom Ridge, Former Chairman of the Democratic National Committee Howard Dean,
former Congressman Patrick Kennedy and several other former and current government officials.
I then took the train back to New York, where I was hoping to attend the Metropolitan Opera,
but I was too tired and I went back to my apartment and ended the week by falling asleep at about
10PM. My wife was proud of me for acknowledging my limitations, saying that 5 years earlier, I
never would have been willing to miss anything because of being tired. A friend, who is a

The matter goes beyond Hamas. The Syrian regime is currently
fighting for its life against its majority Sunni population. It has
survived thus far, but it needs to redefine the conflict. The Iranians
and Hezbollah are among those most concerned with the fall of the
Syrian regime. Syria has been Iran's one significant ally, one
strategically positioned to enhance Iranian influence in the Levant. Its
fall would be a strategic setback for Iran at a time when Tehran is
looking to enhance its position with the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq.
Iran, which sees the uprising as engineered by its enemies - the
United States, Saudi Arabia and Turkey - understandably wants al
Assad to survive.

Meanwhile, the fall of Syria would leave Hezbollah - which is highly
dependent on the current Syrian regime and is in large part an
extension of Syrian policy in Lebanon - wholly dependent on Iran.
And Iran without its Syrian ally is very far away from Hezbollah.
Like Tehran, Hezbollah thus also wants al Assad to survive.
Hezbollah joining Hamas in a confrontation with Israel would take
the focus off the al Assad regime and portray his opponents as
undermining resistance to Israel. Joining a war with Israel also would
make it easier for Hezbollah to weather the fall of al Assad should his
opponents prevail. It would help Hezbollah create a moral foundation
for itself independent of Syria. Hezbollah's ability to force a draw
with Israel in 2006 constituted a victory for the radical Islamist group
that increased its credibility dramatically.

The 2006 military confrontation was also a victory for Damascus, as
it showed the Islamic world that Syria was the only nation-state
supporting effective resistance to Israel. It also showed Israel and the
United States that Syria alone could control Hezbollah and that
forcing Syria out of Lebanon was a strategic error on the part of Israel
and the United States.

arguments later will drive logic pretty far. Logic needs words that are like algeraic

symbols in meaning the same thing all along.

Figuratively and literally, foundations are groundwork. They will be less a chore if
you love logic. And you'd better if you’re going to like the later chapters. Let’s get

started.

Orientation

Economics itself, I think, is a quantitative rationale of choices. Psychology is a sister
study not explicitly quantitative, and accounting for subliminal behavior as well as
deliberate choices. The two fields cooperate and overlap. Economics is quantitative
in that it asks how much as well as what, and focuses on numbers. It is science-like
in that it looks for surprising and testable predictions in the end. It is philosophy-
like in that choices are subjective and that the larger factor, human capital, leaves
little market evidence from which to reason upward. Both facts put the burden on

reasoning downward from axioms.

Much of the evidence for both factors, meaning physical and human capital, comes
from the records of literal markets where we rent and hire and buy and sell. Most
economics looked no further until Gary Becker and others expanded the boundaries
about 50 years ago. The expansion made sense. A rationale of choices in literal
markets alone is a silly concept. It is silly to acknowledge only choices that ring cash
registers. We are the same people everywhere. Logic is the same everywhere. We
have little interest in axioms that aren’t the same everywhere. Becker was right to
see choices in marriage and even crime as predictable in terms of supply and

demand and price.

That includes psychic price. Once we follow Becker past literal markets, we accept

psychic value and yield. We must anyhow. Value is in the mind. Economics works as

Federal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations

IL, Authority

Section 6 of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. 156,
provides that ‘“The Board shall have
authority from time to time to make,
amend, and rescind, in the manner
prescribed by the Administrative
Procedure Act [5 U.S.C. 553], such rules
and regulations as may be necessary to
carry out the provisions of this Act.’’ As
discussed in detail below, the Board
interprets Section 6 as authorizing the
rule.

A. The Board’s Section 6 Rulemaking
Authority

Numerous comments dispute the
Board’s statutory authority to enact the
proposed rule. Many note the fact that
the Board’s rulemaking is constrained
by Congressional intent as evidenced in
its enabling statute. For instance, the
American Trucking Association quotes a
Ninth Circuit case explaining that
Section 6 ‘‘does not authorize the Board
to promulgate rules and regulations
which have the effect of enlarging its
authority beyond the scope intended by
Congress,’ 11 and similarly, the Motor &
Equipment Manufacturers Association
asserts, “A regulation cannot stand if it
is contrary to the statute.’’12 The Board
agrees that it may not exercise its
rulemaking authority in a way contrary
to that intended by Congress, but for the
reasons discussed below it also does not
believe that it has done so in this rule.

Several comments assert that because
NLRA Section 6 is written in general,
rather than specific, terms, the Board is
not empowered to enact the proposed
rule. For example, Associated Builders
and Contractors argues that “the lack of
express statutory language under
Section 6 of the NLRA to require the
posting of a notice of any kind ‘is a
strong indicator, if not dispositive, that
the Board lacks the authority to impose
such a requirement * * *.’’?18 And the
Heritage Foundation likewise argues
that the Board’s reliance upon its
general Section 6 rulemaking authority
does not suffice to meet the
Administrative Procedure Act’s
requirement that the NPRM must

11 Gen. Eng’g, Inc. v. NLRB, 341 F.2d 367, 374
(1965).

12 Citing United States v. O’Hagan, 521 U.S. 642,
673 (1997). However, the Supreme Court actually
held there that an agency’s interpretation of its
enabling statute must be given ‘‘controlling weight
unless it is arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly
contrary to the statute.” (quoting Chevron U.S.A.
Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837,
844 (1984)). There, the Court upheld the rule and
found it was not arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly
contrary to the statute.

13 Quoting Member Hayes’ dissent, 75 FR 80415.

“reference the legal authority under
which the rule is proposed.” 14

The Board believes that these
comments are in error because the
courts’ construction of other statutes’
general rulemaking authority, as well as
Section 6 in particular, fully support its
reading of this statutory provision. In
fact, earlier this year, the Supreme Court
issued a decision in Mayo Foundation
for Medical Education and Research v.
United States 1° (discussed more fully
below), unanimously reaffirming the
principle that a general grant of
rulemaking authority fully suffices to
confer legislative (or binding)
rulemaking authority upon an agency.

Even prior to Mayo, a long line of both
non-NLRA and NLRA cases supported
reading Section 6 in the manner
suggested by the Board. Over forty years
ago, in Thorpe v. Housing Authority,'®
the Supreme Court found that the
expansive grant of rulemaking authority
in Section 8 of the Housing Act was
sufficient to grant legislative rulemaking
power to the Department of Housing
and Urban Development. The Court
further noted that “[s]uch broad rule-
making powers have been granted to
numerous other federal administrative
bodies in substantially the same
language.’ 17 A few years later, in
Mourning v. Family Publication
Services,1® the Court reaffirmed its
stance in Thorpe:

Where the empowering provision of a
statute states simply that the agency may
‘make * * * such rules and regulations as
may be necessary to carry out the provisions
of this Act,’ we have held that the validity
of a regulation promulgated thereunder will
be sustained so long as it is ‘reasonably
related to the purposes of the enabling
legislation.’ 19

Following the Supreme Court’s lead,
key circuit decisions then extended the

14 See 5 USC 553(b)(2). For this conclusion, the
Heritage Foundation cites Global Van Lines, Inc., v.
ICC, 714 F.2d 1290, 1297-98 (5th Cir. 1983). But
Global Van Lines did not find that a general
statement of authority can never meet the APA’s
requirements to specify the legal authority for the
rule. Instead, the Fifth Circuit held that that portion
of the APA is violated when an agency chooses to
rely on additional statutory provisions in support
of its rule for the first time on appeal, and those
grounds do not appear elsewhere in the
administrative record. See id. at 1298-99. Here, in
contrast, the grounds for the Board’s rule are clearly
laid out in subsection B, Statutory Authority,
below.

145131 S.Ct. 704, 713-14 (2011).

16 393 U.S. 268 (1969).

17 Id, at 277 n. 28 (citations omitted). The
rulemaking grant there at issue provided that HUD
may, “from time to time * * * make, amend, and
rescind such rules and regulations as may be
necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act,”
id. at 277, quite similar to Section 6 of the NLRA.

18 411 U.S. 356 (1973).

19 Id. at 369 (quoting Thorpe, 393 U.S. at 280-81).

notion that broad grants of rulemaking
authority conveyed legislative
rulemaking power.?° Although the
Board had historically chosen to make
policy by adjudications, the Supreme
Court, consistent with the non-NLRA
case law, used a pair of Board
enforcement cases to unanimously
emphasize the existence of the Board’s
legislative rulemaking authority, NLRB
v. Wyman-Gordon Co.2! and NLEB v.
Bell Aerospace.22

In 1991, after the Board enacted a rule
involving health care units, the
Supreme Court unanimously upheld
that rule in American Hospital
Association v. NLRB.?* The Supreme
Court found that that the general grant
of rulemaking authority contained in
Section 6 of the Act “‘was
unquestionably sufficient to authorize
the rule at issue in this case unless
limited by some other provision in the
Act.” 24 As in AHA, there is no such
limitation here on the Board’s authority
to enact the proposed Rule, as explained
further below. As Senator Tom Harkin
and Representative George Miller 25
emphasized in their comment, the
Supreme Court in AHA examined “the
structure and the policy of the NLRA,”
in order to conclude:

As a matter of statutory drafting, if
Congress had intended to curtail in a
particular area the broad rulemaking
authority granted in § 6, we would have
expected it to do so in language expressly
describing an exception from that section or
at least referring specifically to the section.?°

Thus, the Court could not have been
clearer that unless the Board is
“expressly” limited in some manner,
Section 6 empowers the Board to make
“such rules and regulations as may be
necessary to carry out the provisions of

Dear President Obama:
I am writing today with a somewhat unusual request.

First and foremost, I am asking that you return America to its August 20th, 1959 borders so that Hawaii is no longer a state and you are no longer a citizen.
Sincerely,
Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu

In response to a message left seeking the Trump campaign's comment on this article, on 
Thursday Trump's general counsel Alan Garten emailed threatening legal action against 
BuzzFeed News. Mr. Trump's only connection with Mr. Epstein was that Mr. Epstein was 
one of thousands of people who has visited Mar-a-Lago. That's it. Mr. Trump has NEVER 
been accused of having any involvement or even having any knowledge of any of Mr. 
Epstein's conduct by anyone, Garten wrote. 
As a result, I have no idea what the purpose of your article could possibly be other than to 
try and intentionally and with actual malice defame my client's name and reputation by 
mentioning him in the same article as Mr. Epstein. In other words, suggest guilt by 
association. This is the very definition of irresponsible and reckless journalism and to 
publish such a story would be highly unethical - even by buzzfeed's standards.

Proposal to Work Remotely on a Contract Basis

This is the actual remote-work proposal reader Autumn Brookmire used successfully to move to
Argentina while retaining her job and cutting back to 5—10 hours per week of work.

AUTUMN BROOKMIRE July 2008
Background

After working for the [company name] for more than two years, I have a great loyalty to the people and
mission of this organization. I believe I have added a great deal of value to the organization in my
position as marketing coordinator. With my creative problem solving and my cost effective solutions I
have changed the way we produce and distribute our holiday cards and I’ve developed a contest to bring
in more usable photos for our marketing and publications. I would like to propose continuing to perform
the following tasks for [company name], but on a contract basis, remotely. I plan to live in Argentina for
6-12 months starting in September of 2008. My goals are to develop my fluency in the Spanish language
and immerse myself in another culture and completely foreign environment so that I develop my skills in
adaptation to new ways of thinking.

have been in a very different position. The story would have broken
before Poitras or Greenwald even knew about Snowden’s presence
in Hong Kong, and his identity would be secret except for whatever
foreign mission he had contacted. But, as we know, the Post turned
down his ultimatum.

Time was running out if he was to break the story and leave Hong
Kong before the NSA realized he was missing. At best, he was safe
until June 3, when he was supposed to return from his medical leave.
If he failed to show up in Hawaii on June 3, alarm bells at the NSA
would go off, and it would not take long to find him. Airline records
would show that he had flown to Hong Kong. Snowden told Poi-
tras that NSA security would ask, “This guy isn’t where he says
he’s supposed to be. He’s supposed to be getting medical treatment.
Why the hell is he in Hong Kong?” It would not take long to deter-
mine that he had lied about his medical treatment, and then the hunt
would begin.

He had, remember, already sent Poitras an enciphered file and told
her she would get the key once she followed his instructions. Green-

© wald had still not committed himself to meeting Snowden. Green- ©
wald was, however, willing to publish the documents once Snowden
provided them. That Snowden remained in Hong Kong suggests that
his reason for going to and remaining in Hong Kong went beyond
just delivering documents to journalists, which he could have done
over the Internet. What he could not do in America, without risking
arrest, was to make and release a video.

In any event, after his attempt to pressure the Post, Snowden
asked Greenwald to fly immediately to Hong Kong. Presumably, he
still wanted Greenwald’s story and the video done in Hong Kong
before he became a suspect. If Greenwald and Poitras had immedi-
ately flown to Hong Kong, it still might have left Snowden an escape
window.

But of course things do not always go as planned. Greenwald,
although agreeing to come to Hong Kong, waited in New York
for two days while the Guardian editors completed their due dili-
gence. Poitras waited with him. As a result of this delay, as we know,
Greenwald and Poitras did not arrive at his hotel in Hong Kong until
June 3, only hours before Snowden became suspect at the NSA. “It

the facts as i see them

in June and then again Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout., then after weeks of thinking
about the issue ( which I fully understand ) . the payout was unilaterally changed . 5m woudl be reserved
for the future ? . and out of the remaining 15m ,? 1 would receive only 5. ( note : I'm confident that both
the debt , and the artspace investment will also lead to a write off of another 30 m. plus ) In my dining
room ,you were surprised when I said that i require most people to pay their advisory fee up front so that
I am assured that I will be properly compensated for my work when strategies that I devise are
implemented . you may recall that you appeared offended and said  are you suggesting that 1 would go
back on my word I said no , of course not ! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is that
when amounts get large, people tend to get unhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay ,.

From day zero a 50 - 60 million price was attached as the fair price of the transaction just completed .
though this amount was already substantially less thanour agreed and negotiated formula. - I was
never told that this was out of range. in fact, alternative methods of payment. plane -in-kind etc, were
discussed (ie keeping the 30m portion of fee outstanding till March ) ,I provided as requested a
detailed step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that i was given access to. ( Phaidon
was not forthcoming ) in order to make my many corrections. I was then told that Alans involvement
warranted a discount. Even in the best of light , though it is beyond question that not one-,not -one
time in three years has he ever proposed a unique idea. (including the new tenant in common idea,) and
lets say he made a contribution to the plan andeven that it was 50 %. though no one could posit such a
large amount unless they were wearing a brightly colored clown suit. , the price of doing the deal was
known . It had both sent in writing and spoken about on the phone numerous times , a detailed
execution plan was provided . then and only then after all was laid out for the group I was told that after a
number of conversations with brad karp that only 20m would be paid , (and even that was more than
originally contemplated ) for both transactions . I feel It was remarkably unfair. Did brad even know of
our prior agreement.? I called him and he said he was never told.?, I would ask that you I and Brad karp
sit together if you think it would be helpful. . I would like to send him this email, with your consent of
course. Ifthe transactions were never consummated , 1 would not be owed a dime, however , the price
was known up front. , the detailed step by step plan was followed and overseen by me, the price that had
been requested before the transaction was begun, and had Iready heavily discounted, out of friendship,
from our agreement . I believe the decision re paying only 20 m has frankly left me felling quite uneasy.

her conquest of the President as to engage in an intimate relationship. She really did want oral
sex: she wanted to talk about it. And she did —to more than a dozen people. The President
achieved immediate gratification while risking long term consequences to his marriage, his
daughter, his presidency and above all the nation’s stability.

At the time he began his sexual encounter with Lewinsky, Clinton knew that he might possibly
have to testify under oath about his sex life. He knew that two sets of enemies had the powerful
legal weapon of subpoena power aimed directly at his presidency. That is probably why he was
reluctant to engage in sexual intercourse. He wanted sex with deniability. What he got was
unsatisfying sex with unconvincing deniability. Or, as Maureen Dowd put it:

“Mr. Clinton’s habit, with language and behavior, has been to try to incorporate
his alibi into his sin. The result is more twisted than titillating.”*™

This was surely not the first time Bill Clinton put his future at risk for immediate sexual
gratification. But in every other instance he was able to avoid the long term consequences. I am
certain that he believed that this pattern of short term risk-taking and subsequent avoidance of
long term consequences would be repeated. I doubt he believed, at the moment that he first
allowed Lewinsky to touch him in a sexual manner, that this action would eventually lead to
possible removal from office and damage to his family life. He surely would not have consciously
taken such a knowing risk. But when people have succeeded so often in the past in achieving
both immediate gratification and long term avoidance of consequences, they miscalculate the odds
and act as if they can have their cake and eat it too.

The history of many of my own celebrity clients is largely a history of defendants who for years —
sometimes decades — have risked their careers, family lives, fortunes and freedom for some form
of immediate gratification. Finally when they were caught, everyone asked the same question:
“How could they have risked so much for so little?” What that question fails to understand is that
the “little” thing for which they were eventually caught was usually only the tip of a very large
iceberg of sin or crime which they had gotten away with for years. In their minds therefore, they
were risking very little (the extreme unlikelihood that this time they would get caught) for a great
deal (a lifetime of small, short term gratifications, which add up to something for which it is
worth taking small risks.)

In retrospect, we consider such actions reckless because we are running the video backwards: we
know he was caught. But at the time Clinton made the decision, he probably did not regard it as
any more reckless than the many similar decisions he had previously made, without destroying his
career and his family. He had probably played the same sexual-verbal game before: limiting his
sexual contact so that he could plausibly deny that he engaged in “sexual relationships” outside of
his marriage,*° but he never before had to testify under oath about these relationships. What he
failed to comprehend was how much the risks had increased as the result of the legal proceedings

** See Maureen Dowd, Maladroit Du Siegneur, N.Y.Times, 9/30/98, p.A23. (“He would be laughed out of any
locker room in the country.”)

85 Prior to the Lewinsky matter becoming public, there were widespread reports that the President limited his extra-
marital sex to oral gratification since he believed that it did not constitute Biblical adultery and it gave him verbal
deniability regarding sexual relations. This history actually strengthens his legal claim that he did not commit
perjury when he denied having what he regarded as sexual relations with Lewinsky. A 28 year old waitress was

The Illusion of Peace with Syria

Elliott Abrams



May 23, 2011 -- The news from Syria grows grimmer by the day—more peaceful protesters killed, ten thousand arrested in the past week, army units shelling residential neighborhoods. 

But the Obama administration’s response has not grown grimmer or louder. As recently as May 6, Secretary of State Clinton was still talking about a “reform agenda” in Syria, as if Bashar al-Assad were a slightly misguided bureaucrat rather than the murderer of roughly 1,000 unarmed demonstrators. As for the president, though the White House has issued a couple of statements in his name, he has yet to say one word on camera about the bloodletting in Syria. This is not a small matter, for a tough statement attacking the regime’s repression and giving the demonstrators moral support would immediately circulate over the Internet. American sanctions against Syria, meanwhile, have not named Assad, and there has been no call for him to step down.

Why is the administration appearing to stick with Assad and refusing to call for his ouster? A key reason may be the hope that an Israeli-Syrian peace deal can be arranged. 

From the day it came to office, the Obama administration clearly wanted to win an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. There has been no progress during its two years in office, mostly because the White House insisted on a 100 percent construction freeze in the West Bank settlements and Jerusalem as a precondition for negotiations. This was politically impossible in Israel, and also meant that Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas could not come to the table lest he appear to be asking less from Israel than the Americans.

With negotiations frozen, the Palestinians turned to unilateral measures: seeking a United Nations vote admitting the State of Palestine to membership and getting dozens of countries to recognize a Palestinian state. Meanwhile, their delegitimization campaign against Israel continued apace, especially in Europe, where calls for boycotts and sanctions spread. On the pro-Israel side there was also consideration of unilateral measures—steps to head off the Palestinians diplomatically (several of which I described and supported in the April 11 Weekly Standard).

Some forlorn hope may still have existed inside the administration that a compromise on construction could bring the Palestinians back to the table with the government of Israel—until the agreement between Hamas and Fatah was signed on April 27. This agreement, unless and until it collapses, makes Israeli concessions or new flexibility in the West Bank impossible and puts paid to the entire “peace process.” It brings Hamas into the Palestinian Authority government, ending a period of several years when Palestinian Security Forces have cooperated with the Israel Defense Forces against terrorism and against Hamas in particular. It will also bring Hamas—next year and for the first time—into the PLO, the body charged with negotiating peace with Israel. Even Yasser Arafat resisted that development when he headed the PLO, and it seems obvious that Israel cannot negotiate peace with an anti-Semitic terrorist group bent on its destruction.

So where can the White House turn if it wants some kind of peace process in the Middle East? Syria. After all, in his first term as prime minister, back in 1998, Benjamin Netanyahu did authorize indirect negotiations with Syria. And the IDF—and especially Ehud Barak, a former head of the IDF, Israel’s defense minister, and a close adviser to Netanyahu—has long favored such a deal. The IDF theory was that if Syria made peace, so would Lebanon, and then Israel would be at peace with all four neighboring Arab states. And it can be argued now that Assad may see negotiations with Israel as a way to climb back from the pariah status he is earning, making him at this juncture truly open to a new peace process.

Such thinking, whether in Jerusalem or the White House, is foolish and even grotesque. There is no possibility that Assad would negotiate seriously and that an agreement could be attained. He is now clinging desperately to power, and his only true allies are Iran and Hezbollah. Yet Israel’s (and, one hopes, our own) key precondition to any agreement would necessarily be a clean break in those relationships: an end to the Syrian alliance with Hezbollah and Iran. Otherwise Israel would be giving the Golan, in effect, to Iran—a suicidal act. No Israeli government would do it, which suggests that negotiations with Assad would have no purpose.

Assad may indeed be open to commencing a negotiation as a means to escape international isolation, but that’s all the more reason not to give it to him. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert’s 2008 talks with Syria (via Turkey) allowed Syria to escape the partial isolation the United States had imposed on it in that decade, with zero gain for Israel. This is not an experiment worth repeating, for the Assad regime is today even more despicable than it was three years ago.

To react to the murders now taking place all over Syria by embracing the Assad regime would be morally indefensible. Whether Assad can be overthrown soon by the people of Syria is a fair question to ask. Will the army stay with him, or will Sunni units rebel? Will the Sunni business elites turn against him? How long can the regime survive? We do not yet know the answers. But surely we must avoid any step that could help Assad, rehabilitate his regime, or undermine the courageous struggle of peaceful demonstrators in the streets of Syria. 

The peace agreements that Israel signed with Egypt and Jordan were real achievements, but there will be no such agreements with the Palestinians or with Syria in the foreseeable future. The Palestinians have taken themselves out of the game for now. We cannot turn from them to the Syrians while Assad’s troops are using howitzers and sniper rifles against his people. This is the time not for diplomatic engagement with Assad, but for diplomacy aimed at quarantining his regime and helping bring it down. The White House should dismiss any remaining dreams of a “peace process” with Syria to substitute for the Palestinian version and face facts: There will be no peace with the butcher who rules Syria today.

A democratic Arab world would welcome peace with Israel
Hamid Alkifaey

One could reasonably argue that the golden opportunity for peace in the Middle East was blown away when Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated on Nov. 4, 1995. 
He was the only Israeli leader capable of making peace with the Palestinians, and was about to do so had it not been for the bullets of Yigal Amir, the right-wing religious zealot who believed in the “winner takes all” principle. 
One could also claim that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its global ramifications are responsible for agitating religious extremism in the Muslim world as a whole, and among Palestinians in particular. Prior to 1987, there was hardly any Islamic factor in Palestinian resistance. The Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups were established after the 1987 intifada. From this we deduce that extremism on the Israeli side led to the same on the Palestinian side, and consequently in other Muslim countries, which manifests in popular opposition to traditional and despotic regimes.
The Arab world is currently going through a social and political revolution that has so far claimed two “entrenched” regimes in Tunisia and Egypt. At least three other regimes in the region are fighting for their lives, and are not expected to survive. There will soon be different styles of government in Libya, Yemen and Syria. This much is certain. 
Will there be a different policy toward Israel? Certainly. But this will take time to take shape, since there are more pressing national priorities, such as political and economic reforms. Israel has long branded the Arab world as tribal and undemocratic, in order to brand itself the only democracy in the Middle East. Well, soon enough it won’t be. Many of its neighbors will soon join the democratic world as demands for democracy grow. Democracy will mean more development, prosperity and people’s power. It means more popular participation in decision making and awareness of the possibilities of the nation and what it can and cannot do. It may not mean more hostility toward Israel if the latter knows how to deal with it. But there will be tension if Israel continues to follow extreme policies, which it will under the current leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu. 
The Palestinians must achieve their right to establish their own state on their land. This right has been recognized by almost everyone except a minority of extremists in Israel, led by Netanyahu. Free and democratic Arab countries won’t shrink from supporting this Palestinian right under any circumstances. Muslims will not give up on East Jerusalem, either. Arab regimes have been weak in the past. Democracy will strengthen them, but also add reason to Arab governance. Most Arabs have accepted Israel’s right to exist, and accepted U.N. resolutions 242 and 338, but Israeli intransigence is not helping them formulate a unified position. 
Democratic Egypt won’t be a threat to Israel as the Egyptian military, which will continue to be highly influential in Egypt’s politics in the foreseeable future, will not risk another war with Israel. Egyptians under a democratic regime will be seeking better living standards, better laws to govern the country and more rights as citizens. They won’t be pressing their government to fight Israel; on the contrary, they want a stable economy where things will be better for future generations. But Israel may aggravate the situation by electing extremists and following extreme policies. This will strengthen the hands of the hawks in the Arab world. Moderate Israel under reasonable and realistic leaders should have nothing to fear from Egypt, with which it has an enduring peace treaty. 
The situation with Syria may not be exactly the same, however, especially when the two countries are still officially in a state of war. The regime of Bashar Assad, and his father before him, would have never started a war with Israel unilaterally. It also suited them not to have a peace treaty. Any new Syrian leader is not likely (for a considerable period of time) to initiate a move toward a peace agreement with Israel as this will weaken his position domestically. Nor will he launch a war, however, since such a war will not result in victory. A democratic regime in Syria, or any other Arab country for that matter, will need a good 10 years to build democratic institutions and stabilize a modern market economy needed in any democracy. So, war won’t be on the agenda in the near future.
Prosperity increases the public’s stake in a stable economy, and this will make people want to compromise to make their country more prosperous and stable. However, everything will depend on how prepared the free world is to help new democracies in the Middle East survive and prosper. Small Islamic groups, organized and armed with religious zeal, could hijack power from the moderates. This would lead to a disaster for the whole region. Therefore, it is imperative for the free world, Israel included, not to leave matters to chance. A proactive stance is needed to nurture democracy and help moderate forces organize themselves in order to govern the region

The Awkward Exit of Mideast Envoy George Mitchell

Daniel Stone



May 13, 2011 -- Two days after Barack Obama's inauguration, George Mitchell was named special envoy for Middle East peace. With the new president standing beside Mitchell and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden took the podium and extolled Mitchell's reputation and experience having brokered peace in Northern Ireland, calling him an outstanding public servant with incredible capacity. In the press, Mitchell was praised as the right man for the job at the right time.

On Friday, though, that capacity had reached its limit, and Mitchell told his bosses in the West Wing that he'd had enough. His reasons, he said, were personal—the kind of nebulous rationale that leaves ample room for interpretation. Unmentioned were the months of frustration that Mitchell had built up as direct negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians became more difficult and the peace process further off.

The timing of Mitchell's departure couldn't be more awkward. Obama will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Jordan's King Abdullah next week, as well as deliver a major speech on Middle East policy. But the resignation didn't come as a surprise to those who worked closest with Mitchell. A State Department official described to Newsweek a man increasingly annoyed by both parties' constant moving of the goal posts and the constraints of the administration's unshakeable political instinct to support Israel.

The strain was noticeable in the Middle East. In a recent interview with Newsweek, one senior Israeli official said Mitchell often would say one thing about the direction the U.S. was taking with the two sides, only to be contradicted by Dennis Ross, Clinton's special adviser to the region. The official, who did not want to be quoted by name, said it seemed as if Mitchell had abdicated his role completely in recent months. Indeed, Mitchell's frequent visits to Israel and the West Bank slowed to a trickle; his last visit to the region was in December.

When he was there, officials on both sides of the conflict had voiced bewilderment at Mitchell's hands-off approach to the complex negotiating process. With a small staff in Israel, he would shuttle between Jerusalem and Ramallah to meet with senior advisers to the leaders of both sides and then leave after just a few days. In an interview with Newsweek last month, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas openly accused Mitchell of not doing his job. Every visit by Mitchell, we talked to him and gave him some ideas, he said. At the end we discovered that he didn't convey any of these ideas to the Israelis. What does it mean?

A politically attuned man who was once Senate Majority Leader, Mitchell was aware of the complaints about him. His usual comeback was to point to his success in Northern Ireland, which earned him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. For hundreds of days, he liked to say, he was considered a failure, until the final day, when he actually got it done.

Mitchell's resignation letter set off a small panic inside the West Wing earlier in the week. Senior advisers, as well as Obama himself, could sense the increasing difficulty of the job: Administration officials had been unable to convince Israel to halve new settlements in the West Bank, alienating Palestinians, and Israelis were irked in early May when Abbas allied with Hamas, a group that refuses to denounce violence against Israel. But the symbolism of Mitchell leaving several days before Obama's biggest week of outreach to the region projected a vacuum of confidence that anything hopeful, however remote, was on the horizon.

He wouldn't be leaving at this important hour if he knew there was going to be a significant change in the administration's attitude toward the peace process, said Middle East analyst Gregory Orfalea, who formerly taught at Georgetown's School of Foreign Service. He's leaving because it's status quo.

Mitchell will be replaced—in the interim by his deputy, David Hale—and another official will take a crack at the quandary. But despite new momentum from Netanyahu's visit next week and Obama's speech Thursday, Mitchell's departure could signal stagnant talks for the next several years. According to Fawaz Gerges, director of the London School of Economics' Middle East Center, the reality is that, with Mitchell leaving, Barack Obama basically lost the ideological battle [over how to confront the peace process]. By now he'll have to wait for the second term before you can get another concerted effort.

Amid the Arab Spring, a U.S.-Saudi split

Nawaf Obaid



May 16 - RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA -- A tectonic shift has occurred in the U.S.-Saudi relationship. Despite significant pressure from the Obama administration to remain on the sidelines, Saudi leaders sent troops into Manama in March to defend Bahrain’s monarchy and quell the unrest that has shaken that country since February. For more than 60 years, Saudi Arabia has been bound by an unwritten bargain: oil for security. Riyadh has often protested but ultimately acquiesced to what it saw as misguided U.S. policies. But American missteps in the region since Sept. 11, an ill-conceived response to the Arab protest movements and an unconscionable refusal to hold Israel accountable for its illegal settlement building have brought this arrangement to an end. As the Saudis recalibrate the partnership, Riyadh intends to pursue a much more assertive foreign policy, at times conflicting with American interests. The backdrop for this change are the rise of Iranian meddling in the region and the counterproductive policies that the United States has pursued here since Sept. 11. The most significant blunder may have been the invasion of Iraq, which resulted in enormous loss of life and provided Iran an opening to expand its sphere of influence. For years, Iran’s leadership has aimed to foment discord while furthering its geopolitical ambitions. Tehran has long funded Hamas and Hezbollah; recently, its scope of attempted interference has broadened to include the affairs of Arab states from Yemen to Morocco. This month the chief of staff of Iran’s armed forces, Gen. Hasan Firouzabadi, harshly criticized Riyadh over its intervention in Bahrain, claiming this act would spark massive domestic uprisings.

Such remarks are based more on wishful thinking than fact, but Iran’s efforts to destabilize its neighbors are tireless. As Riyadh fights a cold war with Tehran, Washington has shown itself in recent months to be an unwilling and unreliable partner against this threat. The emerging political reality is a Saudi-led Arab world facing off against the aggression of Iran and its non-state proxies. Saudi Arabia will not allow the political unrest in the region to destabilize the Arab monarchies — the Gulf states, Jordan and Morocco. In Yemen, the Saudis are insisting on an orderly transition of power and a dignified exit for President Ali Abdullah Saleh (a courtesy that was not extended to Hosni Mubarak, despite the former Egyptian president’s many years as a strong U.S. ally). To facilitate this handover, Riyadh is leading a diplomatic effort under the auspices of the six-country Gulf Cooperation Council. In Iraq, the Saudi government will continue to pursue a hard-line stance against the Maliki government, which it regards as little more than an Iranian puppet. In Lebanon, Saudi Arabia will act to check the growth of Hezbollah and to ensure that this Iranian proxy does not dominate the country’s political life. Regarding the widespread upheaval in Syria, the Saudis will work to ensure that any potential transition to a post-Assad era is as peaceful and as free of Iranian meddling as possible.  Regarding Israel, Riyadh is adamant that a just settlement, based on King Abdullah’s proposed peace plan, be implemented. This includes a Palestinian state with its capital in East Jerusalem. The United States has lost all credibility on this issue; after casting the sole vote in the U.N. Security Council against censuring Israel for its illegal settlement building, it can no longer act as an objective mediator. This act was a watershed in U.S.-Saudi relations, guaranteeing that Saudi leaders will not push for further compromise from the Palestinians, despite American pressure.

Saudi Arabia remains strong and stable, lending muscle to its invigorated foreign policy. Spiritually, the kingdom plays a unique role for the world’s 1.2 billion Muslims — more than 1 billion of whom are Sunni — as the birthplace of Islam and home of the two holiest cities. Politically, its leaders enjoy broad domestic support, and a growing nationalism has knitted the historically tribal country more closely together. This is largely why widespread protests, much anticipated by Western media in March, never materialized. As the world’s sole energy superpower and the de facto central banker of the global energy markets, Riyadh is the economic powerhouse of the Middle East, representing 25 percent of the combined gross domestic product of the Arab world. The kingdom has amassed more than $550 billion in foreign reserves and is spending more than $150 billion to improve infrastructure, public education, social services and health care.  To counter the threats posed by Iran and transnational terrorist networks, the Saudi leadership is authorizing more than $100 billion of additional military spending to modernize ground forces, upgrade naval capabilities and more. The kingdom is doubling its number of high-quality combat aircraft and adding 60,000 security personnel to the Interior Ministry forces. Plans are underway to create a “Special Forces Command,” based on the U.S. model, to unify the kingdom’s various special forces if needed for rapid deployment abroad. Saudi Arabia has the will and the means to meet its expanded global responsibilities. In some issues, such as counterterrorism and efforts to fight money laundering, the Saudis will continue to be a strong U.S. partner. In areas in which Saudi national security or strategic interests are at stake, the kingdom will pursue its own agenda. With Iran working tirelessly to dominate the region, the Muslim Brotherhood rising in Egypt and unrest on nearly every border, there is simply too much at stake for the kingdom to rely on a security policy written in Washington, which has backfired more often than not and spread instability. The special relationship may never be the same, but from this transformation a more stable and secure Middle East can be born.

Dr. K’s Rx for China

Niall Ferguson



May 15, 2011  -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton thinks the Chinese government is “scared” of the Arab Spring. “They’re worried,” she told Jeffrey Goldberg in the latest Atlantic, “and they are trying to stop history, which is a fool’s errand. They cannot do it.”

These are words—intemperate, undiplomatic, and very likely counterproductive—that you cannot imagine being uttered by her predecessor Henry Kissinger. It is now 40 years since Kissinger went on his secret mission to China, to pave the way for President Richard Nixon’s historic visit the following year. Since then he has visited the country more than 50 times. And if there is one thing he has learned, it is this: the real fool’s errand is to lean on the Chinese. Much has changed in the world since Kissinger’s first trip to China. (In 1971, who would have dared to predict that America’s public enemy No. 1 would be a Saudi-born Islamic fundamentalist skulking in a walled compound in Pakistan?) But at least two things in American foreign policy remain consistent: the relationship with mainland China, revived by Kissinger after more than 20 years in the deep freeze, and Kissinger himself, consulted formally or informally by every president from John F. Kennedy to Barack Obama. On China, Kissinger’s new book, is a reminder of why our leaders still want to pick his brains. Eighty-eight years old this month, he remains without equal as a strategic thinker.  The opening to China is a story Kissinger has told before: how he and Nixon had discerned that country could become a strategic counterweight to the Soviet Union; how he secretly flew to China after feigning illness in Pakistan; how he and Premier Zhou Enlai hammered out the diplomatic basis for Nixon’s official visit (the Shanghai Communiqué). The result was, as he puts it, “a quasi alliance,” which, though initially intended to contain the Soviet Union, ended up outliving the Cold War.

In this telling, however, Kissinger is able to take advantage of recent research that illuminates the Chinese side of the story. The American opening to China was also a Chinese opening to America, actuated above all by Mao Zedong’s fear of encirclement. “Think about this,” Mao told his doctor in 1969. “We have the Soviet Union to the north and the west, India to the south, and Japan to the east. If all our enemies were to unite, attacking us from the north, south, east, and west, what do you think we should do?” The medic had no idea. “Think again,” said Mao. “Beyond Japan is the United States. Didn’t our ancestors counsel negotiating with faraway countries while fighting with those that are near?” It was to explore the American option that Mao recalled four Army marshals from exile. Skirmishes were already underway between Soviet and Chinese forces on the Ussuri River. In October 1970 Mao ordered China’s top leadership to evacuate Beijing and put the People’s Liberation Army on “first-degree combat readiness.” The stakes for China were high indeed—higher than for the United States.  As Kissinger shows, it was far from unusual for Mao to refer to “our ancestors’ counsel.” Despite his lifelong commitment to Marxism-Leninism, Mao was also steeped in the classics of Chinese civilization, as were his close advisers. “We can consult the example of Zhuge Liang’s strategic guiding principle,” Marshal Ye Jian-ying suggested, “when the three states of Wei, Shu, and Wu confronted each other: ‘Ally with Wu in the east to oppose Wei in the north.’ ” The allusion, Kissinger explains, is to Romance of the Three Kingdoms, a 14th-century epic novel set in the so-called Warring States period (475–221 B.C.).

Nor was this the only occasion when China’s communist leaders looked to the distant past for inspiration. Of equal importance to them, Kissinger argues, was The Art of War by Sun Tzu, which dates from the even earlier Spring and Autumn period (770–476 B.C.). “The victorious army/Is victorious first/And seeks battle later”: axioms like this one encouraged Chinese strategists to think of international relations like the board game Weiqi (known in the West as Go), a “game of surrounding pieces.”   Mao shared with China’s prerevolutionary leaders an assumption that China is not like other countries. With a population that amounts to a fifth of humanity, it is Zhongguo: the Middle Kingdom or, perhaps more accurately, the “Central Country.” At times it could even seem like tian xia: “all under heaven.” The best foreign policy for such an empire was to “let barbarians fight barbarians.” If that failed, then the strongest of the barbarians should be embraced and civilized (as happened to the Manchus).   “Domineering and overwhelming … ruthless and aloof, poet and warrior, prophet and scourge”—Mao’s true hero was not Lenin but the tyrannical, book-burning “first emperor,” Qin Shi Huang, who united China in 221 B.C. In a similar way, Kissinger shows, the current generation of Chinese leaders have drawn inspiration from the teachings of Kong Fu Zi (known in the West as Confucius). Their goal, he argues, is not world domination but da tong: “great harmony.”   This goes to the heart of the matter. In 1971, when Kissinger first went to China, the U.S. economy was roughly five times that of the People’s Republic. Forty years later, as a result of the industrial revolution unleashed by Mao’s successor Deng Xiao-ping, it is conceivable that China could overtake America within a decade. This is a feat the Soviet Union never came close to achieving. Moreover, China is now the biggest foreign holder of U.S. Treasury notes, which form an important part of its vast $3 trillion of international reserves. How China will use its newfound economic power may be the most important question of our time. Few Americans are better placed to answer that question than Kissinger, who has dealt with four generations of Chinese leaders.

The most profound insights of On China are psychological. They concern the fundamental cultural differences between a Chinese elite who can look back more than two millennia for inspiration and an American elite whose historical frame of reference is little more than two centuries old. This became most obvious in the wake of June 1989, when Americans recoiled from the use of military force to end the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy demonstrations. To Kissinger’s eyes, it was doubly naive to retaliate to this crackdown with sanctions: “Western concepts of human rights and individual liberties may not be directly translatable … to a civilization for millennia ordered around different concepts. Nor can the traditional Chinese fear of political chaos be dismissed as an anachronistic irrelevancy needing only ‘correction’ by Western enlightenment.”

As China’s first Anglophone leader, Jiang Zemin, explained to Kissinger in 1991: “We never submit to pressure … It is a philosophical principle.”   The United States and China went to war in Korea because of another cultural gap. It came as a surprise to the Americans when Mao ordered Chinese intervention because the military odds looked so unfavorable. But, argues Kissinger, his “motivating force was less to inflict a decisive military first blow than to change the psychological balance, not so much to defeat the enemy as to alter his calculus of risks.” Mao was a master of the ancient Empty City Stratagem, which seeks to conceal weakness with a show of confidence, even aggression. To Westerners, his insistence that he did not fear a nuclear attack seemed unhinged or, at best, callous (“We may lose more than 300 million people. So what? War is war. The years will pass, and we’ll get to work producing more babies than ever before”). But this was classical Chinese bravado, or “offensive deterrence.”    “Chinese negotiators,” observes Kissinger in a passage that should be inwardly digested not just by American diplomats but also by American businessmen before they land in Beijing, “use diplomacy to weave together political, military, and psychological elements into an overall strategic design.” American diplomacy, by contrast, “generally prefers …c to be ‘flexible’; it feels an obligation to break deadlocks with new proposals—unintentionally inviting new deadlocks to elicit new proposals.” We could learn a thing or two from the Chinese, Kissinger implies, particularly Sun Tzu’s concept of shi, meaning the “potential energy” of the overall strategic landscape. Our tendency is to have an agenda of 10 different points, each one to be dealt with separately. They have one big game plan. We are always in a hurry for closure, anxiously watching the minutes tick away. The Chinese value patience; as Mao explained to Kissinger, they measure time in millennia.

Such fundamental cultural differences may give rise to conflict with China in the future, Kissinger warns: “When the Chinese view of preemption encounters the Western concept of deterrence, a vicious circle can result: acts conceived as defensive in China may be treated as aggressive by the outside world; deterrent moves by the West may be interpreted in China as encirclement. The United States and China wrestled with this dilemma repeatedly during the Cold War; to some extent they have not yet found a way to transcend it.”

Could the United States and the People’s Republic come to blows again? The possibility cannot be excluded. As Kissinger reminds us, war was the result when Germany rose to challenge Britain economically and geopolitically 100 years ago. Moreover, the key factor that brought America and China together in the 1970s—the common Soviet enemy the Chinese called “the polar bear”—has vanished from the scene. Old, intractable differences persist over Taiwan and North Korea. What remains is “Chimerica,” a less-than-happy marriage of economic convenience in which one partner does all the saving and the other does all the spending.

In Kissinger’s own words, China’s rise could “make international relations bipolar again,” ushering in a new cold (or possibly even hot) war. Nationalist writers like Liu Mingfu, author of China Dream, urge China to switch from “peaceful development” to “military rise” and look forward to the “duel of the century” with the United States. There are those in Washington, too—apparently including, for the moment, the Obama administration—who would relish a more confrontational relationship.   Yet Kissinger remains hopeful that cooler heads will prevail in Beijing: thinkers like Zheng Bijian, who urges China to “transcend the traditional ways for great powers to emerge” and “not [to] follow the path of Germany leading up to World War I.” Rather than attempting to “organize Asia on the basis of containing China or creating a bloc of democratic states for an ideological crusade,” the United States would do better, Kissinger suggests, to work with China to build a new “Pacific Community.”

Four decades ago, Richard Nixon grasped sooner than most the huge potential of China. “Well,” he mused, “you can just stop and think of what could happen if anybody with a decent system of government got control of that mainland. Good God … There’d be no power in the world that could even—I mean, you put 800 million Chinese to work under a decent system … and they will be the leaders of the world.” That prophecy is being fulfilled in our time. The fact that until now China’s rise has been a boon to the United States rather than a bane owes much to the work of Henry Kissinger. With this book he has given his successors an indispensable guide to continuing the Sino-American “coevolution” he began.

Syria as Turkey’s domestic issue

Yusuf Kanli

May 15, 2011 -- Syria is no Libya for many reasons; not just because it is a country right on the Turkish border or, like Turkey, it has a Kurdish population and an explosion there may ignite an explosion on this side of the border as well.

Like a broken watch that shows correct time twice a day, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as well occasionally makes some correct analysis. Last week, while comparing the uprising in Libya against the Moammar Gadhafi regime and the growing unrest in the Syrian street against the Baathist regime of Bashar al-Assad, the prime minister correctly said Libya and Syria were two totally different issues for Turkey.

Erdoğan explained while Turkey was very much concerned with what’s happening in Libya and have been undertaking every possible effort to contribute to a quick end to the tumult and restoration of peace and order in Libya, Syria was very much like a domestic incident for Turkey.

As part of its neo-Ottoman drive to enhance its influence in the Middle Eastern territory of the former Ottoman Empire the ruling Justice and development Party, or AKP, government of Turkey has long waived visa requirement in travel between Turkey and Syria. The aim behind that move was to plant the seeds of a future European Union-like Middle Eastern union led by Turkey but the first tangible result was not a marked increase in commercial, business or tourist interactions, but a batch of 250 refugees running from the fire on the Syrian street.

If the problem continues and escalates further in the Syrian street it is probable that the prefabricated facility in the Hatay province constructed to provide temporary lodging to pilgrims during the Hajj season will not suffice in providing a shelter to Syrian refugees who thanks to the no-visa regime in travel between Turkey and Syria may freely escape to Turkey from the trouble in their own street and thus carry the problem to the Turkish street.

For now the separatist Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, terrorists are abiding with an unilateral truce, which is claimed to have been negotiated with the government by Abdullah Öcalan, the chieftain of the gang serving an enforced life term on the İmralı island prison, which according to claims will last until June 15, three days after the June 12 parliamentary elections. Indeed, excluding some rehearsal for a possible mass civilian disobedience campaign after the elections and some exceptional terrorist acts, it might be said that there is nothing extraordinary in Turkey’s southeast bordering Syria, Iraq and Iran, where there are sizeable Kurdish populations.

The “success” of the unrest in Syrian streets in uprooting the government might mean added trouble for Turkey, which has been battling with separatist terrorism for the past 25 years. Turkey remaining silent or supportive of the Assad regime crushing the pressure for a regime change and reform calls of the Syrian street, on the other hand, would seriously imperil the regional role aspired by the AKP governance of Turkey.

Indeed, while the AKP government in Ankara joined the calls of the U.S.-led coalition of the willing that time is up for Moammar Gadhafi in Libya and for peace and safety of his own people Gadhafi must step down, as regards to Syria Ankara, as well as the Western alliance, has been restraining their calls with a shy request from Assad to accelerate reforms.

While Ankara may answer anti-Turkish demonstrations in Libya by closing down the Turkish embassy in Tripoli, the first ever such action by the diplomatic service throughout its modern history, anti-Turkish demonstrations in Damascus can be really costly for Turkey now and in the future.

While the personal friendly relations between Assad and his counterpart in Turkey, Erdoğan, might provide Turkey a golden opportunity to help Syria sail out of the current tumultuous situation. Of course at a time when Erdoğan himself is after converting Turkey into his sultanate of fear under the aegis of advanced democracy it might be absurd to expect him to advise Assad of a democratic way out of the mess in Syria. Yet, as much as Turkey needs to see restoration of peace, security and stability in Syria for domestic security reasons as well as for its regional role, Syria and President Assad need Turkey and Erdoğan to walk the extra mile in reforms advised by them, as the real-politic of the day compels him to do so if he wants to sail out of this problem in one piece.

If, however, despite Turkey’s democracy and reform preaches, the massacres continue in the Syrian street not only the prestige of Erdoğan in the Arab street will be seriously impaired but sooner or later the fire in the Arab street will have a reflection on the Turkish streets.

STRATFOR

The Geopolitics of Israel: Biblical and Modern 



The founding principle of geopolitics is that place — geography — plays a significant role in determining how nations will behave. If that theory is true, then there ought to be a deep continuity in a nation's foreign policy. Israel is a laboratory for this theory, since it has existed in three different manifestations in roughly the same place, twice in antiquity and once in modernity. If geopolitics is correct, then Israeli foreign policy, independent of policymakers, technology or the identity of neighbors, ought to have important common features. This is, therefore, a discussion of common principles in Israeli foreign policy over nearly 3,000 years. 
For convenience, we will use the term Israel to connote all of the Hebrew and Jewish entities that have existed in the Levant since the invasion of the region as chronicled in the Book of Joshua. As always, geopolitics requires a consideration of three dimensions: the internal geopolitics of Israel, the interaction of Israel and the immediate neighbors who share borders with it, and Israel's interaction with what we will call great powers, beyond Israel's borderlands. 
Israel has manifested itself three times in history. The first manifestation began with the invasion led by Joshua and lasted through its division into two kingdoms, the Babylonian conquest of the Kingdom of Judah and the deportation to Babylon early in the sixth century B.C. The second manifestation began when Israel was recreated in 540 B.C. by the Persians, who had defeated the Babylonians. The nature of this second manifestation changed in the fourth century B.C., when Greece overran the Persian Empire and Israel, and again in the first century B.C., when the Romans conquered the region. 
The second manifestation saw Israel as a small actor within the framework of larger imperial powers, a situation that lasted until the destruction of the Jewish vassal state by the Romans. 
Israel's third manifestation began in 1948, following (as in the other cases) an ingathering of t least some of the Jews who had been dispersed after conquests. Israel's founding takes place in the context of the decline and fall of the British Empire and must, at least in part, be understood as part of British imperial history. 
During its first 50 years, Israel plays a pivotal role in the confrontation of the United States and the Soviet Union and, in some senses, is hostage to the dynamics of these two countries. In other words, like the first two manifestations of Israel, the third finds Israel continually struggling among independence, internal tension and imperial ambition.
Israeli Geography and Borderlands 
At its height, under King David, Israel extended from the Sinai to the Euphrates, encompassing Damascus. It occupied some, but relatively little, of the coastal region, an area beginning at what today is Haifa and running south to Jaffa, just north of today's Tel Aviv. The coastal area to the north was held by Phoenicia, the area to the south by Philistines. It is essential to understand that Israel's size and shape shifted over time. For example, Judah under the Hasmoneans did not include the Negev but did include the Golan. The general locale of Israel is fixed. Its precise borders have never been.
Thus, it is perhaps better to begin with what never was part of Israel. Israel never included the Sinai Peninsula. Along the coast, it never stretched much farther north than the Litani River in today's Lebanon. Apart from David's extreme extension (and fairly tenuous control) to the north, Israel's territory never stretched as far as Damascus, although it frequently held the Golan Heights. Israel extended many times to both sides of the Jordan but never deep into the Jordanian Desert. It never extended southeast into the Arabian Peninsula. 
Israel consists generally of three parts. First, it always has had the northern hill region, stretching from the foothills of Mount Hermon south to Jerusalem. Second, it always contains some of the coastal plain from today's Tel Aviv north to Haifa. Third, it occupies area between Jerusalem and the Jordan River — today's West Bank. At times, it controls all or part of the Negev, including the coastal region between the Sinai to the Tel Aviv area. It may be larger than this at various times in history, and sometimes smaller, but it normally holds all or part of these three regions. 
Israel is well-buffered in three directions. The Sinai Desert protects it against the Egyptians. In general, the Sinai has held little attraction for the Egyptians. The difficulty of deploying forces in the eastern Sinai poses severe logistical problems for them, particularly during a prolonged presence. Unless Egypt can rapidly move through the Sinai north into the coastal plain, where it can sustain its forces more readily, deploying in the Sinai is difficult and unrewarding. Therefore, so long as Israel is not so weak as to make an attack on the coastal plain a viable option, or unless Egypt is motivated by an outside imperial power, Israel does not face a threat from the southwest. 
Israel is similarly protected from the southeast. The deserts southeast of Eilat-Aqaba are virtually impassable. No large force could approach from that direction, although smaller raiding parties could. The tribes of the Arabian Peninsula lack the reach or the size to pose a threat to Israel, unless massed and aligned with other forces. Even then, the approach from the southeast is not one that they are likely to take. The Negev is secure from that direction. 
The eastern approaches are similarly secured by desert, which begins about 20 to 30 miles east of the Jordan River. While indigenous forces exist in the borderland east of the Jordan, they lack the numbers to be able to penetrate decisively west of the Jordan. Indeed, the normal model is that, so long as Israel controls Judea and Samaria (the modern-day West Bank), then the East Bank of the Jordan River is under the political and sometimes military domination of Israel — sometimes directly through settlement, sometimes indirectly through political influence, or economic or security leverage. 
Israel's vulnerability is in the north. There is no natural buffer between Phoenicia and its successor entities (today's Lebanon) to the direct north. The best defense line for Israel in the north is the Litani River, but this is not an insurmountable boundary under any circumstance. However, the area along the coast north of Israel does not present a serious threat. The coastal area prospers through trade in the Mediterranean basin. It is oriented toward the sea and to the trade routes to the east, not to the south. If it does anything, this area protects those trade routes and has no appetite for a conflict that might disrupt trade. It stays out of Israel's way, for the most part. 
Moreover, as a commercial area, this region is generally wealthy, a factor that increases predators around it and social conflict within. It is an area prone to instability. Israel frequently tries to extend its influence northward for commercial reasons, as one of the predators, and this can entangle Israel in its regional politics. But barring this self-induced problem, the threat to Israel from the north is minimal, despite the absence of natural boundaries and the large population. On occasion, there is spillover of conflicts from the north, but not to a degree that might threaten regime survival in Israel. 
The neighbor that is always a threat lies to the northeast. Syria — or, more precisely, the area governed by Damascus at any time — is populous and frequently has no direct outlet to the sea. It is, therefore, generally poor. The area to its north, Asia Minor, is heavily mountainous. Syria cannot project power to the north except with great difficulty, but powers in Asia Minor can move south. Syria's eastern flank is buffered by a desert that stretches to the Euphrates. Therefore, when there is no threat from the north, Syria's interest — after securing itself internally — is to gain access to the coast. Its primary channel is directly westward, toward the rich cities of the northern Levantine coast, with which it trades heavily. An alternative interest is southwestward, toward the southern Levantine coast controlled by Israel. 
As can be seen, Syria can be interested in Israel only selectively. When it is interested, it has a serious battle problem. To attack Israel, it would have to strike between Mount Hermon and the Sea of Galilee, an area about 25 miles wide. The Syrians potentially can attack south of the sea, but only if they are prepared to fight through this region and then attack on extended supply lines. If an attack is mounted along the main route, Syrian forces must descend the Golan Heights and then fight through the hilly Galilee before reaching the coastal plain — sometimes with guerrillas holding out in the Galilean hills. The Galilee is an area that is relatively easy to defend and difficult to attack. Therefore, it is only once Syria takes the Galilee, and can control its lines of supply against guerrilla attack, that its real battle begins. 
To reach the coast or move toward Jerusalem, Syria must fight through a plain in front of a line of low hills. This is the decisive battleground where massed Israeli forces, close to lines of supply, can defend against dispersed Syrian forces on extended lines of supply. It is no accident that Megiddo — or Armageddon, as the plain is sometimes referred to — has apocalyptic meaning. This is the point at which any move from Syria would be decided. But a Syrian offensive would have a tough fight to reach Megiddo, and a tougher one as it deploys on the plain. 
On the surface, Israel lacks strategic depth, but this is true only on the surface. It faces limited threats from southern neighbors. To its east, it faces only a narrow strip of populated area east of the Jordan. To the north, there is a maritime commercial entity. Syria operating alone, forced through the narrow gap of the Mount Hermon-Galilee line and operating on extended supply lines, can be dealt with readily. 
There is a risk of simultaneous attacks from multiple directions. Depending on the forces deployed and the degree of coordination between them, this can pose a problem for Israel. However, even here the Israelis have the tremendous advantage of fighting on interior lines. Egypt and Syria, fighting on external lines (and widely separated fronts), would have enormous difficulty transferring forces from one front to another. Israel, on interior lines (fronts close to each other with good transportation), would be able to move its forces from front to front rapidly, allowing for sequential engagement and thereby the defeat of enemies. Unless enemies are carefully coordinated and initiate war simultaneously — and deploy substantially superior force on at least one front — Israel can initiate war at a time of its choosing or else move its forces rapidly between fronts, negating much of the advantage of size that the attackers might have. 
There is another aspect to the problem of multifront war. Egypt usually has minimal interests along the Levant, having its own coast and an orientation to the south toward the headwaters of the Nile. On the rare occasions when Egypt does move through the Sinai and attacks to the north and northeast, it is in an expansionary mode. By the time it consolidates and exploits the coastal plain, it would be powerful enough to threaten Syria. From Syria's point of view, the only thing more dangerous than Israel is an Egypt in control of Israel. Therefore, the probability of a coordinated north-south strike at Israel is rare, is rarely coordinated and usually is not designed to be a mortal blow. It is defeated by Israel's strategic advantage of interior lines. 
Israeli Geography and the Convergence Zone
Therefore, it is not surprising that Israel's first incarnation lasted as long as it did — some five centuries. What is interesting and what must be considered is why Israel (now considered as the northern kingdom) was defeated by the Assyrians and Judea, then defeated by Babylon. To understand this, we need to consider the broader geography of Israel's location. 
Israel is located on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, on the Levant. As we have seen, when Israel is intact, it will tend to be the dominant power in the Levant. Therefore, Israeli resources must generally be dedicated for land warfare, leaving little over for naval warfare. In general, although Israel had excellent harbors and access to wood for shipbuilding, it never was a major Mediterranean naval power. It never projected power into the sea. The area to the north of Israel has always been a maritime power, but Israel, the area south of Mount Hermon, was always forced to be a land power. 
The Levant in general and Israel in particular has always been a magnet for great powers. No Mediterranean empire could be fully secure unless it controlled the Levant. Whether it was Rome or Carthage, a Mediterranean empire that wanted to control both the northern and southern littorals needed to anchor its eastern flank on the Levant. For one thing, without the Levant, a Mediterranean power would be entirely dependent on sea lanes for controlling the other shore. Moving troops solely by sea creates transport limitations and logistical problems. It also leaves imperial lines vulnerable to interdiction — sometimes merely from pirates, a problem that plagued Rome's sea transport. A land bridge, or a land bridge with minimal water crossings that can be easily defended, is a vital supplement to the sea for the movement of large numbers of troops. Once the Hellespont is crossed, the coastal route through southern Turkey, down the Levant and along the Mediterranean's southern shore, provides such an alternative. 
There is an additional consideration. If a Mediterranean empire leaves the Levant unoccupied, it opens the door to the possibility of a great power originating to the east seizing the ports of the Levant and challenging the Mediterranean power for maritime domination. In short, control of the Levant binds a Mediterranean empire together while denying a challenger from the east the opportunity to enter the Mediterranean. Holding the Levant, and controlling Israel, is a necessary preventive measure for a Mediterranean empire. 
Israel is also important to any empire originating to the east of Israel, either in the Tigris-Euphrates basin or in Persia. For either, security could be assured only once it had an anchor on the Levant. Macedonian expansion under Alexander demonstrated that a power controlling Levantine and Turkish ports could support aggressive operations far to the east, to the Hindu Kush and beyond. While Turkish ports might have sufficed for offensive operations, simply securing the Bosporus still left the southern flank exposed. Therefore, by holding the Levant, an eastern power protected itself against attacks from Mediterranean powers. 
The Levant was also important to any empire originating to the north or south of Israel. If Egypt decided to move beyond the Nile Basin and North Africa eastward, it would move first through the Sinai and then northward along the coastal plain, securing sea lanes to Egypt. When Asia Minor powers such as the Ottoman Empire developed, there was a natural tendency to move southward to control the eastern Mediterranean. The Levant is the crossroads of continents, and Israel lies in the path of many imperial ambitions. 
Israel therefore occupies what might be called the convergence zone of the Eastern Hemisphere. A European power trying to dominate the Mediterranean or expand eastward, an eastern power trying to dominate the space between the Hindu Kush and the Mediterranean, a North African power moving toward the east, or a northern power moving south — all must converge on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean and therefore on Israel. Of these, the European power and the eastern power must be the most concerned with Israel. For either, there is no choice but to secure it as an anchor.
Internal Geopolitics 
Israel is geographically divided into three regions, which traditionally have produced three different types of people. Its coastal plain facilitates commerce, serving as the interface between eastern trade routes and the sea. It is the home of merchants and manufacturers, cosmopolitans — not as cosmopolitan as Phoenicia or Lebanon, but cosmopolitan for Israel. The northeast is hill country, closest to the unruliness north of the Litani River and to the Syrian threat. It breeds farmers and warriors. The area south of Jerusalem is hard desert country, more conducive to herdsman and warriors than anything else. Jerusalem is where these three regions are balanced and governed. 
There are obviously deep differences built into Israel's geography and inhabitants, particularly between the herdsmen of the southern deserts and the northern hill dwellers. The coastal dwellers, rich but less warlike than the others, hold the balance or are the prize to be pursued. In the division of the original kingdom between Israel and Judea, we saw the alliance of the coast with the Galilee, while Jerusalem was held by the desert dwellers. The consequence of the division was that Israel in the north ultimately was conquered by Assyrians from the northeast, while Babylon was able to swallow Judea. 
Social divisions in Israel obviously do not have to follow geographical lines. However, over time, these divisions must manifest themselves. For example, the coastal plain is inherently more cosmopolitan than the rest of the country. The interests of its inhabitants lie more with trading partners in the Mediterranean and the rest of the world than with their countrymen. Their standard of living is higher, and their commitment to traditions is lower. Therefore, there is an inherent tension between their immediate interests and those of the Galileans, who live more precarious, warlike lives. Countries can be divided over lesser issues — and when Israel is divided, it is vulnerable even to regional threats. 
We say even because geography dictates that regional threats are less menacing than might be expected. The fact that Israel would be outnumbered demographically should all its neighbors turn on it is less important than the fact that it has adequate buffers in most directions, that the ability of neighbors to coordinate an attack is minimal and that their appetite for such an attack is even less. The single threat that Israel faces from the northeast can readily be managed if the Israelis create a united front there. When Israel was overrun by a Damascus-based power, it was deeply divided internally. 
It is important to add one consideration to our discussion of buffers, which is diplomacy. The main neighbors of Israel are Egyptians, Syrians and those who live on the east bank of Jordan. This last group is a negligible force demographically, and the interests of the Syrians and Egyptians are widely divergent. Egypt's interests are to the south and west of its territory; the Sinai holds no attraction. Syria is always threatened from multiple directions, and alliance with Egypt adds little to its security. Therefore, under the worst of circumstances, Egypt and Syria have difficulty supporting each other. Under the best of circumstances, from Israel's point of view, it can reach a political accommodation with Egypt, securing its southwestern frontier politically as well as by geography, thus freeing Israel to concentrate on the northern threats and opportunities.
Israel and the Great Powers 
The threat to Israel rarely comes from the region, except when the Israelis are divided internally. The conquests of Israel occur when powers not adjacent to it begin forming empires. Babylon, Persia, Macedonia, Rome, Turkey and Britain all controlled Israel politically, sometimes for worse and sometimes for better. Each dominated it militarily, but none was a neighbor of Israel. This is a consistent pattern. Israel can resist its neighbors; danger arises when more distant powers begin playing imperial games. Empires can bring force to bear that Israel cannot resist. 
Israel therefore has this problem: It would be secure if it could confine itself to protecting its interests from neighbors, but it cannot confine itself because its geographic location invariably draws larger, more distant powers toward Israel. Therefore, while Israel's military can focus only on immediate interests, its diplomatic interests must look much further. Israel is constantly entangled with global interests (as the globe is defined at any point), seeking to deflect and align with broader global powers. When it fails in this diplomacy, the consequences can be catastrophic. 
Israel exists in three conditions. First, it can be a completely independent state. This condition occurs when there are no major imperial powers external to the region. We might call this the David model. Second, it can live as part of an imperial system — either as a subordinate ally, as a moderately autonomous entity or as a satrapy. In any case, it maintains its identity but loses room for independent maneuvering in foreign policy and potentially in domestic policy. We might call this the Persian model in its most beneficent form. Finally, Israel can be completely crushed — with mass deportations and migrations, with a complete loss of autonomy and minimal residual autonomy. We might call this the Babylonian model. 
The Davidic model exists primarily when there is no external imperial power needing control of the Levant that is in a position either to send direct force or to support surrogates in the immediate region. The Persian model exists when Israel aligns itself with the foreign policy interests of such an imperial power, to its own benefit. The Babylonian model exists when Israel miscalculates on the broader balance of power and attempts to resist an emerging hegemon. When we look at Israeli behavior over time, the periods when Israel does not confront hegemonic powers outside the region are not rare, but are far less common than when it is confronting them. 
Given the period of the first iteration of Israel, it would be too much to say that the Davidic model rarely comes into play, but certainly since that time, variations of the Persian and Babylonian models have dominated. The reason is geographic. Israel is normally of interest to outside powers because of its strategic position. While Israel can deal with local challenges effectively, it cannot deal with broader challenges. It lacks the economic or military weight to resist. Therefore, it is normally in the process of managing broader threats or collapsing because of them. 
The Geopolitics of Contemporary Israel
Let us then turn to the contemporary manifestation of Israel. Israel was recreated because of the interaction between a regional great power, the Ottoman Empire, and a global power, Great Britain. During its expansionary phase, the Ottoman Empire sought to dominate the eastern Mediterranean as well as both its northern and southern coasts. One thrust went through the Balkans toward central Europe. The other was toward Egypt. Inevitably, this required that the Ottomans secure the Levant. 
For the British, the focus on the eastern Mediterranean was as the primary sea lane to India. As such, Gibraltar and the Suez were crucial. The importance of the Suez was such that the presence of a hostile, major naval force in the eastern Mediterranean represented a direct threat to British interests. It followed that defeating the Ottoman Empire during World War I and breaking its residual naval power was critical. The British, as was shown at Gallipoli, lacked the resources to break the Ottoman Empire by main force. They resorted to a series of alliances with local forces to undermine the Ottomans. One was an alliance with Bedouin tribes in the Arabian Peninsula; others involved covert agreements with anti-Turkish, Arab interests from the Levant to the Persian Gulf. A third, minor thrust was aligning with Jewish interests globally, particularly those interested in the refounding of Israel. Britain had little interest in this goal, but saw such discussions as part of the process of destabilizing the Ottomans. 
The strategy worked. Under an agreement with France, the Ottoman province of Syria was divided into two parts on a line roughly running east-west between the sea and Mount Hermon. The northern part was given to France and divided into Lebanon and a rump Syria entity. The southern part was given to Britain and was called Palestine, after the Ottoman administrative district Filistina. Given the complex politics of the Arabian Peninsula, the British had to find a home for a group of Hashemites, which they located on the east bank of the Jordan River and designated, for want of a better name, the Trans-Jordan — the other side of the Jordan. Palestine looked very much like traditional Israel. 
The ideological foundations of Zionism are not our concern here, nor are the pre- and post-World War II migrations of Jews, although those are certainly critical. What is important for purposes of this analysis are two things: First, the British emerged economically and militarily crippled from World War II and unable to retain their global empire, Palestine included. Second, the two global powers that emerged after World War II — the United States and the Soviet Union — were engaged in an intense struggle for the eastern Mediterranean after World War II, as can be seen in the Greek and Turkish issues at that time. Neither wanted to see the British Empire survive, each wanted the Levant, and neither was prepared to make a decisive move to take it. 
Both the United States and the Soviet Union saw the re-creation of Israel as an opportunity to introduce their power to the Levant. The Soviets thought they might have some influence over Israel due to ideology. The Americans thought they might have some influence given the role of American Jews in the founding. Neither was thinking particularly clearly about the matter, because neither had truly found its balance after World War II. Both knew the Levant was important, but neither saw the Levant as a central battleground at that moment. Israel slipped through the cracks. 
Once the question of Jewish unity was settled through ruthless action by David Ben Gurion's government, Israel faced a simultaneous threat from all of its immediate neighbors. However, as we have seen, the threat in 1948 was more apparent than real. The northern Levant, Lebanon, was fundamentally disunited — far more interested in regional maritime trade and concerned about control from Damascus. It posed no real threat to Israel. Jordan, settling the eastern bank of the Jordan River, was an outside power that had been transplanted into the region and was more concerned about native Arabs — the Palestinians — than about Israel. The Jordanians secretly collaborated with Israel. Egypt did pose a threat, but its ability to maintain lines of supply across the Sinai was severely limited and its genuine interest in engaging and destroying Israel was more rhetorical than real. As usual, the Egyptians could not afford the level of effort needed to move into the Levant. Syria by itself had a very real interest in Israel's defeat, but by itself was incapable of decisive action. 
The exterior lines of Israel's neighbors prevented effective, concerted action. Israel's interior lines permitted efficient deployment and redeployment of force. It was not obvious at the time, but in retrospect we can see that once Israel existed, was united and had even limited military force, its survival was guaranteed. That is, so long as no great power was opposed to its existence. 
From its founding until the Camp David Accords re-established the Sinai as a buffer with Egypt, Israel's strategic problem was this: So long as Egypt was in the Sinai, Israel's national security requirements outstripped its military capabilities. It could not simultaneously field an army, maintain its civilian economy and produce all the weapons and supplies needed for war. Israel had to align itself with great powers who saw an opportunity to pursue other interests by arming Israel. 
Israel's first patron was the Soviet Union — through Czechoslovakia — which supplied weapons before and after 1948 in the hopes of using Israel to gain a foothold in the eastern Mediterranean. Israel, aware of the risks of losing autonomy, also moved into a relationship with a declining great power that was fighting to retain its empire: France. Struggling to hold onto Algeria and in constant tension with Arabs, France saw Israel as a natural ally. And apart from the operation against Suez in 1956, Israel saw in France a patron that was not in a position to reduce Israeli autonomy. However, with the end of the Algerian war and the realignment of France in the Arab world, Israel became a liability to France and, after 1967, Israel lost French patronage. 
Israel did not become a serious ally of the Americans until after 1967. Such an alliance was in the American interest. The United States had, as a strategic imperative, the goal of keeping the Soviet navy out of the Mediterranean or, at least, blocking its unfettered access. That meant that Turkey, controlling the Bosporus, had to be kept in the American bloc. Syria and Iraq shifted policies in the late 1950s and by the mid-1960s had been armed by the Soviets. This made Turkey's position precarious: If the Soviets pressed from the north while Syria and Iraq pressed from the south, the outcome would be uncertain, to say the least, and the global balance of power was at stake.
The United States used Iran to divert Iraq's attention. Israel was equally useful in diverting Syria's attention. So long as Israel threatened Syria from the south, it could not divert its forces to the north. That helped secure Turkey at a relatively low cost in aid and risk. By aligning itself with the interests of a great power, Israel lost some of its room for maneuver: For example, in 1973, it was limited by the United States in what it could do to Egypt. But those limitations aside, it remained autonomous internally and generally free to pursue its strategic interests. 
The end of hostilities with Egypt, guaranteed by the Sinai buffer zone, created a new era for Israel. Egypt was restored to its traditional position, Jordan was a marginal power on the east bank, Lebanon was in its normal, unstable mode, and only Syria was a threat. However, it was a threat that Israel could easily deal with. Syria by itself could not threaten the survival of Israel. 
Following Camp David (an ironic name), Israel was in its Davidic model, in a somewhat modified sense. Its survival was not at stake. Its problems — the domination of a large, hostile population and managing events in the northern Levant — were subcritical (meaning that, though these were not easy tasks, they did not represent fundamental threats to national survival, so long as Israel retained national unity). When unified, Israel has never been threatened by its neighbors. Geography dictates against it.
Israel's danger will come only if a great power seeks to dominate the Mediterranean Basin or to occupy the region between Afghanistan and the Mediterranean. In the short period since the fall of the Soviet Union, this has been impossible. There has been no great power with the appetite and the will for such an adventure. But 15 years is not even a generation, and Israel must measure its history in centuries. 
It is the nature of the international system to seek balance. The primary reality of the world today is the overwhelming power of the United States. The United States makes few demands on Israel that matter. However, it is the nature of things that the United States threatens the interests of other great powers who, individually weak, will try to form coalitions against it. Inevitably, such coalitions will arise. That will be the next point of danger for Israel. 
In the event of a global rivalry, the United States might place onerous requirements on Israel. Alternatively, great powers might move into the Jordan River valley or ally with Syria, move into Lebanon or ally with Israel. The historical attraction of the eastern shore of the Mediterranean would focus the attention of such a power and lead to attempts to assert control over the Mediterranean or create a secure Middle Eastern empire. In either event, or some of the others discussed, it would create a circumstance in which Israel might face a Babylonian catastrophe or be forced into some variation of a Persian or Roman subjugation. 
Israel's danger is not a Palestinian rising. Palestinian agitation is an irritant that Israel can manage so long as it does not undermine Israeli unity. Whether it is managed by domination or by granting the Palestinians a vassal state matters little. Nor can Israel be threatened by its neighbors. Even a unified attack by Syria and Egypt would fail, for the reasons discussed. Israel's real threat, as can be seen in history, lies in the event of internal division and/or a great power, coveting Israel's geographical position, marshalling force that is beyond its capacity to resist. Even that can be managed if Israel has a patron whose interests involve denying the coast to another power. 
Israel's reality is this. It is a small country, yet must manage threats arising far outside of its region. It can survive only if it maneuvers with great powers commanding enormously greater resources. Israel cannot match the resources and, therefore, it must be constantly clever. There are periods when it is relatively safe because of great power alignments, but its normal condition is one of global unease. No nation can be clever forever, and Israel's history shows that some form of subordination is inevitable. Indeed, it is to a very limited extent subordinate to the United States now. 
For Israel, the retention of a Davidic independence is difficult. Israel's strategy must be to manage its subordination effectively by dealing with its patron cleverly, as it did with Persia. But cleverness is not a geopolitical concept. It is not permanent, and it is not assured. And that is the perpetual crisis of Jerusalem.

ohn Masters stood up to address General Stanley A. McChrystal

and his military staff in Kabul. The topic, of course, the war in

Afghanistan. The main war lasted only eight weeks, but this did not
end the conflict. A level of tribal violence and insurgent warfare rumbled
on for years, killing around 30 people a week. Masters’ job was to explain
the dynamics of Afghanistan and provide politicians and military
commanders a framework to understand what was going on.

Think about your country for a moment. What maintains the fabric
of society — police, family, the local charity club, church, newspapers, the
broadcast media? All these institutions work to keep us civilized, but what
happens if a country loses them? There are institutions in Afghanistan,
good and bad: tribes, gangs, corrupt officials, families. Masters had spent
a year investigating these interactions, and questioning the returning
commanders. He and his team believed that understanding the dynamics
of the conflict was the key to bringing peace to Afghanistan.

If you live in an industrialized country, you rarely see society
without its civilizing web in place. One interesting ‘experiment’ that
shows what happens when it fails was the 1976 traffic police strike
in Finland. Finland is a fantastically law abiding country where most
people obey both the written and unwritten laws. During the strike, this
behavior changed. Many people began parking illegally but refrained
from blocking the roads. A few took advantage of the absence of police to
drive incredibly fast — twice the national limit. These would be labeled as
‘defectors’ in game theory. Without traffic police, a different automotive

attackers. Very early on, we shifted to using plastic bullets. But even that
presented problems. At a distance of a hundred feet or so, they could drastically
reduce deaths. But when a young recruit saw hundreds of Palestinians closing in
on him, he wasn’t about to take out a tape measure. Over time, we began relying
wherever possible on rubber bullets and, in extreme cases, snipers to target the
legs of the organizers or ring-leaders.

If all of this sounds soul-destroying, that’s because it was. Especially with
daily television coverage of the clashes amplifying overseas support for the
Palestinians, morale among our soldiers also took a battering. In visits to units
on the West Bank and in Gaza, Dan and I, and Rabin too, heard two opposite
responses. Some of the young soldiers wanted us to use maximum force. We are
the army, they argued. We have the weapons. Why the hell don’t we use them?
But we also heard another view, if less often: why are we here at all?

We imposed closures and curfews. We made thousands of arrests. Still,
hundreds of soldiers and settlers were being injured, a number of them
disfigured or disabled. By the end of 1998, the Palestinian death toll was above
300. In February 1989, an Israeli officer was killed by a cement block tossed
from a rooftop in Nablus. A month later, a Palestinian knifed several people in
Tel Aviv, killing one of them. And in July, in the first attempt inside Israel at a
suicide attack, a Palestinian passenger grabbed the wheel of a bus on its way
from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and drove it off the road, killing 16 people.

By the summer of 1990, although the violence had begun to flag slightly, I
was feeling more drained and exhausted than at any time since my bout of
illness in the Sinai after the 1973 war. I even briefly thought of leaving the army
after Dan’s term ended the following year. I’m not sure whether I would have
done that if the situation had not begun to change. But it did, dramatically. The
intifada gradually began to subside, and an entirely new crisis suddenly
intervened.

On August 2, against a background of longstanding financial and territorial
disputes, Iraq’s Sadam Hussein sent in tens of thousands of his troops and
occupied the neighboring state of Kuwait. Though the immediate crisis was

Local Outsourcing/Consolidation: Improve Efficiency of Public Services
Through Automation / Scale / Flexibility

1. Automation — Government agencies cannot afford to perform manual
routine-based processes that can be replaced more efficiently by
technology.

2. Scale — Consolidation of non-core processes across agencies or
outsource non-core processes to local companies can deliver scale
efficiencies.

3. Flexibility — Outsourced labor enables temporary employment in
situations where hiring full-time workers would be costly and
unnecessary.

the summary judgment motion as follows: Edwards and Cassell
do acknowledge that the public filing in the Crime Victims

Rights Act case of the client's allegations against Defendant
Dershowitz became a major distraction from the merits of the

well-founded Crime Victims Rights Act case by causing delay

and, as a consequence, turned out to be a tactical mistake.

Tactical mistake. For that reason Edwards and Cassell have
chosen to withdraw the referenced filing as a condition of the

That's all a very interesting lawsuit, but that's a
lawsuit that does not have Ms. Giuffre as a party. It was

Cassell and Edwards versus Alan Dershowitz, with claims going

back and forth. Cassell and Edwards were, of course,

vindicating their own professional interests and their

professional reputation responding to the attacks that had been

made by Mr. Dershowitz, and they chose to settle the case, as
did Mr. Dershowitz, for undisclosed financial reasons.

And also, from the fact I think your Honor is now
aware, that there were some witnesses who were not available.
Sarah Ransome has come forward in this case to say that she was

Shortly after the election, his friend Ailes told him, with some urgency, “You’ve got to
get right on Russia.” Even exiled from Fox News, Ailes still maintained a fabled
intelligence network. He warned Trump of potentially damaging material coming his way.
“You need to take this seriously, Donald.”

“Jared has this,” said a happy Trump. “It’s all worked out.”

7 OK Ok

Trump Tower, next door to Tiffany and now headquarters of a populist revolution,
suddenly seemed like an alien spaceship—the Death Star—on Fifth Avenue. As the great
and good and ambitious, as well as angry protesters and the curious hoi polloi, began
beating a path to the next president’s door, mazelike barricades were hurriedly thrown up
to shield him.

The Pre-Election Presidential Transition Act of 2010 established funding for
presidential nominees to start the process of vetting thousands of candidates for jobs in a
new administration, codifying policies that would determine the early actions of a new
White House, and preparing for the handoff of bureaucratic responsibilities on January 20.
During the campaign, New Jersey governor Chris Christie, the nominal head of the Trump
transition office, had to forcefully tell the candidate that he couldn’t redirect these funds,
that the law required him to spend the money and plan for a transition—even one he did
not expect to need. A frustrated Trump said he didn’t want to hear any more about it.

The day after the election, Trump’s close advisers—suddenly eager to be part of a
process that almost everybody had ignored—immediately began blaming Christie for a
lack of transition preparations. Hurriedly, the bare-bones transition team moved from
downtown Washington to Trump Tower.

This was certainly some of the most expensive real estate ever occupied by a transition
team (and, for that matter, a presidential campaign). And that was part of the point. It sent
a Trump-style message: we’re not only outsiders, but we’re more powerful than you
insiders. Richer. More famous. With better real estate.

And, of course, it was personalized: his name, fabulously, was on the door. Upstairs
was his triplex apartment, vastly larger than the White House living quarters. Here was his
private office, which he’d occupied since the 1980s. And here were the campaign and now
transition floors—firmly in his orbit and not that of Washington and the “swamp.”

Trump’s instinct in the face of his unlikely, if not preposterous, success was the
opposite of humility. It was, in some sense, to rub everybody’s face in it. Washington
insiders, or would-be insiders, would have to come to him. Trump Tower immediately
upstaged the White House. Everybody who came to see the president-elect was
acknowledging, or accepting, an outsider government. Trump forced them to endure what

misleading and vague. The first
comment, from COLLE, argues that the
provision is misleading because it fails
to acknowledge that an employer does
not have an obligation under the NLRA
to consent to the establishment of a
collective-bargaining agreement, but
instead only has the statutory duty to
“meet at reasonable times and confer in
good faith with respect to wages, hours,
and other terms and conditions of
employment.” 29 U.S.C. 158(d). The
comment also argues that the failure to
reach an agreement is not per se
unlawful, and the finding of an unfair
labor practice depends on whether the
parties engaged in good-faith bargaining.
This comment suggests that the notice
should instead note that the NLRA
requires parties to bargain in good faith
but does not compel agreement or the
making of concessions, and that, in
some instances, a bargaining impasse
will result, permitting the parties to
exercise their economic weapons, such
as strikes or lockouts. The second
comment, made generally by more than
a few organizations and individuals,
suggests that the notice add a statement
indicating that employers and unions
have an obligation to bargain in good
faith.

The Board finds it unnecessary to add
the suggested amplifications. For one
thing, the notice does state that
employers and unions have a duty to
bargain in good faith, “in a genuine
effort to reach a written, binding
agreement setting your terms and
conditions of employment.” In the
Board’s view, the statement that the
parties must make a ‘‘genuine effort” to
reach agreement necessarily implies that
they are not, in the end, required to
reach one. The Board deems the notice
language to be adequate on this point.
Finally, for the reasons already
discussed, the Board rejects the
contention that the notice should
discuss the implications or
consequences of unsuccessful
bargaining.

iii. The Right To Discuss With Co-
Workers or Union

A comment from the National
Immigration Law Center suggests that
the use of the phrase “terms and
conditions of employment” is unclear
especially to employees who are
unaware of their rights under the NLRA.
The comment recommends that, in
order to clarify, the Board add the
phrase “including wages and benefits.”
The suggested language would read,
“you have the right to: discuss your
terms and conditions of employment,
including wages and benefits, or union

organizing with your co-workers ora
union.”

The Board agrees that adding the
suggested language would clarify the
provision. The list of affirmative rights
uses the terms ‘‘wages, hours, and other
terms and conditions of employment” to
describe what unions may negotiate.
The notice then uses the terms “wages,
benefits, hours, and other working
conditions” to describe the right to
bargain collectively for a contract. Those
statements make it clear that “terms and
conditions of employment” includes
wages and benefits. But then
immediately following those two
statements, the notice states that
employees may discuss ‘“‘terms and
conditions of employment,” but does
not include any clarifying language. In
order, to create a more uniform notice
and clarify the extent to which
employees may discuss their terms and
conditions of employment the final
notice will read, “Under the NLRA, you
have a right to: Discuss your wages and
benefits and other terms and conditions
of employment or union organizing with
your co-workers or a union.”

iv. The Right To Strike and Picket

The notice’s reference to the right to
strike and picket received a few
comments from law firms and other
organizations representing employers’
interests. The comments suggest that the
provision is flawed because of the
absence of further limitations,
exceptions, and distinctions.1°¢
Generally, the comments argue that not
all strikes and pickets are protected.
COLLE argues that the notice should
inform employees of the limitations of
strikes encompassed by “depending on
the purpose or means of the strike or
pickets’’—for example, whether the
strike is for recognition or bargaining,
whether the strike has a secondary
purpose, whether picketing involves a
reserved gate, whether the strike is a sit-
down or minority strike, whether the
conduct is a slowdown and not a full
withholding of work, whether the strike
is partial or intermittent, whether the
strike involves violence, and whether
the strike is an unfair labor practice
strike or an economic strike. ALFA
argues that employees should be
informed that if the employer is a
healthcare institution, “employees do
not have the right to participate in a
union-initiated strike or picket unless
the union has provided the employer
and federal and state mediation agencies
with the required 10 days notice.”

106 See comments of ALFA, Carrollton Health and
Rehabilitation Center, and COLLE.

The Board disagrees. By necessity, an
11x17-inch notice cannot contain an
exhaustive list of limitations on and
exceptions to the rights to strike and
picket, as suggested by employers.
However, because exercising the right to
strike can significantly affect the
livelihood of employees, the Board
considers it important to alert
employees that there are some
limitations to exercising this right. The
Board is satisfied that the general
caveat, “depending on the purpose or
means of the strike or the picketing,”
together with the instruction to contact
the NLRB with specific questions about
the application of rights in certain
situations, provides sufficient guidance
to employees about the exercise of their
rights while still staying within the
constraints set by a necessarily brief
employee notice.

v. The Right To Refrain From Union or
Other Protected Concerted Activity

All the comments that discuss the
right to refrain from engaging in union
activity criticize what they contend to
be its lack of prominence. ALFA accuses
the Board of ‘‘burying” the provision by
placing it last, below the other rights to
engage in union and other concerted
activity. The U.S. Chamber of
Commerce suggests that the notice
include “‘or not’”’ after each of the
enumerated rights. For example, ‘‘you
have the right to: form join or assist a
union, or not.” (Emphasis added.) Other
suggested revisions to amplify the
prominence of the provision include
stating that employees have the right to
refrain from protected, concerted
activities and/or union activities; stating
that employees’ right to refrain includes
the right to actively oppose
unionization, to not sign union
authorization cards, to request a secret
ballot election, to not be a member of a
union or pay dues or fees (addressed
further below), or to decertify a union
(also addressed below); and stating that
employees have the right to be fairly
represented even if not a member of the
union. One employer suggests that if the
notice retains its current emphasis
favoring union activity and disfavoring
the freedom to refrain from such
activity, employers will need to post
their own notices that emphasize and
elaborate on the right to refrain.

The Board received at least four
comments that argue that the notice, as
written, may make employees believe
that the employer is encouraging
unionization. Two of those comments
suggest that an employer is protected
from compelled speech by Section 8(c)
of the NLRA. (The Board has already
rejected the latter argument; see section

Second, Jane Doe #3 claims that she needed to defame Prof. Dershowitz and others in the
Joinder Motion because of discovery disputes between the government and Jane Doe #1 and Jane
Doe #2. This does not even make sense, legally or factually. Jane Doe #3’s right to join in this
case has nothing to do with Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2’s entitlement to documents in
discovery. In fact, the discovery requests that Jane Doe #3 cites to in her Response as purported
cover for their sliming of Prof Dershowitz show that their argument is factually bogus. Prof.
Dershowitz is mentioned in only two of twenty-five requests for production propounded by Jane
Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2. (See Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2’s First Request for Production to
the Government Regarding Information Relevant to Their Pending Action Concern [sic] the
Crime Victims Act, at DE 225-1 at 26-38.) Both requests, nos. 8 and 21 seek his
communications with the government in his role as Mr. Epstein’s defense attorney. There is no
issue of complicity or knowledge in any misconduct. Moreover, a fact conveniently omitted by
Jane Doe #3 is that Prof. Dershowitz is one of eleven lawyers whose communications Jane Doe
#1 and Jane Doe #2 sought in the requests for production. As the Court knows, Prof. Dershowitz
had no material connection to this case—as to the merits or as to discovery—before he was
dragged in by Jane Doe #3.

Third, Jane Doe #3 claims that the smears against Prof. Dershowitz are relevant to show

that Prof. Dershowitz had a motive to negotiate “confidentiality” and “blank check” provisions

discovery requests regarding her belief that Prince Andrew was somehow involved in “lobbying
efforts to persuade the Government to give him a more favorable plea arrangement,” and because
her allegations against Prince Andrews occurred in London, therefore “affect[ing] foreign
commerce” are patently absurd. (DE 291 at 20 and 18, fn. 10.) Because Jane Doe #3’s other
allegations are replete with allegations of interstate activity and because implications of Prince
Andrew’s involvement in “lobbying” for the NPA are entirely nonsensical, it is obvious that the
inclusion of claims against Prince Andrew were included solely for their intended audience: the

Egypt's new Constitution: an update

Nathan Brown

March 29, 2011 -- The March 19 vote in favor of constitutional
amendments in Egypt provides a boost to the military-led transition
process and its vigorous electoral schedule.

The voter turnout was impressive by Egyptian standards — 41 percent
of eligible voters, at least double the turnout in any previous national
election or referendum — and the victory was overwhelming at 77
percent of voters. But opponents attracted enough votes to make the
outcome seem less like the predictable landslides of the authoritarian
order. Those who objected to the content of the amendments and,
more forcefully, to the process by which they were written and the
political sequence they implied marshaled forceful arguments,
campaigned hard, and then lost.

As a consequence, Egypt’s transition process will likely rush forward.
What are the next steps? The basic sequence of events is clear, but
the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) has not
revealed many of the details. Nor has it shared decision-making
power over the sequence and rules in any serious way.

The amended articles — most of them governing presidential and
parliamentary elections — are now clearly in effect. But the rest of
Egypt’s Constitution remains suspended. Egypt’s military rulers have
suggested that they will very shortly issue a declaration indicating
how authority will be exercised while Egypt’s Parliament and
president are elected, which parts of the 1971 Constitution will be
brought back into effect, and what their own role will be.

The committee that drafted the amendments also prepared
amendments to various laws in order to bring them into conformance

(self-invested work) and what it forgets to exclude (recovered human depreciation).

My own way of putting things mightn’t strictly need the terms investment or saving
except to translate my ideas into the language we all know. That translation is
essential if | hope to be understood. It will first take account of the fact that Keynes
meant investment and saving as to physical capital only, with labor or human capital
to arrive exogenously as an outcome somehow of consumption. That led to the

Y=1+C equation

output = investment + consumption. (4.1)
Gross and net versions of (4.1) meant gross and net of depreciation. Thus

gross output = gross investment + consumption (4.1a)
and

net output = net investment + consumption. (4.1b)
In the General Theory, where (4.1) appears in his Chapter 6, (4.1) it means the gross
version unless otherwise specified. I prefer the opposite, and mean the net version
(4.1b) unless otherwise specified.
My ex ante investment corresponds to Keynes’ “intended saving” through
consumption restraint. My “depreciation investment”, or “depreciation plowback”,
means just enough ex ante investment to offset actual depreciation, not book
depreciation, of physical capital. 1 assume that we intuit roughly how much this is

when I say that optimum ex ante investment is depreciation plowback. Now let’s

consider how that could be true.

victims’ rights act case that we are talking about is in
the Southern District of Florida. I think the record
should be clear that that is in the 11th Circuit. And
so that case law says that you look at these different
factors, one of the factors, that to my mind would weigh
heavily in favor of drawing the adverse inference would
be the degree of control that the one party has over the
other.

Dershowitz was the attorney for Epstein and,
indeed, we heard today that he continues to be the
attorney on the Tri-Tech case and I'm assuming an
attorney/client privilege on other matters as well. So
he would seem to have a significant control over that.

The other thing that was going on in my mind
when I'm drawing the adverse inference is that there
might be some people that are invoking the Fifth
Amendment but not getting sound legal advice.

An attorney can only allow his client to
assert a Fifth Amendment privilege in civil case if
there's a significant risk that the answer will be
incriminating. You can't just invoke it willy-nilly.

And I knew that Mr. Epstein had been
receiving -- you know, as a billionaire would -- you
know, the best legal advice that money could buy, and

sexual trafficking. The statute has never been applied to a “John,” and only a highly and
impermissibly selective prosecution could stretch § 1591 to reach conduct like that at issue in
this case.

In short, without “novel” interpretive expansions—a description used by CEOS itself—it
cannot be shown that Mr. Epstein violated any of the three federal statutes identified by
prosecutors. As the Supreme Court’s recent decisions in Santos and Cuellar make clear, federal
law may not be stretched in that manner, and the current federal investigation relies, as its
foundation, on impermissibly elastic stretches of each statute beyond any reported precedent;
beyond the essential elements of each statute; well outside the ordinary construction of each
statute’s limitations; and on a selective, extraordinary, and unwarranted expansion of federal law
to cover conduct that has always been exclusively within the core of state powers.

At this point in time, the need for Departmental oversight is critical. We appreciate this
opportunity to submit our assessment of the key facts in this case and review of the pertinent
federal statutes, and respectfully request that the Office of the Deputy Attorney General end
federal involvement in this matter so that the State of Florida may resolve this case appropriately.

Summary of the Facts

Mr. Epstein has maintained a home in Palm Beach, Florida for the past 20 years. While
there, he routinely conducted business, received medical attention, socialized with friends, and
helped care for his elderly mother. Mr. Epstein also had various women visit his home to
perform massages. He did not personally schedule the massage appointments or communicate
with the women over the phone or the Internet. Rather, Mr. Epstein’s personal assistants
scheduled many types of appointments, personal trainers, chiropractors, business meetings and
massages. The phone message pad taken from his house and in the possession of the
government confirmed that in many cases, the women themselves contacted Mr. Epstein’s
assistants to inquire about his availability—trather than vice versa.

The majority of the massages were just that and nothing else. Mr. Epstein often would be
on the telephone conducting business while he received his massage. At times, the masseuses
would be topless, and some sexual activity might occur—primarily self-masturbation on the part
of Mr. Epstein. On other occasions, no sexual activity would occur at all. There was no pattern
or practice regarding which masseuse would be scheduled on a particular day—if one would be
scheduled at all—or whether any sexual activity might occur. Indeed, Mr. Epstein almost never
knew which masseuse his assistants had scheduled until she arrived. See Tab 3, To
Records.

Mr. Epstein specifically requested that each masseuse be at least 18 years old. The vast
majority of the masseuses were in fact in their twenties, many accompanied to Mr. Epstein’s
home by friends or even other family members. Furthermore, most of the women who have
testified that they were actually under 18 have specifically admitted to systematically lying to
Mr. Epstein about their age. See Tab 4 UMMM Tr. at 38-39; Tab 5, Tr. at 16; Tab 6, ©

historical connections and responsibilities as “sons and daughters of the Yellow Emperor”
to support the PRC’s goals and the “China Dream.” As Xi Jinping™ described it in a 2014
speech to the Seventh Conference of Overseas Chinese Associations, “The Rejuvenation of
the Chinese Nation is a Dream shared by all Chinese” [emphasis added]. In January 2018,
Politburo member and former state counselor and foreign minister Yang Jiechi made this
presumption even clearer when he called upon the government to expand and strengthen
“Overseas Chinese Patriotic Friendly Forces” in the service of the “Great Rejuvenation” of
the Chinese nation.

In addition to appealing to the cultural affinities of Chinese Americans, the Chinese
government has also implemented a wide range of programs to strengthen ties with

elite members of this community. China has appointed hundreds of Chinese Americans
to positions in its united front organizations and provided thousands with free trips to
China, during which they have been feted by senior united front officials. In some cases,
Chinese Americans are offered senior positions in united front organizations. For example,
in 2013, one Chinese American, a native of Guangdong Province, became the first and
only foreigner to become a vice president of the Chinese Overseas Friendship Association
(COFA).””

China has used this tactic of handing out what one senior Chinese American called
“honors” to Chinese Americans as a way for united front departments, and even
espionage agencies, to cultivate contacts in the United States, often to the detriment of
other groups—such as Tibetans, Taiwanese independence supporters, supporters of the
Republic of China, Uighurs, prodemocracy activists, and other independent Chinese
voices with which the Party does not agree. Chinese Americans appointed to such
positions in organizations established by the Communist Party have subsequently led
protests against Taiwan and Tibet and participated in campaigns to silence Chinese
dissidents, such as the exiled billionaire Guo Wengui. For example, a Chinese American
who is a vice president of COFA spearheaded a campaign against Guo that was encouraged
by officials from the PRC. On a video posted to YouTube, this individual is seen railing
against Guo, vowing that he will “not rest” until Guo is returned to China to answer
charges against him.

United Front organizations in China have been surprisingly aggressive and transparent

in their public tasking of Chinese Americans to carry out activities that support the PRC
policies. One example occurred after the 19th Party congress in October 2017. The state-
owned Fujian Daily reported on November 24, 2017, that representatives of local Chinese
community associations based in the United States, Australia, the Philippines, and Europe
had gathered in Fujian and received letters of appointment from local provincial and city
United Front agencies in China to serve officially as “overseas propaganda agents” on their
return to their home countries. These commissions obliged them to accept responsibility for
promoting the decisions of the Party’s recent national congress in their home countries. The

NLRA; the high percentage of
immigrants in the labor force, who are
likely to be unfamiliar with workplace
rights in the United States; studies
indicating that employees and high
school students about to enter the work
force are generally uninformed about
labor law; and the absence ofa
requirement that, except in very limited
circumstances, employers or anyone
else inform employees about their
NLRA rights. 75 FR 80411.

A large number of comments contend
that the Board failed to demonstrate the
necessity of the notice posting rule.
They challenge each of the premises
(except the last) underlying the Board’s
belief that employees are generally
unaware of their NLRA rights.

Many comments assert that, contrary
to the Board’s belief, the right to join a
union is widely known and understood
by employees. For example:

—I believe the majority of employees know
about labor unions and how to form a
union, and this poster is unnecessary.*9

—IIlt is hard to imagine that there are many
in the US who do not know that they can
try to join a union.

—The fact of the matter is that if a group of
employees are upset enough with their
current management that they feel they
need union representation, they already
know what they need to do as a recourse.
And if they do not immediately know how
to respond, there are plenty of resources for
them.5°

—We, the employees, know the unions exist,
* * * Ifthe employees want to know about
unions, they should research it themselves.
It is not as though the information is not
readily available.

Some posit that comparatively few
private sector employees are
represented by unions not because
employees do not know that they can
join unions, but because they have
consciously rejected union
representation for any number of
reasons (e.g., they do not believe that
unions can help them; they do not want
to pay union dues; they deem union
representation unnecessary in light of
other workplace protection statutes). For
example:

—lIs it not just as probable that people clearly
understand unions, and they have decided
they want no part of them?

—Labor unions charge approximately 1.3%
of pre-tax earnings for monthly dues. Many
workers, especially those who lost their
good paying jobs during this recession and
have found new jobs at $10.00-$11.00 per
hour wages, need the dues money
themselves, in order to support their
families.

49 Comment of the Employers Association.
5° Comment of Malt-O-Meal Company (Malt-O-
Meal).

—Membership is down because so many of
the good things unions fought for a long
time ago have been legislated, at either the
Federal or State level, and so the need for
unions has declined.51

—I[Mlost employees are very aware of their
rights to unionize and many employees
choose not to do so because of the rights
they already have under our federal and
state laws.

—In fact, one could say that the NLRA and
other employment laws have succeeded to
the degree that unions are NOT necessary
in today’s work environment.®2

A few comments question the Board’s
belief that immigrant workers are
unfamiliar with their workplace
rights.>? Several comments argue that
the NLRA has been in effect for nearly
76 years, which is sufficient time for
employees to learn about its
provisions.>4

A number of comments argue that the
studies cited in the NPRM are from the
late 1980s and early 1990s and are
therefore out of date >> (and also, some
say, poorly supported).5® Moreover,
those studies, whatever their value
when published, predate the wide use
of the internet. Now there are many
online sources of information
concerning unions and union
organizing, including the Board’s own
Web site. According to these comments,
it should not be necessary to require
employers to post notices of NLRA
rights because employees who are
interested in learning about unions can
quickly and easily find such
information online.>”? One comment,
like some others, argues that “If it is so
important that employees know their
rights under the NLRB it should be the
government or union whose
responsibility it is to inform them.’’ 58
Two comments suggest that the Board
conduct a mass media informational
campaign to that end, and one notes that
the Board has in fact recently increased

57 As one person states, ‘The internet has long
ago replaced lunch room bulletin board postings as
the means by which employees learn of and
exercise their rights.”’

58 Such comments appear to misunderstand that
by this rule, the Board is indeed seeking to inform
employees of the provisions of the NLRA, using the
most accessible venues to reach them, their
workplaces.

Other comments question why this rule does not
mandate notice posting by governmental employers.
The NLRA does not cover such employers. See
Section 2(2), 29 U.S.C. 152(2).

its public information efforts.59 One

comment urges the Board to conduct a

study to ascertain current employees’

level of NLRA knowledge before
imposing a notice posting requirement.

In contrast, as discussed in more
detail below, numerous comments from
individuals, union organizers, attorneys
representing unions, and worker
assistance organizations agree with the
Board that most employees are
unfamiliar with their NLRA rights.
Immigrant rights organizations state that
immigrant workers largely do not know
about their rights.

After careful consideration of the
comments on both sides of this issue,
the Board believes that many employees
are unaware of their NLRA rights and
that a notice posting requirement is a
reasonable means of promoting greater
knowledge among employees. To the
extent that employees’ general level of
knowledge is uncertain, the Board
believes that the potential benefit of a
notice posting requirement outweighs
the modest cost to employers. Certainly,
the Board has been presented with no
evidence persuasively demonstrating
that knowledge of NLRA rights is
widespread among employees.

The comments asserting that the right
to join a union is widely known cite
little, if any, support for that assertion.
By contrast, many of the comments
contending that employees are
unfamiliar with their NLRA rights base
their statements on personal experience
or on extensive experience representing
or otherwise assisting employees. Many
individual workers, commenting on the
rule, indicate their personal experiences
with the lack of NLRA knowledge and
concurrent strong support for the rule.
For example:

—Even though most of my coworkers and
supervisors were highly intelligent people,
it is my experience that most workers are
almost totally unaware of their rights under
the NLRA.

—Knowing that there is a federal agency out
there that will protect the rights of working
people to organize is essential to the
exercise of those rights.

—TI had no idea that I had the right to join
a union, and was often told by my
employer that I could not do so.* * *I
think employers should be required to post
notices so that all employees may make an
informed decision about their rights to join
a union.6°

—Workers have rights and they have the
right to know them.®?

—[Tlhere is a lot of ignorance among young
workers and veteran workers alike with
regard to knowledge of their right to

his father murdered at least 10,000 — and start thinking
Hammersmith.

Questions swirl. Who are the Libyan rebels? Who are the angry of
Latakia? The Arab transitions will be long and bumpy — like those
that brought representative government to Latin America and Central
Europe and wide swathes of Asia — but now that fear has been
overcome, they are irreversible.

Here’s who the protesters are: people like Asmaa Mahfouz, 26, the
Egyptian woman who on Jan. 18 made a video urging citizens to go
to Tahrir Square on Jan. 25 — the demonstration that would start the
revolution. She said then: “We’ll go down and demand our rights,
our fundamental human rights. I won’t even talk about any political
rights. We just want our human rights and nothing else.” And she
said people “don’t have to come to Tahrir Square, just go down
anywhere and say it, that we are free human beings.” And: “This is
enough!”

People are being born throughout the Middle East. They are
discovering their capacity to change things, their inner “Basta!”
That’s how the Arab spring began on Dec. 17 in the little town of
Sidi Bouzid in Tunisia — with a fruit peddler’s “enough” to
humiliation. In my end is my beginning.

Three months later the genie is not only out of the bottle, it’s
shattered the bottle. I said of Libya in an earlier column: Be ruthless
or stay out. So now the West is in, be ruthless. Arm the resurgent
rebels. Incapacitate Qaddafi. Do everything short of putting troops on
the ground. Qaddafi, as President Obama has said, “must leave.” So
that Libya can be an Arab country that is imperfect but open.

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033004 
"
IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019916.txt,"Trump did not enjoy his own inauguration. He had hoped for a big blowout. Tom Barrack,
the would-be showman—in addition to Michael Jackson’s Neverland Ranch, he had
bought Miramax Pictures from Disney with the actor Rob Lowe—may have declined the
chief of staff job, but, as part of his shadow involvement with his friend’s White House, he
stepped up to raise the money for the inaugural and to create an event that—seemingly
quite at odds with the new president’s character, and with Steve Bannon’s wish for a no-
frills populist inauguration—he promised would have a “soft sensuality” and “poetic
cadence.” But Trump, imploring friends to use their influence to nail some of the A-level
stars who were snubbing the event, started to get angry and hurt that stars were determined
to embarrass him. Bannon, a soothing voice as well as a professional agitator, tried to
argue the dialectical nature of what they had achieved (without using the word
“dialectical’’). Because Trump’s success was beyond measure, or certainly beyond all
expectations, the media and the liberals had to justify their own failure, he explained to the
new president.

In the hours before the inauguration, the whole of Washington seemed to be holding its
breath. On the evening before Trump was sworn in, Bob Corker, the Republican senator
from Tennessee and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, opened his
remarks as the featured speaker at a gathering at the Jefferson Hotel with the existential
question, “Where are things going?” He paused for a moment and then answered, as
though from some deep well of bewilderment, “I have no idea.”

Later that evening, a concert at the Lincoln Memorial, part of an always awkward
effort to import pop culture to Washington, ended up, absent any star power, with Trump
himself taking the stage as the featured act, angrily insisting to aides that he could outdraw
any star.

Dissuaded by his staff from staying at the Trump International Hotel in Washington
and regretting his decision, the president-elect woke up on inaugural morning complaining
about the accommodations at Blair House, the official guest residence across the street
from the White House. Too hot, bad water pressure, bad bed.

His temper did not improve. Throughout the morning, he was visibly fighting with his
wife, who seemed on the verge of tears and would return to New York the next day;
almost every word he addressed to her was sharp and peremptory. Kellyanne Conway had
taken up Melania Trump as a personal PR mission, promoting the new First Lady as a
vital pillar of support for the president and a helpful voice in her own right, and was trying
to convince Trump that she could have an important role in the White House. But, in
general, the Trumps’ relationship was one of those things nobody asked too many
questions about—another mysterious variable in the presidential mood.

At the ceremonial meeting of the soon-to-be-new president and the soon-to-be-old
president at the White House, which took place just before they set off for the swearing-in
ceremony, Trump believed the Obamas acted disdainfully—“very arrogant”’—toward him

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028088.txt,"I was grateful not only to Shamir for naming me chief-of-staff, but to Rabin
and Misha. Both had honored the assurance Yitzhak had given me that I’d be
Dan’s successor. I also discovered Misha had played an even greater role than
I’d assumed. I knew there would be other candidates for the job. The strongest
turned out to be Yossi Peled, who was the head of the northern command and
possessed the undoubted credentials to be an excellent chief-of-staff. What I
hadn’t been aware of was the sentiment among some in the Likud that I was the
wrong choice politically. Not only had been born on a Labor kibbutz. There was
the small matter of the article in Hadashot several years earlier, imagining me
as a Labor leader going head-to-head in a future election against Bibi
Netanyahu for the Likud.

Yossi was assumed to be more of a Likudnik, and a few weeks before Dan
left office, I learned how Misha had rebutted the suggestion I was politically
unfit to lead the armed forces. He was visiting the north and was taken aside by
a group of Likud activists who asked how he could possibly be thinking of
supporting Barak — a Labor guy — for chief-of-staff. At first, Misha didn’t reply.
But one woman kept pressing him.

“Do you have children in the army?” he asked.
“Yes. I have a son in the Golani Brigade,” she replied proudly.

“So let’s assume your son is going on a raid across the border. Would you
want his company to be led by the best commander in the battalion? Or by a
commander who’s Likud?”

“The best commander, of course,” she said.

To which Misha said: “Well we do, too.”

admonition to “break and control the violence of faction” through a
“well-constructed Union.”

Right now factionalism leaves critical budget challenges unmet, stops
serious investment in education and research, and leaves America
trailing China on the green technologies that will be big job-creators
in coming decades. The road to the American future is not “Drill,
Baby, Drill!”

Third, it’s just delusional to imagine that any president, Republican
or Democrat, confronted by the meltdown of 2008, would not have
seen as a core task a retrenchment of U.S. overseas commitments in
an attempt to bring them in line with diminished resources.

But with an angry, anxious nation, Republicans are betting that
invocations of greatness and dominance, however illusory, will
resonate. Bruce Jentleson, a political scientist at Duke University,
said, “After the killing of Osama bin Laden, they can’t attack Obama
as a wimp, but they will attack him as not being a real American.”
Obama, he added, must answer by demonstrating “what this
generation of Americans is going to show the world, how it’s going
to compete in a global era. Against the illusion of restoration, he must
offer adaptation.”

With the U.S. economy wobbling, Obama runs the Bush Sr. risk. He
got Bin Laden and has been on the right side of the Arab Spring —
what Timothy Garton Ash has called “the most hopeful set of events
in the 21st century so far, comparable in scale and potential to 1989.”
Americans respond to that kind of hope. They care about foreign
policy and see through foreign posturing. What they need now from
Obama is a better sense of how their economy can thrive in this
changed world.

UAE Prime Minister 
First Media e-Session with the Prime Minister 
Dear Friends in the Media: 
I write this in the spirit of good will to thank all of you for your interest in communicating with me through the 
official Prime Minister's Web site. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024930 
This is the second time that I have responded to your questions online; the first time was eight years ago, when 
Internet communications were still in the nascent stage -- although, I must say, Dubai and the United Arab 
Emirates had already made noteworthy progress in this field. During that initial online interview, my objective 
was to stimulate the interest of the Emirati community in the Internet when the use of the online 
communications was relatively limited. 
Today the usage of the Internet across the UAE has come to be taken for granted; in fact, the Web has been 
adopted so extensively in both the public and private sectors that e-communications are the norm rather than the 
exception. We see that a large segment of our society, especially young people, believe that the Internet is the 
most important source of information, education and entertainment. 
The UAE continues to lead the Arab world in adoption of information and communication technology 
according to the annual global infor mation technology report released before yesterday. 
Little wonder, then, that I get inundated with questions from citizens and media alike. That's why I have chosen 
to meet with you via my Web site. I think hosting this encounter online will allow all of you to ask as many 
questions as you wish. In the last few days alone, I have received hundreds of questions from several local and 
regional newspapers. Naturally, there was some overlapping of questions since they came from so many 
different sources. Hence, I have tried to consolidate my answers in such a manner that I do not come across as 
repetitious. 
This interview, of course, relates to questions from the media, whose work I consider especially significant in 
telling the story of how Dubai and the UAE are coping successfully with the global financial crisis, and how our 
development plans are being advanced with the resilience and determination that has always characterized 
Emirati society. 
I have also received many questions from everyday Emiratis, and these will be answered in a subsequent 
communication. 
In the meantime, I hope my responses will generate positive discussion about the issues and values that Dubai 
and the UAE care about — the strengthening of a society that's anchored in unique Emirati traditions, and the 
continued building of a global city to which all are welcome, a city that is well integrated in the fast changing 
global commons that we all must share. Dubai is not only a catalyst of change; it is an exemplar of change. And 
I am proud of that, just as I am proud of the economic and social contributions that Emiratis and their well-
wishers have made over these years to furthering the Dubai Vision. 
Al Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi 
Your Highness, Dubai, the famous city known for its outstanding experience on both 
regional and international levels, has been recently criticized for its development 
strategy in the light of the global financial crisis. How do you perceive this campaign and 
how are you dealing with it? 
Criticism and negative statements do not really disturb me. We do not mind receiving objective criticism that 
helps us improving our services and methods. If there were negative aspects, then we will address them and 
work toward revamping them. But following the global financial crisis, what we read and heard was not in 
reference to the negative aspects. In fact it was a media bombardment targeted at the UAE as a model for a 
federal state, a successful and prosperous Arab country. And Dubai, the city that has set up a successful 
economic model at a global level, was under a daily attack by some Western media, as if they were in a race 
against time to harm the UAE. 
As for the motives of the campaign, God Almighty knows. But it seems that the success of the Arab, whether 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024931 
individual or state, city or a company, is seen as unacceptable. It seems that seeing=2 Odistinct images of 
successful Arabs and Arab countries disturbs some people. They would rather stick with the distorted images of 
Arab stereotypes in their minds. 
I need to stress here a very important perception. We are not growing in order to be a model for its highest 
building in the world, best airport, and most luxurious hotel, and the largest seaport and man-made islands. 
These landmarks and features are unique and famous all over the world. But the Dubai model is beyond that. 
Dubai is an Arab city with scarce natural resources but with a clear vision of comprehensive development and 
social needs. It is a city that succeeded through its investments in human resources, its unique geographical 
location, and its trade expertise. This has enabled us to achieve unmatched growth and to become the focal 
connection between the East and West. Dubai has proved as well the possibility of coexistence of different 
cultures in an open and tolerant Arab Islamic environment. 
Dubai's model, which is part of the UAE model, lies in the success of the economy's diversification, and in 
sparking the interest of the Arab region and neighboring countries in the information and communication 
technology, the e-government and the knowledge economy, and in facilitating access to the people in our region 
to global best practices. Our international experiences in various areas are often on display through exhibitions, 
conferences and other activities. 
Dubai's model also lies in proving the viability of investing in the region, of investing specifically in the 
knowledge economy and in human welfare. It has also raised the citizens' expectations in the region concerning 
levels of good governance and transparency, and the quality of public services and state-of-the-art 
infrastructure. 
Dubai is about providing the highest international standards in education and health systems. It is a city with 
entrepreneurial spirit that entered into international investment areas and bought assets in global ports, airports 
and financial markets. Dubai succeeded in building a global financial center and entering into partnerships with 
reputed financial institutions, and was able to compete globally in the areas of air and sea transport, and 
charitable initiatives that were created to help developing the less fortunate countries. 
These are some of Dubai's model features, which has attracted the attention of the world, and enticed the 
interest of the Arab region and its people, and inspired many people and motivated them. Is this the model that 
our critics are targeting? 
I asked my brothers and myself this question and I did not expect a reply, because we are accustomed in the 
UAE to respond by work, not words. We believe in God and we have full faith and confidence in Him and in 
our people and businessmen and the many other believers in Dubai. 
Abu Dhabi is also witnessing an attack since it succeeded in leading a successful Arab union and launched 
initiatives of a strategic and impo rtant nature such as Masdar City.. I know that the international media have 
covered art initiatives in Abu Dhabi, including building an outpost of the Louvre. But one gets the impression 
that even in such coverage of important initiatives, there's invariably some reference or the other to discredited 
stereotypes of the Arab Gulf Now the focus is on Dubai, and again the stereotypes are being brought up. It 
seems that any successful Arab model in economic development invites such negative treatment in the 
international media 
To be fair, we read recently a few balanced articles reporting on what is the UAE doing regarding the effect of 
the global financial crisis on our region. 
Al Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi 
Your Highness, the media campaign has focused on pointing that Dubai is facing an 
economic crisis threatening the foundations of its economic development. What is the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024932 
actual impact of the crisis on Dubai economically and socially? 
In fact, the campaign has gone much further than that. An American writer, well known for his extreme views, 
was so keen to project Dubai's alleged failure in the coexistence of cultures, that he went all the way stating 
that Dubai was a place where cultures break up and not where cultures meet. He reached that conclusion based 
on the fact that Dubai has jailed and deported a British couple caught having illegal sex on a public beach. 
With regard to the fact that the global crisis effect threatens Dubai's growth and economy, I can guarantee you 
that those references constitute wishful thinking on the part of some people; they are illusions, not realities. 
The economic foundations and development are firm and stable; otherwise Dubai would not have been able to 
deal efficiently with the global financial crisis consequences. In addition to that, Dubai is not a city on its own. 
It is a member of the United Arab Emirates federation, which is strong, resilient and successful — a federation 
that is able to face the most difficult challenges. 
Al Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi 
Your Highness, the foreign media are reporting on the bubble burst. What would you 
tell the people who are endorsing this view? 
I keep hearing the expression of the bubble for the past couple of decades. In my opinion, this bubble is found 
only in the minds of those who often keep repeating it and do not know its meaning. The future will prove to 
them the truth. 
Let me assure you we are fine, we have overcome the crisis with the least amount of losses. In our culture, we 
say: be virtuous and you will gain. That is why we always look at the half full cup of water, and when we look 
at the empty part, we do not moan over the void, instead we think of better and faster ways to fill it. 
Al Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi 
Your Highness, if we were saying this is an unfair campaign against Dubai then, could 
you explain to us how to get out of the current crisis? 
The impact of the global financial crisis has been felt all over the world. It generated a state of panic in all 
developed economies. It was expected that our region would not be immune to the crisis, especially in view of 
the fact that it led to the credit freeze, write-downs at banks, deferral of mutual credits, and a freeze on lending 
in some of the wealthiest industrialized countries, such as the United States. 
The crisis hit the world in September 2008, but I think that the panic pha se is over now, especially after the 
intervention of governments in many major countries to regulate financial and banking sectors, and the 
allocation of large sums of money to revitalize their economies. This step has enabled the summit of the G20 
that was held in London a few days ago, to agree on a package of decisions and actions aimed to revive the 
global economy and the organization of the international markets. 
For us in the United Arab Emirates, I can safely say that we have succeeded in containing the risks of the global 
financial crisis in record time. This is a result of the good policies of the Central Bank, and the government's 
action to ensure the liquidity of banks and the protection of deposits, and other actions at the local level, such as 
the additional liquidity that the Abu Dhabi government pumped it into the Emirate's banks and the bond 
issuance of $20 billion bonds. 
The crisis management in addition to the decisions taken during the G20 summit have spread a high degree of 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024933 
satisfaction and optimism around the world, and reflected positively on all the nations including the UAE, 
which has always had a strong, multi-potential and diverse economy. 
Al Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi 
The Federal Government has taken swift action to deal with the crisis, but many 
observers say that these actions are not sufficient to help the UAE, and Dubai in 
particular, to be free of the crisis? 
The actions that we took at the Federal Government were really fast, well thought-out to respond to the issues 
and to overcome the negative effects of the global crisis. Having said that, our economy has shifted from the 
crisis mode to the solution. Of course, we are monitoring and following up our situation and the development of 
all the economic sectors through federal and local specialized committees, just as we follow developments in 
the global economy and international markets. We thank God; most of the indicators seem positive now and 
call for optimism. However, should we face future developments further actions, then we won't sit back. 
Al Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi 
When Du bai launched the $20 billion bonds and the UAE Central Bank subscribed in it 
with $10 billion, it was interpreted as help from Abu Dhabi to Dubai to get out of the 
crisis. How do you evaluate this action by the UAE Central Bank, and what about the 
second tranche of the bonds, which would another $10 billion? 
When Dubai launched the $20 billion bonds and the UAE Central Bank subscribed in it with $10 billion, it was 
interpreted as help from Abu Dhabi to Dubai to get out of the crisis. How do you evaluate this action by the 
UAE Central Bank, and what about the second tranche of the bonds, which would another $10 billion?It seems 
that people are not aware of the life realities in the United Arab Emirates. Well, I welcome this interpretation 
because it emphasizes the depth of ties among the Emirates and ensures the strength of our Central Bank and its 
confidence in Dubai's economy. 
We have announced bonds totaling $20 billion, raised half of it as a public offering, then the Central Bank 
subscribed to the full amount; we will pay an annual interest rate of 4 percent annually on the five-year 
coupons. What we put forward, meets our needs at this stage. Should we need the second part — that is, $10 
billion -- we will then announce it to the public; we know that it will be of interest to many. 
Al Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi 
There are talks that Dubai would be selling few2Ostate owned companies and that Abu 
Dhabi will be its partner in many projects in place or under implementation. What is the 
truth in this? 
These rumors and speculations turned into news and headlines in several prominent international newspapers. 
Rest assured that between Abu Dhabi and Dubai, there is no buying and selling. Everything in Dubai belongs to 
Abu Dhabi and Dubai and the rest of the UAE, and all that is in Abu Dhabi belongs to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, 
and the rest of the UAE. Let me remind you about what The President, His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed 
Al Nahyan, said last month about this matter. He said that the impact of the current global financial crisis on the 
national economy of the United Arab Emirates has been misunderstood and exaggerated. He said that the 
relationship between members of the UAE Federation has been misrepresented. 
We are ... one strong, coherent body. As for the measures taken (at) the federal or local level, to address the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024934 
crisis, they were declared and (made) clear-cut. There was no need to unleash predictions in this respect, His 
Highness said. 
Al Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi 
YYour Highness, do you feel that Dubai is threatened as a result of the current crisis? 
We did not at any time feel that the financial crisis is a threat. The worst is over and behind us. Since the 
eruption of the crisis we did not hear of any state-owned bank or company announcing bankruptcy. None of the 
economy sectors was snapped. We are currently implementing plans and programs of action to benefit from the 
lessons of the crisis and ensure the recovery of the negative effects. 
Al Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi 
The recent murders that occurred in Dubai seriously raised the issue of security despite 
the speed of discovery of the perpetrators of these crimes. How would you respond to the 
statements that the prevention of the assassination should come first? 
Of course, prevention is better than cure. To prevent killing is a very valuable act. Often, people hear about the 
cure procedures, but they do not hear about the actions of prevention. Murders that took place in Dubai in 
recent months, were fewer than half of one hand's fingers -- and this is not to minimize the seriousness but just 
to confirm that it is an exception and the rule is that the UAE, including Dubai, is one of the most secure and 
stable countries, and this would not happen without having our authorities taking preventive measures of 
utmost importance. In any case, the crime rate in the UAE, including Dubai, is one of the lowest in the world, 
and we are working to remain so, and the murder of two known figures will not change the reality. 
Al Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi 
With the brunt of the global financial crisis on Dubai, we noticed the continuation of most 
of the art, culture, media, sports, and cultural activities, in addition to the enormous 
financial awards being bestowed by various organizations for business efficiency, among 
other things. How do you explain this? 
These activities were scheduled prior to the crisis, and some of them are annual events such as the Dubai World 
Cup, the Arab Media Forum and Arab Journalism Award. Some new events were launched, such as the World 
Poetry Festival -- but I don't know why you are wondering about the continuation of those activities. In fact, it 
would be a strange thing to cancel them. With regards to the prizes, they remain as were previously announced. 
Do you suggest in your question that these awards have become a burden to Dubai? If so, I promise we are in a 
good shape. All our projects under implementation have not ceased, and we are paying our loans and debts on 
time, and all suppliers and contractors have begun to receive their entitlements. 
Al Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi 
Your Highness, the media is focusing currently on the large layoffs from the companies 
working under the umbrella of Dubai Holding. What is the truth regarding this matter, 
especially that the issue is going to reach its peak in the coming months? 
The collapse of the global debt markets has pushed all the big companies worldwide to review their plans, expe 
nses and strategies and urged them to restructure their managements including the human resources. Dubai 
Holding is not an exception at all. All its companies work on a commercial basis, and it is normal to lay off the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024935 
employees who do not have roles to play during this situation. I am not sure why people are expecting a peak in 
the coming months. The whole process is a restructuring course that was well received by all Dubai Holding 
employees. 
Al Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi 
Your Highness, Dubai was accused in the media that laid-off Arabs descend from a 
specific nationality, what is the reality? 
Rumors feed on human emotion. Verifiable facts, and even simple common sense, have little or nothing to do 
with the way a rumor spreads. I would say that due to the steep global crisis effect on domains such as PR and 
advertising, which employ by coincidence a large number from a particular nationality, or the construction 
sector which also employs a large number of architects from one nationality, there is absolutely no focus on 
laying off any Arab or non-Arab nationality. 
Al Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi 
Your Highness, your recent visit to Russia complements your strategy in visiting the 
strong economic countries worldwide such as Germany and China last year. Do you 
think that these visits are still useful nowadays? Are you planning to20continue this 
approach and what is the objective of those visits? What was the outcome of your last 
visit to Moscow? 
This is a strange question. We are pretty sure that this crisis will not last forever, and that it will end. The UAE 
has always had good relations with all countries around the world and especially the weighty economic 
countries. Our duty is to work toward developing and enhancing those relationships. In fact, during global 
crisis countries should broaden those visits and enhance their bilateral relations especially since this crisis may 
result in forming a new economic and political world construct. 
Al Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi 
Your Highness, do you think that the current crisis would impose new changes on the 
federal and local levels in the UAE as rumors are spreading regarding a change in 
progress in the cabinet? 
It is obvious that things do change. Whoever does not take up the new situation and cooperate positively with it 
for the benefit of the nation and nationals would be incompetent. However, it is you who's saying that there are 
rumors that a change in the cabinet is under way. 
Al Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi 
Your Highness, people who are aware of the relationship between Dubai and Abu Dhabi 
say that there is no need to worry about the effect of the crisis on Dubai because it relies at 
the end of the day on the financial strength of Abu Dhabi, which owns the biggest 
sovereign fund in the world. What would you say? 
Those people know well that they can't bracket the relationship between both Emirates into just a financial 
relation. The money element is a very minimal component in a superior relationship built on family ties with a 
unity soul, with tolerance essence and foundation concurred by both Sheikh Zayed and Sheikh Rashid on 18 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024936 
February 1968, when they met and issued a historical statement announcing the establishment of a federal 
union between Abu Dhabi and Dubai and called on their brothers in the neighboring emirates to join the union. 
Do you know what it meant for us to stand few days ago with His Highness Sheikh Khalifa at the Union 
House under the UAE flag, and in the same place where our ancestors stood the day of the UAE 
announcement? Would you be able to appraise our feelings at that moment? These are moments that you cannot 
ponder easily. They are priceless. 
Those who know the truth about the Abu Dhabi and Dubai relationship and all the other Emirates, are well 
aware that the federation of the UAE is a choice of wise and liberated people who are guided by their heart, 
beliefs and wisdom. They are people who God Almighty described as ready to sacrifice their souls for others. 
Again, I remind you of what His Highness Sheikh Khalifa said. We are ... one strong, coherent body.

The United Arab Emirates is a federation but there is a tendency, particularly in health 
and education, to allow individual emirates to dictate policy. Will this continue or will 
the federal government seek to establish a more unified national approach on domestic 
policy? 
None of the seven emirates develops its own independent health and educational policies. All legislation and 
policies related to education and overall health are developed at the federal level. What is happening is precisely 
the expansion of the decentralized planning and implementation in order to raise the efficiency of education and 
medical services. This is what we see in industrialized countries, such as the United States and the United 
Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland and others. Our experience in education foundered for many reasons, and we 
are racing against time to make up for what we missed and to create sustainable development in the education 
sector. Of course, the process of development widens then to diversify the teaching methods and to attract 
broad participation of the private sector. 
The National Abu Dhabi Media Company - Matt Slater 
The Federal National Council has expressed concern that its views are ignored by the 
UAE cabinet and that, in reality, they have little power. What role do you see the FNC 
playing within the country's decision-making p rocess, and in what way is the Council 
likely to evolve in the future? 
We never received any complaints against the government for ignoring the views of the Council; instead we 
always receive compliments and appreciation about cooperation. We constantly express our appreciation to the 
Council for its role in the decision-making process. In fact, draft laws first have to pass through the FNC for 
review and recommendations, and later sent back to the Cabinet for consideration and approval. 
The Council is also empowered to summon and to question any Federal Minister regarding Ministry 
performance. We believe in the importance of the Council, and we respect its effective role in the process since 
its inception. The current session marked a beginning of change in the Council in the method of selecting its 
members. We witnessed for the first time the formation of election associations in the UAE to elect half the 
members of the 40-member Council, with 22 percent of members of the Council being women, one of the 
highest such rates in the world. 
In any case, since the founding of the UAE we chose the approach of gradualism. We in the UAE do not work 
with a burning stages style. Our laws and procedures are in line with reality and our reticence. We believe 
that our people are satisfied with this approach that results in prosperity and stability. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024937 
I am well aware of the foreign reports that criticize the way that the UAE deals with the issue of democracy. Th 
ese reports assess our system on the basis of their own history and cultural experiences, and the experiences of 
their countries — some of which have been democracies for more than 300 years. The easiest thing is to hold 
general elections and to place ballot boxes and to disseminate images and words about the greatness of 
democracy. 
But our leadership does not look for fame, and does not import ready-made models that may be valid for other 
societies, but is certainly not suitable for our society. Some months ago, we celebrated National Day, our 37th. 
Do you know how we used to live before? Do you have any idea about the state of education and illiteracy, 
infrastructure and public services? Do you know the details of our society's infrastructure and how it was 
developed? Today, after the tremendous achievements in various fields, our people have full confidence in the 
process of empowerment -- empowerment of the economy, women, the administration, the and culture as well 
as political empowerment within our traditions and culture. The midterm elections of the members of the 
Federal National Council is a very important step in the progression toward what is acceptable to the interests of 
our people and our homeland.

The issues of labor rights and human trafficking continue to adversely affect the image 
of the UAE abroad. Whereas there are clear policies aimed at aligning the2OUAE with 
international best practice on these fronts, the actual rate of prosecutions of those 
violating rights on these fronts are generally seen to be low. What is being done to address 
this? 
I want you to look at the results of the last meeting of the International Committee for Human Rights in Geneva, 
and to look at reports that refer to the huge progress in the UAE with regard to these issues. Even the periodic 
reports issued by the U.S. State Department recognize this progress, particularly on the issue of human 
trafficking. 
We care about the rights of workers; we care about reinforcing the freedom of people. Our aim is not to win the 
approval of international reports, but we are keen to promote human rights and also deepening the values of 
social justice and tolerance. We are keen to provide a model for Arab and Muslim countries that adheres to 
religious and cultural frameworks; we are keen to continue to interact with the international community. We 
want the respect and cooperation of all. Our religion and our values and ethics do not accept any violation of 
human rights and of people -- no matter where they work and where do they come from and what their belief 
and religion are. It's in our nature not to condone injustice, and we sympathize with victims and needy people. 
We have very active charitable institutions operating in a large number of the less fortunate countries. We 
cannot accept that any person, man or woman, would be defeated in their quest2Ofor human dignity. As for the 
number of cases submitted in the courts for prosecution, I would say that it reflects the reality and it is 
considered to be high in comparison with the number of the UAE population. 
The National Abu Dhabi Media Company - Matt Slater 
Your Highness, you are Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE, Ruler of Dubai, 
founder of the famous Godolphin horse-racing stable, sportsman and poet. How do you 
juggle your political and non-political roles, and what do you do for fun? 
The day has 24 hours or 1,440 minutes, or 86,400 seconds. For me, this is sufficient time for work, hobbies and 
sports. It works if you respect time and you know how to organize your schedule. Whoever enjoys his work, it 
seems that you add five days to your week. I enjoy my work, which is my existence in my life: the service of my 
homeland and my people. My joy increases when I see the progress and prosperity of my homeland and my 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024938 
people. I do not work alone, I have a team whom I lead and encourage and on whom I rely. Within each human 
being there is an inexhaustible source of potential, but there is no human being with unlimited capacity. What is 
important is to know your capacities -- and how you should use them. 
For fun, I spend my time with my family at the beach or in the desert. I love to read. I ride horses. My love for 
horses is indescribably enormous; it is part of20my soul and history.

How are the Federal Government and the Government of Dubai cooperating to re-tool 
the development model to address what many economists predict is a permanent 
reduction in credit available from international capital markets 
Whether the available global credit declines or increases, the model of our economy is stable and is developing 
within the framework that we created earlier. Dubai's needs for credit tend to decline and the government's 
loans, which are modest, compared to the size of the economy, all concern investment in infrastructure, not 
current expenditures or operational budgets. The majority of our infrastructure projects are of a long-term 
productive nature, such as the Dubai Metro, the expansion of the power generation station, and so on. With 
regard to the loans of state-owned companies -- they are purely commercial in nature, and their calculations are 
based on the cost of the loan and the return on investment. The global financial crisis has affected the liquidity 
of the companies, and we believe that it is only a temporary impact. We have sufficient means to provide the 
necessary liquidity for these companies. I would like to stress that Dubai's economy is part of the UAE 
economy, and we cannot in any way deal with the situation as an independent entity. I will give you one 
example: We say Abu Dhabi banks, Dubai banks and Sharjah banks. These terms relate to the location of the 
headquarters only, since all banks operate in all the seven Emirates, and are subject to fiscal and monetary 
policy overseen by one body, and one central bank. In any case, credit is always available, and even a few 
months after the financial crisis, it had been available. Of course, this does not mean that all the available credit 
is desirable. This issue is a subject to extensive studies and discussions and to cost-benefit equations.

The question of population demography has been a source of worry to the UAE 
nationals, as it must certainly worry Your Highness. You have announced some 
initiatives in this regard, uncovering a few of them. Could you tell us more about these 
initiatives? 
This question is important because of its ramifications and interconnection of its economic, social, and cultural 
dimensions. His Highness the President of the UAE has defined our approach toward this question. He has said 
that we have a positive outlook toward the demographic structure, showing the ability of our people and state to 
mix this human quantity and variety in a human framework, capable of creating a model highlighting the power 
of human interaction in the process of building and raising our state to assume an advanced position on the level 
of civilization and development. Such a model will help us in gaining the respect and appreciation of local and 
in ternational organizations for our human and civilized treatment of all residents in our country, providing 
incentives for them to take active part in the development process of the UAE. 
This vision, as defined by His Highness the President, does not remove from our sight the necessity of 
preserving our national identity. This was the starting point which led to the formation of a high-level 
committee, headed by the minister of interior, to deal with the question of demographic structure. We highly 
appreciate the work of this committee, which drew out a number of initiatives to deal with this question and 
take active measures in this connection. We are preparing other measures and decisions within our declared and 
transparent policy for dealing with the question of demographic structure in a civilized manner, without 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024939 
violation of our human and international commitments, ensuring the objective of variation of the demographic 
structure in our country. 
Naturally, our children and new generations will remain the actual solution for this question. Hence, the 
development of education, the competencies and capabilities of the UAE nationals will remain our main 
priority. We are optimistic about our youth, and proud of their spirit of national belonging, of their growing 
realization of the importance of self-reliance and active participation in building the homeland. I follow their 
activities and expect a great deal from them, and ask them to double their efforts in learning and enhancing their 
competencies in various fields, in2Oorders to become a distinguished group eagerly sought after by public and 
private sectors. We are eager to increase the rate of Emiratization in government and private sectors. I informed 
the Cabinet last march that the rate of Emiratization in the ministries has not reached the targeted level, as it did 
not exceed 54 percent and 25 percent in the Federal Authorities. I gave directives to prepare a study to denote 
the reasons for such a situation in order to draw suitable programs to fill this gap. 
By Al-Sharq al-Awsat Daily 
Almost a year ago, Your Highness introduced a major reshuffle in the Cabinet. You 
mentioned that any minister is liable to change. Is there a plan for a cabinet reshuffle 
soon? 
There is a fact which should not be absent from the minds of people — that is, the government is at the service of 
the people. A reshuffle is introduced when there is a need for it, and when we find that it suits an active 
handling of the need of national demands, to ensure the power of the union to achieve the objectives of its 
strategy, and whatever objective that may come up to meet the actual developments. I still say that any minister 
or a man of responsibility entrusted with him is open to replacement by another one who is more capable of 
shouldering that responsibility. The basic reference in any decision of this type is the criteria of performance 
and level of fulfillment of plans for development projec ts.

Frankly, people outside the Emirates think there is a kind of sensitivity among the seven 
Emirates. With reference to the federal system adopted by the state, how do you respond 
to that? 
I do not understand what you mean by sensitivity and the relation of the word to the federal system. But I 
know the reason behind your question: it is the media reports which tried, in handling the reflections of the 
international financial crisis on the UAE, to place hurdles and fabricate differences between Abu Dhabi and 
Dubai. These are vicious attempts that ignored the way the UAE faced the repercussions of the global financial 
crisis and the superb performance of our federal entities, under the leadership of His Highness, the President of 
the UAE. The performance was excellent, and it presented a new proof of the capability and power of the 
federation to face difficult challenges. Anyhow, since you brought the subject up, it is useful to remind 
everybody that the seven Emirates chose the federal system, realizing that it is the most viable system to 
survive and develop. The founding fathers had wisdom, vision and a future perspective. Whoever knows the 
history of the area and its situation prior to the establishment of the union will realize the great achievement of 
the union in the establishment of the UAE. If the results are the test, then look at the advance and achievements 
of the UAE20after 37 years of the Union. The UAE is a state of institutions governed by a constitution, which 
covers the allocation of responsibilities to local and federal authorities. Like all federal states, the Federal 
government is concerned with all the sovereign affairs, whether related to defense policy, the armed forces, 
national security, foreign policy, and financial policy, legislations related to justice, economy, labor or 
residence of foreigners.

Among the most important historic achievements we take pride in is the building of the national Emirati identity 
which did not exist before the rise of the Union state. This identity settles deep down in the souls of all Emiratis, 
runs in their blood-veins, and fills them with feelings of dignity and loyalty to their country, the UAE. 
Every citizen and person of responsibility in the UAE puts his Emirati national sense of belonging above that of 
his own area. Basically there is no conflict, but integration, between the two. When a person introduces himself 
as coming from Abu Dhabi, Fujairah, or Dubai, he is not unlike an Egyptian who introduces himself as coming 
from Cairo, Asyut, or Alexandria, or a Saudi, who introduces himself as coming from Riyadh, Makkah, or 
Dammam. 
Unfortunately, some people who do not know the Emirates and the facts of life there, pass judgment on what 
they do not understand. We are, in the words of my brother Sheikh Khalifa, members in one body, strong and 
held together. There are no sensitivities among the Emirates, but t here is mutual cooperation and help within 
the one state, the one national identity; and at the same time, within the one state there is room for competition 
in the fields of good deeds achievement, excellence, and the service of the country and citizens. 
By Al-Sharq al-Awsat Daily 
Do you support increasing the scope of the federal government's authorities while 
decreasing those of local governments towards the overall welfare of the UAE? 
There is no conflict between the local and federal authorities. There are federal and local roles which are clearly 
articulated by the Constitution of the UAE. All sovereign issues fall within the jurisdiction of federal 
government, represented by His Highness, The President, Members of the UAE Supreme Council, The 
Cabinet, The Federal National Council, Federal Law. 
The federal government enjoys full authority to carry out its mandate articulated by the Constitution. Extended 
or limited scope of authority is not a theoretical issue. Meanwhile, promoting non-central governmental models 
and offering more authorities to local governments is now a growing trend in different parts of the world, even 
in single region state. Decentralization has proven quite successful in handling development requirements, 
enhancing government performance and increasing productivity of public organizations. 
In the UAE, we are very keen on ensuring complementary roles and responsibilities among ministries and 
federal authorities and2Othe local departments and establishments towards achieving highest government 
performance levels across the UAE.

In times of crises, Dubai always comes into the world's focus. Are you concerned by 
international reports highlighting Dubai's economic shortcomings during the global 
financial downturn? 
We are completely aware of our capabilities and we don't overestimate our abilities. Dubai's success in 
introducing a unique developmental model has gained remarkable international recognition. As you know, 
success implies a certain burden that cannot be avoided. The international focus on Dubai is absolutely normal. 
During crises, people usually turn their attention to those who have proven a successful track record. The 
current crisis has brought Dubai's developmental model with all its successes into a tough test. Some have 
speculated that Dubai will fail this test, simply because they do not know the UAE nor what Dubai has achieved 
based on solid foundation of knowledge, expertise and business ties across the globe. Dubai's achievements are 
part of the UAE's remarkable progress. I know that some people from outside the region have wished that 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024941 
Dubai model will go down the river. I am fully aware that some financial and economic circles were not happy 
with the progress we managed to achieve on various tracks including investment, aviation industry, IT and 
global competition in mana ging and financial markets. 
The UAE has proven remarkable competency in addressing difficult questions imposed by the global financial 
crisis. I strongly believe it won't be long before international focus will shift from what is claimed to be 
Dubai's shortcomings to Dubai's and the UAE's overall success in passing this difficult test.

Almost a year ago, and during your visit to Asia, you warned against the global financial 
crisis. Why precautionary measures have not been undertaken to avoid negative impacts 
of this crisis on both Dubai and UAE? 
The crisis have taken the whole world by surprise and evolved in tremendous pace. During my visit to Asia, I 
had warned against turmoil in financial and commodities markets, marginalizing the role of international 
financial institutions and potentials that these institutions fall short from fulfilling their expected roles in a 
world where all international markets became very much related, turning into one huge global market which 
does not follow any international rules, regulations or supervision. 
I had urged leading world economies to move swiftly and reconsider roles and mechanisms of international 
financial establishments and institutions, especially the International Monetary Fund -- and that what exactly 
the G20 summit did last month earlier this month. 
Regarding the precautionary measures, I believe that no preventive measures neither i n the UAE or any other 
country in the world, would have provided the desired immunity from the ramifications of the global financial 
meltdown. The UAE's solid economic structure, efficient performing establishments, adoption of a balanced 
model of conservative banking policies overseen by the Federal Central Bank and liberal economic approach, 
were the key elements that enhanced the country's ability to survive the negative implications of the global 
crisis and prevented any case of bankruptcy in any of the country's banks or major corporations. The impact of 
the crisis on our economy was significant during the last quarter of 2008, yet it was not as harsh as on other 
maj or economies. 
By Al-Sharq al-Awsat Daily 
Despite Dubai government officials repeated rebuffs of bailing out some companies to 
Abu Dhabi, speculations in that regard have never stopped. Isn't normal for the 
Emirates to cooperate among themselves to overcome such difficult times? 
Cooperation among the seven Emirates has never stopped and they don't wait for crises to show this 
cooperation. There are several joint ventures between Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Founders and stakeholders of 
most of the UAE Public Joint Stock companies are from Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi investors have huge 
investments in Dubai and vice versa. Dubai has always welcomed business and investments from across the 
UAE. 
Regarding the speculations you referred to in your question, they will always remain just speculations. I believe 
they are meant to be evil gossip as part of a vicious campaign against Dubai model. These speculations were not 
only refuted by Dubai government officials but also by His Highness the President of the UAE last March.

Do you believe that the UAE economy will contract this year? Or will it achieve certain 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024942 
growth? And at what percent? 
We are confident that our national establishments' abilities, combined with the economic measures undertaken 
by the government, will lead to economic growth this year. Yet, we expect that growth may not come at the 
same rate of pervious growth records we sustained over the past few years. While speculating global economic 
contraction of 0.5 percent, international financial bodies forecast a slight growth for the UAE economy. Other 
forecasts speculate a 3 percent growth for the UAE economy.

Maybe every cloud has a silver lining. The financial crisis has restored balance to the 
markets following years of inflation which posed a threat to Dubai's and the UAE's 
economies. Do you see this tough correction, for instance to the real estate market, a good 
solution to a problem that could have escalated in the future? 
Sometimes opportunities are born from the wombs of crises. The most important thing is to focus on the future 
and develop appropriate frameworks that guarantee highest levels of performance on heels of the crisis. 
Measures undertaken by the government on both local and federal levels will ensure that we shall emerge from 
the global financial crisis with least damage. The UAE has proven remarkable ability in facing and overcoming 
previous crises. Specialized committees and task forces are closely monitoring the development of the global 
crisis and analyzing its impacts on our economy and subsequently propose action plans to resiliently cope with 
these ongoing changes.

Many rumors are targeting Dubai claiming it has turned into a ghost city and that tens of 
thousands are being laid off every week. Don't you feel upset about these rumors and the 
way the impact of the crisis has been perceived outside Dubai? 
Actually, we don't pay attention to rumors and our response always comes in actions rather than words. As a 
matter of fact, Dubai visitors these days are surprised by these rumors and I've met with many of them recently 
and they expressed their amazement at Dubai's traffic jams, overbooked hotels and crowded markets. 
Dubai's success -- which it has sustained over the past years -- is the true reason behind this type of mixed 
reports. Those who spread such rumors -- are they aware of the fact that global nature of Dubai makes it more 
sub ject to impacts of global changes than any other city? We totally endorse freedom of expression but we 
always urge responsible freedom that promotes principles of integrity and objectivity. 
It is truly sad to find international publications that have usually boasted about factual and precise reporting 
issuing articles based on mere rumors and baseless speculations. We are fully aware of the hidden fierce global 
economic competition between different parties who are in the same line of business. When a city or a country 
decides to integrate itself as an effective international player, it should not expect an easy journey full of roses 
and good wishes. 
Do you know how many major international airlines are closely monitoring Emirates' performance? Do you 
think that international port services companies are happy with the success accomplished by DP World in 
managing and operating dozens of ports around Europe, Asia and Africa? Do you expect international financial

important financial markets in the world?

I will tell you more. Emirates Airlines' successful model has not led only to achieving an internationally 
recognition but also has induced the launch of other Arab airlines that followed the same model. Emirates has 
encouraged many established Arab airlines to enhance their fleets and upgrade their services. This has 
ultimately led to increasing Arab airlines' share of the in ternational travel market. Leading by example, 
Emirates has set new benchmarks for quality services not only regionally but also internationally. One can only 
gain world recognition by proving success and ability to take the initiative, yet this recognition may not 
necessarily reflect acceptance.

There is no doubt that good planning is one of the key factors behind the success of the 
UAE, backed by the close monitoring of the ongoing challenges and opportunities. In 
your plans, what are the challenges that you foresee? What is the country's level of 
readiness to address them? 
Humans face challenges throughout their lives. Through commitment to proper planning of projects and 
programmes, and following up on their implementation, challenges can be successfully addressed. It is also 
crucial to anticipate challenges without ignoring any possibility. Yet, there are some unforeseen challenges that 
originate remotely but influence us -- as in the global financial crisis that erupted in the United States and 
spread to the economies of developed countries and the rest of the world. One must be prepared to effectively 
deal with the implications of such challenges to one's country, economy and security. We, in the UAE, are 
aware of the challenges that we face and are always prepared for the worst, and are also willing to face 
whatever unforeseen developments regardless of their magnitude and im pact.

You have always stressed that the main challenge facing the Arab world, is that of the 
development of human resources in the knowledge era. Do you believe that the current 
education systems are equipped to prepare a new generation that is able to face this 
challenge and How? 
I am not in a position to assess the efficiency of the Arab educational institutions. But a common concern across 
the Arab world is the poor education systems at both school and university levels. The international rankings of 
the Arab universities are unsatisfactory to both the keen learners as well as the academic institutions. 
Yes, the main challenge facing the Arab world is the challenge of human development in the era of knowledge. 
Without the development of strong education systems, we will not easily achieve the desired development. 
Despite the importance of the state's role in the development of education, the development effort is the 
responsibility of society as a whole; the State must lead these efforts and involve the broadest segments of 
society. Isn't strange that we approach the second decade of the third millennium with the average percentage 
of illiteracy in the Arab world more than 30 percent?

Amid the growing global crisis and in the latest G20=2 Osummit, many were demanding a 
re-consideration of the global economic system, and declaring the failure the entire 
system of capitalism. Would the United Arab Emirates -- with its regional and 
international reach -- consider a new financial direction, such as the Islamic banking 
system as a substitute, even temporarily, to the current global economic system — which is 
currently deteriorating? 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024944 
The United Arab Emirates, on its own or through the GCC, the Arab League and the specialized international 
institutions, plays an integral role on this front. The capitalist system did not fail. What has failed is the 
excessive economic liberalism, which pushed to minimize the intervention of the regulatory government 
institutions in the markets and banks' activities. 
Certainly the world is witnessing the birth of a new economic and financial order. The results of the G20 
summit are a prelude toward this end. However, consensus on the format and the content of this new global 
economic system would not be reached soon. Different factors determine the future of this system, including 
growing global competition and conflicting national economic interests. No party would easily give up its 
position and gains for the benefit of the global economy recovery. 
As for the suggestion on the Islamic banking, it is of interest to the global banking sector. However, to be a 
substitute to the current economic systems, even if only temporarily, is a much more complex approach, which 
relates to the nature of economic systems, the size of the economies of nations, and the size of Islamic banks in 
the banking sector worldwide. As you are aware, there are a lot of factors that govern this, such as the 
distribution of the economic, military, scientific and social powers in the world, as well as the competitive 
nature of civilizations, and the strong links between the civilizations and religions.

There are many other positive aspects of the global financial crisis which were embodied 
in refining the current competencies, reviewing the need for expatriate expertise, and 
strengthening the bonds of the federal entities that supported the UAE. In your opinion, 
what are the lessons learned from this crisis both on the local and federal level? 
There are many lessons to be learned from the crisis, the most important one being the assertion of the state's 
role in regulating and monitoring the overall economy and markets, and confirming the fact of the global 
economy's unity, in addition to the unification of the global market. The widening scope of the crisis, which 
includes all parts of the world, confirms this unity and the common international pursuit. In addition, President 
Obama's public statement, which verifies that the United States cannot overcome the global crisis on its own, is 
further confirmation of the unity of the economy and the market. Other lessons learned from the=2 Ocrisis is 
realizing the urgent need to develop the regulations, terms of reference and working mechanisms of 
international financial institutions to be commensurate with the unified markets and economies, and the 
involvement of many influential players. 
In the United Arab Emirates, we perform a wide range of reviews through specialized federal and local 
committees which are well aware that within the challenges of the crisis, remain many opportunities. The first 
opportunity to be seized is to benefit from the lessons learned from the crisis, and be prepared to deal efficiently 
with the world after the crisis; a world completely different than what it was before. As for the forces of federal 
entities, the fact is that the strength of these entities is what enabled them to cope with the crisis and contain its 
negative effects.

Your Highness, you asked the Ministry of Finance last year to prepare the federal budget 
of the State 2009. The early announcement prior to the global economic crisis has 
resulted in a deficit-free budget. Would the global crisis have implications on the 2010 
budget, particularly with regard to the basic needs of Emirati citizens? 
In the last three years, the federal budget was issued early and before entering the new fiscal year. The 
submission of the budget for 2009 without a deficit is because its main provisions have not been affected by the 
global financial crisis. I also do not think that 2010 budget will be affected. We still have seven months for the 
year to end, and in my opinion this is quite a long period -- we may see by the end of it some positive indicators 
that would help in accelerating the recovery of the global economy.

There are those who say that the senior positions in Dubai are granted to a few selected

Though we realize this fact, the Council of Ministers has lately decided to establish the Emirates Council for 
Competitiveness. Its task is to develop strategies and suggest policies and legal frameworks that can support the

In the first quarter oft his year, accelerating economic events have generated pessimism 
about the future of the global economy and its growth. There are conflicting reports in 
the assessment of the national economy, and we read some of the studies questioning the 
continuation of Western-style development plans and their future in the region in light of 
declining oil prices and the global crisis. What is the assessment of Your Highness on the 
national economy today, can it be maintained at the level of growth in the light of the 
retreat of oil prices? What is the policy that the UAE will use with regard to the latest 
developments of the global financial crisis? 
Our economy is strong and its potential lies in its great diversity. The proportion of oil in the UAE 's GDP is less 
than 30 percent, and this reduces the impact of oil price fluctuations on the national economy. I agree with you 
regarding the presence of many pessimistic reports on the world economy, but it's an exaggerated and 
unrealistic pessimism. Countries with the largest economies are seriously committed to rehabilitating the 
economy, while the summit of the Group of Twenty came out with encouraging results after meeting in London 
recently. Our hope is to commit ourselves to the implementation of all decisions. In fact, the negative vibrations 
will decrease, and will be substituted by cautious optimism. As for the levels of growth, few states in the world 
are likely to maintain high levels of growth recorded in recent years. We in the UAE wi 11 achieve economic 
growth rates lower than those recorded in previous years.

Attracting foreign investment was among the priorities of the UAE. Today, the flight of 
foreign investors from the UAE is widely discussed in the media, and is supported by 
both local and official reports. Does Your Highness really think that our national 
economy's dependence on foreign investment leads to future risks? In the frequent talk 
about the global financial crisis, does Your Highness have new plans to strengthen, 
develop or restore foreign investments to the country? 
We cannot use the term flight of foreign investors because there has been no flight. What happened exactly 
is the drought of liquidity across the world immediately after the collapse of the American investment bank, 
Lehman Brothers, which marked the beginning of the global financial crisis. However, with this drought, the 
compilation of available sources of liquidity became the primary concern of investors, banks, and financial 
institutions throughout the world. Sizeable withdrawals, deposits and liquefaction of all financial centers 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024947 
occurred in the capital markets in the world. 
With regard to your point that the attraction of foreign investment has been among the priorities of economic 
mobility in the UAE; it is an inaccurate assumption. Investment plans have no limits or boundaries. There are 
foreign investments in the UAE, and the=2 OUAE in its turn has countless investments in many regions of the 
world. Investments imply promising opportunities in a favorable environment. This is what attracted foreign 
investment to the UAE, and the investment environment remains favorable in the UAE; the opportunities are 
still promising, and the UAE is still the most important regional center for business and international trade. 
Today, it is more promising than ever before, and the advent of smart investors to the UAE has not stopped.

Security and profit are two very important concepts for the investor, and it is known 
that the UAE has been a breeding ground for the development of capital in recent years. 
This was reflected on the arrival of the most prominent businessmen, major companies 
and famous brands to the country. The active UAE financial market contributed to the 
success of many companies, which turned into public joint stock companies, with billions 
of dirhams having been pumped into their capital. This means that thousands of 
investors were involved in the ownership of shares. Recently, however, we have witnessed 
legal and financial issues involving prominent names of UAE nationals. What does Your 
Highness have to say with regard to the investment community in the UAE on the 
capacity of governmental oversight of corporate governance and management of the 
shareholders and their rights? 
These legal issues are evidence of firm government2Oconcern about good corporate governance and its 
commitment to sound accounting principles, rules of governance and transparency. The government is 
constantly working to develop bodies, procedures and safeguards. No one is above the law in the UAE, and 
whoever crosses the line will be sought by judicial authorities and legally tried.

Emirate stated that there is no current need for the rest of the money. Does this mean that 
the Government of Dubai has closed the doors for new subscription to a second tranche? 
Will support be provided by the Government of Dubai for the companies as a grant? 
The doors to subscription have not been shut down. The subscriptions so far meet our requirements. The 
support given to companies is not a grant, because its origin is the bill, and companies possess productive assets 
that enable them to meet all the requirements. The problem of these companies is part of the liquidity problem

Your Highness, you have put Emiratization on top of the country's development 
priorities. Over the years, the UAE population has grown significantly to the extent that 
expat residents have become absolute majority. Meanwhile, number of private sector 
companies has significantly increased as well. How do you see this impacting the UAE 
nationals' job opportunities? Do you believe it might be necessary to expand the 
Emiratization plan to cover a larger portion of the private sector companies? 
The Emiratization plan is primarily based on training and qualifying UAE nationals, equipping them with all 
necessary tools and competencies a nd supporting them to confidently compete in the job market. I am positive 
that most of the private sector companies prefer to recruit UAE nationals as part of their Corporate Social 
Responsibilities. Also salaries of UAE nationals — however high they may appear to be - are far less than those 
of expats. Employing a UAE national will open the door for more interaction with government departments and 
local customers, who are eventually the highest spenders. If some companies fall short of their responsibilities 
toward the local workforce, then the government will intervene through a set of measures and incentives to 
encourage these companies to live up to the expected level of responsibility. 
By Ro'ya Al Iqtesadiah newspaper 
Many countries have applauded the UAE's hospitality and praised the level of respect it 
shows to the expat communities and the freedom it offers them to lead their business and 
social lives in perfect ease. This encouraged many expats to reside in the UAE for long 
period of time, evolving the same habits and traditions of the local community as well as 
significant loyalty to this country. Some of those expats felt optimistic about recent 
announcements made by some real estate companies that property buyers in certain 
projects in Dubai or Ajman will be offered permanent UAE residency. Other 
companies have completely closed the door of speculation regarding the same issue. How 
does the government perceive=2 Othe Permanent Residency promise? And are there 
any eventual plans to adopt it in the UAE? 
Offering residency is absolutely far beyond the jurisdiction of any real estate company. It is a sovereign issue 
governed by laws and regulations. But I wonder if one buys property in London, Paris, Cairo, or Beirut does this 
mean obtaining a permanent residency there? We are very keen to ensure convenient conditions for expat 
property owners. However, we will be issuing a new law that includes a long multi-visit permit soon.

Some Western media are trying to defame the UA E either through exaggerating the 
impact of the economic downturn on Dubai, or through inaccurate reports such as 
Human Rights Watch's on the Media Law in the UAE. What do you think are the reasons 
behind such campaigns? And what is your response to these campaigns? 
We don't care who stands behind such campaigns, but rather pay attention to the content of these reports either 
issued by media or international nongovernmental organizations. We deal with such reports with absolute 
objectivity -- for example when producers of these reports express their wish to visit the UAE and meet

I am very pleased with the results, and I am confident we are on the right track. Everybody will recognise 
shortly the encouraging indicators of the economic recovery. 
PAUL STOBER, Gulf News 
If it became necessary, what further steps of support would the government consider for 
the financial services and property industries? Would the government consider 
extending support to other important industries in the UAE, like tourism? If so, what 
form might this take? 
The measures we have undertaken so far have shifted the UAE economy from the crisis mood to the solution 
mood. Not one country in the world, regardless of what efficient systems it boasts, could have ensured recovery 
from the financial crisis before recognising its actual impact on the global economy and international markets. 
No one could predict ensuring recovery before the world's leading economies consolidates their efforts to face 
the crisis. That actually took several months of constant work. Now, optimistic voices are getting louder 
worldwide, while markets' fear has started to gradually diminish. 
The UAE has one of the region's most progressive, vibrant and open economies. Efforts by world leading 
economies to deal with the financial crisis have been effective and fruitful, while the tendency to increase 
international cooperation — including recent decisions by the G20 summit in London — remains very positive 
and encouraging. I can confidently say that the UA E is very well positioned on the recovery path, thanks to our 
domestic policy measures — such as the fiscal stimulus, easing monetary policy, and increasing liquidity in the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024950 
system. There are some early indicators of international economic recovery. Yet, I cannot predict that the 
global economic recovery will proceed without potential hurdles. I cannot also claim that repercussions of the 
economic financial meltdown are over yet. But what I can say is that the worst is already behind us, and there is 
now a solid will and determination among concerned countries to join hands to collectively revive the global 
economy as well as their own individual economies. 
Increasing financial support to other business sectors is probable, pending the actual needs of each particular 
sector. The UAE's tourism sector is in a good shape, with UAE hotels recording high occupancy rates. The 
country's tourism industry has already successful survived the worst period and resiliently adapted itself during 
the most critical times. 
PAUL STOBER, Gulf News 
What are the main strengths and weaknesses of the UAE, as it faces the challenge of the 
global economic slowdown? What are the particular challenges that Dubai faces as it 
positions itself as a global business centre? 
The UAE's strengths are numerous. The UAE's success in facing the global financial crisis and alleviating its 
impact on the Emirati economy is the most conspicuous=2 Oevidence of these strengths. The country enjoys a 
leading ranking position in several fields such as productivity, environment, connectivity, and transformation 
to knowledge economy. Yet the failure to match best international practices in these fields might be considered 
a major weakness. We always benchmark ourselves against the best. I always say that we have just embarked 
on a long journey of hard work to fulfil our promised sustainable development through a series of strategic 
projects to be established during the years to come. 
DURAID AL BAIK, Gulf News: 
Do you feel that Dubai needs an efficient auditing body to investigate and curb 
corruption in financial institutions before things become too bad? How more the UAE 
can move faster in fighting corruption and promoting transparency? 
There is already a government financial audit department. The department has a track record of successful 
performance, and it has done very well with investigations related to corruption cases. Enhancing financial 
auditing systems and capabilities is undoubtedly important and that is exactly what we are doing now. As for 
promoting transparency in fighting corruption, I confirm that the UAE is completely committed to highest 
levels of transparency. There is no room for corrupt officials and citizens among us. Handling corruption cases 
does not mean prosecuting judging and penalising corrupt individuals only; it also aims at filling all 
administrative and legal loopholes that=2 Ohave been used to breach the law.

When will the term remote (rural) areas disappear from the everyday vocabulary of 
the UAE? 
The UAE does not have remote areas in the negative connotation of the word. We only have areas that are 
relatively remote from urban centers. The urban planning of these areas has to be based on scientific research to 
carefully identify means of providing best efficient services to local residents. 
There are sometimes exaggerated reports depicting these areas as if they are utterly deprived of basic services 
while their residents live in appalling conditions. Sometimes, one reads press reports demanding a school to be 
built in an area that has no more than 50 homes, while there is a school only few kilometers away with available 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024951 
means of transportation for the students. 
I've personally toured most of these areas across the country, and I was very keen on visiting particular areas 
and schools that were the focus of the media. I discovered that the situation on ground is often completely 
different from the picture presented by the media. Of course, these areas need to be given more attention -- and 
this is exactly what the government has committed itself to since its first day in office. The government efforts 
in that regard are in line with the directives of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of 
the UAE.

Are there any practical measures undertaken by the government to address the issue of 
the population imbalance? What about offering incentives to the UAE nationals to have 
more children? 
The government has embarked on certain measures which have been announced earlier and carried by the 
media. The committee in charge of the population issues is working quietly and in a very effective manner. The 
UAE Government Strategy has identified a major direction for developing particular steps to address the 
population imbalance issue. One of the strategies the UAE government has identified to address this issue 
involves focusing on Emiratization through well-planned policy based on combining federal and local efforts. 
Incentives for the UAE nationals to have more children are already in place. UAE nationals are offered several 
incentives either in terms of services, benefits, salary increments or other privileges for their children. The 
UAE government has paid special attention to offering UAE nationals all possible incentives.

Some peop le believe that you put more trust in youth rather than veterans to lead Dubai 
organizations. What is your comment on this view? 
I've trusted, and I will continue to trust well-qualified and experienced youth. If youth are not empowered and 
given full opportunities, how expertise and new leaderships will be built? 
In the meantime, I don't know which age signifies youth. Are they below the age of 35 or 40? If a person who 
has spent 10 or 20 years in his/her workplace and still has not developed any experience, can he/she be 
categorized as youth? How many years one should spend at work to gain experience -- should we say 5 or 10? 
The world has changed. Knowledge is now accessible to everybody. Training and development programmes 
are also available for those who seek to develop themselves and opt to enhance their competencies to ensure 
successful future career path. Young leaders' development programmes are also available for all UAE 
nationals who prove themselves worthy through tests carried out by an independent body. 
We look high at our national expertise, both young and veteran. I will continue to explore and discover young 
talent and offer them full opportunities and push them to assume leading positions.

How do you evaluate the experience of the women whom you empowered to assume

proven that the UAE woman is completely reliable and worthy of trust in all leadership and non-leadership

What was the response of the UAE health authorities following your direct criticism of 
doctors' professional competencies and your urging that medical services across the 
country be enhanced? 
There has been remarkable progress in quality of health care services, which still fall short of our expectations. 
I totally appreciate that pulling together loose ends to rectify mixed processes accumulated over long years 
takes time. Yet, efforts are now underway to develop the healthcare sector and work is progressing in the right 
direction. Competition resulting from the growing presence of private healthcare organizations has reflected 
positively on the overall medical performance in the country. I believe all private=2 Oand public sector doctors 
will live up to international best practices very soon.

There has been increasing federalism in the handling of the financial needs of the 
Emirates, which has been hailed as a good step forward. How do you see this evolving in 
future? 
The UAE follows unified legislative, financial and fiscal systems. Federal authorities, led by the UAE Central 
Bank and the Ministry of Finance, assume full responsibility of developing and implementing these systems. 
Measures adopted by the UAE government in response to the global financial crisis only reflect conditions of 
the UAE market, which has been around for the last 35 years since the Fiscal Council was first established. The 
UAE government's swift action to address impacts of the global financial crisis has amazed many people. It is 
important to remember that the UAE's response to previous crises, such as the real-estate crisis of the early 
1980s, has always been carried out at the federal level. The increased federalism that you refer to in your 
question is yet another proof that the federation is getting stronger.

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024953

Issuing the first amendment of a law usually takes some time. Rushing things may lead to undesired 
consequences while delay reflects unnecessary bureaucracy. The pace of passing new amendments to laws 
bound by international agreements and world systems — for example, the Companies Law -- is determined by 
the progress of these agreements. Several important international agreements, including a significant number 
involving the World Trade Organization, are still not ripe. Yet, we are very keen on passing or amending any 
laws if necessary to strike a healthy balance between our local interests and our commitments to international 
trade and fmance organizations.

Speculation about the dirham's peg to the United States dollar keep flowing back out. 
What value do you see in keeping the peg in the sh ort term and the long term? Is there 
any move to change the structure or composition of the peg? 
Governed by strict banking principles and guidelines, the UAE Central Bank is taking care of the issue of 
dirham's peg to international currencies. The US dollar's devaluation against the Euro and the pound-sterling 
during the past few years has triggered several debates about economic threats posed by the dirham's peg to the 
dollar. Today, after the dollar's significant gains against other international currencies, we can barely hear these 
voices. 
There are no absolute wins or absolute2Oloses to pegging a local currency to a single foreign currency or a 
currency basket. Decisions are always determined in light of the size of benefits.

One of the many effective measures taken by the UAE Government to deal with the 
fallout of the global financial crisis has been to maintain or increase spending on 
infrastructure projects, even if this leads to a deficit budget. Would the UAE be 
comfortable with a deficit budget for the first time in many years? Would you 
immediately put in place measures to wipe out the deficit (if that happens) in the next 
year? What such measures would you consider? 
This is a hypothetical question. Actually, we evaluate all possible scenarios and we are very keen on endorsing 
a deficit-free budget. Yet I can read between the lines of your question about potential measures to face budget 
deficit. My reply is: No Income Taxes.

The public relations image of UAE and Dubai is being taken to task in sections of the 
Western press. What is the official strategy of UAE going to be to counter this? 
Our strategy in that regard is very consistent, as we strongly believe in the sanctity of truth. Our commitment to 
transparency is unequivocal and unquestioned. Our ultimate response to these reports can be seen in our 
relentless efforts and ongoing success. The life sp an of lies is always short. 
We have been very transparent with all measures undertaken over the past few months to counter the impact of 
the global financial crisis. Senior government officials have spoken openly about the current situation, 
highlighting key facts and figures -- including the actual size of the debts by both the government and 
government affiliated companies.

His Highness the President of the UAE has also openly clarified different dimensions of the crisis's impact on 
the UAE economy. Despite all that, some people in the media have continued to weave rumors and negative 
speculation into their articles. We welcome all media from around the globe and we have never silenced any 
resident or visiting reporters or stopped them from doing their job. 
We shall continue to do the same because of our confidence in ourselves, our economy and our measures -- and 
because we always believe deep in our hearts that truth prevails. Yet our self-confidence does not stop us from 
dialogue with the media to offer them straightforward information. We urge them to adhere to professional 
integrity, objectivity, and fair scrutiny and use of information.

There has been some contraction in business volumes in the UAE over the last few 
months. The harshest effect of this seems to have been on small and medium-sized 
enterprises. Is there any plan to revitalize the small business sector, which is usually co 
nsidered the growth engine of an economy? 
We are fully aware of the vital role of the small and medium enterprises sector; I believe that the contraction it 
has suffered is only temporary. Our success in overcoming the worst will positively reflect on the overall 
economy, including major enterprises as well as small and medium-sized ones. Our position is far better than 
other countries, and encouraging economic indicators have just started to emerge. Enhanced liquidity levels 
across the banking sector, banks' resumption of credit operations, increased number of investors eager to seize 
investment opportunities in the real estate sector and financial markets, are among many other positive and 
encouraging indicators.

By the end of the first quarter of 2009, what is your evaluation of the economic

performance of the UAE in light of the financial crisis? What is the UAE government's 
strategy to raise the national economy, and emerge from the financial crisis stronger than 
before? How do you respond to the unfair and hateful rumors that Dubai has turned into 
a ghost city? 
The performance of our economy in the first quarter of this year proves that we are on the way out of the crisis, 
and that we are on the right track. Our economy will resume its health faster than other economies, but the 
speed of that=2 Oresumption is not governed only by the strength of our economy and its abundant resources. 
The speed will also be influenced by developments in the international economy — including the measures of 
revival in the grouping of industrialized states known as the G-20, whose role in international trade movement 
is about 90 percent of the total international trade, and whose GDP is about 60 percent of the entire world GDP. 
The speed of general recovery will also be influenced by the capability of international measures connected 
with monitoring markets, and the role, functions and work mechanisms of international financial institutions, 
especially the International Monetary Fund. I am optimistic that good implementation of the decisions of G-20 
and the International Monetary Fund will speed up the recovery of the global economy.

Sometime ago, several Western papers published unfair reports about the UAE, claiming 
human right violations of foreign labor in the UAE, and the lack of free elections in the 
UAE, etc. What do you think of these allegations? What do you think is the reason behind 
spreading such malicious reports? 
They may write whatever they like, and play the tunes that please them. We are not annoyed by criticism, nor 
do we fear campaigns. They have their models, experience, values, standards, their cultural and intellectual 
frames of references. We have our models, values, st andards and frames of references. We are open to the 
entire human experience in every field. We learn from them, but we will never import ready-made models. We 
do not accept that, and our society does not accept this. As for the allegations about foreign labor, it is an old 
theme, repeated every now and then. Yes, certain sectors of foreign labor are not in the state we like or hope. 
But we are steadily improving that state, and we are making progress every year. For years, the talk about 
foreign labor has not ceased. Such talk is open to all and to the countries that provide such labor. Despite that, 
millions are trying to come to work in our country. So, why do those foreign countries don't stop their citizens 
from coming to work in the UAE if the work situation is such as these nasty reports claim?

The UAE is facing a regional and global media campaign that questions its ability to 
overcome the global financial crisis. How does Your Highness evaluate such campaigns? 
What are the tools and the initiatives with which to respond, including the development 
of local media? 
Action is louder than words. Our achievements and hard work would be the response to these campaigns. The 
UAE is immune to such campaigns, and questioning of its ability to continue developing a strong federation is 
not going to yield anything. When we established the UAE federation, we faced analysis and speculation 
campaigns, questioning our ability to sustain the Federation and ensure its success. Similarly, the launch of 
every major project was met with uncertainty and rumors from media campaigns. All these campaigns are 
history now and their promoters have been proven to be wrong. 
As for your suggestion of responding to these campaigns with tools and initiatives, including the development 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024956 
of local media, our response is to continue on our path of hard work and to highlight our achievements. 
Ongoing development has always and will remain a key objective to our local media; however, we will not 
allow anyone to drag us to media confrontations. Our policies and procedures are clear, transparent, and always 
in the end, truth will prevail and will defeat all rumors. 
Al Emarat Al Youm: 
The UAE government has taken notable measures in combating corruption, referring 
senior officials to court. Are there further steps the government intends to undertake in 
the same regards? And does Your Highness believe that an independent watchdog body 
might be needed to audit governmental and semi-governmental organizations? 
The UAE has efficient independent watchdog bodies that include the federal State Audit Institution, as well as 
local auditing departments. I've visited the State Audit Institution lately where I was updated on its activities. 
I've given directives to revamp its systems and provide all necessary tools to enhance its performance. Sy 
stems and processes of the Dubai Financial Audit Department are also being reviewed and enhanced. Besides, 
there are other auditing bodies that operate under the Rulers' Courts across the seven Emirates. 
Al Emarat Al Youm: 
Your Highness received His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the 
President of the UAE, in Dubai last week, and escorted His Highness on a tour that 
included key landmark developments across the Emirate. What was the significance of 
this visit? 
I meet with His Highness Sheikh Khalifa on regular basis. We are companions on our journey of development, 
and he is our Leader and our President. Dubai is his home and he is most welcome at anytime. The visit comes 
in line with His Highness' ongoing follow up on development efforts across the seven Emirates. He is always 
keen on meeting his people across the country to listen to their views and ensure their own welfare. 
As a matter of fact, all His Highness visits to Dubai are important. His latest visit was significantly important as 
he toured Dubai's new landmarks, expressing his satisfaction at Dubai's milestone achievements. He was also 
very keen on visiting Dar Al Ittihad (the Union House) where establishment of the United Arab Emirates 
federation was proclaimed. The visit was in honor of this remarkable achievement.

would be something quite different from the America we have known. Far from being
abhorrent, invidious and irrelevant, racial and ethnic classifications would be officially
sanctioned and recognized in all walks of life; each professional or office holder would be
regarded, and would regard himself, as a representative of the group from whose quota he
comes; and individual aspiration would be limited by the proportionate size of the group
to which the individual belongs.

We argued in favor of individualized preferences based on actual experiences:

If individual blacks applying to Davis Medical School have suffered economic hardship
because they encountered discrimination, attended segregated schools or lived in
segregated neighborhoods, these facts could be brought to the attention of the Admission
Committee and their records evaluated accordingly. Any other system of preferences
based on mere membership in a group which, because of its color or physiognomy, has
suffered discrimination can only result in a society in which race consciousness and
partisanship become the significant operative forces and race prejudice, rather than being
minimized, is legitimated.

We quoted several Black leaders, such as Roy Wilkins, who opposed proportional representation:

... It is ridiculous for Negroes to claim that because they are 40 percent of the
population, they should have 40 percent of the jobs, 40 percent of the elected offices, etc.

This is self-defeating nonsense, for no person of ability wants to be limited in his horizons
by an arbitrary quota or wants to endure unqualified people in positions that they fill only
because of a numerical racial quota.

... Such practices and, in fact, the whole black-tilted system are doing no favors to Negro
applicants. God knows it is true that the cards have been deliberately stacked against
blacks. Every feasible step, even those costing extra money, should be taken to correct
this racialism.

But there must not be a lowering of standards. Negroes need to insist on being among the
best, not on being the best of the second- or third-raters. . . .

We urged the Court to require the medical school to develop an affirmative action program that
was compatible with the dream of a color blind America:

Schools may and, we think, should evaluate both grades and test scores in the light of a
candidate's background; whether he came from a culturally impoverished home; the nature
and quality of the schools he attended; whether family circumstances required him to work
while attending school; whether he chose to participate in athletics, the orchestra, school
newspaper, literary magazine, campus government; whether he had demonstrated a

Von Neumann and Turing posed their questions as theoretical studies, because it
was beyond the technology of their day to realize them. But with the convergence of
communication and computation with fabrication, these investigations are now becoming
accessible experimentally. Making an assembler that can assemble itself from the parts
that it’s assembling is a focus of my lab, along with collaborations to develop synthetic
cells.

The prospect of physically self-reproducing automata is potentially much scarier
than fears of out-of-control AI, because it moves the intelligence out here to where we
live. It could be a roadmap leading to Terminator’s Skynet robotic overlords. But it’s
also a more hopeful prospect, because an ability to program atoms as well as bits enables
designs to be shared globally while locally producing things like energy, food, and
shelter—all of these are emerging as exciting early applications of digital fabrication.
Wiener worried about the future of work, but he didn’t question implicit assumptions

creation.

History suggests that neither utopian nor dystopian scenarios prevail; we
generally end up muddling along somewhere in between. But history also suggests that
we don’t have to wait on history. Gordon Moore in 1965 was able to use five years of the
doubling of the specifications of integrated circuits to project what turned out to be fifty
years of exponential improvements in digital technologies. We’ve spent many of those
years responding to, rather than anticipating, its implications. We have more data
available now than Gordon Moore did to project fifty years of doubling the performance
of digital fabrication. With the benefit of hindsight, it should be possible to avoid the
excesses of digital computing and communications this time around, and, from the outset,
address issues like access and literacy.

If the maker movement is the harbinger of a third digital revolution, the success of
AI in meeting many of its own early goals can be seen as the crowning achievement of
the first two digital revolutions. Although machine making and machine thinking might
appear to be unrelated trends, they lie in each other’s futures. The same scaling trends
that have made AI possible suggest that the current mania is a phase that will pass, to be
followed by something even more significant: the merging of artificial and natural
intelligence.

It was an advance for atoms to form molecules, molecules to form organelles,
organelles to form cells, cells to form organs, organs to form organisms, organisms to
form families, families to form societies, and societies to form civilizations. This grand
evolutionary loop can now be closed, with atoms arranging bits arranging atoms.

Fauver, spokeswoman for Cover Oregon, the state agency implementing the law there.

In California, which has the nation’s largest uninsured population, health officials have begun hinting that they may havea
similar problem.

“It's a complex system, and there’s a lot of navigation that needs to happen,” said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for Covered
California. He said the agency will know by early September whether the system will be ready in time.

If not, he said, customers will still be able to log on to the Web site and peruse insurance plans and view prices. When they
get to the final step, however, they will not be able to sign up. They will have to contact a customer service representative to
complete the final enrollment step.

Officials with the District of Columbia’s Health Link decided to put off building a Spanish version of its Web site until later this
year, giving its staff bandwidth to complete other tasks they see more critical to the launch.

Until then, the District will have bilingual call-center workers and in-person helpers who will be able to help Spanish speakers
navigate the site.

The hiccups are troubling to advocates, who worry that there will be mistakes that result in people being erroneously
rejected by Medicaid or denied subsidies to which they are entitled. They are concerned that impediments will discourage
the uninsured from signing up for coverage.

“There will be something up and running, but there will be serious, serious difficulties with it” that could result in delays and
errors initially, said Robert H. Bonthius Jr., a lawyer at the Legal Aid Society of Cleveland. “It’s an extremely ambitious
program, well-intentioned, that is going to be very difficult to accomplish, and it’s going to be months and maybe years
before it really gets sorted out.”

Much of the difficulty stems from the information the federal government needs to determine who qualifies for which health-
law program, including data on citizenship, income, residence and employment. State systems will need to communicate
seamlessly with a federal data hub that pulls in information from the Department of Homeland Security and the Internal
Revenue Service, among others.

President Obama has predicted “bumps” and “glitches” in the initial launch of the exchanges. Health and Human Services
Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has acknowledged a very tight time frame that has required the government to test the hub in
imperfect conditions, but she has said it will still launch on time.

“Ideally what you would do if you were building a data hub that needs this kind of information, you’d put a piece together and
test that. You test it, if you will, sequentially,” she said in an interview. “We have to build and test simultaneously. ... It’s a big
operational issue, but all systems are a go for the first of October.”

Sixteen states decided to build their own health-insurance marketplaces, with the rest leaving all or much of the task to the
federal government. Those states are now in the process of, or have completed, testing to share data back and forth with the
data hub.

“There were times when the hub had to be taken offline. .. . So we couldn't test until they got it back online,” said Jon Hager,
executive director of Nevada’s Silver State Health Insurance Exchange. “But | think the end result, and everything I’ve seen,

says it will be ready.”

Hager has invested significant time preparing contingency plans for his state, including one for a situation in which the
federal data hub does not work, though he said he believes that to be a relatively unlikely scenario.

“If there’s a new rule, that could throw us into a quandary,” Hager said. “You could have, | don’t know, a disaster ora fire. |
think we’ve got backup and contingency plans for everything.”

The federal government handles all testing of these connections for states that did not build a portal and chose instead to

Scarola) and Dershowitz’s extended answer are quoted in full— including Dershowitz’s
reference to the oral sex allegation that he now argues this Court should treat as “confidential”:

Q. [Y]ou [are] aware that years before December of 2014, when the
CVRA pleading was filed, that your name had come up repeatedly in
connection with Jeffrey Epstein’s abuse of minors, correct? . . .

A. Let me answer that question. I am aware that never before 2014,
end of December, was it ever, ever alleged that I had acted in any
way inappropriately with regard to Virginia [Giuffre], that I ever
touched her, that I ever met her, that Ihad ever been with her. I was
completely aware ofthat. There had never been any
allegation. She claims under oath that she told you that secretly in
2011, but you have produced no notes of any such conversation.
You, of course, are a witness to this allegation and will be deposed
asa witness to this allegation. I believe it is an entirely false
allegation that she told you in 2011 that she had had any sexual
contact with me. I think she’s lying through her teeth when she
says that. And I doubt that your notes will reveal any such
information.

But if she did tell you that, she would be absolutely, categorically
lying. So Iam completely aware that never, until the lies were put
in a legal pleading at the end of December 2014, it was
never alleged that I had any sexual contact with Virginia Roberts.

I know that it was alleged that I was a witness to Jeffrey Epstein's
alleged abuse and that was false. 1 was never a witness to any of
Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse. And I wrote that to you, something
that you have falsely denied. And I stand on the record. The record
is clear that I have categorically denied I was ever a witness to
any abuse, that | ever saw Jeffrey Epstein abusing anybody.

And -- and the very idea that I would stand and talk to Jeffrey
Epstein while he was receiving oral sex from Virginia Roberts,
which she swore to under oath, is so outrageous, so preposterous,
that even David Boies said he couldn’t believe it was true.

MS. McCAWLEY: I object. I object. I'm not going to allow you to reveal
any conversations that happened in the context of a settlement discussion.

We constructed a corpus of digitized texts containing
about 4% of all books ever printed. Analysis of this
corpus enables us to investigate cultural trends
quantitatively. We survey the vast terrain of
“culturomics”, focusing on linguistic and cultural
phenomena that were reflected in the English language
between 1800 and 2000. We show how this approach can
provide insights about fields as diverse as lexicography,
the evolution of grammar, collective memory, the
adoption of technology, the pursuit of fame, censorship,
and historical epidemiology. “Culturomics” extends the
boundaries of rigorous quantitative inquiry to a wide
array of new phenomena spanning the social sciences and
the humanities.
Reading small collections of carefully chosen works enables
scholars to make powerful inferences about trends in human
thought. However, this approach rarely enables precise
measurement of the underlying phenomena. Attempts to
introduce quantitative methods into the study of culture (1-6)
have been hampered by the lack of suitable data.
We report the creation of a corpus of 5,195,769 digitized
books containing ~4% of all books ever published.
Computational analysis of this corpus enables us to observe
cultural trends and subject them to quantitative investigation.
“Culturomics” extends the boundaries of scientific inquiry to
a wide array of new phenomena.
The corpus has emerged from Google’s effort to digitize
books. Most books were drawn from over 40 university
libraries around the world. Each page was scanned with
custom equipment (7), and the text digitized using optical
character recognition (OCR). Additional volumes – both
physical and digital – were contributed by publishers.
Metadata describing date and place of publication were
provided by the libraries and publishers, and supplemented
with bibliographic databases. Over 15 million books have
been digitized [12% of all books ever published (7)]. We
selected a subset of over 5 million books for analysis on the
basis of the quality of their OCR and metadata (Fig. 1A) (7).
Periodicals were excluded.
The resulting corpus contains over 500 billion words, in
English (361 billion), French (45B), Spanish (45B), German
(37B), Chinese (13B), Russian (35B), and Hebrew (2B). The
oldest works were published in the 1500s. The early decades
are represented by only a few books per year, comprising
several hundred thousand words. By 1800, the corpus grows
to 60 million words per year; by 1900, 1.4 billion; and by
2000, 8 billion.
The corpus cannot be read by a human. If you tried to read
only the entries from the year 2000 alone, at the reasonable
pace of 200 words/minute, without interruptions for food or
sleep, it would take eighty years. The sequence of letters is
one thousand times longer than the human genome: if you
wrote it out in a straight line, it would reach to the moon and
back 10 times over (8).
To make release of the data possible in light of copyright
constraints, we restricted our study to the question of how
often a given “1-gram” or “n-gram” was used over time. A 1-
gram is a string of characters uninterrupted by a space; this
includes words (“banana”, “SCUBA”) but also numbers
Downloaded from www.sciencemag.org on December 16, 2010
/ www.sciencexpress.org / 16 December 2010 / Page 1 / 10.1126/science.1199644
(“3.14159”) and typos (“excesss”). An n-gram is sequence of
1-grams, such as the phrases “stock market” (a 2-gram) and
“the United States of America” (a 5-gram). We restricted n to
5, and limited our study to n-grams occurring at least 40 times
in the corpus.
Usage frequency is computed by dividing the number of
instances of the n-gram in a given year by the total number of
words in the corpus in that year. For instance, in 1861, the 1-
gram “slavery” appeared in the corpus 21,460 times, on
11,687 pages of 1,208 books. The corpus contains
386,434,758 words from 1861; thus the frequency is 5.5x10 -5 .
“slavery” peaked during the civil war (early 1860s) and then
again during the civil rights movement (1955-1968) (Fig. 1B)
In contrast, we compare the frequency of “the Great War”
to the frequencies of “World War I” and “World War II.” “the
Great War” peaks between 1915 and 1941. But although its
frequency drops thereafter, interest in the underlying events
had not disappeared; instead, they are referred to as “World
War I” (Fig. 1C).
These examples highlight two central factors that
contribute to culturomic trends. Cultural change guides the
concepts we discuss (such as “slavery”). Linguistic change –
which, of course, has cultural roots – affects the words we use
for those concepts (“the Great War” vs. “World War I”). In
this paper, we will examine both linguistic changes, such as
changes in the lexicon and grammar; and cultural phenomena,
such as how we remember people and events.
The full dataset, which comprises over two billion
culturomic trajectories, is available for download or
exploration at www.culturomics.org.
The Size of the English Lexicon
How many words are in the English language (9)?
We call a 1-gram “common” if its frequency is greater
than one per billion. (This corresponds to the frequency of the
words listed in leading dictionaries (7).) We compiled a list of
all common 1-grams in 1900, 1950, and 2000 based on the
frequency of each 1-gram in the preceding decade. These lists
contained 1,117,997 common 1-grams in 1900, 1,102,920 in
1950, and 1,489,337 in 2000.
Not all common 1-grams are English words. Many fell
into three non-word categories: (i) 1-grams with nonalphabetic
characters (“l8r”, “3.14159”); (ii) misspellings
(“becuase, “abberation”); and (iii) foreign words
(“sensitivo”).
To estimate the number of English words, we manually
annotated random samples from the lists of common 1-grams
(7) and determined what fraction were members of the above
non-word categories. The result ranged from 51% of all
common 1-grams in 1900 to 31% in 2000.
Using this technique, we estimated the number of words in
the English lexicon as 544,000 in 1900, 597,000 in 1950, and
1,022,000 in 2000. The lexicon is enjoying a period of
enormous growth: the addition of ~8500 words/year has
increased the size of the language by over 70% during the last
fifty years (Fig. 2A).
Notably, we found more words than appear in any
dictionary. For instance, the 2002 Webster’s Third New
International Dictionary [W3], which keeps track of the
contemporary American lexicon, lists approximately 348,000
single-word wordforms (10); the American Heritage
Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition (AHD4)
lists 116,161 (11). (Both contain additional multi-word
entries.) Part of this gap is because dictionaries often exclude
proper nouns and compound words (“whalewatching”). Even
accounting for these factors, we found many undocumented
words, such as “aridification” (the process by which a
geographic region becomes dry), “slenthem” (a musical
instrument), and, appropriately, the word “deletable.”
This gap between dictionaries and the lexicon results from
a balance that every dictionary must strike: it must be
comprehensive enough to be a useful reference, but concise
enough to be printed, shipped, and used. As such, many
infrequent words are omitted. To gauge how well dictionaries
reflect the lexicon, we ordered our year 2000 lexicon by
frequency, divided it into eight deciles (ranging from 10 -9 –
10 -8 to 10 -2 – 10 -1 ), and sampled each decile (7). We manually
checked how many sample words were listed in the OED (12)
and in the Merriam-Webster Unabridged Dictionary [MWD].
(We excluded proper nouns, since neither OED nor MWD
lists them.) Both dictionaries had excellent coverage of high
frequency words, but less coverage for frequencies below 10 -
6 : 67% of words in the 10 -9 – 10 -8 range were listed in neither
dictionary (Fig. 2B). Consistent with Zipf’s famous law, a
large fraction of the words in our lexicon (63%) were in this
lowest frequency bin. As a result, we estimated that 52% of
the English lexicon – the majority of the words used in
English books – consists of lexical “dark matter”
undocumented in standard references (12).
To keep up with the lexicon, dictionaries are updated
regularly (13). We examined how well these changes
corresponded with changes in actual usage by studying the
2077 1-gram headwords added to AHD4 in 2000. The overall
frequency of these words, such as “buckyball” and
“netiquette”, has soared since 1950: two-thirds exhibited
recent, sharp increases in frequency (>2X from 1950-2000)
(Fig. 2C). Nevertheless, there was a lag between
lexicographers and the lexicon. Over half the words added to
AHD4 were part of the English lexicon a century ago
(frequency >10 -9 from 1890-1900). In fact, some newlyadded
words, such as “gypseous” and “amplidyne”, have
already undergone a steep decline in frequency (Fig. 2D).
Not only must lexicographers avoid adding words that
have fallen out of fashion, they must also weed obsolete
words from earlier editions. This is an imperfect process. We
Downloaded from www.sciencemag.org on December 16, 2010
/ www.sciencexpress.org / 16 December 2010 / Page 2 / 10.1126/science.1199644
found 2220 obsolete 1-gram headwords (“diestock”,
“alkalescent”) in AHD4. Their mean frequency declined
throughout the 20th century, and dipped below 10 -9 decades
ago (Fig. 2D, Inset).
Our results suggest that culturomic tools will aid
lexicographers in at least two ways: (i) finding low-frequency
words that they do not list; and (ii) providing accurate
estimates of current frequency trends to reduce the lag
between changes in the lexicon and changes in the dictionary.
The Evolution of Grammar
Next, we examined grammatical trends. We studied the
English irregular verbs, a classic model of grammatical
change (14-17). Unlike regular verbs, whose past tense is
generated by adding –ed (jump/jumped), irregulars are
conjugated idiosyncratically (stick/stuck, come/came, get/got)
(15).
All irregular verbs coexist with regular competitors (e.g.,
“strived” and “strove”) that threaten to supplant them (Fig.
2E). High-frequency irregulars, which are more readily
remembered, hold their ground better. For instance, we found
“found” (frequency: 5x10 -4 ) 200,000 times more often than
we finded “finded.” In contrast, “dwelt” (frequency: 1x10 -5 )
dwelt in our data only 60 times as often as “dwelled” dwelled.
We defined a verb’s “regularity” as the percentage of
instances in the past tense (i.e., the sum of “drived”, “drove”,
and “driven”) in which the regular form is used. Most
irregulars have been stable for the last 200 years, but 16%
underwent a change in regularity of 10% or more (Fig. 2F).
These changes occurred slowly: it took 200 years for our
fastest moving verb, “chide”, to go from 10% to 90%.
Otherwise, each trajectory was sui generis; we observed no
characteristic shape. For instance, a few verbs, like “spill”,
regularized at a constant speed, but others, such as “thrive”
and “dig”, transitioned in fits and starts (7). In some cases, the
trajectory suggested a reason for the trend. For example, with
“sped/speeded” the shift in meaning from “to move rapidly”
and towards “to exceed the legal limit” appears to have been
the driving cause (Fig. 2G).
Six verbs (burn, chide, smell, spell, spill, thrive)
regularized between 1800 and 2000 (Fig. 2F). Four are
remnants of a now-defunct phonological process that used –t
instead of –ed; they are members of a pack of irregulars that
survived by virtue of similarity (bend/bent, build/built,
burn/burnt, learn/learnt, lend/lent, rend/rent, send/sent,
smell/smelt, spell/spelt, spill/spilt, and spoil/spoilt). Verbs
have been defecting from this coalition for centuries
(wend/went, pen/pent, gird/girt, geld/gelt, and gild/gilt all
blend/blent into the dominant –ed rule). Culturomic analysis
reveals that the collapse of this alliance has been the most
significant driver of regularization in the past 200 years. The
regularization of burnt, smelt, spelt, and spilt originated in the
US; the forms still cling to life in British English (Fig. 2E,F).
But the –t irregulars may be doomed in England too: each
year, a population the size of Cambridge adopts “burned” in
lieu of “burnt.”
Though irregulars generally yield to regulars, two verbs
did the opposite: light/lit and wake/woke. Both were irregular
in Middle English, were mostly regular by 1800, and
subsequently backtracked and are irregular again today. The
fact that these verbs have been going back and forth for
nearly 500 years highlights the gradual nature of the
underlying process.
Still, there was at least one instance of rapid progress by
an irregular form. Presently, 1% of the English speaking
population switches from “sneaked” to “snuck” every year:
someone will have snuck off while you read this sentence. As
before, this trend is more prominent in the United States, but
recently sneaked across the Atlantic: America is the world’s
leading exporter of both regular and irregular verbs.
Out with the Old
Just as individuals forget the past (18, 19), so do societies
(20). To quantify this effect, we reasoned that the frequency
of 1-grams such as “1951” could be used to measure interest
in the events of the corresponding year, and created plots for
each year between 1875 and 1975.
The plots had a characteristic shape. For example, “1951”
was rarely discussed until the years immediately preceding
1951. Its frequency soared in 1951, remained high for three
years, and then underwent a rapid decay, dropping by half
over the next fifteen years. Finally, the plots enter a regime
marked by slower forgetting: collective memory has both a
short-term and a long-term component.
But there have been changes. The amplitude of the plots is
rising every year: precise dates are increasingly common.
There is also a greater focus on the present. For instance,
“1880” declined to half its peak value in 1912, a lag of 32
years. In contrast, “1973” declined to half its peak by 1983, a
lag of only 10 years. We are forgetting our past faster with
each passing year (Fig. 3A).
We were curious whether our increasing tendency to forget
the old was accompanied by more rapid assimilation of the
new (21). We divided a list of 154 inventions into timeresolved
cohorts based on the forty-year interval in which
they were first invented (1800-1840, 1840-1880, and 1880-
1920) (7). We tracked the frequency of each invention in the
nth after it was invented as compared to its maximum value,
and plotted the median of these rescaled trajectories for each
cohort.
The inventions from the earliest cohort (1800-1840) took
over 66 years from invention to widespread impact
(frequency >25% of peak). Since then, the cultural adoption
of technology has become more rapid: the 1840-1880
invention cohort was widely adopted within 50 years; the
1880-1920 cohort within 27 (Fig. 3B).

“In the Future, Everyone Will Be World Famous for 7.5
Minutes” –Whatshisname
People, too, rise to prominence, only to be forgotten (22).
Fame can be tracked by measuring the frequency of a
person’s name (Fig. 3C). We compared the rise to fame of the
most famous people of different eras. We took all 740,000
people with entries in Wikipedia, removed cases where
several famous individuals share a name, and sorted the rest
by birthdate and frequency (23). For every year from 1800-
1950, we constructed a cohort consisting of the fifty most
famous people born in that year. For example, the 1882
cohort includes “Virginia Woolf” and “Felix Frankfurter”; the
1946 cohort includes “Bill Clinton” and “Steven Spielberg.”
We plotted the median frequency for the names in each
cohort over time (Fig. 3D-E). The resulting trajectories were
all similar. Each cohort had a pre-celebrity period ( median
frequency <10 -9 ), followed by a rapid rise to prominence, a
peak, and a slow decline. We therefore characterized each
cohort using four parameters: (i) the age of initial celebrity;
(ii) the doubling time of the initial rise; (iii) the age of peak
celebrity; (iv) the half-life of the decline (Fig. 3E). The age of
peak celebrity has been consistent over time: about 75 years
after birth. But the other parameters have been changing.
Fame comes sooner and rises faster: between the early 19th
century and the mid-20th century, the age of initial celebrity
declined from 43 to 29 years, and the doubling time fell from
8.1 to 3.3 years. As a result, the most famous people alive
today are more famous – in books – than their predecessors.
Yet this fame is increasingly short-lived: the post-peak halflife
dropped from 120 to 71 years during the nineteenth
century.
We repeated this analysis with all 42,358 people in the
databases of Encyclopaedia Britannica (24), which reflect a
process of expert curation that began in 1768. The results
were similar (7). Thus, people are getting more famous than
ever before, but are being forgotten more rapidly than ever.
Occupational choices affect the rise to fame. We focused
on the 25 most famous individuals born between 1800 and
1920 in seven occupations (actors, artists, writers, politicians,
biologists, physicists, and mathematicians), examining how
their fame grew as a function of age (Fig. 3F).
Actors tend to become famous earliest, at around 30. But
the fame of the actors we studied – whose ascent preceded the
spread of television – rises slowly thereafter. (Their fame
peaked at a frequency of 2x10 -7 .) The writers became famous
about a decade after the actors, but rose for longer and to a
much higher peak (8x10 -7 ). Politicians did not become
famous until their 50s, when, upon being elected President of
the United States (in 11 of 25 cases; 9 more were heads of
other states) they rapidly rose to become the most famous of
the groups (1x10 -6 ).
Science is a poor route to fame. Physicists and biologists
eventually reached a similar level of fame as actors (1x10 -7 ),
but it took them far longer. Alas, even at their peak,
mathematicians tend not to be appreciated by the public
(2x10 -8 ).
Detecting Censorship and Suppression
Suppression – of a person, or an idea – leaves quantifiable
fingerprints (25). For instance, Nazi censorship of the Jewish
artist Marc Chagall is evident by comparing the frequency of
“Marc Chagall” in English and in German books (Fig.4A). In
both languages, there is a rapid ascent starting in the late
1910s (when Chagall was in his early 30s). In English, the
ascent continues. But in German, the artist’s popularity
decreases, reaching a nadir from 1936-1944, when his full
name appears only once. (In contrast, from 1946-1954, “Marc
Chagall” appears nearly 100 times in the German corpus.)
Such examples are found in many countries, including Russia
(e.g. Trotsky), China (Tiananmen Square) and the US (the
Hollywood Ten, blacklisted in 1947) (Fig.4B-D).
We probed the impact of censorship on a person’s cultural
influence in Nazi Germany. Led by such figures as the
librarian Wolfgang Hermann, the Nazis created lists of
authors and artists whose “undesirable”, “degenerate” work
was banned from libraries and museums and publicly burned
(26-28). We plotted median usage in German for five such
lists: artists (100 names), as well as writers of Literature
(147), Politics (117), History (53), and Philosophy (35) (Fig
4E). We also included a collection of Nazi party members
[547 names, ref (7)]. The five suppressed groups exhibited a
decline. This decline was modest for writers of history (9%)
and literature (27%), but pronounced in politics (60%),
philosophy (76%), and art (56%). The only group whose
signal increased during the Third Reich was the Nazi party
members [a 500% increase; ref (7)].
Given such strong signals, we tested whether one could
identify victims of Nazi repression de novo. We computed a
“suppression index” s for each person by dividing their
frequency from 1933 – 1945 by the mean frequency in 1925-
1933 and in 1955-1965 (Fig.4F, Inset). In English, the
distribution of suppression indices is tightly centered around
unity. Fewer than 1% of individuals lie at the extremes (s<1/5
or s>5).
In German, the distribution in much wider, and skewed
leftward: suppression in Nazi Germany was not the
exception, but the rule (Fig. 4F). At the far left, 9.8% of
individuals showed strong suppression (s<1/5). This
population is highly enriched for documented victims of
repression, such as Pablo Picasso (s=0.12), the Bauhaus
architect Walter Gropius (s=0.16), and Hermann Maas
(s<.01), an influential Protestant Minister who helped many
Jews flee (7). (Maas was later recognized by Israel’s Yad
Vashem as a “Righteous Among the Nations.”) At the other

extreme, 1.5% of the population exhibited a dramatic rise
(s>5). This subpopulation is highly enriched for Nazis and
Nazi-supporters, who benefited immensely from government
propaganda (7).
These results provide a strategy for rapidly identifying
likely victims of censorship from a large pool of possibilities,
and highlights how culturomic methods might complement
existing historical approaches.
Culturomics
Culturomics is the application of high-throughput data
collection and analysis to the study of human culture. Books
are a beginning, but we must also incorporate newspapers
(29), manuscripts (30), maps (31), artwork (32), and a myriad
of other human creations (33, 34). Of course, many voices –
already lost to time – lie forever beyond our reach.
Culturomic results are a new type of evidence in the
humanities. As with fossils of ancient creatures, the challenge
of culturomics lies in the interpretation of this evidence.
Considerations of space restrict us to the briefest of surveys: a
handful of trajectories and our initial interpretations. Many
more fossils, with shapes no less intriguing, beckon:
(i) Peaks in “influenza” correspond with dates of known
pandemics, suggesting the value of culturomic methods for
historical epidemiology (35) (Fig. 5A).
(ii) Trajectories for “the North”, “the South”, and finally,
“the enemy” reflect how polarization of the states preceded
the descent into war (Fig. 5B).
(iii) In the battle of the sexes, the “women” are gaining
ground on the “men” (Fig. 5C).
(iv) “féminisme” made early inroads in France, but the US
proved to be a more fertile environment in the long run (Fig.
5D).
(v) “Galileo”, “Darwin”, and “Einstein” may be well-known
scientists, but “Freud” is more deeply engrained in our
collective subconscious (Fig. 5E).
(vi) Interest in “evolution” was waning when “DNA”
came along (Fig. 5F).
(vii) The history of the American diet offers many
appetizing opportunities for future research; the menu
includes “steak”, “sausage”, “ice cream”, “hamburger”,
“pizza”, “pasta”, and “sushi” (Fig. 5G).
(viii) “God” is not dead; but needs a new publicist (Fig.
5H).
These, together with the billions of other trajectories that
accompany them, will furnish a great cache of bones from
which to reconstruct the skeleton of a new science.

~129 million book editions have been published since the
advent of the printing press (upper left). Second row:
Libraries and publishing houses provide books to Google for

(1861-1865) and the civil rights movement (1955-1968) are
highlighted in red. The number in the upper left (1e-4) is the
unit of frequency. (C) Usage frequency over time for “the
Great War” (blue), “World War I” (green), and “World War

of language, lexicography, and grammar. (A) The size of the
English lexicon over time. Tick marks show the number of
single words in three dictionaries (see text). (B) Fraction of
words in the lexicon that appear in two different dictionaries
as a function of usage frequency. (C) Five words added by
the AHD in its 2000 update. Inset: Median frequency of new
words added to AHD4 in 2000. The frequency of half of these
words exceeded 10 -9 as far back as 1890 (white dot). (D)
Obsolete words added to AHD4 in 2000. Inset: Mean
frequency of the 2220 AHD headwords whose current usage
frequency is less than 10 -9 . (E) Usage frequency of irregular
verbs (red) and their regular counterparts (blue). Some verbs
(chide/chided) have regularized during the last two centuries.
The trajectories for “speeded” and “speed up” (green) are
similar, reflecting the role of semantic factors in this instance
of regularization. The verb “burn” first regularized in the US
(US flag) and later in the UK (UK flag). The irregular
“snuck” is rapidly gaining on “sneaked.” (F) Scatter plot of
the irregular verbs; each verb’s position depends on its
regularity (see text) in the early 19th century (x-coordinate)
and in the late 20th century (y-coordinate). For 16% of the
verbs, the change in regularity was greater than 10% (large
font). Dashed lines separate irregular verbs (regularity<50%)

(grey arrow). (C) The 1976 and 1989 Tiananmen Square
incidents both lead to elevated discussion in English texts.
Response to the 1989 incident is largely absent in Chinese
texts (blue), suggesting government censorship. (D) After the

I. Overview of Google Books Digitization
In 2004, Google began scanning books to make their contents searchable and discoverable online. To
date, Google has scanned over fifteen million books: over 11% of all the books ever published. The
collection contains over five billion pages and two trillion words, with books dating back to as early as
1473 and with text in 478 languages. Over two million of these scanned books were given directly to
Google by their publishers; the rest are borrowed from large libraries such as the University of Michigan
and the New York Public Library. The scanning effort involves significant engineering challenges, some of
which are highly relevant to the construction of the historical n-grams corpus. We survey those issues
here.
The result of the next three steps is a collection of digital texts associated with particular book editions, as
well as composite metadata for each edition combining the information contained in all metadata sources.
I.1. Metadata
Over 100 sources of metadata information were used by Google to generate a comprehensive catalog of
books. Some of these sources are library catalogs (e.g., the list of books in the collections of University of
Michigan, or union catalogs such as the collective list of books in Bosnian libraries), some are from
retailers (e.g., Decitre, a French bookseller), and some are from commercial aggregators (e.g., Ingram).
In addition, Google also receives metadata from its 30,000 partner publishers. Each metadata source
consists of a series of digital records, typically in either the MARC format favored by libraries, or the ONIX
format used by the publishing industry. Each record refers to either a specific edition of a book or a
physical copy of a book on a library shelf, and contains conventional bibliographic data such as title,
author(s), publisher, date of publication, and language(s) of publication.
Cataloguing practices vary widely among these sources, and even within a single source over time. Thus
two records for the same edition will often differ in multiple fields. This is especially true for serials (e.g.,
the Congressional Record) and multivolume works such as sets (e.g., the three volumes of The Lord of
the Rings).
The matter is further complicated by ambiguities in the definition of the word „book‟ itself. Including
translations, there are over three thousand editions derived from Mark Twain‟s original Tom Sawyer.
Google‟s process of converting the billions of metadata records into a single nonredundant database of
book editions consists of the following principal steps:
3
1. Coarsely dividing the billions of metadata records into groups that may refer to the same
work (e.g., Tom Sawyer).
2. Identifying and aggregating multivolume works based on the presence of cues from individual
records.
3. Subdividing the group of records corresponding to each work into constituent groups
corresponding to the various editions (e.g., the 1909 publication of De lotgevallen van Tom
Sawyer, translated from English to Dutch by Johan Braakensiek).
4. Merging the records for each edition into a new “consensus” record.
The result is a set of consensus records, where each record corresponds to a distinct book edition and
work, and where the contents of each record are formed out of fields from multiple sources. The number
of records in this set -- i.e., the number of known book editions -- increases every year as more books are
written.
In August 2010, this evaluation identified 129 million editions, which is the working estimate we use in this
paper of all the editions ever published (this includes serials and sets but excludes kits, mixed media, and
periodicals such as newspapers). This final database contains bibliographic information for each of these
129 million editions (Ref. S1). The country of publication is known for 85.3% of these editions, authors for
87.8%, publication dates for 92.6%, and the language for 91.6%. Of the 15 million books scanned, the
country of publication is known for 91.5%, authors for 92.1%, publication dates for 95.1%, and the
language for 98.6%.
I.2. Digitization
We describe the way books are scanned and digitized. For publisher-provided books, Google removes
the spines and scans the pages with industrial sheet-fed scanners. For library-provided books, Google
uses custom-built scanning stations designed to impose only as much wear on the book as would result
from someone reading the book. As the pages are turned, stereo cameras overhead photograph each
page, as shown in Figure S1.
One crucial difference between sheet-fed scanners and the stereo scanning process is the flatness of the
page as the image is captured. In sheet-fed scanning, the page is kept flat, similar to conventional flatbed
scanners. With stereo scanning, the book is cradled at an angle that minimizes stress on the spine of the
book (this angle is not shown in Figure S1). Though less damaging to the book, a disadvantage of the
latter approach is that it results in a page that is curved relative to the plane of the camera. The curvature
changes every time a page is turned, for several reasons: the attachment point of the page in the spine
differs, the two stacks of pages change in thickness, and the tension with which the book is held open
may vary. Thicker books have more page curvature and more variation in curvature.
This curvature is measured by projecting a fixed infrared pattern onto each page of the book,
subsequently captured by cameras. When the image is later processed, this pattern is used to identify the
location of the spine and to determine the curvature of the page. Using this curvature information, the
scanned image of each page is digitally resampled so that the results correspond as closely as possible
to the results of sheet-fed scanning. The raw images are also digitally cropped, cleaned, and contrast
enhanced. Blurred pages are automatically detected and rescanned. Details of this approach can be
found in U.S. Patents 7463772 and 7508978; sample results are shown in Figure S2.
Finally, blocks of text are identified and optical character recognition (OCR) is used to convert those
images into digital characters and words, in an approach described elsewhere (Ref. S2). The difficulty of
applying conventional OCR techniques to Google‟s scanning effort is compounded because of variations
in language, font, size, paper quality, and the physical condition of the books being scanned.
Nevertheless, Google estimates that over 98% of words are correctly digitized for modern English books.
After OCR, initial and trailing punctuation is stripped and word fragments split by hyphens are joined,
yielding a stream of words suitable for subsequent indexing.
I.3. Structure Extraction
After the book has been scanned and digitized, the components of the scanned material are classified
into various types. For instance, individual pages are scanned in order to identify which pages comprise
the authored content of the book, as opposed to the pages which comprise frontmatter and backmatter,
such as copyright pages, tables of contents, index pages, etc. Within each page, we also identify
repeated structural elements, such as headers, footers, and page numbers.
Using OCR results from the frontmatter and backmatter, we automatically extract author names, titles,
ISBNs, and other identifying information. This information is used to confirm that the correct consensus
record has been associated with the scanned text.

II. Construction of Historical N-grams Corpora
As noted in the paper text, we did not analyze the entire set of 15 million books digitized by Google.
Instead, we
1. Performed further filtering steps to select only a subset of books with highly accurate metadata.
2. Subdivided the books into „base corpora‟ using such metadata fields as language, country of
publication, and subject.
3. For each base corpus, construct a massive numerical table that lists, for each n-gram (often a
word or phrase), how often it appears in the given base corpus in every single year between 1550
and 2008.
In this section, we will describe these three steps. These additional steps ensure high data quality, and
also make it possible to examine historical trends without violating the 'fair use' principle of copyright law:
our object of study is the frequency tables produced in step 3 (which are available as supplemental data),
and not the full-text of the books.
II.1. Additional filtering of books
II.1A. Accuracy of Date-of-Publication metadata
Accurate date-of-publication data is crucial component in the production of time-resolved n-grams data.
Because our study focused most centrally on the English language corpus, we decided to apply more
stringent inclusion criteria in order to make sure the accuracy of the date-of-publication data was as high
as possible.
We found that the lion's share of date-of-publication errors were due to so-called 'bound-withs' - single
volumes that contain multiple works, such as anthologies or collected works of a given author. Among
these bound-withs, the most inaccurately dated subclass were serial publications, such as journals and
periodicals. For instance, many journals had publication dates which were erroneously attributed to the
year in which the first issue of the journal had been published. These journals and serial publications also
represented a different aspect of culture than the books did. For these reasons, we decided to filter out all
serial publications to the extent possible. Our 'Serial Killer' algorithm removed serial publications by
looking for suggestive metadata entries, containing one or more of the following:
5
1. Serial-associated titles, containing such phrases as 'Journal of', 'US Government report', etc.
2. Serial-associated authors, such as those in which the author field is blank, too numerous, or
contains words such as 'committee'.
Note that the match is case-insensitive, and it must be to a complete word in the title; thus the filtering of
titles containing the word „digest‟ does not lead to the removal of works with „digestion‟ in the title. The
entire list of serial-associated title phrases and serial-associated author phrases is included as
supplemental data (Appendix). For English books, 29.4% of books were filtered using the 'Serial Killer',
with the title filter removing 2% and the author filter removing 27.4%. Foreign language corpora were
filtered in a similar fashion.
This filtering step markedly increased the accuracy of the metadata dates. We determined metadata
accuracy by examining 1000 filtered volumes distributed uniformly over time from 1801-2000 (5 per year).
An annotator with no knowledge of our study manually determined the date-of-publication. The annotator
was aware of the Google metadata dates during this process. We found that 5.8% of English books had
metadata dates that were more than 5 years from the date determined by a human examining the book.
Because errors are much more common among older books, and because the actual corpora are strongly
biased toward recent works, the likelihood of error in a randomly sampled book from the final corpus is
much lower than 6.2%. As a point of comparison, 27 of 100 books (27%) selected at random from an
unfiltered corpus contained date-of-publication errors of greater than 5 years. The unfiltered corpus was
created using a sampling strategy similar to that of Eng-1M. This selection mechanism favored recent
books (which are more frequent) and pre-1800 books, which were excluded in the sampling strategy for
filtered books; as such the two numbers (6.2% and 27%) give a sense of the improvement, but are not
strictly comparable.
Note that since the base corpora were generated (August 2009), many additional improvements have
been made to the metadata dates used in Google Book Search itself. As such, these numbers do not
reflect the accuracy of the Google Book Search online tool.
II.1B. OCR quality
The challenge of performing accurate OCR on the entire books dataset is compounded by variations in
such factors as language, font, size, legibility, and physical condition of the book. OCR quality was
assessed using an algorithm developed by Popat et al. (Ref S3). This algorithm yields a probability that
expresses the confidence that a given sequence of text generated by OCR is correct. Incorrect or
anomalous text can result from gross imperfections in the scanned images, or as a result of markings or
drawings. This algorithm uses sophisticated statistics, a variant of the Partial by Partial Matching (PPM)
model, to compute for each glyph (character) the probability that it is anomalous given other nearby
glyphs. ('Nearby' refers to 2-dimensional distance on the original scanned image, hence glyphs above,
below, to the left, and to the right of the target glyph.) The model parameters are tuned using multilanguage
subcorpora, one in each of the 32 supported languages. From the per-glyph probability one can
compute an aggregate probability for a sequence of glyphs, including the entire text of a volume. In this
manner, every volume has associated with it a probabilistic OCR quality score (quantized to an integer
between 0-100; note that the OCR quality score should not be confused with character or word accuracy).
In addition to error detection, the Popat model is also capable of computing the probability that the text is
in a particular language given any sequence of characters. Thus the algorithm serves the dual purpose of
detecting anomalous text while simultaneously identifying the language in which the text is written.
To ensure the highest quality data, we excluded volumes with poor OCR quality. For the languages that
use a Latin alphabet (English, French, Spanish, and German), the OCR quality is generally higher, and
more books are available. As a result, we filtered out all volumes whose quality score was lower than
80%. For Chinese and Russian, fewer books were available, and we did not apply the OCR filter. For
Hebrew, a 50% threshold was used, because its OCR quality was relatively better than Chinese or
Russian. For geographically specific corpora, English US and English UK, a less stringent 60% threshold
was used, in order to maximize the number of books included (note that, as such, these two corpora are
not strict subsets of the broader English corpus). Figure S4 shows the distribution of OCR quality score
as a function of the fraction of books in the English corpus. Use of an 80% cut off will remove the books
with the worst OCR, while retaining the vast majority of the books in the original corpus.
The OCR quality scores were also used as a localized indicator of textual quality in order to remove
anomalous sections of otherwise high-quality texts. The end source text was ensured to be of
comparable quality to the post-OCR text presented in text-mode on the Google Books website.
II.1C. Accuracy of language metadata
We applied additional filters to remove books with dubious language-of-composition metadata. This filter
removed volumes whose meta-data language tag disagrees with the language determined by the
statistical language detection algorithm described in section 2A. For our English corpus, 8.56%
6
(approximately 235,000) of the books were filtered out in this way. Table S1 lists the fraction removed at
this stage for our other non-English corpora.
II.1D. Year Restriction
In order to further ensure publication date accuracy and consistency of dates across all our corpora, we
implemented a publication year restriction and only retained books with publication years starting from
1550 and ending in 2008. We found that a significant fraction of mis-dated books have a publication year
of 0 or dates prior to the invention of printing. The number of books filtered due to this year range
restriction is considerably small, usually under 2% of the original number of books.
The fraction of the corpus removed by all stages of the filtering is summarized in Table S1. Note that
because the filters are applied in a fixed order, the statistics presented below are influenced by the
sequence in which the filters were applied. For example, books that trigger both the OCR quality filter and
by the language correction filter are excluded by the OCR quality filter, which is performed first. Of course,
the actual subset of books filtered is the same regardless of the order in which the filters are applied.
II.2. Metadata based subdivision of the Google Books Collection
II.2A. Determination of language
To create accurate corpora in particular languages that minimize cross-language contamination, it is
important to be able to accurately associate books with the language in which they were written. To
determine the language in which a text is written, we rely on metadata derived from our 100 bibliographic
sources, as well as statistical language determination using the Popat algorithm (Ref S3). The algorithm
takes advantage of the fact that certain character sequences, such as 'the', 'of', and 'ion, occur more
frequently in English. In contrast, the sequences 'la', 'aux', and 'de' occur more frequently in French.
These patterns can be used to distinguish between books written in English and those written in
French. More generally, given the entire text of a book, the algorithm can reliably classify the book into
one of the 32 supported language types. The final consensus language was determined based on the
metadata sources as well as the results of the statistical language determination algorithm, with the
statistical algorithm as the higher priority.
II.2B. Determination of book subject assignments
Book subject assignments were determined using a book's Book Industry Standards and Communication
(BISAC) subject categories. BISAC subject headings are a system for categorizing books based on
content developed by the BISAC subject codes committee overseen by the Book Industry Study Group.
They are often used for a variety of purposes, such as to determine how books are shelved in stores. For
English, 92.4% of the books had at least one BISAC subject assignment. In cases where there were
multiple subject assignments, we took the more commonly used subject heading and discarded the rest.
II.2C. Determination of book country-of-publication
Country of publication was determined on the basis of our 100 bibliographic sources; 97% of the books
had a country-of-publication assignment. The country code used is the 2 letter code as defined in the ISO
3166-1 alpha-2 standard. More specifically, when constructing our US versus British English corpora, we
used the codes us (United States) and gb (Great Britain) to filter our volumes.
7
II.3. Construction of historical n-grams corpora
II.3A. Creation of a digital sequence of 1-grams and extraction of n-gram
counts
All input source texts were first converted into UTF-8 encoding before tokenization. Next, the text of each
book was tokenized into a sequence of 1-grams using Google‟s internal tokenization libraries (more
details on this approach can be found in Ref. S4). Tokenization is affected by two processes: (i) the
reliability of the underlying OCR, especially vis-à-vis the position of blank spaces; (ii) the specific
tokenizer rules used to convert the post-OCR text into a sequence of 1-grams.
Ordinarily, the tokenizer separates the character stream into words at the white space characters (\n
[newline]; \t [tab]; \r [carriage return]; “ “ [space]). There are, however, several exceptional cases:
(1) Column-formatting in books often forces the hyphenation of words across lines. Thus the word
“digitized”, may appear on two lines in a book as digi-<newline>ized. Prior to tokenization, we look for 1-
grams that end with a hyphen ('-') followed by a newline whitespace character. We then concatenate the
hyphen-ending 1-gram to the next 1-gram. In this manner, digi-<newline>tized became “digitized”. This
step takes place prior to any other steps in the tokenization process.
(2) Each of the following characters are always treated as separate words:
! (exclamation-mark)
@ (at)
% (percent)
^ (caret)
* (star)
( (open-round-bracket)
) (close-round-bracket)
[ (open-square-bracket)
] (close-square-bracket)
- (hyphen)
= (equals)
{ (open-curly-bracket)
} (close-curly-bracket)
| (pipe)
\ (backslash)
: (colon)
: (semi-colon)
< (less-than)
8
, (comma)
> (greater-than)
? (question-mark)
/ (forward-slash)
~ (tilde)
` (back-tick)
“ (double quote)
(3) The following characters are not tokenized as separate words:
& (ampersand)
_ (underscore)
Examples of the resulting words include AT&T, R&D, and variable names such as
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.
(4) . (period) is treated as a separate word, except when it is part of a number or price, such as 99.99 or
$999.95. A specific pattern matcher looks for numbers or prices and tokenizes these special strings as
separate words.
(5) $ (dollar-sign) is treated as a separate word, except where it is the first character of a word consisting
entirely of numbers, possibly containing a decimal point. Examples include $71 and $9.95
(6) # (hash) is treated as a separate word, except when it is preceded by a-g, j or x. This covers musical
notes such as A# (A-sharp), and programming languages j#, and x#.
(7) + (plus) is treated as a separate word, except it appears at the end of a sequence of alphanumeric
characters or “+” s. Thus the strings C++ and Na2+ would be treated as single words. These cases
include many programming language names and chemical compound names.
(8) ' (apostrophe/single-quote) is treated as a separate word, except when it precedes the letter s, as in
ALICE'S and Bob's
The tokenization process for Chinese was different. For Chinese, an internal CJK
(Chinese/Japanese/Korean) segmenter was used to break characters into word units. The CJK
segmenter inserts spaces along common semantic boundaries. Hence, 1-grams that appear in the
Chinese simplified corpora will sometimes contain strings with 1 or more Chinese characters.
Given a sequence of n 1-grams, we denote the corresponding n-gram by concatenating the 1-grams with
a plain space character in between. A few examples of the tokenization and 1-gram construction method
are provided in Table S2.
Each book edition was broken down into a series of 1-grams on a page-by-page basis. For each page of
each book, we counted the number of times each 1-gram appeared. We further counted the number of
times each n-gram appeared (e.g., a sequence of n 1-grams) for all n less than or equal to 5. Because
this was done on a page-by-page basis, n-grams that span two consecutive pages were not counted.
9
II.3B. Generation of historical n-grams corpora
To generate a particular historical n-grams corpus, a subset of book editions is chosen to serve as the
base corpus. The chosen editions are divided by publication year. For each publication year, total counts
for each n-gram are obtained by summing n-gram counts for each book edition that was published in that
year. In particular, three counts are generated: (1) the total number of times the n-gram appears; (2) the
number of pages on which the n-gram appears; and (3) the number of books in which the n-gram
appears.
We then generate tables showing all three counts for each n-gram, resolved by year. In order to ensure
that n-grams could not be easily used to identify individual text sources, we did not report counts for any
n-grams that appeared fewer than 40 times in the corpus. (As a point of reference, the total number of 1-
grams that appear in the 3.2 million books written in English with highest date accuracy („eng-all‟, see
below) is 360 billion: a 1-gram that would appear fewer than 40 times occurs at a frequency of the order
of 10 -11 .) As a result, rare spelling and OCR errors were also omitted. Since most n-grams are infrequent,
this also served to dramatically reduce the size of the n-gram tables. Of course, the most robust historical
trends are associated with frequent n-grams, so our ability to discern these trends was not compromised
by this approach.
By dividing the reported counts by the corpus size (measured in either words, pages, or books), it is
possible to determine the normalized frequency with which an n-gram appears in the base corpus. Note
that the different counts can be used for different purposes. The usage frequency of an n-gram,
normalized by the total number of words, reflects both the number of authors using an n-gram, and how
frequently they use it. It can be driven upward markedly by a single author who uses an n-gram very
frequently, for instance in a biography of 'Gottlieb Daimler' which mentions his name many times. This
latter effect is sometimes undesirable. In such cases, it may be preferable to examine the fraction of
books containing a particular n-gram: texts in different books, which are usually written by different
authors, tend to be more independent.
Eleven corpora were generated, based on eleven different subsets of books. Five of these are English
language corpora, and six are foreign language corpora.
Eng-all
This is derived from a base corpus containing all English language books which pass the filters described
in section 1.
Eng-1M
This is derived from a base corpus containing 1 million English language books which passed the filters
described in section 1. The base corpus is a subset of the Eng-all base corpus.
The sampling was constrained in two ways.
First, the texts were re-sampled so as to exhibit a representative subject distribution. Because digitization
depends on the availability of the physical books (from libraries or publishers), we reasoned that digitized
books may be a biased subset of books as a whole. We therefore re-sampled books so as to ensure that
the diversity of book editions included in the corpus for a given year, as reflected by BISAC subject
codes, reflected the diversity of book editions actually published in that year. We estimated the latter
using our metadata database, which reflects the aggregate of our 100 bibliographic sources and includes
10-fold more book editions than the scanned collection.
Second, the total number of books drawn from any given year was capped at 6174. This has the net
effect of ensuring that the total number of books in the corpus is uniform starting around the year 1883.
This was done to ensure that all books passing the quality filters were included in earlier years. This
10
capping strategy also minimizes bias towards modern books that might otherwise result because the
number of books being published has soared in recent decades.
Eng-Modern-1M
This corpus was generated exactly as Eng-1M above, except that it contains no books from before 1800.
Eng-US
This is derived from a base corpus containing all English language books which pass the filters described
in section 1 but having a quality filtering threshold of 60%, and having 'United States' as its country of
publication, reflected by the 2-letter country code us,
Eng-UK
This is derived from a base corpus containing all English language books which pass the filters described
in section 1 but having a quality filtering threshold of 60%, and having 'United Kingdom' as its country of
publication, reflected by the 2-letter country code gb,
Fre-all
This is derived from a base corpus containing all French language books which pass the series of filters
described in section 1.
Ger-all
This is derived from a base corpus containing all German language books which pass
the series of filters described in section 1.
Spa-all
This is derived from a base corpus containing all Spanish language books which pass the series of filters
described in section 1.
Rus-all
This is derived from a base corpus containing all Russian language books which pass the series of filters
described in section 1C-D.
Chi-sim-all
This is derived from a base corpus containing all books written using the simplified Chinese character set
which pass the series of filters described in section 1C-D.
Heb-all
This is derived from a base corpus containing all Hebrew language books which pass the series of filter
described in section 1.
11
The computations required to generate these corpora were performed at Google using the MapReduce
framework for distributed computing (Ref S5). Many computers were used as these computations would
take many years on a single ordinary computer.
Note that the ability to study the frequency of words or phrases in English over time was our primary focus
in this study. As such, we went to significant lengths to ensure the quality of the general English corpora
and their date metadata (i.e., Eng-all, Eng-1M, and Eng-Modern-1M). As a result, the accuracy of placeof-publication
data in English is not as reliable as the accuracy of date metadata. In addition, the foreign
language corpora are affected by issues that were improved and largely eliminated in the English data.
For instance, their date metadata is not as accurate. In the case of Hebrew, the metadata for language is
an oversimplification: a significant fraction of the earliest texts annotated as Hebrew are in fact hybrids
formed from Hebrew and Aramaic, the latter written in Hebrew script.
The size of these base corpora is described in Tables S3-S6.
III. Culturomic Analyses
In this section we describe the computational techniques we use to analyze the historical n-grams
corpora.
III.0. General Remarks
III.0.1 On Corpora.
There is significant variation in the quality of the various corpora during various time periods and their
suitability for culturomic research. All the corpora are adequate for the uses to which they are put in the
paper. In particular, the primary object of study in this paper is the English language from 1800-2000; this
corpus during this period is therefore the most carefully curated of the datasets. However, to encourage
further research, we are releasing all available datasets - far more data than was used in the paper. We
therefore take a moment to describe the factors a culturomic researcher ought to consider before relying
on results of new queries not highlighted in the paper.
1) Volume of data sampled. Where the number of books used to count n-gram frequencies is too small,
the signal to noise ratio declines to the point where reliable trends cannot be discerned. For instance, if
an n-gram's actual frequency is 1 part in n, the number of words required to create a single reliable
timepoint must be some multiple of n. In the English language, for instance, we restrict our study to years
past 1800, where at least 40 million words are found each year. Thus an n-gram whose frequency is 1
part per million can be reliably quantified with single-year resolution. In Chinese, there are fewer than 10
million words per year prior to the year 1956. Thus the Chinese corpus in 1956 is not in general as
suitable for reliable quantification as the English corpus in 1800. (In some cases, reducing the resolution
by binning in larger windows can be used to sample lower frequency n-grams in a corpus that is too smal
for single-year resolution.) In sum: for any corpus and any n-gram in any year, one must consider whether
the size of the corpus is sufficient to enable reliable quantitation of that n-gram in that year.
2) Composition of the corpus. The full dataset contains about 4% of all books ever published, which
limits the extent to which it may be biased relative to the ensemble of all surviving books. Still, marked
shifts in composition from one year to another are a potential source of error. For instance, book sampling
patterns differ for the period before the creation of Google Books (2004) as compared to the period
afterward. Thus, it is difficult to compare results from after 2000 with results from before 2000. As a result,
significant changes in culturomic trends past the year 2000 may reflect corpus composition issues. This
was an important reason for our choice of the period between 1800 and 2000 as the target period.
12
3) Quality of OCR. This varies from corpus to corpus as described above. For English, we spent a great
deal of time examining the data by hand as an additional check on its reliability. The other corpora may
not be as reliable.
4) Quality of Metadata. Again, the English language corpus was checked very carefully and
systematically on multiple occasions, as described above and in the following sections. The metadata for
the other corpora may not be equally reliable for all periods. In particular, the Hebrew corpus during the
19th century is composed largely of reprinted works, whose original publication dates farpredate the
metadata date for the publication of the particular edition in question. This must be borne in mind for
researchers intent on working with that corpus.
In addition to these four general issues, we note that earlier portions of the Hebrew corpus contain a large
quantity of Aramaic text written in Hebrew script. As these texts often oscillate back and forth between
Hebrew and Aramaic, they are particularly hard to accurately classify.
All the above issues will likely improve in the years to come. In the meanwhile, users must use extra
caution in interpreting the results of culturomic analyses, especially those based on the various non-
English corpora. Nevertheless, as illustrated in the main text, these corpora already contain a great
treasury of useful material, and we have therefore made them available to the scientific community
without delay. We have no doubt that they will enable many more fascinating discoveries.
III.0.2 On the number of books published
In the text, we report that our corpus contains about 4% of all books ever published. Obtaining this
estimate relies on knowing how many books are in the corpus (5,195,769) and estimating the total
number of books ever published. The latter quantity is extremely difficult to estimate, because the record
of published books is fragmentary and incomplete, and because the definition of book is itself
ambiguous.
One way of estimating the number of books ever published is to calculate the number of editions in the
comprehensive catalog of books which was described in Section I of the supplemental materials. This
produces an estimate of 129 million book editions. However, this estimate must be regarded with great
caution: it is conservative, and the choice of parameters for the clustering algorithm can lead to significant
variation in the results. More details are provided in Ref S1.
Another independent estimate we obtained in the study How Much Information? (2003) conducted at
Berkeley (Ref S6). That study also produced a very rough estimate of the number of books ever
published and concluded that it was between 74 million and 175 million.
The results of both estimates are in general agreement. If the actual number is closer to the low end of
the Berkeley range, then our 5 million book corpus encompasses a little more than 5% of all books ever
published; if it is at the high end, then our corpus would constitute a little less than 3%. We report an
approximate value (about 4%) in the text; it is clear that, in the coming years, more precise estimates of
the denominator will become available.
III.1. Generation of timeline plots
III.1A. Single Query
The timeline plots shown in the paper are created by taking the number of appearances of an n-gram in a
given year in the specified corpus and dividing by the total number of words in the corpus in that year.
This yields a raw frequency value. Results are smoothed using a three year window; i.e., the frequency of
13
a particular n-gram in year X as shown in the plots is the mean of the raw frequency value for the n-gram
in the year X, the year X-1, and the year X+1.
Note that for each n-gram in the corpus, we can provide three measures as a function of year of
publication:
1- the number of times it appeared
2- the number of pages where it appeared
3- the number of books where it appeared.
Throughout the paper, we make use only of the first measure; but the two others remain available. They
are generally all in agreement, but can denote distinct cultural effects. These distinctions are not explored
in this paper.
For example, we give in Appendix measures for the frequency of the word 'evolution'. In the first three
columns, we give the number of times it appeared, the normalized number of times it appeared (relative
to #words that year), the normalized number of pages it appeared in, and the normalized number of
books it appeared in, as a function of the date.
III.1B. Multiple Query/Cohort Timelines
Where indicated, timeline plots may reflect the aggregates of multiple query results, such as a cohort of
individuals or inventions. In these cases, the raw data for each query we used to associate each year with
a set of frequencies. The plot was generated by choosing a measure of central tendency to characterize
the set of frequencies (either mean or median) and associating the resulting value with the corresponding
year.
Such methods can be confounded by the vast frequency differences among the various constituent
queries. For instance, the mean will tend to be dominated by the most frequent queries, which might be
several orders of magnitude more frequent than the least frequent queries. If the absolute frequency of
the various query results is not of interest, but only their relative change over time, then individual query
results may be normalized so that they yield a total of 1. This results in a probability mass function for
each query describing the likelihood that a random instance of a query derives from a particular year.
These probability mass functions may then be summed to characterize a set of multiple queries. This
approach eliminates bias due to inter-query differences in frequency, making the change over time in the
cohort easier to track.
III.2. Note on collection of historical and cultural data
In performing the analyses described in this paper, we frequently required additional curated datasets of
various cultural facts, such as dates of rule of various monarchs, lists of notable people and inventions,
and many others. We often used Wikipedia in the process of obtaining these lists. Where Wikipedia is
merely digitizing the content available in another source (for instance, the blacklists of Wolfgang
Hermann), we corrected the data using the original sources. In other cases this was not possible, but we
felt that the use of Wikipedia was justifiable given that (i) the data – including all prior versions - is publicly
available; (ii) it was created by third parties with no knowledge of our intended analyses; and (iii) the
specific statistical analyses performed using the data were robust to errors; i.e., they would be valid as
long as most of the information was accurate, even if some fraction of the underlying information was
wrong. (For instance, the aggregate analysis of treaty dates as compared to the timeline of the
corresponding treaty, shown in the control section, will work as long as most of the treaty names and
dates are accurate, even if some fraction of the records is erroneous.
We also used several datasets from the Encyclopedia Britannica, to confirm that our results were
unchanged when high-quality carefully curated data was used. For the lexicographic analyses, we relied
primarily on existing data from the American Heritage Dictionary.
We avoided doing manual annotation ourselves wherever possible, in an effort to avoid biasing the
results. When manual annotation had to be performed, such as in the classification of samples from our
14
language lexica, we tried whenever possible to have the annotation performed by a third party with no
knowledge of the analyses we were undertaking
III.3. Controls
To confirm the quality of our data in the English language, we sought positive controls in the form of
words that should exhibit very strong peaks around a date of interest. We used three categories of such
words: heads of state („President Truman‟), treaties („Treaty of Versailles‟), and geographical name
change („Byelorussia‟ to „Belarus‟). We used Wikipedia as a primary source of such words, and manually
curated the lists as described below. We computed the timeserie of each n-gram, centered it on the date
of interest (year when the person became president, for instance), and normalized the timeserie by
overall frequency. Then, we took the mean trajectory for each of the three cohorts, and plotted in Figure
S5.
The list of heads of states include all US presidents and British monarchs who gained power in the 19 th or
20 th centuries (we removed ambiguous names, such as „President Roosevelt‟). The list of treaties is taken
from the list of 198 treaties signed in the 19 th or 20 th centuries (S7); but we kept only the 121 names that
referred to only one known treaty, and that have non zero timeseries. The list of country name changes is
taken from Ref S8. The lists are given in APPENDIX.
The correspondence between the expected and observed presence of peaks was excellent. 42 out of 44
heads of state had a frequency increase of over 10-fold in the decade after they took office (expected if
the year of interest was random: 1). Similarly, 85 out of 92 treaties had a frequency increase of over 10-
fold in the decade after they were signed (expected: 2). Last, 23 out of 28 new country names became
more frequent than the country name they replaced within 3 years of the name change; exceptions
include Kampuchea/Cambodia (the name Cambodia was later reinstated), Iran/Persia (Iran is still today
referred to as Persia in many contexts) and Sri Lanka/Ceylon (Ceylon is also a popular tea).
III.4. Lexicon Analysis
III.4A. Estimation of the number of 1-grams defined in leading
dictionaries of the English language.
(a) American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 4th Edition (2000)
We are indebted to the editorial staff of AHD4 for providing us the list of the 153,459 headwords that
make up the entries of AHD4. However, many headwords are not single words (“preferential voting” or
“men‟s room”), and others are listed as many times as there are grammatical categories (“to console”, the
verb; “console”, the piece of furniture).
Among those entries, we find 116,156 unique 1-grams (such as “materialism” or “extravagate”).
15
(b) Webster’s Third New International Dictionary (2002)
The editorial staff communicated to us the number of “boldface entries” of the dictionary, which are taken
to be the number of n-grams defined: 476,330.
The editorial staff also communicated the number of multi-word entries 74,000 out of a total number of
entries 275,000. They estimate a lower bound of multi-word entries at 27% of the entries.
Therefore, we estimate an upper bound of unique 1-grams defined by this dictionary as 0.27*476,330,
which is approximately 348,000.
(c) Oxford English Dictionary (Reference in main text)
From the website of the OED we can read that the “number of word forms defined and/or illustrated” is
615,100; and that we find 169,000 “italicized-bold phrases and combinations”.
Therefore, we estimate an upper bound of the number of unique 1-grams defined by this dictionary as
615,100-169,000 which is approximately 446,000.
III.4B. Estimation of Lexicon Size
How frequent does a 1-gram have to be in order to be considered a word? We chose a minimum
frequency threshold for „common‟ 1-grams by attempting to identify the largest frequency decile that
remains lower than the frequency of most dictionary words.
We plotted a histogram showing the frequency of the 1-grams defined in AHD4, as measured in our year
2000 lexicon. We found that 90% of 1-gram headwords had a frequency greater than 10 -9 , but only 70%
were more frequent than 10 -8 . Therefore, the frequency 10 -9 is a reasonable threshold for inclusion in the
lexicon.
To estimate the number of words, we began by generating the list of common 1-grams with a higher
chronological resolution, namely 11 different time points from 1900 until 2000 (1900, 1910, 1920, ... 2000)
as described above. We next excluded all 1-grams with non-alphabetical characters in order to produce a
list of common alphabetical forms for each time point.
For three of the time points (1900, 1950, 2000), we took a random sample of 1000 alphabetical forms
from the resulting set of alphabetical forms. These were classified by a native English speaker with no
knowledge of the analyses being performed. The results of the classification are found in Appendix. We
asked the speaker to classify the candidate words were classified into 8 categories:
M if the word is a misspelling or a typo or seems like gibberish*
N if the word derives primarily from a personal or a company name
P for any other kind of proper nouns
H if the word has lost its original hyphen
F if the word is a foreign word not generally used in English sentences
B if it is a „borrowed‟ foreign word that is often used in English sentences
R for anything that does not fall into the above categories
U unclassifiable for some reason
We computed the fraction of these 1000 words at each time point that were classified as P, N, B, or R,
which we call the „word fraction for year X‟, or WF X . To compute the estimated lexicon size for 1900,
1950, and 2000, we multiplied the word fraction by the number of alphabetical forms in those years.
For the other 8 time points, we did not perform a separate sampling step. Instead, we estimated the word
fraction by linearly interpolating the word fraction of the nearest sampled time points; i.e., the word
fraction in 1920 satisfied WF 1920 =.WF 1900 +.4*(WF 1950 .- WF 1900 ). We then multiplied the word fraction by the
number of alphabetical forms in the corresponding year, as above.
For the year 2000 lexicon, we repeated the sampling and annotation process using a different native
speaker. The results were similar, which confirmed that our findings were independent of the person
doing the annotation.
We note that the trends shown in Fig 2A are similar when proper nouns (N) are excluded from the lexicon
(i.e., the only categories are P, B and R). Figure S7 shows the estimates of the lexicon excluding the
category „N‟ (proper nouns).
* A typo is a one-time typing error by someone who presumably knows the correct spelling (as in
improtant); a misspelling, which generally has the same pronunciation as the correct spelling, arises when
a person is ignorant of the correct spelling (as in abberation).
16
III.4C. Dictionary Coverage
To determine the coverage of the OED and Merriam-Webster‟s Unabridge Dictionary (MW), we
performed the above analysis on randomly generated subsets of the lexicon in eight frequency deciles
(ranging from 10 -9 – 10 -8 to 10 -3 – 10 -2 ). The samples contained 500 candidate words each for all but the
top 3 deciles; the samples corresponding to the top 3 deciles (10 -5 – 10 -4 , 10 -4 – 10 -3 , 10 -3 – 10 -2 )
contained 100 candidate words each.
A native speaker with no knowledge of the experiment being performed determined which words from our
random samples fell into the P, B, or R categories (to enable a fair comparison, we excluded the N
category from our analysis as both OED an MW exclude them). The annotator then attempted to find a
definition for the words in both the online edition of the Merriam-Webster Unabridged Dictionary or in the
online version of the Oxford English Dictionary‟s 2 nd edition. Notably, the performance of the latter was
boosted appreciably by its inclusion of Merriam-Webster‟s Medical Dictionary. Results of this analysis are
shown in Appendix.
To estimate the fraction of dark matter in the English language, we applied the formula:
sum over all deciles of P word *P OED/MW *N 1gram , with:
- N 1gram the number of 1grams in the decile
- P word the proportion of words (R,B or P) in this decile
- P OED/MW the proportion of words of that decile that are covered in OED or MW.
We obtain 52% of dark matter, words not listed in either MW or the OED. With the procedure above, we
estimate the number of words excluding proper nouns at 572,000; this results in 297,000 words unlisted
in even the most comprehensive commercial and historical dictionaries.
III.4D. Analysis New and Obsolete words in the American Heritage
Dictionary
We obtained a list of the 4804 vocabulary items that were added to the AHD4 in 2000 from the
dictionary‟s editorial staff. These 4804 words were not in AHD3 (1992) – although, on rare occasions a
word could have featured in earlier editions of the dictionary (this is the case for “gypseous”, which was
included in AHD1 and AHD2).
Similar to our study of the dictionary‟s lexicon, we restrict ourselves to 1grams. We find 2077 1-grams
newly added to the AHD4. Median frequency (Fig 2D) is computed by obtaining all frequencies of this set
of words and computing its median.
Next, we ask which 1grams appear in AHD4 but are not part of the year 2000 lexicon any more
(frequency lower than one part per billion between 1990 and 2000). We compute the lexical frequency of
the 1-gram headwords in AHD, and find a small number (2,220) that are not part of the lexicon today. We
show the mean frequency of these 2,220 words (Fig 2F).
III.5. The Evolution of Grammar
III.5A. Ensemble of verbs studied
Our list of irregular verbs was derived from the supplemental materials of Ref 18 (main text). The full list
of 281 verbs is given in Appendix.
Our objective is to study the way word frequency affects the trajectories of the irregular compared with
regular past tense. To do so, we must be confident that
- the 1grams used refer to the verbs themselves: “to dive/dove” cannot be used, as “dove” is a
common noun for a bird. Or, in the verb “to bet/bet”, the irregular preterit cannot be distinguished from the
17
present (or, for that matter, from the common noun “a bet”).
- the verb is not a compound, like “overpay” or “unbind”, as the effect of the underlying verb
(“pay”, “bind”) is presumably stronger than that of usage frequency.
We therefore obtain a list of 106 verbs that we use in the study (marked by the denomination „True‟ in the
column “Use in the study?”)
III.5B. Verb frequencies
Next, for each verb, we computed the frequency of the regular past tense (built by suffixation of „-ed‟ at
the end of the verb), and the frequency of the irregular past tense (summing preterit and past participle).
These trajectories are represented in Fig 3A and Fig S8.
We define the regularity of a verb: at any given point in time, the regularity of a verb is the percentage of
past tense usage made using the regular version. Therefore, in a given year, the regularity of a verb is
r=R/(R+I) where R is the number of times the regular past tense was used, and I the number of times the
irregular past tense was used. The regularity is a continuous variable that ranges between 0 and 1
(100%).
We plot in Figure 3B the mean regularity between 1800-1825 in x-axis, and the mean regularity between
1975-2000 in y-axis.
If we assume that a speaker of the English language uses only one of the two variants (regular or
irregular); and that all speakers of English are equally likely to use the verb; then the regularity translates
directly into percentage of the population of speakers using the regular form. While these assumptions
may not hold generally, they provide a convenient way of estimating the prevalence of a certain word in
the population of English speakers (or writers).
III.5C. Rates of regularization
We can compute, for any verb, the slope of regularity as a function of time: this can be interpreted as the
variation in percentage of the population of English speakers using the regular form.
By holding population size constant over the time window used to obtain the slope, we derive the
variation of population using the regular form in absolute terms.
For instance, the regularity of “sneak/snuck” has decreased from 100% to 50% over the past 50 years,
which is 1% per year. We consider the population of US English speakers to be roughly 300 million. As a
result, snuck is sneaking in at a speed of 3 million speakers per year, or about one speaker per minute in
the US.
III.5D. Classification of Verbs
The verbs were classified into different types based on the phonetic pattern they represented using the
classification of Ref 18 (main text). Fig 3C shows the median regularity for the verbs „burn‟, „spoil‟, „dwell‟,
„learn‟, „smell‟, „spill‟ in each year. We compute the UK rate as above, using 60 million for UK population.
III.6. Collective Memory
One hundred timelines were generated, for every year between 1875 and 1975. Amplitude for each plot
was measured by either computing „peak height‟ – i.e., the maximum of all the plotted values, or „areaunder-the
curve‟ – i.e., the sum of all the plotted values. The peak for year X always occurred within a
18
handful of years after the year X itself. The lag between a year and its peak is partly due to the length of
the authorship and publication process. For instance, a book about the events of 1950 may be written
over the period from 1950-1952 and only published in 1953.
For each year, we estimated the slope of the exponential decay shortly past its peak. The exponent was
estimated using the slope of the curve on a logarithmic plot of frequency between the year Y+5 and the
year Y+25. This estimate is robust to the specific values of the interval, as long as the first value (here,
Y+5) is past the peak of Y, and the second value is in the fifty years that follow Y. The Inset in Figure 4A
was generated using 5 and 25. The half-life could thus be derived.
Half-life can also be estimated directly by asking how many years past the peak elapse before frequency
drops below half its peak value. These values are noisier, but exhibit the same trend as in Figure 4A,
Inset (not shown).
Trends similar to those described here may capture more general events, such as those shown in Figure
S9.
III.7. The Pursuit of Fame
We study the fame of individuals appearing in the biographical sections of Encyclopedia Britannica and
Wikipedia. Given the encyclopedic objective of these sources, we argue these represent comprehensive
lists of notable individuals. Thus, from Encyclopedia Britannica and Wikipedia, we produce databases of
all individuals born between 1800-1980, recording their full name and year of birth. We develop a method
to identify the most common, relevant names used to refer to all individuals in our databases. This
method enables us to deal with potentially complicated full names, sometimes including multiple titles and
middle names. On the basis of the amount of biographical information regarding each individual, we
resolve the ambiguity arising when multiple individuals share some part, or all, their name. Finally, using
the time series of the word frequency of people‟s name, we compare the fame of individuals born in the
same year or having the same occupation.
III.7A) Complete procedure
7.A.1 - Extraction of individuals appearing in Wikipedia.
Wikipedia is a large encyclopedic information source, with an important number of articles referring to
people. We identify biographical Wikipedia articles through the DBPedia engine (Ref S9), a relational
database created by extensively parsing Wikipedia. For our purposes, the most relevant component of
DBPedia is the “Categories” relational database.
Wikipedia categories are structural entities which unite articles related to a specific topic. The DBPedia
“Categories” database includes, for all articles within Wikipedia, a complete listing of the categories of
which this article is a member. As an example, the article for Albert Einstein
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) is a member of 73 categories, including “German physicists”,
“American physicists”, “Violonists”, “People from Ulm” and “1879_births”. Likewise, the article for Joseph
Heller (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Heller) is a member of 23 categories, including “Russian-
American Jews”, “American novelists”, “Catch-22” and “1923_births”.
We recognize articles referring to non-fictional people by their membership in a “year_births” category.
The category “1879_births” includes Albert Einstein, Wallace Stevens and Leon Trotsky ,likewise
“1923_births” includes Henry Kissinger, Maria Callas and Joseph Heller while “1931_births” includes
Michael Gorbachev, Raul Castro and Rupert Murdoch. If only the approximate birth year of a person is
19
known, their article will be a member of a “decade_births” category such as “1890s_births” and
“1930s_births”. We treat these individuals as if born at the beginning of the decade.
For every parsed article, we append metadata relating to the importance of the article within Wikipedia,
namely the size in words of the article and the number of page views which it obtains. The article word
count is created by directly accessing the article using its URL. The traffic statistics for Wikipedia articles
are obtained from http://stats.grok.se/.
Figure S10a displays the number of records parsed from Wikipedia and retained for the final cohort
analysis. Table S7 displays specific examples from the extraction‟s output, including name, year of birth,
year of death, approximate word count of main article and traffic statistics for March 2010.
1) Create a database of records referring to people born 1800-1980 in Wikipedia.
a. Using the DBPedia framework, find all articles which are members of the categories
„1700_births‟ through „1980_births‟. Only people both in 1800-1980 are used for the
purposes of fame analysis. People born in 1700-1799 are used to identify naming
ambiguities as described in section III.7.A.7 of this Supplementary Material.
b. For all these articles, create a record identified by the article URL, and append the birth
year.
c. For every record, use the URL to navigate to the online Wikipedia page. Within the main
article body text, remove all HTML markup tags and perform a word count. Append this
word count to the record.
d. For every record, use the URL to determine the page‟s traffic statistics for the month of
March 2010. Append the number of views to the record.
III.7.A.2 – Identification of occupation for individuals appearing in Wikipedia.
Two types of structural elements within Wikipedia enable us to identify, for certain individuals, their
occupation. The first, Wikipedia Categories, was previously described and used to recognize articles
about people. Wikipedia Categories also contain information pertaining to occupation. The categories
“Physicists”, “Physicists by Nationality”, “Physicists stubs”, along with their subcategories, pinpoint articles
of relating to the occupation of physicist. The second are Wikipedia Lists, special pages dedicated to
listing Wikipedia articles which fit a precise subject. For physicists, relevant examples are “List of
physicists”, “List of plasma physicists” and “List of theoretical physicists”. Given their redundancy, these
two structural elements, when used in combination provide a strong means of identifying the occupation
of an individual.
Next, we selected the top 50 individuals in each category, and annotated each one manually as a function
of the individual‟s main occupation, as determined by reading the associated Wikipedia article. For
instance, “Che Guevara” was listed in Biologists; so even though he was a medical doctor by training, this
is not his primary historical contribution. The most famous individuals of each category born between
1800 and 1920 are given in Appendix.
In our database of individuals, we append, when available, information about the occupations of people.
This enables the comparison, on the basis of fame, of groups of individuals distinguished by their
occupational decisions.
20
2) Associate Wikipedia records of individuals with occupations using relevant Wikipedia
“Categories” and “Lists” pages. For every occupation to be investigated :
a. Manually create a list of Wikipedia categories and lists associated with this defined
occupation.
b. Using the DBPedia framework, find all the Wikipedia articles which are members of the
chosen Wikipedia categories.
c. Using the online Wikipedia website, find all Wikipedia articles which are listed in the body
of the chosen Wikipedia lists.
d. Intersect the set of all articles belonging to the relevant Lists and Categories with the set
of people both 1800-1980. For people in both sets, append the occupation information.
e. Associate the records of these articles with the occupation.
III.7.A.3 - Extraction of individuals appearing in Encyclopedia Britannica.
Encyclopedia Britannica is a hand-curated, high quality encyclopedic dataset with many detailed
biographical entries. We obtained, in a private communication, structured datasets from Encyclopedia
Britannica Inc. These datasets contain a complete record of all entries relating to individuals in the
Encyclopedia Britannica. Each record contains the birth and death of the person at hand, as well as set of
information snippets summarizing the most critical biographical information available within the
encyclopedia.
For the analysis of fame, we extract, from the dataset provided by Encyclopedia Britannica Inc.,
records of individuals born in between 1800 and 1980. For every person, we retain, as a measure of their
notability, a count of the number of biographical snippets present in the dataset. Figure S10b outlines the
number of records parsed from the Encyclopedia Britannica dataset, as well as the number of these
records ultimately retained for final analysis. Table S8 displays examples of records parsed in this step of
the analysis procedure.
3) Create a database of records referring to people born 1800-1980 in Encyclopedia
Britannica.
a. Using the internal database records provided by Encyclopedia Britannica Inc., find all
entries referring to individuals born 1700-1980. Only people both in 1800-1980 are used
for the purposes of fame analysis. People born in 1700-1799 are used to identify naming
ambiguities as described in section III.7.A.7 of this Supplementary Material.
b. For these entries, create a record identified by a unique integer containing the individual‟s
full name, as listed in the encyclopedia, and the individual‟s birth year.
c. For every record, find the number of encyclopedic informational snippets present in the
Encyclopedia Britannica dataset. Append this count to the record.
III.7.A.4 – Produce spelling variants of the full names of individuals.
We ultimately wish to identify the most relevant name used to commonly refer to an individual. Given the
limits of OCR and the specificities of the method used to create the word frequency database, certain
typographic elements such as accents, hyphens or quotation marks can complicate this process. As
such, for every full name present in our database of people, we append variants of the full names where
these typographic elements have been removed or, when possible, replaced. Table S9 presents
examples of spelling variants for multiple names.
21
4) In both databases, for every record, create a set of raw names variants. To create the set:
a. Include the original raw name.
b. If the name includes apostrophes or quotation marks, include a variant where these
elements are removed.
c. If the first word in the name contains a hyphen, include a name where this hyphen is
replaced with a whitespace.
d. If the last word of the name is a numeral, include a name where this numeral has been
removed.
e. For every element in the set which contains non-Latin characters, include a variant where
this characters have been replaced using the closest Latin equivalent.
III.7.A.5 – Find possible names used to refer to individuals.
The common name of an individual sometimes significantly differs from the complete, formal name
present in Encyclopedia Britannica and Wikipedia. This encyclopedia full name can contain details such
as titles, initials and military or nobility standings, which are not commonly used when referring to
individual in most publications. Even in simpler cases, when the full name contains only first, middle and
last names, there exists no systematic convention on which names to use when talking about an
individual. Henry David Thoreau is most commonly referred to by his full name, not “Henry Thoreau” nor
“David Thoreau”, whereas Oliver Joseph Lodge is mentioned by his first and last name “Oliver Lodge”,
not his full name “Oliver Joseph Lodge”.
Given a full name with complex structure potentially containing details such as titles, initials, nobility rights
and ranks, in addition to multiple first and last names, we must extract a list of simple names, using three
words at most, which can potentially be used to refer to this individual. This set of names is created by
generating combinations of names found in the raw name. Furthermore, whenever they appear we
systematically exclude common words such as titles or ranks from these names. The query name sets of
several individuals are displayed in Table S10.
5) For every record, using the set of raw names, create a set of query names. Query names
are (2,3) grams which will be used in order to measure the fame of the individual. The following
procedure is iterated on every raw name variant associated with the record. Steps for which the
record type is not specified are carried out for both.
a. For Encyclopedia Britannica records, truncate the raw name at the second comma,
reorder so that the part of name preceding the first comma follows that succeeding the
comma.
b. For Wikipedia records, replace the underscores with whitespaces.
c. Truncate the name string at the first (if any) parenthesis or comma.
d. Truncate the name string at the beginning of the words „in‟, ‟In‟, ‟the‟, ‟The‟, ‟of‟ and „Of‟, if
these are present.
e. Create the last name set. Iterating from last to first in the words of the name, add the first
name with the following properties:
i. Begin with a capitalized letter.
ii. Longer than 1 character.
iii. Not ending in a period.
iv. If the words preceding this last name are identified as a prefix ('von', 'de', 'van',
'der', 'de' , „d'‟, 'al-', 'la', 'da', 'the', 'le', 'du', 'bin', 'y', 'ibn' and their capitalized
versions ), the last name is a 2gram containing both the prefix.
f. If the last name contains a capitalized character besides the first one, add a variant of
this word where the only capital letter is the first to the set of last names.
g. Create the set of first names. Iterating on the raw name elements which are not part of
the last name set, candidate first names are words with the following properties :
i. Begin with a capital letter.
ii. Longer than 1 character.
iii. Not ending in a period.
iv. Not a title. („Archduke‟, 'Saint', 'Emperor', 'Empress', 'Mademoiselle', 'Mother',
'Brother', 'Sister', 'Father', 'Mr', 'Mrs', 'Marshall', 'Justice', 'Cardinal', 'Archbishop',
'Senator', 'President', 'Colonel', 'General', 'Admiral', 'Sir', 'Lady', 'Prince',
'Princess', 'King', 'Queen', 'de', 'Baron', 'Baroness', 'Grand', 'Duchess', 'Duke',
'Lord', 'Count', 'Countess', 'Dr')
22
h. Add to the set of query names all pairs of “first names + last names” produced by
combining the sets of first and last names.
i. This procedure is carried for every raw name variant.
III.7.A.6 – Find the word match frequencies of all names.
Given the set of names which may refer to an individual, we wish to find the time resolved words
frequencies of these names. The frequency of the name, which corresponds to a measure of how often
an individual is mentioned, provides a metric for the fame of that person. We append the word
frequencies of all the names which can potentially refer to an individual. This enables us, in a later step,
to identify which name is the relevant.
6) Append the fame signal for each query name of each record. The fame signal is the
timeseries of normalized word matches in the complete English database.
III.7.A.7 – Find ambiguous names which can refer to multiple individuals.
Certain names are particularly popular and are shared by multiple people. This results in ambiguity, as
the same query name may refer to a plurality of individuals. Homonimity conflicts occur between a group
of individuals when they share some part of, or all, their name. When these homonimity conflicts arise,
the word frequency of a specific name may not reflect the number of references to a unique person, but to
that of an entire group. As such, the word frequency does not constitute a clear means of tracking the
fame of the concerned individuals. We identify homonimity conflicts by finding instances of individuals
whose names contain complete or partial matches. These conflicts are, when possible, resolved on the
basis of the importance of the conflicted individuals in the following step. Typical homonimity conflicts are
shown in Table S11.
7) Identify homonimity conflicts. Homonimity conflicts arise when the query names of two or more
individuals contain a substring match. These conflicts are distinguished as such :
a. For every query name of every record, find the set of substrings of query names.
b. For every query name of every record, search for matches in the set of query name
substrings of all other records.
c. Bidirectional homonimity conflicts occur when a query name fully matches another query
name. The name conflicted name could be used to refer to both individuals.
Unidirectional conflicts occur when a query name has a substring match within another
query name. Thus, the conflicted name can refer to one of the individuals, but also be
part of a name referring to another.
III.7.A.8 – Resolve, when possible, the most likely origin of ambiguous names.
The problem of homonymous individuals is limiting because the word frequencies data do not allow us to
resolve the true identity behind a homonymous name. Nonetheless, in some cases, it is possible to
distinguish conflicted individuals on the basis of their importance. For the database of people extracted
from Encyclopedia Britannica, we argue that the quantity of information available about an individual
provides a proxy for their relevance. Likewise, for people obtained from Wikipedia, we can judge their
importance by the size of the article written about the person and the quantity of traffic the article
generates. As such, we approach the problem of ambiguous names by comparing the notability of
individuals, as evaluated by the amount of information available about them in the respective
encyclopedic source. Examples of conflict resolution are shown in Table S12 and S13.
8) Resolve homonimity conflicts.
23
a. Conflict resolution involves the decision of whether a query name, associated with
multiple records, can unambiguously refer to a single one of them.
b. Wikipedia. Conflict resolution for Wikipedia records is carried out on the basis the main
article word count and traffic statistics. A conflict is resolved as such :
i. Find the cumulative word count of words written in the articles in conflict.
ii. Find the cumulative number of views resulting from the traffic to the articles in
conflict.
iii. For every record in the conflict, find the fraction of words and views resulting from
this record by dividing by the cumulative counts.
iv. Does a record have the largest fraction of both words written and page views?
v. Does this record have above 66% of either words written and page views?
vi. If so, the conflicted query name can be considered as being sufficiently specific
to the record with these properties.
c. Encyclopedia Britannica. Conflict resolution for Encyclopedia Britannica records is carried
on the basis of the quantity of information snippets present in the dataset.
i. Find the cumulative number of information snippets related to the records in
conflicts.
ii. For every record in the conflict, find the fraction of informational snippets by
dividing with the cumulative count
iii. If a record has greater than 66% of the cumulative total, the query name in
conflict is considered to refer to this record.
III.7.A.9 Identify the most relevant name used to refer to an individual.
So far, we have obtained, for all individuals in both our databases, a set of names by which they can
plausibly be mentioned. From this set, we wish to identify the best such candidate and use its word
frequency to observe the fame of the person at hand. This optimal name is identified on the basis of the
amplitude of the word frequency, the potential ambiguities which arise from name homonimity and the
quality of the word frequency time series. Examples are shown in Fig S11 and S12.
9) Determine the best query name for every record.
a. Order all the query names associated with a record on the basis of the integral of the
fame signal from the year of birth until the year 2000.
b. Iterating from the strongest fame signal to the lowest, the selected query name is the first
result with the following properties :
i. Unambiguously refers to the record (as determined by conflict resolution, if
needed).
ii. The average fame signal in the window [year of birth ± 10 years] is less than 10 -9
or an order of magnitude less than the average fame signal from the year of birth
to the year 2000.
iii. (Wikipedia Only). The query name, when converted to a Wikipedia URL by
replacing whitespaces with underscores, refers to the record or an inexistent
article. If the name refers to another article or a disambiguation page, the query
name is rejected.
c. If the best query name is a 2-gram name corresponding the last two names in 3-gram
query name, and if the fame integral of the 3-gram name is 80% of the fame integral of
the 2-gram, the best query name is replaced by the 3-gram.
24
III.7.A.10 – Compare the fame of multiple individuals.
Having identified the best name candidate for every individual, we use the word frequency time series of
this name as a metric for the fame of the each individual. We now compare the fame of multiple
individuals on the basis of the properties of their fame signal. For this analysis, we group people
according to specific characteristics, which in the context of this work are the years of birth and the
respective occupations.
10) Assemble cohorts on the basis of a shared record property.
a. Fetch all records which match a specific record property, such as year of birth or
occupation.
b. Create fame cohorts comparing the fame of individuals born in the same year.
i. Use average lifetime fame ranking, done on the basis of the average fame as
computed from the birth of the individual to the year 2000.
c. Create fame cohorts for individuals with the same occupation.
i. Use most famous 20 th year, ranking on the basis of the 20 th best year in the
terms of fame for the individual.
III.7B. Cohorts of fame
For each year, we defined a cohort of the top 50 most famous individuals born that year. Individual fame
was measured in this case by the average frequency over all years after one's birth. We can compute
cohorts on the basis of names from Wikipedia, or Encyclopedia Britannica. In Figure 5, we used cohorts
computed with names from Wikipedia.
At each time point, we defined the frequency of the cohort as the median value of the frequencies of all
individuals in the cohort.
For each cohort, we define:
(1) Age of initial celebrity. This is the first age when the cohort's frequency is greater than 10-9. This
corresponds to the point at which the median individual in the cohort enter the English lexicon as
defined in the first section of the paper.
(2) Age of peak celebrity. This is the first age when the cohort's frequency is greater than 95% of its peak
value. This definition is meant to diminish the noise that exists on the exact position of the peak value of
the cohort's frequency.
(3) Doubling time of fame. We compute the exponential rate at which fame increases between the 'age of
fame' and the 'age of peak fame'. To do so, we fit an exponential to the timeseries with the methods of
least squares. The doubling time is derived from the estimated exponent.
(4) Half-life of fame. We compute the exponential rate at which fame decreases past the year at which it
reaches its peak (which is later than the age of peak celebrity as defined above). To do so, we fit an
exponential to the timeseries with the methods of least squares. The half-life is derived from the
estimated exponent.
We show the way these parameters change with the cohort‟s year of birth in Figure S13.
The dynamics of these quantities is sensibly the same when using cohorts from Wikipedia or from
Encyclopedia Britannica. However, Britannica features fewer individuals in their cohorts, and therefore the
cohorts from the early 19 th century are much noisier. We show in Figure S14 the fame analysis
conducted with cohorts from Britannica, restricting our analysis to the years 1840-1950.
In Figure 5E, we analyze the trade-offs between early celebrity and overall fame as a function of
occupation. For each occupation, we select the top 25 most famous individuals born between 1800 and
1920. For each occupation, we define the contour within which all points are close to at least 2 member of
the cohort (it is the contour of the density map created by the cohort).
25
People leave more behind them than a name. Like her fictional protagonist Victor Frankenstein, Mary
Shelley is survived by her creation: Frankenstein took on a life of his own within our collective imagination
(Figure S15). Such legacies, and all the many other ways in which people achieve cultural immortality,
fall beyond the scope of this initial examination.
III.8. History of Technology
A list of inventions from 1800-1960 was taken from Wikipedia (Ref S10).
The year listed is used in our analysis. Where multiple listings of a particular invention appear, the year
retained in the list is the one reported in the main Wikipedia article for the invention. (e.g. Microwave
Oven is listed in 1945 and 1946; the main article lists 1945 as the year of invention, and this is the year
we use in our analyses).
Each entry's main Wikipedia page was checked for alternate terms for the invention. Where alternate
names were listed in the main article (e.g. thiamine or thiamin or vitamin B 1 ), all the terms were
compared for their presence in the database. Where there was no single dominant term (e.g.MSG or
monosodium glutamate) the invention was eliminated from the list. If a name other than the originally
listed one appears to be dominant, the dominant name was used in the analysis (e.g.
electroencephalograph and EEG - EEG is used).
Inventions were grouped into 40-year intervals (1800-1840, 1840-1880, 1880-1920, and 1920-1960), and
the median percentages of peak frequency was calculated for each bin for each year following invention:
these were plotted in Fig 4B, together with examples of individual inventions in inset.
Our study of the history of technology suffers from a possible sampling bias: it is possible that some older
inventions, which peaked shortly after their invention, are by now forgotten and not listed in the Wikipedia
article at all. This sampling bias would be more extreme for the earlier cohorts, and would therefore tend
to exaggerate the lag between invention date and cultural impact in the older invention cohorts. We have
verified that our inventions are past their peaks, in all three cohorts (Fig S16). Future analyses would
benefit from the use of historical invention lists to control for this effect.
Another possible bias is that observing inventions later after they were invented leaves more room for the
fame of these inventions to rise. To ensure that the effect we observe is not biased in this way, we
reproduce the analysis done in the paper using constant time intervals: a hundred years from time of
invention. Because we have a narrower timespan, we consider only technologies invented in the 19 th
century; and we group them in only two cohorts. The effect is consistent with that observed in the main
text (Fig S16).
III.9. Censorship
III.9A. Comparing the influence of censorship and propaganda on
various groups
To create panel E of Fig 6, we analyzed a series of cohorts; for each cohort, we display the mean of the
normalized probability mass functions of the cohort, as described in section 1B. We multiplied the result
by 100 in order to represent the probability mass functions more intuitively, as a percentage of lifetime
26
fame. People whose names did not appear in the cohorts for the time periods in question (1925-1933,
1933-1945, and 1955-1965) were eliminated from the analysis.
The cohorts we generated were based on four major sources, and their content is given in Appendix.
1) The Hermann lists
The lists of the infamous librarian Wolfgang Hermann were originally published in a librarianship journal
and later in Boersenblatt, a publishing industry magazine in Germany. They are reproduced in Ref S11. A
digital version is available on the German-language version of Wikipedia (Ref S12). We considered
digitizing Ref S10 by hand to ensure accuracy, but felt that both OCR and manual entry would be timeconsuming
and error prone. Consequently, we began with the list available on Wikipedia and hired a
manual annotator to compare this list with the version appearing in Ref S11 to ensure the accuracy of the
resulting list. The annotator did not have access to our data and made these decisions purely on the
basis of the text of Ref S11. The following changes were made:
Literature
1) “Fjodor Panfjorow” was changed to “Fjodor Panferov”.
2) “Nelly Sachs” was deleted.
History
1) “Hegemann W. Ellwald, Fr. v.” was changed to “W. Hegemann” and “Fr. Von Hellwald”
Art
4) “Paul Stefan” was deleted.
Philosophy/Religion
1) “Max Nitsche” was deleted.
The results of this manual correction process were used as our lists for Politics, Literature, Literary
History, History, Art-related Writers, and Philosophy/Religion.
27
2) The Berlin list
The lists of Hermann continued to be expanded by the Nazi regime. We also analyzed a version from
1938 (Ref S13). This version was digitized by the City of Berlin to mark the 75 th year after the book
burnings in 2008 (Ref S14). The list of authors appearing on the website occasionally included multiple
authors on a single line, or errors in which the author field did not actually contain the name of a person
who wrote the text. These were corrected by hand to create an initial list.
We noted that many authors were listed only using a last name and a first initial. Our manual annotator
attempted to determine the full name of any such author. The results were far from comprehensive, but
did lead us to expand the dataset somewhat; names with only first initials were replaced by the full name
wherever possible.
Some authors were listed using a pseudonym, and on several occasions our manual annotator was able
to determine the real name of the author who used a given pseudonym. In this case, the real name was
added to the list.
In addition, we occasionally included multiple spelling variants for a single author. Because of this, and
because an author‟s real name and pseudonym may both be included on the list, the number of author
names on the list very slightly exceeds the number of individuals being examined. The numbers reported
in the figure are the number of names on the list.
It is worth pointing out that Adolf Hitler appears as an author of one of the banned books from 1938. This
is due to a French version of Mein Kampf, together with commentary, which was banned by the Nazi
authorities. Although it is extremely peculiar to find Hitler on a list of banned authors, we did not remove
Hitler‟s name, as we had no basis for doing so from the standpoint of the technical authorship and name
criteria described above: Adolf Hitler is indeed listed as the author of a book that was banned by the Nazi
regime. This is consistent with our stance throughout the paper, which is that we avoided making
judgments ourselves that could bias the outcome of our results. Instead, we relied strictly upon our
secondary sources. Because Adolf Hitler is only one of many names, the list as a whole nevertheless
exhibits strong evidence of suppression, especially because the measure we retained (median usage) is
robust to such outliers.
3) Degenerate artists
The list of degenerate artists was taken directly from the catalog of a recent exhibition at the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art which endeavored to reconstruct the original „Degenerate Art‟ exhibition (Ref S15).
4) People with recorded ties to Nazis
The list of Nazi party members was generated in a manner consistent with the occupation categories in
section 7. We included the following Wikipedia categories: Nazis_from_outside_Germany, Nazi_leaders,
SS_officers, Holocaust_perpetrators, Officials_of_Nazi_Germany, Nazis_convicted_of_war_crimes,
together with all of their subcategories, with the exception of Nazis_from_outside_Germany. In addition,
the three categories German_Nazi_politicians, Nazi_physicians, Nazis were included without their
respective subcategories.
III.9B. De Novo Identification of Censored and Suppressed Individuals
We began with the list of 56,500 people, comprising the 500 most famous individuals born in each year
from 1800 – 1913. This list was derived from the analysis of all biographies in Wikipedia described in
section 7. We removed all individuals whose mean frequency in the German language corpus was less
than 5 x 10 -9 during the period from 1925 – 1933; because their frequency is low, a statistical assessment
of the effect of censorship and suppression on these individuals is more susceptible to noise.
The suppression index is computed for the remaining individuals using an observed/expected measure.
The expected fame for a given year is computed by taking the mean frequency of the individual in the
German language from 1925-1933, and the mean frequency of the individual from 1955-1965. These two
values are assigned to 1929 and 1960, respectively; linear interpolation is then performed in order to
compute an expected fame value in 1939. This expected value is compared to the observed mean
frequency in the German language during the period from 1933-1945. The ratio of these two numbers is
the suppression index s. The complete list of names and suppression indices is included as supplemental
data. The distribution of s was plotted for using a logarithmic binning strategy, with 100 bins between 10 -2
and 10 2 . Three specific individuals who received scores indicating suppression in German are indicated
on the plot by arrows (Walter Gropius, Pablo Picasso, and Hermann Maas).
As a point of comparison, the entire analysis was repeated for English; these results are shown on the
plot.
III.9C. Validation by an expert annotator
We wanted to see whether the findings of this high-throughput, quantitative approach were consistent
with the conclusions of an expert annotator using traditional, qualitative methods. We created a list of 100
individuals at the extremes of our distribution, including the names of the fifty people with the largest s
value and of the fifty people with the smallest s value. We hired a guide at Yad Vashem with advanced
degrees in German and Jewish literature to manually annotate these 100 names based on her
assessment of which people were suppressed by the Nazis (S), which people would have benefited from
the Nazi regime (B), and lastly, which people would not obviously be affected in either direction (N). All
100 names were presented to the annotator in a single, alphabetized list; the annotator did not have
access to any of our methods, data, or conclusions. Thus the annotator‟s assessment is wholly
independent of our own.
28
The annotator assigned 36 names to the S category and 27 names to the B category; the remaining 37
were given the ambiguous N classification. Of the names assigned to the S category by the human
annotator, 29 had been annotated as suppressed by our algorithm, and 7 as elevated, so the
correspondence between the annotator and our algorithm was 81%. Of the names assigned to the B
category, 25 were annotated as elevated by our algorithm, and only 2 as suppressed, so the
correspondence was 93%.
Taken together, the conclusions of a scholarly annotator researching one name at a time closely matched
those of our automated approach. These findings confirm that our computational method provides an
effective strategy for rapidly identifying likely victims of censorship given a large pool of possibilities.
III.10. Epidemics
Disease epidemics have a significant impact on the surrounding culture (Fig. S18 A-C). It was recently
shown that during seasonal influenza epidemics, users of Google are more likely to engage in influenzarelated
searches, and that this signature of influenza epidemics corresponds well with the results of CDC
surveillance (Ref S16). We therefore reasoned that culturomic approaches might be used to track
historical epidemics. These could help complement historical medical records, which are often woefully
incomplete.
We examined timelines for 4 diseases: influenza (main text), cholera, HIV, and poliomyelitis. In the case
of influenza, peaks in cultural interest showed excellent correspondence with known historical epidemics
(the Russian Flu of 1890, leading to 1M deaths, the Spanish Flu of 1918, leading to 20-100M deaths; and
the Asian Flu of 1957, leading to 1.5M deaths). Similar results were observed for cholera and HIV.
However, results for polio were mixed. The US epidemic of 1916 is clearly observed, but the 1951-55
epidemic is harder to pinpoint: the observed peak is much broader, starting in the 30s and ending in the
60s. This is likely due to increased interest in polio following the election of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in
1932, as well as the development and deployment of Salk‟s polio vaccine in 1952 and Sabin‟s oral
version in 1962. These confounding factors highlight the challenge of interpreting timelines of cultural
interest: interest may increase in response to an epidemic, but it may also respond to a stricken celebrity
or a famous cure.
The dates of important historical epidemics were derived from the Cambridge World History of Human
Diseases (1993) 3 rd Edition.
For cholera, we retained the time periods which most affected the Western world, according to this
resource:
- 1830-35 (Second Cholera Epidemic)
- 1848-52, and 1854 (Third Cholera Epidemic)
- 1866-74 (Fourth Cholera Epidemic)
- 1883-1887 (Fifth Cholera Epidemic)
The first, sixth and seventh cholera epidemics appear not to have caused significant casualties in the
Western world.

are found from time to time used in a regular form, but those used more often tend to be used in a
regular way more rarely. This is illustrated in the top two rows with the frequently-used verb “find” and
the less often encountered “dwell”. In the third row, the trajectory of “thrive” is one of many ways by
which regularization occurs. The bottom two panels shows that the regularization of “spill” happened
earlier in the US than in the UK.

‘Franklin Delano Roosevelt’ (green), who had been paralyzed by polio in 1936 (green shading), as well as
by the development of the ‘polio vaccine’ (red) in 1952. The vaccine ultimately eradicated ‘infantile
paralysis’ in the United States.

"
IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011476.txt,"The challenge now, I told my exhausted team, was to make sure we were
prepared for this new reality. Part of the spadework was already in place. Much
as I’d hoped that Arafat and I could turn a new page in Middle East history, I
had directed our army chief-of-staff, nine months before the summit, to draw up
contingency plans for the likelihood of an unprecedentedly deadly eruption of
Palestinian violence if we were to fail.

Now, I felt we had to go even further, and to prepare a proactive alternative
to the negotiated deal we’d been unable to secure. I proposed considering a
unilateral Israeli pullout from the West Bank and Gaza. The territorial terms
would, necessarily, be less far-reaching than the proposal Arafat had rejected.
But I felt we should still withdraw from the great majority of the land we had
captured in 1967, still leaving the Palestinians an area which the outside world
would recognize as wholly sufficient for them to establish a viable, successful
state.

And crucially, this would finally give Israel, our country, a delineated, final
border with the territory captured in the Six-Day War.

Gili, clearly uneasy about accepting the idea that the chances for a negotiated
peace were definitively gone, left to try to get some sleep on the long flight
ahead. Danny and Shlomo Ben-Ami as well. Within an hour or so, the plane
was full of irregularly slumped bodies, the silence broken only by the drone of
the 707’s engines and the occasional sound of snoring.

I sat, wide awake, in one of the seats at the front.

My sleeping habits were another inheritance from Sayveret Matkal. During
those years, nearly everything of significance which I did had happened after
sundown. The commando operations were, of course, set for darkness whenever
possible. The element of surprise could mean the difference between success
and failure, indeed life and death. But all of my planning, all my thinking,
tended to happen at night as well. The quiet, and the lack of distractions, helped
to discipline my mind. I found that it helped to free my mind as well, sometimes
only to discover that it went off in unexpected directions.

It did so now. Perhaps even I was still reluctant to accept that Camp David
meant that the opportunity for a transformative deal with Arafat was finished.
Yet whatever the reason, I began thinking back to the first time that my path and
his had crossed. It was in the spring of 1968, nearly a year after Israel had
defeated the armies of our three main Arab enemies — Egypt, Syria and Jordan.
Israeli forces were advancing on a Jordanian town called Karameh, across the

pointed out that the human brain is the result of billions of years of evolution.*°> Human
intelligence is not the special characteristic we think it is, but just another survival
mechanism not unlike our digestive or immune systems, both of which are also
amazingly complex. Intelligence evolved because it allowed us to make sense of the
world around us, to plan ahead, and thus cope with all sorts of unexpected things in order
to survive. However, as Descartes stated, we humans define our very existence by our
ability to think. So it is not surprising that, in an anthropomorphic way, our fears about
AI reflect this belief that our intelligence is what makes us special.

But if we step back and look at life on Earth, we see that we are far from the most
resilient species. If we’re going to be taken over at some point, it will be by some of
Earth’s oldest life-forms, like bacteria, which can live anywhere from Antarctica to deep-
sea thermal vents hotter than boiling water, or in acid environments that would melt you
and me. So when people ask where we’re headed, we need to put the question in a
broader context. I don’t know what sort of future AI will bring: whether AI will make
humans subservient or obsolete or will be a useful and welcome enhancement of our
abilities which will enrich our lives. But I am reasonably certain that computers will
never be the overlords of bacteria.

So the really shocking thing this year is that the only major economy in the world where

° For companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter, their main revenue streams are

This conversion is not so dependent on the growth of GDP, because they are still in the
process of converting ads of different formats to digital ads, and that's something that will
continue, regardless of GDP growth.

The bottom line: Tech companies that have long been the darlings of investor portfolios
will likely find themselves in much weaker positions.

a “Preventing Litigation” project, working with agencies on ways to reduce their
chances of a request resulting in litigation.

GAO recommended that OGIS establish a time frame for completing and
implementing a methodology that defines, among other things, the scope,

FOIA policies, procedures, and compliance. OGIS had already begun creating
a draft assessment framework, which will form one piece of OGIS’s expanded

adequately established and meets Congress’s intent. The IG report,
completed in September 2012, found that OGIS meets the requirements set

V.I. businesses face higher unemployment taxes
as territory struggles to pay down $69 million debt

By BRIAN O’CONNOR
Daily News Staff

Territory business owners will pay
four times the normal federal unem-
ployment tax rate this year because
of an unpaid government debt, docu-
ments show.

The federal unemployment insur-
ance tax rate is traditionally 6 per-
cent on the first $7,000 an employee
makes. However, the federal govern-
ment usually offers a credit of 5.4
percent, meaning most employers ac-
tually pay about 0.6 percent, accord-
ing to the IRS.

States — and territories — with
unemployment insurance programs
meeting federal standards are re-
quired to meet their unemployment
obligations. When a state can’t meet
its unemployment obligations, it’s
entitled to take loans from the Fed-
eral Unemployment Insurance Trust
Fund.

Federal documents show only one
state and one jurisdiction — Califor-
nia and the U.S. Virgin Islands — are
currently in that position.

The territory owes $69,138,266.61
in loans, according to the U.S. De-
partment of Treasury website.

In fiscal year 2017, which be-
gan Oct. 1, the loans have accrued
$294,349.15 in interest payments
alone.

The VI. Labor Department is in
charge of administering unemploy-
ment insurance. Labor Commission-
er Catherine Hendry did not return a
number of phone calls seeking com-
ment.

Government House spokeswoman
Cherie Munchez would not com-
ment, saying that Hendry would issue
a prepared statement about the debt
by Wednesday.

Provisions of the Federal Unem-
ployment Tax Act stipulate that in
states or territories with outstanding
balances in the fund, businesses are
subject to a credit reduction, which is
collected and directed toward the un-
paid balance, according to Robert Pa-
vosevich, Supervisor of the Actuarial
Team in the Office of Unemployment

Insurance’s Division of Fiscal and
Actuarial Services in the Department
of Labor.

Virgin Islands business owners
will pay the original 0.6 percent, plus
an additional 1.8 percent caused by
the unpaid balance, for a total of 2.4
percent, Pavosevich said.

At the fully discounted rate, an
employer would pay $42 for each
employee earning $7,000. At the Vir-
gin Islands rate, employers will have
to pay $168.

After two years with an unpaid
balance, the discount decreases by
0.3 percent each year until the total
discount disappears, Pavosevich said.

“It’s capped at 6 percent,” Pavosev-
ich said.

At the full 6 percent, employers
will have to pay $420 for each new
employee earning $7,000 that comes
on board. By law, that money can’t
come out of the wages themselves
and is paid out of the profits or losses
that employers face, said Charles
Engeman, an attorney who served on
the Unemployment Insurance Advi-
sory Council under the administra-
tion of Goy. John deJongh Jr.

Without payment on the loan — or
waivers or relief, which has happened
three times since 2013 — the rate is
scheduled to max out by 2028. That’s
barring the imposition of step in-
creases, which can happen if the state
has an outstanding balance for a cer-
tain number of years, or if — as was
the case in the tax year 2012 — step
increases are piled on by other provi-
sions of the law, which could move
the unemployment tax rate up faster.

“Tt looks like they’re not making
much headway,” Pavosevich said, re-
ferring to the territory’s debt.

The territory wasn’t alone in 2011,
the first year the rate went up. In all,
20 states and the Virgin Islands re-
ceived a 0.3 percent credit reduction
that year, federal documents show.

That’s in part because of the linger-
ing effects of the Great Recession,
said Bennett Chan, a lawyer who
represents several businesses and has
worked with the St. Thomas-St. John
Chamber of Commerce in the past.

| don’t think there’s enough political willpower to do
the kinds of thing necessary to fix the system.

— Charles Engeman,

an attorney who served on the Unemployment Insurance Advisory
Council under the administration of Gov. John deJongh Jr.

The business owners always bear the brunt of
whatever deficiencies we have. We have to, at some
point, find other sources of revenue for the
government. Any time there's any sort of additional
tax burden, fee burden, licensing burden, it’s always

a point of concern.

— Kimberly McCollum,

president of the St. Croix Chamber of Commerce

In general terms, states collected
more money than they paid out dur-
ing the years leading up to the 2008
market collapse, creating large sur-
pluses. Sometimes those surpluses
were subject to financial raids. Other
times — as was the case in the ter-
ritory — the surpluses were used as
a cause to reduce the amounts col-
lected for unemployment insurance.
When large-scale unemployment hit
as a result of the recession, surpluses
turned into deficits, Chan said.

“A lot of states were blindsided
by the Great Recession,’ Chan said.
“They also had big surpluses and
never foresaw that there would be
this sudden inflow in unemployment
claims.”

Territorial officials were late in re-
acting to bring the rate back up to ad-
dress the issue, Chan said.

“Tf we had done it earlier, we prob-
ably would have collected enough,”
he said. “Now they want to make it
up when times are hard.”

In many cases, the government
can’t say what each employer owes

or has paid in surplus, Engeman said.

The system originally was set up so
that employers faced a roller coaster,
Engeman said.

Each employer had a rate based
on a three-year average. If an em-
ployer’s account paid out more in
benefits than they contributed, the
rate would go up to 5.4 percent. After
three years, the employer's rate would
drop down to 0.1 percent, because at
5.4 percent, the rate exceeded likely
contributions.

At 0.1 percent, if anyone were laid
off, it immediately moved the em-
ployer back to the 5.4 percent rate.
Employers would oscillate between
the 5.4 percent rate and the 0.1 per-
cent rate.

“Tt was 5.4 for many employers,
and that’s what an average employer
would pay out over the course of 17
years for one employee,” Engeman
said.

As a result, the unemployment
insurance fund accumulated large
surpluses. To reduce the surpluses,
the VI. Labor Department dropped

the automatic increase based on a
negative account, and lowered the
minimum rate to 0. Less money came
in, even as unemployment rates re-
mained high and benefits remained
expensive.

A few steps could help move
the system back to sound footing,
Engeman said. For example, better
record-keeping would help reduce
delinquencies. Reducing unem-
ployment insurance benefits and
reducing the amount of time the
unemployed are eligible for unem-
ployment would both help. Verify-
ing that those collecting unemploy-
ment are seeking employment, and
generally reducing fraud also would
help, Engeman said.

“T don’t think there’s enough politi-
cal willpower to do the kinds of thing
necessary to fix the system,” he said.

Chamber of Commerce officials
on both islands decried any increase
in taxes or fees for businesses.

“Despite what the governor and
the senators think, the economy of
the Virgin Islands is not doing that
well,” said Tom Brunt III, a member
of the St. Thomas-St. John Chamber
of Commerce Board of Directors.

Kimberly McCollum, president of
the St. Croix Chamber of Commerce,
said any increases to fees or taxes was
worrying.

“The business owners always bear
the brunt of whatever deficiencies we
have,” she said. “We have to, at some
point, find other sources of revenue
for the government. Any time there’s
any sort of additional tax burden, fee
burden, licensing burden, it’s always
a point of concern.”

The folly of the situation is com-
pounded by the fact that business
owners themselves aren’t allowed to
file for unemployment if they lose
their jobs, McCollum said.

“You're still paying unemployment
taxes on what you’re paid, but you are
not allowed to request compensation
should you find yourself in a position
to file for unemployment,” she said.

idea” that the letter would be used politically. But that simply isn’t true, since the request to
Justice O’ Connor—stating that it would be “beneficial” to have a letter from her as part of a
Republican proposal to enact a Christian Nation resolution—made it clear that she was being
asked to write her letter specifically for use in a political campaign.

When I got wind of Justice O’Connor’s letter, I wrote a scathing op ed for the New York Times
criticizing her judicial ethics as well as her miscitation of the law.

Justice Sandra Day O'Connor has again deplorably allowed her name and judicial office to
be used for partisan political purposes.

In 1987, she agreed to conduct a private briefing in the Supreme Court for Republicans
who contributed at least $10,000 to a political-action group. She canceled it after leading
ethics experts publicly criticized her actions as violating the Code of Judicial Conduct -
but not until after her name had been used in the fund-raising solicitation.

Justice O'Connor recently complied with a request from an arch-conservative Arizona
Republican friend who had asked her to write a letter in support of a proposed party
resolution declaring the United States to be a Christian Nation . . . based on the absolute
law of the Bible.

I then described what she had done and the phony excuse she had offered in defense: that she
“had no idea” her letter would be used politically. My op ed concluded:

Not only was Justice O'Connor's letter used in that [political] campaign, its miscitation of
cases was relied on in the resolution enacted by the Arizona Republican Party. That
resolution begins, Whereas the Supreme Court of the United States has three holdings to
the effect that this is a Christian nation . . . . It then cites the decisions provided by Justice
O'Connor and declares that we are a Christian Nation, and that the Constitution created
a republic based upon the absolute laws of the Bible, not a democracy.

Justice O'Connor has twice given aid and comfort to partisan Republican causes. Both
times her regrets came too late and only after public criticism. She has twice allowed her
name and judicial office to be used improperly. She has twice violated the Code of Judicial
Conduct, which unambiguously directs sitting judges to refrain from political activity,
including making speeches for a political organization and participating in political fund
raising.

A seat on the Supreme Court does not exempt a Justice from complying with the rules of
the profession. Justice O'Connor must remember that her allegiances are no longer to a
particular wing of the Arizona Republican Party but to all Americans, regardless of party
affiliation, region or religion.

I was told by several law clerks that after my op ed appeared, she was deeply embarrassed by
what she had done and has not repeated the errors of her way during her subsequent years of
service on the Court.

must first cut through the skull, a two-millimeter thick protective
layer of bone. The adult human skull has almost no gaps in it, and the
only ways into the brain without a bone saw are through the eye sockets
or the soft area of bone at the back of the nose. Egyptian mummies had
their brains removed through the nose and preserved in a jar for the
afterlife!

P hysically the human brain is very boring. Alan Turing described it

Thinking with Porridge

Protecting the brain is very important and the skull does a good job
by being a tough, impenetrable barrier. But sometimes this toughness
backfires. In 2009, Richard Hammond, one of the presenters of the TV
motoring series Top Gear, suffered a crash while testing a land speed
record-breaking car. Although he was in a multipoint harness, the
crash, at over 200 miles per hour, bounced his helmeted head around
the inside of the cockpit and his brain was badly bruised. As you know
from experience, when you bruise you get swelling, and the brain is
no exception. However, the brain is encased in bone, so this swelling
has nowhere to escape. The resulting buildup of pressure is dangerous,
causing an interruption of blood supply to the un-bruised parts. Brain
damage in such accidents is often fatal; Richard Hammond was very
lucky to live through the experience.

Surgeons often need to cut into the skull to relieve pressure on
the brain, or to gain access to remove tumors. Going through the scalp
involves a great deal of blood, but once you have a clean hole in the skull
you can peel back the thin membranes, called the meninges, to reveal a
wrinkly folded whitish thing that looks a bit like a cauliflower. This is the
outer surface of the brain where much of our thinking is done. Unfolded,
this surface layer would cover the area of a football field and this intense
folding distinguishes the human brain from the brains of simpler animals.
Some animals, such as elephants and dolphins, have larger brains than
ours, but the area of their folded surface is considerably smaller. It is
thought that this efficient folding is key to giving us the ability to think
complex thoughts.

Analysis of Einstein’s brain held at Princeton University shows it
is not particularly massive, but it is strikingly more folded than average,
and has a shorter lateral sulcus - the fissure between the front and back

you've just made, if you want to give me guidance, I'll tell
you what I'm thinking with respect to this and what we put

Forth in our filing.

But there are statements that are attributed to my

client in other articles and things. For example, there ar

statements about Bill Clinton being on the island, and the
defense wants to bring in those statements to show that -- they
believe they can show evidence that he wasn't on the island, so
therefore, my client is a liar or is lying about that.

Now, your Honor will remember, back in June we sought

to depose him because we were concerned about that fact, that

they were going to raise it, and we wanted to have him under

oath --
THE COURT: Let's back up a little bit.
MS. McCAWLEY: Sure.
THE COURT: What and where was the statement made?
MS. McCAWLEY: The statement was made in a March 5th
article. So not the two articles we showed you yesterday --

COURT: The Churcher article.

MS. McCAWLEY: Yes. But it was another article that
came out in March of 2011.

damaging documents than had Manning. He therefore would have been aware that by revealing
state secrets that he had sworn to protect, he would be risking imprisonment unless, unlike
Manning, he fled the country. His motives, no matter how noble they might be, would not spare
him, anymore than it spared the other six, from determined federal prosecution.

To be sure, the view of those on the Snowden side of the divide is not grounded in legal
definitions, but in a broader notion of morality. Snowden‘s supporters do not accept that the law
should be applied in this fashion to Snowden. They argue that Snowden had a moral imperative to
act, even if it meant breaking the law. They fully accepted his view that he had a higher duty to
protect citizens of all countries in the world from, as he put it, “secret pervasive surveillance.”
That higher duty transcended him any narrower legal definitions of law-breaking. For example,
Ben Wizner, a lawyer from the American Civil Liberties Union who represented Snowden since
November 2013, argues that Snowden’s taking of classified documents was as “act of
conscience” that overrode any legal constraints because it “revitalized democratic oversight in the
U.S.” And, without question, Snowden’s theft caused a much needed debate on govern
surveillance.

In this ends- justify-the-means view, any person with access to government secrets can
authorize himself or herself to reveal those secrets to the world if it serves the public good and
because doing so would be an “act of conscience,” he or she should be immune from legal
prosecution.

So for Snowden’s supporters, his “act of conscience” justifies his claim to being a whistle-
blower even though the preponderance of the secrets disclosed by Snowden had to do with the
NSA’s authorized activity of using its multi-billion dollar global arrays of sensors to intercept data
in foreign countries and share it with some 30 allied intelligence services, as it did in 2013.
Snowden, for example, took the NSA to task for its sharing information with Israel. In an
interview in Moscow with James Bamford for Wired Magazine in August 2014, Snowden
describes supplying intelligence to Israel as “One of the biggest abuses we’ve seen.” He was
referring to the NSA providing the Israeli Cyber Service, known as Unit 8200, with data
concerning Arab communications in Gaza, the West Bank, and Lebanon. But providing Israel
with such data, as well as providing it with lethal weaponry, was not some rogue operation. It
was part of a policy that had been approved by every American President—and every
Congress—since 1948. Snowden had every right to disagree with this established US policy of
aiding Israel with intelligence, but it is another matter to release secret documents to support his
view. If the concept of whistle blowing is expanded to cover intelligence workers who steal
secrets because they disagree with their government’s foreign policy of their government, it
would also have to include many notorious spies, such as Kim Philby.

Snowden’s concept of whistle-blowing also applied to NSA’s spying on adversary nations.
“We’ve crossed lines.” Snowden said in regard to China, “We’re hacking universities and
hospitals and wholly civilian infrastructure.” The NSA’s operations against China were such “a

places, it is possible to live well while spending little. I spend less in Tokyo than in California because I
know it well. Hip, recently gentrified artist areas, not unlike the Brooklyn of 10 years ago, can be found
in almost all cities. The one place I can’t seem to find a decent lunch for less than $20 U.S.? London.

Here are a few exotic places I don’t recommend for vagabonding virgins, though veterans can make
them all work: all countries in Africa, the Middle East, or Central and South America (excepting Costa
Rica and Argentina). Mexico City and Mexican border areas are also a bit too kidnap-happy to make it
onto my favorites list.

4. Prepare for your trip. Here’s the countdown.

=» Three months out— Eliminate

Get used to minimalism before the departure. Here are the questions to ask and act upon, even if you
never plan to leave:

What is the 20% of my belongings that I use 80% of the time? Eliminate the other 80% in clothing,
magazines, books, and all else. Be ruthless— you can always repurchase things you can’t live without.

Which belongings create stress in my life? This could relate to maintenance costs (money and energy),
insurance, monthly expenses, time consumption, or simple distraction. Eliminate, eliminate, eliminate. If
you sell even a few expensive items, it could finance a good portion of your mini-retirement. Don’t rule
out the car and home. It’s always possible to purchase either upon your return, often losing no money in
the process.

Check current health insurance coverage for extended overseas travel. Get the wheels in motion to
rent, swap, or sell your home—renting out is most recommended by serial vagabonds—or end your
apartment lease and move all belongings into storage.

In all cases where doubts crop up, ask yourself, “If I had a gun to my head and had to do it, how
would I do it?” It’s not as hard as you think.

= Two months out— Automate

After eliminating the excess, contact companies (including suppliers) that bill you regularly and set up
autopayment with credit cards that have reward points. Telling them that you will be traveling the world
for a year often persuades them to accept credit cards rather than chase you around the planet like
Carmen Sandiego.

For the credit card companies themselves and others that refuse, arrange automatic debit from your
checking account. Set up online banking and bill payment. Set up all companies that won’t take credit
cards or automatic debit as online payees. Set these scheduled checks for $15—20 more than expected
when dealing with utilities and other variable expenses. This will cover miscellaneous fees, prevent time-
consuming billing problems, and accrue as a credit. Cancel paper bank and credit card statement
delivery. Get bank-issued credit cards for all checking accounts— generally one for business and one for
personal—and set the cash advances to $0 to minimize abuse potential. Leave these cards at home, as
they are just for emergency overdraft protection.

Give a trusted member of your family and/or your accountant power of attorney, which gives that
person authority to sign documents (tax filings and checks, for example) in your name. Nothing screws

Subject: Oscar Diary 
It's Thursday morning on Wilshire Boulevard and the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences has just 
opened it's doors for ticket pick-up for the 85th Oscar telecast. 
Forty voting members, the distinguished director Norman Jewison and I are on a long single file line that 
snakes thru the lobby patiently waiting to go upstairs to pick up our tickets. My seats were awarded via 
a lottery system. We clutch our photo I.D. 
Suddenly, a messenger slips in wearing a smart khaki windbreaker and cuts through the line. He announces 
to the uniformed guard in a stage whisper, Dreamworks, and as if Steven Spielberg himself had just 
delivered the Gettysburg address, is ushered upstairs. 
That is the final act of social justice of the Lincoln campaign. 
I am sleep deprived and jet lagged having just spent six hours on a flight sitting next Paula Wagner who 
is Tom Cruise's ex-agent turned Broadway producer for Jessica Chastain's The Heiress. We discuss 
Jessica's not so great chances to beat Jennifer Lawrence for Best Actress. I mention Harvey Weinstein's 
concern about Emmanuel Riva's last minute surge. The French phenomena doesn't speak English, has never 
been to L.A. and it's like voting for a ghost, even on her 86th birthday. 
This is the year I got phone calls in September from top studio executives announcing each are winning 
the Oscar. Their euphoric giddiness is due to the quality of the films resulting in the priciest oscar 
campaigns on record and astounding audience support at the theaters. 
Seven of the nine best picture nominees have taken in well over $100 million at the domestic box office 
to date, but it's the worldwide numbers in the millions that are staggering. 
Twentieth Century Fox's Life of Pi caused a tsunami at $595, 
Universal's Les Miserables scored $412, the Weinstein Cos.' Django Unchained whipped up $395, 
DreamWorks' Lincoln delivered at $254, Warner's Argo captured $219, Weinstein's Silver Lining 
Playbook danced to $187 and Sony's Zero Dark Thirty killed at $107 million. 
In comparison, Sony Classics' Amour received $19 and Fox Searchlights' Beast of the Southern Wild 
worked up $19 million. 
Hugh audiences having actually seen the films this year have an ear for the nuances of the Oscar race and 
everyone including Ben Affleck follow the bloggers religiously. 
So by Thursday morning on line at the Academy the informed buzz was as follows: Argo takes best 
picture because is was most entertaining. The director snub to Ben Affleck was a Godsend as George 
Clooney's advice came from far away Berlin where he was in pre-production on The Monuments Men. 
Warner's president Sue Kroll kept the campaign clean and calm on the home front. 
Lincoln's victory is Daniel Day Lewis from day one of shooting, no pun intended. The suggestion that 
Obama is our answer to Lincoln was interesting. Voters knew Obama secretly hosted three screenings in the 
White House, but they weren't invited. The Hollywood Foreign press were the biggest winners with Bill 
Clinton's surprise appearance on their broadcast. DreamWorks' ran an impeccable patriotic campaign that 
the media ate up. 
The best director race had the most drama. Hollywood dreaded Spielberg loosing to Ang Lee. (Eventually 
everyone was thrilled Steven was anointed president of the Cannes Jury for 2013 the day after the awards 
show.) 
The voters knew beloved Ang Lee's three year boat ride was the technical miracle. Fox's $595 million 
international box office blew in the win. 
Harvey Weinstein having three horses running is always the most talked about. His loquacious Quentin 
Tarentino was a lock for screenplay. Best supporting actor was a total toss up with a sentimental edge 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031118 
to Robert DeNiro. We even applauded Bob putting his handprints in cement in front of Grauman's Chinese 
Theater. 
The conversations continued about how our government put the cabasch on Zero Dark Thirty with their 
arrogant denial of enhanced interrogation. Even MPAA President Chris Dodd could not help Mark Boal, 
Katherine Bigalow and Amy Pascal. 
Additional chatter was the renewed last minute love for Les Miserables. Clearly the most polarizing 
film in the race, this 27 year old theatrical musical seen by 60 million fans is now the talk of the 
Oscar weekend. 
Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, Russell Crowe, Amanda Segfried, Eddie Redmayne, Sasha Baron Cohen, Helena 
Bonham Carter and Samanthe Barks are making an historic one time live performance as part of Sunday's 
television broadcast. Producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron's will attempt to razzel dazzel us with an 
homage to movie musicals for three plus hours at the Dolby theater. 
Barbra Streisand, Adele and Shirley Basse's appearances also create high anxiety and a blood bath for 
tickets...hence the hysteria created by DreamWorks' messenger cutting the line. 
After checking into the iconic Beverly Hills Hotel, my home away from home for 30 years of Oscar weekends 
and meticulously laying out all the ensembles sent from Valentino and Ralph Rucci, I hit the party 
circuit overdressed for life. 
Daisy... I can do this...fairly easily now...but I have a lunch at 12:30pm and important meetings. I am 
so distraught about all this pressure. I am calling you now. Peggy

“because for him, Jerusalem was sacred from a strictly national and historic point
of view.” It was for me as well. In fact, I think its religious significance probably
resonated more strongly. Still, the major change from the summit was that even
those Israelis who found a compromise on Jerusalem unacceptable recognized that,
if they did want to negotiate a definitive end to the conflict, talking about it was
unavoidable.

At least for now, however, there wasn’t going to be a peace deal. As our El Al
707 descended over the Mediterranean for our approach back to Ben-Gurion
Airport, I faced the more immediate issue of ensuring my government survived.
This was partly in case, against all odds, Arafat showed a readiness to revive the
search for peace — but also because of the real prospect he would choose violence
instead.

Since the Knesset was about to go into recess until late October, I would have a
three-month window to reshape and stabilize my coalition — but only if we could
weather a no-confidence motion introduced by Arik Sharon after Camp David. We
did weather it, barely. Arik needed a majority of the Knesset’s 120 seats to bring
down the government. The vote ended in a 50-50 tie. The other 20 MKs abstained,
or didn’t show up. This was not because of any enthusiasm for my efforts to get an
agreement at Camp David, but because of a /ack of enthusiasm for an early
election in which they feared losing seats.

Still, that did allow me to focus on the challenge of the inevitably altered
situation with Arafat after the summit’s collapse. My main concern was the
possibility of violence. Even before returning home, I’d phoned Shaul Mofaz and
Avi Dichter, the former Sayeret Matkal officer who was now head of the Shin Bet.
“Let’s hope the violence doesn’t come,” I told them. “But if it does, make sure we
are ready.” Though there was no sign of violence in the weeks immediately after
the summit, there was equally little sign of diplomatic engagement by Arafat.
Obviously relieved at the way Camp David had ended, he returned to Gaza to a
hero’s welcome, proudly proclaiming that he had refused to “give up” Jerusalem. It
was vintage Arafat: the “general” in his starched uniform and kefiyeh, fresh from

— Example task: The robot should learn to clean up and put away its toys when it’s
done playing with them.
e Social Communication
— Example task: The robot should greet new human entrants into the lab, but if it
knows the new entrants very well and it’s busy, it may eschew the greeting
e Social Inference about simple social relationships
— Example task: The robot should infer that Cassio and Ben are friends because they
often enter the lab together, and often talk to each other while they are there
Group Play at loosely-organized activities
— Example task: The robot should be able to participate in “informally kicking a ball
around” with a few people, or in informally collaboratively building a structure with
blocks

12. Communication

e Gestural communication to achieve goals and express emotions
— Example task: If the robot is asked where the red ball is, it should be able to show
by pointing its hand or finger
Verbal communication using English in its life-context
— Example tasks: Answering simple questions, responding to simple commands, de-
scribing its state and observations with simple statements
Pictorial Communication regarding objects and scenes it is familiar with
— Example task: The robot should be able to draw a crude picture of a certain tower
of blocks, so that e.g the picture looks different for a very tall tower and a wide low
one
e Language acquisition
— Example task: The robot should be able to learn new words or names via people
uttering the words while pointing at objects exemplifying the words or names
Cross-modal communication
— Example task: If told to touch Bob’s knee but the robot doesn’t know what a
knee is, being shown a picture of a person and pointed out the knee in the picture
should help it figure out how to touch Bob’s knee

neous) sets of objects
e Simple, grounded arithmetic with small numbers
— Example task: Learning simple facts about the sum of integers under 10 via teaching,
reinforcement and imitation
e Comparison of observed entities regarding quantitative properties
— Example task: Ability to answer questions about which object or person is bigger
or taller

copy of Epstein’s proposed state plea agreement and learned that the plea was scheduled for 8:30
a.m., Monday, June 30, 2008. AUSA Villafafia called Edwards to provide notice to his clients
regarding the hearing. AUSA Villafafia did not tell Attorney Edwards that the guilty pleas in
state court would bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea
agreement. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit “N”, at 96.

36. Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771, victims of
federal crimes — including E.W. and L.M. — are entitled to basic rights during any plea
bargaining process, including the right to be treated with fairness, the right to confer with
prosecutors regarding any plea, and the right to be heard regarding any plea. The process that
was followed leading to the non-prosecution of Epstein violated these rights of E.W. and L.M.
See Emergency Petn. for Victim’s Enforcement of Crime Victim’s Rights, No. 9:08-CV-80736-
KAM (S.D. Fla. 2008) (Exhibit “P”).

37. Because of the violation of the CVRA, on July 7, 2008, Edwards filed an action in
the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Case No. 9:08-CV-80736, seeking to
enforce the rights of E.W. and L.M. That action alleged that the U.S. Attorney’s Office had
failed to provide E.W. and L.M. the rights to which they were entitled under the Act, including
the right to be notified about a plea agreement and to confer with prosecutors regarding it. See

CVRA action. It was only at this hearing that both victims learned for the first time that the plea

deal was already done with Epstein and that the criminal case against Epstein had been

her back to the United States for Epstein.

32. I did the massage training in Chiang Mai. While I
was there, I met a great and special guy and told him hon-
estly what I was being forced to do. He told me I should get
out of it. I told him that the people I was working for were
very powerful and that I could not walk away or disobey
them without risking serious punishment, including my life.
He told me he would protect me. I had confidence [in] him
and I saw his love and help as my opportunity to escape and
to be with someone who truly loved me and would protect
me. I married him and flew to Australia.

33. I called Epstein and told him I was not coming back.
He asked why? I said “I’ve fallen in love.” Epstein basically
said “good luck and have a good life.” I could tell he was not
happy. I was afraid of what he was going to do to me. I
thought he or one of his powerful friends might send some-
one to hurt me or have me killed.

34. From that point onward, out of concern for my safety
and general well-being, I stayed in Australia with my hus-
band. I was in Australia from late 2002 to October 2013. To
be clear, I was never in the United States during these years,
not even for a short trip to visit my mother. And my absence
from the United States was not voluntary —I was hiding

from Epstein out of fear of what he would do to me if I
returned to the United States.

years, out of the blue I was contacted by someone who identi-

the University of California, San Diego, argues that the awareness of
mortality on its own would have led evolution to a dead end. The
despair would have interfered with our daily function, bringing the
activities needed for survival to a stop. The only way conscious
mental time travel could have arisen over the course of evolution is if
it emerged together with irrational optimism. Knowledge of death
had to emerge side by side with the persistent ability to picture a
bright future.

The capacity to envision the future relies partly on the hippocampus,
a brain structure that is crucial to memory. Patients with damage to
their hippocampus are unable to recollect the past, but they are also
unable to construct detailed images of future scenarios. They appear
to be stuck in time. The rest of us constantly move back and forth in
time; we might think of a conversation we had with our spouse
yesterday and then immediately of our dinner plans for later tonight.
But the brain doesn't travel in time in a random fashion. It tends to
engage in specific types of thoughts. We consider how well our kids
will do in life, how we will obtain that sought-after job, afford that
house on the hill and find perfect love. We imagine our team winning
the crucial game, look forward to an enjoyable night on the town or
picture a winning streak at the blackjack table. We also worry about
losing loved ones, failing at our job or dying in a terrible plane crash —
but research shows that most of us spend less time mulling over
negative outcomes than we do over positive ones. When we do
contemplate defeat and heartache, we tend to focus on how these can
be avoided. Findings from a study I conducted a few years ago with

already be providing reasonable protection for a victim before an offender is indicted, regardless of how the CVRA is
123

interpreted.
The VRRA, however, does not contain a right to confer and a right to fair treatment and respect for the victim's dignity.
Therefore, if victims are going to receive these statutory rights before trial, these rights must be found in the CVRA. With
regard to the CVRA provision that victims have the reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in the
case, !24 OLC contends that the phrase in the case’ implies the pendency of a judicial proceeding. '*° To bolster its
conclusion, OLC then cites Black's Law Dictionary, which includes among its several definitions of the word case the
definition a civil or criminal proceeding. !7® But OLC does not acknowledge that Black's Law Dictionary also defines and
exemplifies a case more broadly as a criminal investigation <the [*82] Manson case>. !*7 Thus, Black's Law Dictionary
does not help resolve the dispute as to which of the two meanings should be used, as there are clearly differing meanings.
While OLC's reading may be a permissible one, so is a pro-victim reading.

OLC also turns to the CVRA's legislative history to bolster its conclusion. But, here again, its analysis is misleading. OLC
relies on a passage from Senate floor colloquy between Senators Jon Kyl and Dianne Feinstein regarding the CVRA's scope. In
OLC's recounting of the legislative history, the floor statements emphasize that the right to confer relates to the conduct of
criminal proceedings after the filing of charges. !°° For instance, OLC quotes Senator Kyl stating that under this provision,
victims are able to confer with the Government's attorney about proceedings after charging.” !?°

This is a truncated and deceptive description of the legislative history, so much so that Senator Kyl sent an angry letter to
Attorney General Eric Holder complaining about the distortion. On June 6, 2011, the Senator wrote to express [his] surprise
that [OLC is] so clearly quoting [his] remarks out of context. !3° Senator Kyl then went on to observe that the colloquy began
by noting that the right to confer is intended to be expansive. '3! The Senator further discussed various examples of when
the right to confer applied, including any critical stage or disposition of the case. The right, however, is not limited to these
examples. !3? It was against that backdrop that Senator Kyl gave the example of conferring about proceedings after
charging.

In his letter to Attorney General Holder, Senator Kyl also noted that he had:

made clear that crime victims had rights under the CVRA even before an indictment is filed. For example, ... I made clear that

crime victims had a right to consult about both the case! and case proceedings’ - 1.e., both about how the case was being

handled before being filed in court and then later how the case was being handled in court proceedings.' !73

23 Exactly what reasonable protection means, however, remains uncertain. See generally Mary Margaret Giannini, Redeeming an Empty
Promise: Procedural Justice, the Crime Victims' Rights Act, and the Victim's Right to Be Reasonably Protected from the Accused, 78 Tenn.
L. Rev. 47 (2010) (suggesting the right has not been adequately defined and proposing ways to do so).

herself shies away from the Cineplex imagery in favor of the notion
of “smart power.”

“Smart power’ is the use of American power in ways that would help
prevent and resolve conflict—not just send our military in,” she says.
“Smart power’ is closer cooperation between our development
experts, our diplomats, our military leaders.” Hillary offers an
example: in Afghanistan, the Pentagon has a fund that allows a young
American officer to take $100,000 in discretionary funds and rebuild
a school on his own authority. By contrast, a diplomat or
development expert trying to rebuild a school would spend months
filling out forms, Hillary says, and probably still wouldn’t get the
money out of Congress. “We need a more agile civilian power,” she
concludes.

Hillary draws a distinction between focusing on relations with
governments (the locus of diplomacy for hundreds of years) and
stimulating change in societies, where the results are less controllable
but ultimately more profound. She clearly wants to try both at once,
but that intention can break down under the stress of a crisis. In the
debate over the bombing of Libya, the “society” policymakers were
the hawks. Their argument was caricatured by critics as purely
humanitarian but was in fact strategic. The thinking here was that the
U.S. must “get on the right side of history” and connect to the
aspirations of young people in the region. By contrast, the Old Guard
focused on nervous allies like Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Jordan.
Seeing the upheaval through the lens of stability, they were doves on
the question of bombing Libya, which they thought might detract
from the larger aim of containing Iran. Their mantra was “Beware
unintended consequences.”

While the Pentagon was clearly opposed beforehand, the other power
centers in the government were more conflicted. It wasn’t State
versus White House, much less women versus men or old versus

In Pennsylvania, Richard Kasunic, a Democratic state senator, failed

legislation to outlaw “swinger clubs.” He states, “My bill will outlaw

Cannabis Investment Report | December 2017

Methodology and Estimates: Industry Comparisons

To evaluate our methodology and results, we compare estimated values from our model with values
for the same parameters in markets for certain other stimulants and pharmaceuticals. We believe that
this comparison is useful because cannabis is used recreationally in much the same way alcohol, coffee

and tobacco are used, and because cannabis may be an alternative to pharmaceuticals currently used
to treat a range of medical conditions. The following table compares the estimated penetration rate,

average monthly consumer spending and U.S. retail market size for a number of common stimulants

and pharmaceutical categories.

Topic: The quixotic search for energy solutions

Question #3: What if the world ends up relying on coal forthe next 100 Question #4: What would be the reduction in gasoline needs if the entire U.S.
years, and seeks to prevent further increases in carbon emissions. How cornharvest not already used for ethanol were repurposed for more ethanol?

large an undertaking is it to bury 15% of all CO2 emissions? 160,000,000 US corn harvest, tonnes, 2010, not already used for ethanol
33.2 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions (2010) 159,667,200,000 US corn harvest, kg, not already used for ethanol
5.0 Sequestration target, billions of tonnes 0.40 Conversion ratio, liters of ethanol per kg
Now fet’s shrink the CO 2 by compressing it before burying it... 63,866,880,000 Liters of converted ethanol

4.6 Volume of global crude oil extracted, bn cubic meters (2010) . . . .
Implication: Benefits of corn ethanol appear to be close to their maximum

Implication: Capturing a small portion of CO. emissions requires a production level. There is of course the issue of ethanol's energy return on

as an energy input. Coal-fired plant capital costs could rise 40%-75% (as EROls for oil (10-20); Tar sands and Shale Oil (3-5); Nuclear (5-15) and Wind
per IPCC), and their electricity consumption could rise by 30%-40% for CCS (15-20, but that excludes the cost of back-up peaking plants). In that context,

a further rise in COz emissions; unexplored legal and NIMBY issues as well. involved, is well below the fully loaded economic benefits of other fuel sources.

As for wind, let’s put aside concerns about space requirements and transmission lines. Let’s also put aside problems of wind’s
reliance on rare earths like neodymium for its turbine magnets (neodymium prices quadrupled this year, and that’s with wind
still making up /ess than 3% of global electricity generation). Let’s also put aside debris (from birds/insects), ice storms and
other natural elements that reduce wind farm efficiency. The reason to put them aside: if wind were more reliable, like
hydropower, it could justify a lot more expense and effort. Unfortunately, wind is not that reliable. The first chart is the
“Mona Lisa” of wind unreliability, measured at one of California’s largest wind farms. The second is from the California
Independent System Operator, showing how wind power tends to be low when power demand is high (and vice-versa).

‘Lasked, “How come?” and he laughed and said, “He owes me some favours.” Maybe he was just

weren't more careful.

‘Bill must have known about Jeffrey's girls. There were three desks in the living area of the villa on

‘Ghislaine was at Bill's left and at the left of Ghislaine there were two olive-skinned brunettes who'd

‘I'd never met them before. I'd say they were no older than 17, very innocent-looking.

According to prison records, when Epstein was
serving his jail term, his visitors included a long-
time — and highly controversial — Clinton acquaintance, Arnold Prosperi.

‘In the final hours of the Clinton presidency, in January 2001, Prosperi was facing three years in
prison after being convicted of tax fraud. Mr Clinton commuted his sentence to house arrest.

‘Clinton, Prosperi and Epstein make an odd threesome on the face of it,’ says a law enforcement
source.

‘Was Prosperi visiting Epstein as some kind of intermediary for Bill?

‘Maybe Bill wanted to know if Epstein knew anything that could embarrass him. Or did Bill commute
Prosperi’s sentence as some kind of favour

for Epstein?’

Virginia disclosed that Mr Clinton’s vice-president Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, were also guests of
Epstein on his island.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018605.txt,"time I'm really serious about someone, I guess. Monogamy isn't necessary for these
things, but it would definitely make doing them less complicated.

+ Societal acceptance. Straight up, monogamy is the Western societal default. In some
ways this makes monogamy hard to understand and communicate about -- because there
are SO many assumptions and built-in expectations, and folks don't always agree on those
expectations! A recent study found that 40% of young couples don't agree about whether
or not they're monogamous. That amazes me, because I have never assumed that I was
monogamous with a partner until we had a conversation establishing that we were
monogamous... but I guess I can see how it happens, if people feel anxious about
communicating and fall back on assumptions instead.

Usually, however, being the societal default makes monogamy easier. Heterosexual
monogamous people can get married with no problem, for example, and while marriage
is obviously contested territory for non-hets, it's instructive that gay marriage” is such a
big political issue (while polyamorous marriage is currently nothing more than a
specter right-wingers use to scare people about gay marriage). Outsiders usually assume
that you're monogamous when you introduce your partner. Romantic comedies exalt
monogamy; the media, and many people around us, associate monogamy with love.
When you're monogamous, you never have to articulate your weird relationship structure
to your parents. You rarely have to think outside the box about relationship problems, and
you can go to any Western advice columnist or therapist and be sure that they'll recognize
your relationship as legitimate. (Those of you who like privilege checklists might enjoy
this monogamous privilege checklist, which is patterned after Peggy McIntosh's classic

essay and white privilege checklist.)

+ Some people just like it better. Occasionally, people will toy with the idea of an
“orientational” element to polyamory or monogamy: some folks just plain feel aligned
with monogamy or non-monogamy. (I have similar thoughts about this as I do about
BDSM as a sexual orientation.)

Personally, I always think it's really key, during any sex-positive critique, to emphasize
from the start that whatever you like is cool as long as the actions you take are
consensual. I know people who act all apologetic for being monogamous, usually because
they've been overexposed to polyvangelists who argue that non-monogamy is better
or more evolved. This is silly! Liking monogamy doesn't have to be justified, as long as
you don't turn around and claim that non-monogamy is bad and wrong. And liking
monogamy is a perfectly awesome reason for preferring monogamy!

discontinuous changes in results.”

He grinned mischievously as he asked, “Can you see it?”

Thom’s catastrophes serve as accessible and powerful theoretical settings
for the use of energy as a generalizable, one dimensional, dependent, resulting
effect, influenced by one or several, sometimes conflicting, independent, causal,
variables. For more examples: the weight of a ship (smaller to greater, left to right,
along the x, normal dimension) and the position of center of gravity (smaller to
greater, front to back, along the y splitting dimension) are causal with a jump in roof-
height energy from stability to capsizing, a discontinuity emerging from initially
smooth changes in stability. As above, gradually increasing tension (the left to right
normal factor) and alienation (the back to front (splitting factor) in inmates generate
a sudden increment in energy, from subtlety increasing tension in relative quiet to
the sudden outbreak in a riot in the prison population. Embryological notochord
somitogenesis, (that which become the vertebrate of the spinal column) has a
smooth (left to right) causal influence that Chris Zeeman named a normal factor. It
is the smooth growth of the material wave of mesodermal (to become muscle,
connective tissue and bone) tissue. Zeeman called the front to back dimensional
gradient of influence, the secondary wave of adhesiveness, the splitting factor. The
value of this secondary wave co-determined a critical-valued interaction between
these causal parameters leading to a discontinuous change in the “energy”
equivalent continuity of developmental growth and vertebral column segmentation.

A little more technically: Thom’s basic mathematical contributions were in
differential topology and analysis with particular emphasis on what is called
structural stability of surfaces representing and supporting actions called manifolds.
For example, in a graph of a function, say F(x), such that a change in cause x
determines what happens to the result y= F(x), the stability question involves what
happens when one perturbs F(x) with a littles, i.e. 6 + F(x). Do the topological
properties of the surface representing the potential range of actions of the system
(such as nearness of an originally close point set, continuity and connectedness of

the surface, its dimensionality, its compactness as a generalization of finiteness)

Evilightenment

Educate your children to self-control, to the habit of holding passion and prejudice and
evil tendencies subject to an upright and reasoning will, and you have done much to
abolish misery from their future and crimes from society.

— Benjamin Franklin

Charles Darwin observed that of all the differences between humans and other animals, one capacity
reigns supreme: we alone have the ability to contemplate what others ought to do. We alone are endowed
with a moral imperative to reflect, consider, and imagine alternatives. We alone are impelled to be
dissatisfied with the status quo, urged to contemplate what could be and ultimately what must be. This
capacity creates a fundamental principle of human existence and enlightenment: we alone invest in the
survival of the /east fit. We give money to those in abject poverty, risk our lives to help others in areas of
conflict, adopt abandoned children, nurture individuals with extreme disabilities, and care for the elderly.
This principle fuels our humanitarian efforts. Sadly, it is a necessary response to another unique
difference between humans and other animals: we alone have the ability to inflict great harms on our own
species and many others. We alone are responsible for creating work for those in the humanitarian sector.
We alone are evil.

We also have an opportunity to begin a new volume of humane history. We have the chance to
harness our understanding of the past in order to present our children with the gift of knowledge and the
prospects of a healthier future. We should— no, we must — teach our children what we have learned
about the causes of corporate corruption, the desire for ethnic cleansing, and the combined forces of
nature and nurture to create excessive suffering and lifeless flesh. These are topics that should be
presented early on in education rather than waiting for heady discussions at the university. We owe the
next generation the best education from our generation. The best education will come from confronting
history, exposing human nature, and supporting cultural variation while fighting to demolish totalitarian
regimes that limit or eliminate basic human rights. I write this sentence following on the eve of Egypt's
inspiring revolution, a revolution led by educated people who refused to allow the dictator Hosni
Mubarak to ruin their country and their children's future. The people of Egypt, like the people of many
countries who rallied in the Arab spring of 2011, refused to be eternal victims. This is a lesson that must
spread to every corner of the globe. It is a lesson of hope. It is a lesson to all evildoers to beware.

I have taken you on a journey into evil’s core, penetrating with scientific evidence and
explanation. Though we have traveled to distant lands, traversed vast spans of time, and encountered
wildly different cultures, the key idea is that this nchness was generated from a few essential ingredients.
This is a minimalist approach to a difficult and highly variegated problem. I end our journey by taking
stock of the essential ideas and reflect on some of the broader implications.

Retracing our steps

In the beginning, before there were bald, bipedal, big-brained, babbling humans, there were hairy,
quadrupedal, bitsy-brained, barking bonobos. These animals, clearly clever, have survived for over 6-7
million years, despite attempts by our species to demolish their habitat. But — and this is a significant

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018611.txt,"Other men seem to be having issues with their age. One mentioned that he's just turned
40, and that's really bugging him. Then he flaked out on me a couple times -- I don't think
he was completely okay with his own decision to be seeing me. But anyway, often,
another thing these men seem to get out of it is access to someone who has a bunch of
youthful energy and optimism and just plain new ideas. A lot of them have mentioned
feeling stuck, or bored, or cynical, or intellectually constrained. So in this sense sex is
only one thing I'm offering them -- I'm also offering them optimism, hope, energy, and so
on. Firstly, the sex is good in and of itself, as most of them aren't getting laid otherwise.
But the sex is also a symbol of them getting access to my youthful energy or whatever.

I think the archetypal image of a mistress involves a woman being kept so that she
doesn't have to work, so that she can be available for sex basically whenever. But I don't
think this is what the men I see want. I am more valuable to them because I have other
work that I am seriously invested in, and am having sex with them anyway. Again, these
men are interested in a woman who they see as more equal to them -- in this case,
defined by earnings potential -- and they seem gratified by the idea that they could help
me enter their income bracket someday. This is, of course, still kind of patronizing; like I
said, they keep using words like mentor. It's also presumptuous. But I think a lot of
them being patronizing and presumptuous can probably be attributed to age and wealth,
and only some of it to gender.

I think I've learned more about class and money than I have about gender. It turns out
there are people to whom $1,000 versus $3,000 doesn't matter that much, and I finally
understand that on a visceral level. $1,000 doesn't mean the same thing to me as it does to
most of them. I knew this, but now I really know it.

Another thing I've been struck by is exactly how much romantic relationships are worth.
I've had several clients tell me they don't feel wealthy, and they feel like they worry about
money a lot. I think they were sincere. Of course, my first thought was: don't you think
that your $2,000-per-month prostitute is part of the budget that could be trimmed? But I
think that maybe it's not, actually. I think they think that investing a lot of money in me is
a good investment for them if it gives them a release valve so they can deal with the rest
of their lives. They're probably right.

Clarisse Thorn: You mentioned that you feel powerful in your relationships with
these men. But there are issues of your safety, right?

Olivia: I think there are issues of safety anytime a person meets someone they don't really
know, especially if they plan to spend time in private. And especially if you're dealing
with topics as sensitive as sex or money. There may be more issues of safety with this
because some people really do believe that money can buy them anything. But for the
most part, when I meet people they seem very respectful.

Things I do to increase my safety are that I tell my husband and my friends where I'm
going to be, I tell them exactly where I am. I'll do things like take down a client's license
plate number and text it to my husband. I've been thinking maybe I should look at each
client's driver's license too, and text the client's name and driver's license number to my
husband. I think some clients might feel threatened by that, though.

be on a par with an omission.

The Mayan study is but one example. It suggests some flexibility in our perception of actions and
omissions, and shows how cultural differences can create individual differences. When our social world is
relatively small and circumscribed, we can keep tabs on everyone. By keeping tabs, we can hold others
responsible for their actions and their omissions. As the American psychologists Jon Haidt and Jonathan
Baron have shown, this psychology can be recreated in the laboratory by creating scenarios in which the
individuals are either unfamiliar or familiar. When there is a relationship between the individuals —
family, friends, team members — and thus, some degree of familiarity, the omission effect weakens.

The omission effect is not an obligatory state of the human mind. It is a common tendency, a way
that our brains lean, especially in unfamiliar contexts. In patients with obsessive compulsive disorder, the
omission effect is as strong as it is in healthy subjects, except for familiar cases of harm that are directly
relevant to them, such as the excessive washing behavior that is the trademark of this clinical disorder.
The fact that certain situations can cause us to lean in different directions has important policy
implications: even when corporations, institutions, or other organizations grow large, we should always
segregate these masses into smaller divisions, and make the issues personally relevant. Every member of
one division should hold all others within its division responsible or accountable. Further, efforts should
be made to foster familiarity across divisions, enabling not only a level of responsibility but of respect
and trust. By recreating the psychology of small scale societies, and making potential harms relevant, we
may help bypass the omission effect, allowing us to hold people responsible for their omissions. This, in
turn, may reduce the number of individuals who live as passive bystanders. Familiarity and relevance
may well be the necessary catalysts for converting bystanders into active whistle blowers, defenders, and
rescuers.

When bystanders remain passive, watching the world go by, it is often because they believe that
their actions won’t make a difference or think that the costs of heroism are too high. This is, again, an
issue of responsibility. It raises the question of when we ought to act. The distinguished Australian
philosopher Peter Singer has spent a lifetime pushing this issue in the context of charitable donations,
culminating most recently in his book The Life You Can Save. The key idea, taken from a utilitarian
perspective where outcomes as opposed to rules or principles motivate our moral actions, is that we ought
to give a fraction of our incomes to those lacking basic access to food, shelter and health care. Standing
by as bystanders when there are 1.4 billion people in a state of abject poverty is morally wrong. The logic
seems perfectly reasonable, especially given the fact that humanitarian organizations have helped reduce
the number of people living in poverty by .5 billion within the last 20 years. But then we learn of another

Peter Singer idea: if the three richest men alive today — Carlos Slim Helu, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffett

Minister, I felt it was not my place to criticize Olmert publicly when Israeli troops
were in action. Two days in, in fact, I told a television interviewer that the
government had every right to respond and was doing so effectively. Olmert
phoned to thank me. When he, like Shimon, asked what I thought the government
should do next, I was straightforward: “Do your best to bring things to an end as
soon as you can.” I said that Halutz and the other generals would be caught up in
the operational details, which made his role and that of the cabinet even more
critical. “In any operation, you’ll have an idea about what represents a satisfactory
exit point. But there will be a temptation, when you get close to that point, to take
just one more step, to keep going until you’re absolutely sure you’ve reached it.”
Resist that temptation, I told him. I said there was a danger that, before they knew
it, he and the other minister would be in way over their heads.

In pure military terms, there were just two realistic choices in responding the
Hibzollah attack: a deliberately limited and fairly brief operation, or a full-scale
war. We ended up doing neither. The result was an operation that lasted 34 days,
nearly twice the length of the Yom Kippur War. Our air force flew 12,000
missions, more than in 1973 and nearly twice as many as in the 1982 Lebanon
War. Hizbollah fired about 4,000 rockets into Israel — from a stockpile we
estimated to number nearly 20,000 — and not just at the border settlements but as
far south as Hadera and Haifa, keeping hundreds of thousands of Israelis under
effective siege. More than 120 Israeli soldiers and 44 civilians were killed. So were
hundreds of Hizbollah fighters and, inevitably, many Lebanese civilians as well,
with a predictable surge of criticism from much of the outside world. Only
President Bush and Britain’s Tony Blair steadfastly reminded the critics of how the
war had actually begun.

The one putative victory for Israel was the UN cease-fire resolution that Tzipi
Livni helped to negotiate in August. At least on paper, it contained a commitment
to a “long-term solution” including the disarmament of Hizbollah and the
“unconditional release of the abducted Israeli soldiers, which has given rise to the
current crisis.” But as Israeli newspapers began speaking to the returning soldiers
and officers, a picture emerged not just of a long and difficult war, but a lack of
clearly communicated military objectives, and an often-chaotic chain of command,
which ended up costing Israeli lives. Our final advance, alone, shortly before the
cease-fire, claimed the lives of some 30 soldiers. And for what, many Israelis were
soon asking themselves. One of the newspapers most supportive of the operation at

Troubled teenager: Virginia on the billionaire's Zorra ranch in New Mexico in 2001

Virginia was fascinated by his life story: the son of a humble New York City parks worker, he was a
teacher before becoming a Wail Street broker and friends with the upper echelons of the political,
financial and academic establishment.

As a confused teenager, Virginia easily fell into the practice of sexually gratifying him for money.
He guaranteed her a minimum of $200 each time she gave him what he called an ‘erotic massage.’

Virginia said: ‘I would always receive the money immediately. He would give me the cash from a wad
he carried in a black duffel bag or an assistant paid me.

‘And, because of the way Epstein had warped her sensibilities, every time she took the cash,
Virginia felt even more indebted to him. Secretly, he was also preparing her for an even more
disturbing role.

‘Basically, | was training to bea prostitute for him
and his friends who shared his interest in young

Epstein had trained me
irls,’ sh : ‘After about two , he started
Baek mets antartain his friends. estene to do whatever men

It started when Epstein called Virginia at the Pam Wanted. | told myself |
Beach apartment he had rented for her. r
was special

She recalls: ‘He said, “I've got a good friend and |
need you to fly to the island to
entertain him, massage him and make him fee! how you make me feel.”

He didn’t spell out what | had to do. He didn’t have to. ‘He'd trained me to do whatever a man
wanted. | was shocked but | told myself he was sharing me around because he trusted me and | was
special.

| was worried, but | would do anything to keep Jeffrey happy and to keep my place as his number
one girl.

He would keep telling me how lucky | was with the life | was leading and the money ! was making. It
was easy to fall into his grasp.

‘The way it usually worked was I’d be sent to meet a man on the private island Jeffrey owned in the
Caribbean, or at his ranch in New Mexico, which was really isolated.’ She was ‘given’ to men ranging
in age from their 40s to their 60s.

They included a well-known businessman (whose pregnant wife was asleep in the next room), a
world-renowned scientist, a respected liberal politician and a foreign head of state.

None appeared to think the arrangement was unusual. Virginia says there were many other girls in
Epstein’s circle and that she was paid extra money to help recruit them.

‘They would lounge around the Palm Beach house, the ranch or the island, nude or topless,’ she
says. ‘But | was one of the very few he trusted as “special” and chosen to “entertain” his friends.’

Virginia took the sedative Xanax to detach herself from sordid reality. ‘lt was an escape drug,’ she
says. ‘It made me caim and helped me forget about what | had to do. | was up to eight pills a day.’

Epstein had no objection to Virginia's use of prescription drugs, no doubt recognising that they made
her even more malleable. ‘I didn’t want to go back to the life I'd had before’ she says.

‘That made me totally obedient.’ Despite the fact that Epstein was, essentially, her pimp, this life now
seemed normal to Virginia. ‘l felt that he and Ghislaine really cared for me,’ she said.

‘We'd do family things, like watch Sex And The City and eat popcorn. ‘A lot of it was very glamorous.
| met famous friends of his such as Al Gore and Heidi Klum and Naomi Campbell. He introduced me
as his “travelling masseuse.”

Some people mistook me for his daughter. ‘When we were in New York or Palm Beach, Ghislaine

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018258.txt,"the years as we waited for him was nothing less than whole new worlds, connected
landscapes that emerged entirely from systems Apple was secretly breeding. He
wasn't merely introducing a phone; he was changing how we were going to
experience life. “Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that
changes everything,” Jobs began his famous rolling introduction for the first iPhone
in 2007. “In 1984 we introduced the Macintosh. It didn't just change Apple. It
changed the whole computer industry. In 2001 we introduced the first iPod. It didn't
just change the way we all listen to music. It changed the entire music industry.”
Apple devices were cracking open paths to whole new worlds in this sense. The
company develops an app for podcasts; a new media form is born. It builds an
architecture for video calling; our relations to each other deepen a bit. What Jobs
was presenting was new and - until that very instant - unimagined universes of
possibility that we'd all explore. No wonder the world tuned in.

When we speak of “architecture” in a digital sense we mean the design of the inside
of a computer — how the chips link to each other - or the layout of a phone system,
the mechanics of a block-chain or encryption tool, or the ethereal construction of a
datascape so it can be better used to train artificially intelligent programs. These are
design choices that, just like the ones about where to put a door or a freeway,
conclusively decide and shape movement. They affect speed. Politics, social norms,
technological needs - these and other forces all shape the architecture of digital
systems. But -and this is where a new sensibility comes into play - the
architectures, in turn, touch and twist politics, social norms and technology. Instant
communication, social webs, fast-spreading news - all of these forces redound
powerfully on the real world. They affect how we think and act. And, as a result,
controlling these connections is a profound source of power. It’s also true that
architectures and designs dropped into different places have different results: Think
of how an open computer system plopped into the Middle East might be used
differently than one placed in the American Midwest.

It was these sorts of vibrations, the ones made by power pulsing through certain
forms or networks in history, that led the Orientalist scholar Karl Wittfogel to his
famous “Hydrological Hypothesis” in the last centrury. Ancient agrarian societies -
Egypt or China, for instance - developed political orders that were decided by their
need for large scale irrigation, Wittfogel explained. Without water, these societies
were dead. Without control of that water? Exposed to constant chaos. Chinese
dynasties tumbled and Egyptian prosperity collapsed as unexpected, unpredicted
droughts and flooding tore them apart. Taming water became the aim of all politics.
An unusual centralized effort emerged. It screwed these scattered, nomadic
societies into a tight, enduring and largely effective authoritarianism. Wittfogel
argued that the “irrigation societies” of Egypt, China, Mesopotamia, and South
America all reflected this link between survival and water control. Power pooled in
the hands of what he called a “Hydraulic Bureaucracy”. China’s Yu the Great”, for
instance, rose to power around 2800 B.C. because of his skills in throttling the
unpredictable and deadly Yangtze flows. “Contrary to popular belief that nature
always remains the same,” Wittfogel wrote, “nature changes profoundly whenever

especially Out of Africa), reads yet more briefing papers than she’s
already consumed in Washington, scans news on an iPad, and
sometimes manages a few pages of a mystery, but mostly she sleeps,
without any pills, often right through landing. “If she couldn’t sleep
most of the way,” says Philippe Reines, her longtime press secretary,
“she wouldn’t be able to function.”

Some of her best road stories involve Holbrooke, her close friend, a
maestro of diplomacy for more than four decades. (Holbrooke was
meeting with Hillary in her office last December when he collapsed
and was rushed to the hospital, where he later died from a ruptured
aorta.) At his Kennedy Center memorial service, which played more
like a roast, she recalled that Holbrooke was once, in Pakistan, so
insistent on making a point that he followed her all the way into the
ladies’ room. On boarding her plane, he would test every seat to see
which was the most comfortable, then hound whichever official was
assigned to it to trade with him. Hillary especially enjoyed when he
would disappear into the airplane restroom and emerge like an
oversize Easter bunny in his bright-yellow sleeping suit. “On hearing
Winston Churchill’s motto, “Never, never, never, never give up,’
[Richard] called Churchill halfhearted,” she said. Hillary thinks this
also perfectly captures her own theory of persistence.

Aloft, the secretary of state can often be found with a black binder
clip in her hair instead of fastened onto classified documents. It helps.
Her stylist, Isabelle Goetz, does her hair in Washington, but on the
road—unless the ambassador’s wife can recommend someone good—
she takes care of herself. For years she’s routinely done her own
makeup, which is easier because she has good skin. And her genes
seem unusually strong. Dorothy Rodham, Hillary’s mother, is 92 but
looks more like 80. Hillary is 63 but seems a bit younger. She is one

decisions on all the underlying structural policy matters damaging America’s long-term prospects

and distorting our democracy. No more kicking the can down the road.

e This candidate should also pledge to push for laws passed that reflect the will of simple majorities
in Congress. Congress now only allows bills to move forward when a “majority of a majority”
supports the policy and on many levels seems fundamentally broken. This third-party president
could force votes based on a transparent reading of where the votes lie via coalition building. The
Senate filibuster power will present a high hurdle, but a third-party candidate would be a de facto
disruptor of the two-party system. Party discipline could well break down, and moderates in both
parties could form a powerful, decisive block willing to work with the new President. The policies
passed into law may not be ideal for either Democrats or Republicans, but for the major agenda
items that must be addressed for America’s long-term health, an imperfect fix that corrects course

is better than those that now have us hurtling toward national bankruptcy.

And if no candidate secures 270 electoral votes in 2020? The House of Representatives would choose the
next president. In 2016, reports suggested Michael Bloomberg declined to run on a third-party ticket for
fear of splitting support from Hillary Clinton and throwing the election to a GOP-controlled House of
Representatives who would then vote to select the president. The fear was the GOP controlled House

would have just elected Trump.

Would Democratic control of the House mean that the House would pick an alternative to Trump as
president? Each state delegation has a single vote in selecting a president and it is the incoming Congress
- the class elected in 2020 that would decide the election. But no matter which party has the speaker’s
chair, the GOP would almost certainly have the upper hand in the majority of state delegations

controlled. Would the state delegations pick a president based on party majority control of the
delegation, the winner of the popular vote in each state or their own calculations as to who is best for
America? Precedent suggests that delegations use secret ballots, which means individual lawmakers may

vote their consciences.

The Department opposes subsection (a) as an excessively burdensome and unnecessary
creation of a new layer of bureaucracy within our agency. The Department does not believe
that there is currently any lack of coordination, and a new position could lead to duplication of
efforts. Furthermore, subsection (a}(2)(A} incorrectly lists the Civil Division and not the Civil
Rights Division.

255 Section 236

In subsection (a), DOJ questions the reliability of the congressional findings, especially
with respect to the estimated number of victims and the inference that the lack of child victims is
directly related to a lack of education individuals who may come into contact with human
trafficking victims. Such findings, without a full body of evidence, are counter-productive.

The Department also opposes subsection (b). The Attorney General should be involved
in any program that focuses on combating child trafficking at the border. We propose that
section (b}(1} is amended fo read “The Secretary of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the
Secretary of State, Attorney Genera], and the Secretary of Health and Human Services.” Further,
most of the children interdicted at the border are used for smuggling and are not trafficking
victims. In subsection (b)(5)(D), DOJ believes that the proceedings for removal to non-
contiguous countries are problematic because DHS needs more flexibility to handle gang
members, terrorists, repeat offenders, and state offenders. Furthermore, the terrorism exception
provided is too narrow to protect the national security interests of the country.

We oppose subsection (c)(1) to the extent that it limits the Administration's ability to
determine the best arrangement for custody or various classes of UACs. The administration will
work with DHS, DOJ, and HHS to refine and modify current detention practices where
necessary. The interagency process is the best forum to consider the various interests of
unaccompanied minors and law enforcement and to develop and adapt policies thai, among other
things, provide for the safety of all concerned. We look forward to discussing these
developments with Congress in the future.

The Department opposes subsection (d)(2) as too narrowly construed. There are
numerous reasons, outside of the child proving to be a danger to himself or others, that require
children to be kept in a secure facility, including the safety of the child from danger that is not
self-imposed. In addition, the standard for placing minors in “secure” care is too strict. It
requires the “least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child.” HHS only places 1.4
percent of minors in its care into a “secure” custody arrangement. This could mean that minors
who need this arrangement would instead be housed with children who have no history of
violence or criminal behavior. HHS needs more flexibility and there should not, therefore, be
required to make an “independent finding” of the child’s danger to self or others.

DOJ opposes the language of subsection (d)(3)(c) that would afford HHS access to law
enforcement sensitive databases.

This Article has several aims. One is to introduce the concept of enforcement redundancy and demonstrate its utility. Another is
to highlight problems of criminal law underenforcement and to situate contemporary complaints about failures to prosecute
police violence and sexual assaults as specific examples of broader enforcement deficiencies that stem from bias and favoritism
in police and prosecutorial discretion. The Article also defends the observation that enforcement redundancy strategies are
responses to versions of this problem. It then assesses the strengths and weaknesses of different such strategies, with primary
attention on the effectiveness of the U.S. approach of redundant federal-state authority. A focus on three different categories of
criminal law underenforcement - government corruption, police violence, and sexual assaults - clarifies differences in the
effectiveness of the U.S. approach. Federalism has proven an effective response to states’ failures to address forms of public
corruption, and for those crimes, it 1s likely superior to its alternatives. Federal authority has had some success in compensating
for states' failures to prosecute police violence and other police wrongdoing, but its efficacy is harder to judge and arguments
for supplemental redundancy strategies are stronger. For sexual assaults, federal authority has failed to assert any meaningful
enforcement jurisdiction to compensate for weaknesses in state justice systems. Despite the sustained efforts and notable
successes of reform advocates in this area, no model of enforcement redundancy has made inroads.

The Article proceeds as follows. Part II briefly surveys evidence of and reasons for underenforcement. The need for safeguards
against unjustified nonenforcement has long been recognized in the United States and elsewhere; outside the United States, as
part of victims’ rights reforms, it has been the object of institutional reforms. Part III elaborates the mechanisms available to
address risks of criminal law underenforcement. The predominant options are (1) some authority for private actors to initiate or
participate in criminal prosecutions; (2) judicial or administrative review of initial nonprosecution decisions by public
prosecutors; and (3) authority for a separate, independent public prosecutor's office to bring charges when another prosecutor
has declined to. Other countries - out of tradition, an absence of federalism, or as part of victims’ rights reforms - rely on
versions of [*850] the first and second options. Part IIT also considers why U.S. victims’ rights laws, which are otherwise
robust, lack either of these components adopted elsewhere, especially given that many state criminal justice systems relied on
private prosecution for much of the nineteenth century. The likely answers help explain why the United States relies almost
exclusively on the third option as a safeguard against underenforcement.

Finally, Part IV assesses how effectively federalism-based enforcement redundancy addresses underenforcement, particularly
the recurrent, contemporary controversies around police violence and sexual assault. Redundant enforcement through
overlapping federalism has had considerable success addressing some underenforcement problems, such as corruption by state
and local officials, certain kinds of civil rights violations, or crimes against disfavored minority groups. 7° It is doubtful that
private prosecution or judicial review could match its success. The federalism strategy has a more mixed record on the problem
of unjustified police violence. Federal officials have succeeded where state officials have failed in overseeing reform of local
police departments to reduce police lawbreaking, and they occasionally prosecute and convict individual officers. 7! But the

vast majority of incidents of police violence go unprosecuted, including most that lead to large civil settlements for victims. 7?

an agreement with the Palestinians to replace an Israeli troop cordon there with
Palestinian police. But on the morning of Saturday October 7th, hours after the
Palestinian police took over, a mob attacked, burned and ransacked the site. They
destroyed the Torah scrolls. A few hours later, our soldiers found the body of a
rabbi from a nearby settlement. He had gone to survey the damage to the
synagogue.

That evening, I delivered an ultimatum: “If we don’t see a change in the
patterns of violence in the next two days, we will regard this as a cessation by
Arafat of the peace process.” That did, briefly, have an effect. When Clinton
reinforced my message later in the day, Dennis told me that for the first time, he
sensed that Arafat realized he had to act. But again, it was not enough, nor in
anything like a sustained manner. And with an appalling act of murder three days
afterwards, it was too late. That outrage came in Ramallah. Two Israeli reservists
took a wrong turn and ended up driving into the town. They were taken to the
Palestinian police station. Hundreds of people broke in and stabbed them, gouged
their eyes out and disembowled them. In a chilling image broadcast around the
world, one of the murderers brandished the bloodstained palms of his hands in a
gesture of triumph. Since I was Defense Minister as well, I spent the hours that
followed in the kirya. We ordered attack helicopters into action for the first time,
though with advance warning to local Palestinians in the areas we targeted. We
destroyed the Ramallah police station, as well as a militia base near Arafat’s
headquarters in Gaza. But Arafat emerged to tell a cheering crowd: “Our people
don’t care. They don’t hesitate to continue their march to Jerusalem, the capital of
the Palestinian independent state.”

Israelis did care. It is hard to say which emotion was more powerful: disgust or
fury. But if the opinion polls were to be believed, a large majority wanted us to hit
back with the full force of the Israeli army. Still, my overriding aim remained to
end the violence if possible, not make it worse. When Clinton asked me to join
him, Arafat, King Abdullah of Jordan and UN Secretary General Kofi Annan for a
summit in Sharm al-Sheikh, I agreed. We worked out a series of steps to
disengage. Arafat was finally supposed to order the Palestinian Authority security
forces and Tanzim to cease fire, and establish no-go perimeters around our army
positions. We would reopen Gaza airport and, over a period of two weeks, pull
back our forces to where they had been before the violence began. But again, it
didn’t happen. The Palestinian attacks intensified and, as I’d made clear at the

in some cases depending on the nature of the task. Here we give a partial task-set for the vir-
tual and robot preschool scenarios discussed in Chapter 16, and a couple example quantitative
metrics just to illustrate what is intended; the creation of a fully detailed roadmap based on
the ideas outlined here is left for future work.

The train of thought presented in this chapter emerged in part from a series of conversa-
tions preceding and during the AGI Roadmap Workshop held at the University of Tennessee,
Knoxville in October 2008. Some of the ideas also trace back to discussions held during two
workshops on Evaluation and Metrics for Human-Level AI organized by John Laird and Pat
Langley (one in Ann Arbor in late 2008, and one in Tempe in early 2009). Some of the conclu-
sions of the Ann Arbor workshop were recorded in [LWMLO9]. Inspiration was also obtained
from discussion at the Future of AGI post-conference workshop of the AGI-09 conference,
triggered by Itamar Arel’s [ARK09a] presentation on the AGI Roadmap theme; and from an
earlier article on AGI Roadmapping by [AL09].

However, the focus of the AGI Roadmap Workshop was considerably more general than the
present chapter. Here we focus on preschool-type scenarios, whereas at the workshop a number
of scenarios were discussed, including the preschool scenarios but also, for example,

Standardized Tests and School Curricula

Elementary, Middle and High School Student

General Videogame Learning

Wozniak’s Coffee Test: go into a random American house and figure out how to make coffee,
and do it

Robot College Student

e General Call Center Respondent

For each of these scenarios, one may generate tasks corresponding to each of the competency
areas we will outline below. CogPrime is applicable in all these scenarios, so our choice to focus
on preschool scenarios is an additional judgment call beyond those judgment calls required to
specify the CogPrime design. The roadmap presented here is a AGI Preschool Roadmap and
as such is a special case of the broader AGI Roadmap outlined at the workshop.

17.2 Measuring Incremental Progress Toward Human-Level AGI

In Chapter 2, we discussed several examples of practical goals that we find to plausibly char-
acterize human level AGI, e.g.

Turing Test

Virtual World Turing Test
Online University Test
Physical University Test
Artificial Scientist Test

We also discussed our optimism regarding the possibility that in the future AGI may advance
beyond the human level, rendering all these goals early-stage subgoals.

However, in this chapter we will focus our attention on the nearer term. The above goals are
ambitious ones, and while one can talk a lot about how to precisely measure their achievement,

Chapter 5

The Rise of ‘Illiberal Democracy’

In July 2014, Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban
gave what has come to be known as his “illiberal
democracy speech before an ethnic Hungarian audi-
ence in Baile Tusnad, Romania.! Several points in his
remarks are worth noting:

¢ Orban urged his listeners to no longer regard the
1989 triumph over communism as the reference
point for developments in Hungary. Instead of
measuring progress from the transition from
dictatorship and foreign domination to elections,
civil liberties, and sovereignty, Orban said Hungary
should adopt a new point of departure, the onset
of the global financial crisis in 2008, which also
marked the European Union’s greatest setback.

¢ He cited U.S. president Barack Obama and vari-
ous unnamed sources on the West's weakness,
including an “internationally recognized analyst
who wrote that liberal values today “embody
corruption, sex, and violence.”

« He suggested that in the future it would be
systems that were “not Western, not liberal,
not liberal democracies, and perhaps not even
democracies’ that would create successful and
competitive societies. He asserted that “the
stars of the international analysts today are
Singapore, China, India, Russia, and Turkey.”

In a passage devoted to the obstacles facing his
own political party, Fidesz, as it seeks to build an
alternative to liberalism, Orban singled out civil
society and the nongovernmental sector. Civil
society critics, he insisted, “are not nongovern-
mental organizations but “paid political activists
who are attempting to enforce foreign interests
here in Hungary.” (In a separate speech in early
2016, he referred to “hordes of implacable hu-
man rights warriors who “feel an unquenchable
desire to lecture and accuse us.’”)

In this relatively short address, Orban neatly summa-
rized most of the key factors that distinguish a fully
democratic “Western” system based on liberal values
and accountability from what he calls an “Eastern”
approach based ona strong state, a weak opposition,
and emaciated checks and balances.

“There is a race underway to find the
method of community organization,
the state, which is most capable of
making a nation and a community
internationally competitive... [T]he
most popular topic in thinking today
is trying to understand how systems
that are not Western, not liberal, not
liberal democracies, and perhaps not
even democracies, can nevertheless
make their nations successful.”

—Viktor Orban, prime minister of Hungary

“If we want to organize our national
state to replace the liberal state, it is
very important that we make it clear
that we are not opposing nongov-
ernmental organizations here, and

it is not nongovernmental organi-
zations who are moving against us,
but paid political activists who are
attempting to enforce foreign inter-
ests here in Hungary.”

—Viktor Orban

First, his exhortation to no longer regard the events of
1989 as a seminal, even sacred, juncture in Hungarian
history is noteworthy given Orban's biography. While
he often cites his own role in the anticommunist
struggle and describes himself as a freedom fighter,
he now regards 1989—so redolent of liberal values,
ideas about individual freedom, and democratic
solidarity—as an intellectual impediment to his plans
for a Hungary that is skeptical of such ideals and of
European integration.

Second, Orban included full-blown dictatorships
(Russia and China) in the roster of governments he
admires, along with quasi-democratic illiberal states
(Turkey and Singapore) and one genuine, if inconsis-
tent, democracy (India).

Thank you for asking how I am doing. The short answer is very well. I hope that you are in good health and 
continue to use your special talents to make the world a better place and for your somewhat unique 
amusements. 
The longer answer to your question is that at the end of 2014 I closed down the office of Landmark, transferred 
all of the assets to pay all of the major creditors, except me, and found myself as broke as I was when you first 
called me that Friday after Thanksgiving, with my only remaining assets, a large capital loss, my reputation, 
and my energy. 
Since then, our luck has been better than even an optimist like me would expect. Being free of the $500,000 a 
day I was fined by the OTS, after several years they abandoned this fine, which was initiated strictly to ensure 
that I had no opportunity to finance any new developments, I became involved with an extraordinary, large, 
important real estate development in Oklahoma City and two others in the D.C. area. 
The bad news is that my dear friend and good partner, Aubrey McClendon, was killed in a single car accident 
on March 2nd of this year and the development with great potential is now either delayed or abandoned. The 
good news is that our involvement in a 1,000 acre development on Deep Creek Lake in western Maryland is in 
the process of being financed and should be underway sometime this summer. Our second project is a 405 
acre development in Harper's Ferry, West Virginia, that is probably the prettiest piece of property I know of in 
the U.S. that is zoned and developable. Its business plan is now underway and we should be in the financing 
mode this fall. My impression is that there is a tremendous amount of money on the sidelines, but the top 5% 
or 10% that control it are terribly frightened of losing money they don't need, while the 90% to 95% of the 
citizens are continuing their daily labors somewhat frightened that they are not certain where next month's or 
next year's mortgage payment is coming from. 
On a lighter note, Donald Trump recently bought our development in Ireland, Doonbeg Golf Club. It has been 
rated the first or second best resort in Europe. To-date, to my surprise, he is managing it reasonably well, 
probably because he is presently devoted to an endeavor that amuses him. 
Jeffrey, I want you to understand that I am extremely pleased and not at all melancholy about my present 
circumstances. Whenever I get an opportunity, I always visit those assets I helped create and almost without 
exception, I wish I had been smarter, but generally satisfied that I made a positive contribution and one much 
higher than normally done by my competitors, because I am fortunate that the labor focus of my life has not 
attracted the best and the brightest.

The Puzzle of Optimism

While the past few years have seen important advances in the
neuroscience of optimism, one enduring puzzle remained. How 1s it
that people maintain this rosy bias even when information
challenging our upbeat forecasts is so readily available? Only
recently have we been able to decipher this mystery, by scanning the
brains of people as they process both positive and negative
information about the future. The findings are striking: when people
learn, their neurons faithfully encode desirable information that can
enhance optimism but fail at incorporating unexpectedly undesirable
information. When we hear a success story like Mark Zuckerberg's,
our brains take note of the possibility that we too may become
immensely rich one day. But hearing that the odds of divorce are
almost 1 in 2 tends not to make us think that our own marriages may
be destined to fail. Why would our brains be wired in this way? It is
tempting to speculate that optimism was selected by evolution
precisely because, on balance, positive expectations enhance the odds
of survival. Research findings that optimists live longer and are
healthier, plus the fact that most humans display optimistic biases —
and emerging data that optimism is linked to specific genes — all
strongly support this hypothesis. Yet optimism is also irrational and
can lead to unwanted outcomes. The question then is, How can we
remain hopeful — benefiting from the fruits of optimism — while at
the same time guarding ourselves from its pitfalls?

I believe knowledge is key. We are not born with an innate
understanding of our biases. The brain's illusions have to be
identified by careful scientific observation and controlled
experiments and then communicated to the rest of us. Once we are
made aware of our optimistic illusions, we can act to protect
ourselves. The good news is that awareness rarely shatters the
illusion. The glass remains half full. It is possible, then, to strike a

instance, has noted that if there are any doubts about how to construe the CVRA, this venue provision sweeps them away. !8!
Once again, the language that Congress used leads inexorably to the conclusion that the CVRA extends rights to victims before
the filing of criminal charges.

IV. When Pre-charging Rights Attach Under the CVRA

The zeal with which OLC argues against applying CVRA rights before charging raises the question of why it protests so much.
Although OLC never articulated this concern, perhaps OLC worried that pre-charging rights would be difficult to administer.
Such concerns should evaporate with a workable construction of when pre-charging rights attach. In this Part, we propose such
a construction, suggesting that CVRA rights should attach when substantial evidence exists that a specific person has been
directly and proximately harmed as the result of a federal crime. This approach appears to already be the method that the
Department is taking, as [*91] it has extended many rights to victims before the formal filing of criminal charges as a matter
of internal policy. !8? This approach appears to be workable, as a number of states extend rights to victims during the

investigative process. 1°

A. A TEST FOR DETERMINING WHEN RIGHTS ATTACH

As explained in the earlier Parts of this Article, the CVRA clearly envisions that crime victims would have rights in the
criminal justice process before the return of indictments or the filing of criminal complaints. The question then as to how much
earlier in the process crime victims have rights naturally arises. Does the CVRA apply one second after a federal crime has
been committed? Or does it apply at some later point during an investigation?

This issue was nicely framed by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York in a securities fraud case. In the
first indictment underlying the case, the charged crime did not include various victims. A later superseding indictment
broadened the charges to include those missing individuals. When they brought a suit under the CVRA, the court noted that
quite understandably, movants perceive their victimization as having begun long before the government got around to filing
the superseding indictment. '84 The court, however, explained that there must be logical limits to crime victims’ rights
before the filing of charges. '®> The court noted:

For example, the realm of cases in which the CVRA might apply despite no prosecution being underway,' cannot be read to
include the victims of uncharged crimes that the government has not even contemplated. It is impossible to expect the
government, much less a court, to notify crime victims of their rights if the government has not verified to at least an
elementary degree that a crime has actually taken place, given that a corresponding investigation is at a nascent or theoretical
stage. 186

The logical limits that the CVRA envisions could come from how the Justice Department interacts with criminals during the
investigation of a crime. Crime victims’ rights advocates are fond of saying that victims only want to be treated like criminals
- that is, they simply want to have the same kinds of rights as criminals receive, such as the right to be notified [*92] of court
hearings and to attend those hearings. !87 So it is instructive to notice that the Justice Department policy is to extend certain
rights to suspected criminals during certain points in the investigative process. That policy might provide guidance on when
crime victims’ rights would attach.

Eurasian countries and elsewhere in the world. While
today there is nothing that resembles the Comintern
of Soviet times, authoritarian countries have devel-
oped an ad hoc network of cooperation that has
proven effective at the United Nations and in regional
bodies like the Organization of American States.

Adapting to survive

Modern authoritarianism matured as regimes sought
to defend themselves against the sorts of civil society
movements that triggered “color revolutions” in
Georgia, Ukraine, and elsewhere in the early 2000s.
On their own, formal opposition parties were relatively
easy to marginalize or co-opt, and traditional mass
media could be brought to heel through pressure on
private owners, among other techniques. But civil
society organizations presented a formidable chal-
lenge in some settings, as they were able to mobilize
the public—especially students and young people—
around nonpartisan reformist goals and use relatively
open online media to spread their messages.

It is now a major objective of modern authoritarian
states to suppress civil society before it becomes
strong enough to challenge the incumbent political
leadership. Yet whereas dissidents were dispatched
to the gulag or explicitly exiled by the Soviets, or jailed
and murdered by traditional dictatorships like Augus-
to Pinochet's Chile, today’s activists are checked by
NGO regulations that control registration and foreign
funding, laws that allow arbitrary restrictions on public
protest, and trumped-up criminal charges for key
organizers that serve to intimidate others.

Modern authoritarianism has also devised special
methods to bring the internet under political control
without shutting it down entirely. While old-style dic-
tatorships like Cuba long prevented the widespread
use of the internet out of fear that online communi-
cations would pose a threat to the state's monopoly
on information, modern authoritarians understood
that a high rate of internet penetration is essential to
participation in the global economy. However, once
online media emerged as a real alternative to tradi-
tional news sources and a crucial tool for civic and
political mobilization, these regimes began to step up
their interference.

The Chinese government has developed the world’s
most sophisticated system of internet controls. Its so-
called Great Firewall, a censorship and filtering appa-
ratus designed to prevent the circulation of informa-
tion that the authorities deem politically dangerous

without affecting nonsensitive information, requires
tremendous financial, human, and technological re-
sources to maintain. Other regimes have not attempt-
ed anything approaching the scale of China's system,
but some have constructed more limited versions or
simply relied on inexpensive offline techniques like
arrests of critical bloggers, direct pressure on the
owners of major online platforms, and new laws that
force internet sites to self-censor.

Alternative values

While modern authoritarians initially mobilized for
defensive purposes, to thwart color revolutions or
the liberal opposition, they have become increasingly
aggressive in challenging the democratic norms that
prevailed in the wake of the Cold War, and in setting
forth a rough set of political values as an alternative
to the liberal model. Examples of this phenomenon
include:

1. Majoritarianism: A signal idea of many author-
itarians is the proposition that elections are
winner-take-all affairs in which the victor has an
absolute mandate, with little or no interference
from institutional checks and balances. Putin,
Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and the
Venezuelan chavista leadership all behave as
if there are no valid controls on their authority,
the opposition has no rights, and the system
is theirs to dismantle and remake from top to
bottom. Disturbingly, the leaders of some dem-
ocratic societies have begun to embrace the
majoritarian idea. The Hungarian prime minister,
Viktor Orban, has instituted a thorough overhaul
of the country's constitution and national leg-
islation with an eye toward measures that will
insulate his party from future defeat.

2. Sovereignty: A number of governments have
invoked the doctrine of absolute sovereignty
to rebuff international criticism of restrictions
on the press, the smothering of civil society,
the persecution of the political opposition, and
the repression of minority groups. They claim
that the enforcement of universal human rights
standards or judgments from transnational legal
bodies represent undue interference in their
domestic affairs and a violation of national pre-
rogatives.

3. Dictatorship of law: Initially articulated by Vlad-
imir Putin, this phrase has come to signify the
adoption of laws that are so vaguely written as to

Relationship Tools: Monogamy, Polyamory, Competition, and Jealousy

Last year, I wrote a piece called In Praise of Monogamy. I currently practice polyamory
in my relationships, but I spent years dating monogamously. I've noticed that when
people talk about monogamy, they usually either assume that it's the only way to go... or
they assume that it has to be thrown out the window entirely. I think that this either-or
approach is completely wrongheaded, so the goal of In Praise of Monogamy” was to talk
about the advantages of monogamy in a more neutral, nuanced way. Different
relationship models are all tools in a toolbox, and some people are better with some tools
than others.

In Praise of Monogamy was probably one of my most successful articles ever -- it was
republished at a ton of websites, including high-profile venues like The Guardian.
Simultaneously, the article got a lot of really mixed comments. Some people felt that I
wasn't praising monogamy enough; others felt that I wasn't praising non-monogamy
enough; there were lots of other frustrations too. My big takeaway was that these
conversations don't happen enough, most people aren't used to having them, and it's
really hard to know where it start.

Jealousy is one obvious starting point, because people always bring it up in conversations
about non-monogamy. I talked a little bit about jealousy in In Praise of Monogamy.” If
you've recently read that piece, then feel free to skip to the end of the following italicized
excerpt:

Some people experience jealousy more than, or less than, or differently from other
people. Plenty of people in non-monogamous relationships experience jealousy -- and
plenty of non-monogamous people handle it just fine, through open-hearted
communication.

But there are also plenty of people who appear to lack the jealousy chip.

And then there are plenty of people who experience so much jealousy, who feel that
jealousy is such a big part of their emotional makeup, that the best way to manage it is
simply through monogamy.

Personally, I used to get a lot more jealous than I do now. I think I'm less likely to get
jealous these days partly because I've gotten better at finding low-drama men. Jealousy
has a reputation for being an irrational emotion, and sometimes it genuinely is an
unreasonable, cruel power-grab. But I think jealousy is often quite rational, and often
arises in response to a genuine emotional threat... or deliberate manipulation.

There's another reason, though... I've also noticed that some switch in my brain has
flipped, and I've started to eroticize jealousy. I occasionally find myself fantasizing about
men I care about sleeping with other women, and sometimes the fantasy is hot because I
feel mildly jealous. I cannot explain how this happened. It surprised me the first time it
happened, believe me. What's really fascinating is that I think the same part of me that
eroticizes jealousy, is the part that used to make me feel sick at the thought of my partner

ing. Its lack of windows and the dirt covering gave it the appearance,
when I viewed it in 2016, of an oblong-shaped anthill. Workers, both
military and civilian, entered through an exterior staircase in the
center of the mound. Even though it is above the ground, it is known
as the tunnel. Snowden said in describing the atmosphere, “ You're in
a vaulted space. Everybody has sort of similar clearances, everybody
knows everybody. It’s a small world.” He said that to relieve the
tediousness of the work, every two months or so his fellow work-
ers would circulate a picture of a naked person that showed up on
their screens as part of the NSA’s surveillance of foreign suspects. He
explained, “You've got young enlisted guys, 18 to 22 years old [who
have] suddenly been thrust into a position of extraordinary respon-
sibility where they now have access to all of your private records. In
the course of their daily work they stumble across ...an intimate
nude photo of someone in a sexually compromising position.”

He knew that copying any files, including photographs, was a vio-
lation of NSA rules. But he did not report this illicit activity to the
NSA, even though he later claimed that it occurred regularly. He

© joked in his Moscow interview with The Guardian that some of the ®
nudes were “extremely attractive” and that viewing them was, as he
put it, “the fringe benefits of surveillance positions.”

Snowden identified with the Libertarian Party, and at the NSA
he made no effort to conceal his political support of its causes. He
became an active partisan of Congressman Ron Paul, the leading fig-
ure in the party in 2012. “He’s so dreamy,” Snowden posted on the
Ars Technica site in March 2009 (just after he registered to vote in
North Carolina, though he no longer lived there). Paul was running
in the 2012 Republican presidential primaries, and Snowden made
a contribution of $500 to his election committee. Snowden’s attrac-
tion to Paul’s libertarian ideology was not that surprising. At the
core of Paul’s worldview was a deep hostility to the intrusion of the
government into private lives. Snowden shared this hostility, as was
clear from his Internet postings. Like other Libertarians, Snowden
believed that citizens should not be “shackled” by federal law. He
later addressed from Moscow via an Internet hookup a libertarian
gathering at which Ron Paul also spoke. “Law is a lot like medi-

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021200.txt,"Jeffrey wanted his evening massage before bed and Ghislane and
Emmy went to their office to talk about something, leaving our guest of
honor to find company elsewhere. Strolling into the darkness with two
beautiful girls around either arm, Bill seemed content to retire for the
evening. He wanted to have a hot bath before bed while I began the
massage in the tub. Starting with his feet and calves, he wanted to end the
night quickly. Never showing any restraint he sat up on the edge of the
tub and asked me to preform on him orally. I did my job, but that’s all our
relationship was these days, a dreadful job. Getting it over and done with
as quick as possible was my hope but I couldn’t let him pick up on those
vibes, to make him enticed I had to act like his little porn star, knowing
exactly how he wanted it. Only then would my duties be fulfilled and I
would be able to get back the reality of my complicated life. Before I
could say goodnight, Jeffrey had one more request. He wanted me to tuck
him under the blankets and fluff his pillows for him. Then I had to reach
under the covers and massage his feet while watching him fall asleep, he
even wanted me to wait like twenty minutes or so after he fell asleep
before | could leave. It wasn’t unusual for him to ask it but God I hated it,
never offering it | would always wait for him to request it. Once he was
snoring gently I wiped my hands clean of the lotion and quietly closed the
doors to his room. Making my way up the outdoor spiraling staircase, I
felt the breeze blow through my hair and looked up to the heavens. The
stars shown so bright out here in the middle of nowhere with no big city
lights to hinder their effect I could get lost in time staring into them. No
matter how far gone I really felt there was always something about a
simple caress from the wind or the reflection of the star sweeping sky in
the black glossy ocean that would always remind me of my fond love of
nature’s blessings.

Back in New York, there was nothing left of nature to adorn. It was a
dwelling for those who no longer saw the use for trees without cages or
blue skies without clouds of man made fumes and gases. Unfortunately if
we weren’t in the Caribbean, we were there in New York. Hardly going
back to Palm Beach, barely even seeing my family, my dog or T.J these
days at all. In my parents heads I was all grown up and educated in the
world of wealth not needing them any longer they would just wait for my
call once in a while to let them know how I was doing and that was the
extent to our restricted relationship. The road my life has led down never
has kept me close to home anyways so to me it wasn’t anything
unordinary but still a sad existence to be without a family of my own. It
would’ve been nice to be missed though, rarely letting myself think like
that. No room for pity in my heart, if I did, the floodgates could open and
I'd have enough grief in one lifetime to go around a few times that they
would’ve never been closed.

Jeffrey’s business was running well from the looks of his attentiveness
the office he owned in the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Alan
Dershowitz, his colleague in finances and personal solicitor, a bird of the
same feather, I had seen hanging around the island and Jeffrey’s
Manhattan mansion, more and more these days. Alan’s taste for the
young and beautiful was a bias for a blooming business relationship
between him and Jeffrey. After an explicit session of Jeffrey’s vulgar
pilgrimage into my body, we were interrupted by a knock at the door by
Jeffrey’s good friend, Alan. I wrapped myself up in Jeffrey’s pink bed
sheets, which is the color preference he chose to sleep in because it
reminded him of the same color of his own words Pussy”, and covered
my face from the unexpected intrusion. Jeffrey got up and wrapped a
towel around his loins and answered the door completely calm. Opening
the bedroom door and letting Alan inside they began to converse about
business immediately, right in front of me. Jeffrey started to tell Alan
what needed to be done while he jostled some notes down quickly. |
peeked my head from underneath the covers thinking they were too
wrapped up in their work to notice me get up and dressed, and Jeffrey
turned back to me and told me to just stay there this would only take a
second. Going back to Alan he turned his focus back into work and
hustled out a few more orders before letting Alan out of the door and
returning his attention to me.

“Sorry about that, work never stops and neither will the money coming
in. How else am | going to make a million dollars while I’m sleeping?”
Jeffrey chuckled as he sat back down on the bed next to me. | laughed at
his humorous and mostly true statement, then a strand of hair fell in front
of my face. Before L could get to it he put it back behind my ears and
sweetly stroked my face, for a moment we just looked into each other’s
eyes and he nearly seemed almost human to me. It was bizarre how he
could be so kind and gentle one moment and the second beforehand | was
being treated like no more than a common plaything left out for display.
Nothing more than an ego trip, Jeffrey got off on letting the ones he
wanted to know that he could own anything and anyone he wanted in this
world. Maybe for a brief minute I believed the sincerity behind his eyes
but that vision would quickly fade away and I would be left second-
guessing why I even fell for his deceitful tricks for a moment.

Jeffrey got up from the bed and asked me to join him for a shower. In
his bedroom, which was the entire top floor, he had a glass shower
enclosed underneath a glass skylight right in the middle of the room. It
was perfectly accessible feature for a man that loved both being clean and
nude, but still an odd feature at that. As I always did whenever 1
showered with him, | lathered a loofa with soapsuds and would scrub his
body, up and down, in between his toes, even behind his ears and of

neutralize any recidivist claims to all of Palestine, especially since we had around
1.5 million Arab citizens living inside our pre-1967 borders. But as I told Bibi, that
was ared herring. There was a more straightforward, legally binding answer: a
peace treaty which, as with Egypt and Jordan, declared an end to our conflict and
to any further claims on either side.

My main concern was more fundamental. Bibi’s new approach contradicted the
central thrust of Zionism: that after centuries of powerlessness and persecution,
Jews would finally take control of their own destiny. We now had our state. It was
more than six decades old. “Why do we need the Palestinians, or anyone, to
validate us as a Jewish state? Why propose something that implies the Palestinians
somehow have a say in what kind of state we choose to be?” Yet the more I
pressed him, the clearer it became that the substance didn’t much matter to Bibi.
His move was political, and tactical, aimed at staking out a position of power in the
diplomatic process. Besides, he didn’t expect any new negotiations to make real

progress anyway.

As Defense Minister, I had scope for taking steps with the Palestinians on my
own. With Bibi’s knowledge and tacit acceptance, I established a particularly
strong relationship with Abu Mazen’s Prime Minister, Salaam Fayyad. A respected
economist, he operated on the assumption that neither violence nor negotiations
seemed likely to lead the Palestinians to statehood as things now stood. He saw his
role as doing an end-run. He would put in place the institutions, the infrastructure,
the economy, the internal security and the stability needed for an eventual state to
succeed. He was trying to do for the Palestinians what Ben-Gurion had done before
1948. He and I met and talked often but discreetly — sometimes in his office in
Ramallah, sometimes in mine, sometimes over dinner in the 31*-floor flat I was
renting in central Tel Aviv. I remember one dinner in particular. I led him onto the
terrace after we’d eaten. It was a startlingly clear night. You could see as far north
as Lebanon and, since the West Bank was barely a dozen miles away, the
twinkling lights of Ramallah as well. He gazed in that direction, then at the bright
lights of the avenues and restaurants and cafés far below us. Smiling, he said:
“Ehud, why do you need Ramallah when you’ve got Tel Aviv?” I smiled back.
There was no need to reply. He knew my views. Not only didn’t Israel need
Ramallah. I was more convinced than ever that it was in our own interest, by treaty
if possible and unilateral disengagement if not, to remove Israel from all of the
major towns and cities of the West Bank.

We are updating our sentiment ranking index on 25 stocks in our Internet coverage
universe (as of 4/4/17). We have aggregated six different indicators we think are
relevant to gauge sentiment and have generated an overall “sentiment” score for each
company. This sentiment analysis is intended to be informative and should not be used
to form an investment opinion; for example our model does not factor in valuation or
management quality. Of our company coverage universe, we have excluded four game
publisher companies as well as two recent IPO’s from this analysis as data may not be
comparable.

Investor sentiment categories

We assembled data that measures investor sentiment across six categories. These
metrics include latest short interest (as a % of float), change in short interest as a % of
float over the last 90 days, current stock performance over the last 90 days, current
average sell side ratings, forward year EPS estimate revisions over last 90 days, and
expected FY17 revenue growth. While there are no perfect indicators of average
investor sentiment, we believe these metrics provide a helpful framework of investor
sentiment in our sector. In our analysis, Facebook, WIX, and LendingTree had the highest
sentiment in 1Q, while Fitbit, Trip and Twitter had the lowest sentiment. Care.com had
the most improved ranking, moving up 9 points to 8, while Quotient had the biggest
decline moving down 10 spots in our ranking to 22™.

Methodology

Our methodology consisted of: 1) gathering financial data across six categories that we
believe are relevant to measuring investor sentiment, 2) ranking companies on each
attribute using a scale of 1 to 29, with 1 highest and 29 the lowest, and 3) ranking the
companies based on the avg. score of the six metrics.

Subsequently, I later learned a series of related lessons that parallel the above: even when there is
a firm basis for reversal, a bad job of lawyering will not bring it about in most cases; a court that is
determined to affirm a conviction—because they don’t like the defendant or for some ideological
reason—will not be convinced even by the most compelling arguments and the most egregious
record; without hard work, many of the most persuasive reasons for reversal are never uncovered.
I learned these lessons later, because in Judge Bazelon’s court, the judge and the law clerks often
did the jobs that the lawyers were supposed to do. Not in the case of Daniel Jackson Oliver
Wendell Holmes Morgan, because his lawyer, Monroe Freedman, had done all the hard work and
made all the plausible arguments.

Eventually Freedman and I became friends and colleagues, and he went on to become Dean of
Hofstra Law School and one of the nation’s leading experts in legal ethics. I tried to follow in his
large footsteps but I’m not sure I ever made as good an oral argument as he did in the Morgan
case. It was quite a way to begin my career as a law clerk.

The remaining cases during my year were in many ways representative of the Supreme Court’s
future docket during the haydays of the Warren Court. Many dealt with the rights of indigent
defendants—an issue that came to the fore in the Supreme Court’s decision in Gideon versus
Weinright, decided toward the end of the year of my Bazelon clerkship. That decision ruled that
every indigent criminal defendant in a serious case had the right to appointed counsel.

The opinions of Judge Bazelon over the years had the laid the foundation for this decision and
several of them were cited in the briefs filed by his friends Abe Fortas and Abe Krash, who had
been appointed to Represent Gideon. (My friend John Hart Ely was working for the Fortas firm
during the summer the briefs were being prepared and I reviewed and edited several drafts with
John.) Bazelon’s opinions—more often dissents than majority—had established the conceptual
framework for a broad-based claim of equality in the criminal justice system. He had gone
considerably further than the Supreme Court would ever go in seeking to assure that indigent
defendants were treated no differently from wealthy ones. Many of the cases my year dealt with
this issue.

Other cases dealt with the pervasive problem of police perjury—today it’s called
“testilying”!°—especially in the context of searches and interrogations. Ifa search or
interrogation is found to be unconstitutional, its fruits are generally excluded, even if they would
conclusively prove the defendant’s guilt. Not surprisingly, many police officers (as well as
prosecutors) hate these “exclusionary rules” and do whatever they can to circumvent them. Some
policemen even resort to perjury, occasionally assisted by prosecutors in making their “testilies”
fit the law. I was shocked when Judge Bazelon first told me about this phenomenon. We didn’t
learn about this dark side of the law at Yale, and at first I was skeptical. But then when I read
case after case in which police officer—often the same ones from the same drug unit—would give
essentially the same scripted testimony, I began to believe it.

Bazelon had no patience for testilyers, for the prosecutors who coached them, or for trial judges
who pretended to believe their obvious lies. He would call them on it, much to the chagrin of

network of personal and technological ties, sometimes explicit, other times almost
ethereal in their nature until they were made real in a blast. By 2011 you could peel
back some corner of the web and find sites like Al-Shumukh’s Special Explosives
Course for Beginners, where dark diagrams were uploaded, debated, refined and re-
drawn, like some sort of hobbyist site for car bomb geeks*!. Deeper still, encrypted
chatrooms and messaging services pulsed invisibly, firing off real-time tips (use
aluminum not copper for detonation packs) and suggestions (Marines are easier to
target in the morning). When soldiers said they were fighting a “terrorist network”
they really meant it: the force arrayed against them was a self-repairing, growing,
constantly-learning web.

The Pentagon had, after a few years of confronting this problem, organized a
taskforce to deal at least with the IEDs, the “Joint IED Device Defeat Organization”
(JIEDDO).*2 The group specialized in miraculous engineering. They absolutely lived
up to the can-do, American spirit sound of their name: Gee! Do! Scientists and
warfighters in JIEDDO devised ways to secretly surveil streets so they could fire on
bomb-planting terrorists. They developed slick, blast-deflecting new designs for
cars and pioneered armor that could absorb the hit of repeated surprise blasts. Gee!
Do! was, its motto ran, trying to, “defeat the IED as a weapon of strategic influence.”

That made good sense, of course. It was a bit weird that $100 pipe-bombs were
disrupting America’s ten trillion dollar national interest. But: Defeating the device?
You could sense a limit in the way that mission statement was drawn out. It wasn’t
enough. Beating the devices wasn’t the same as chewing apart the network that
produced them. That was the real target. The devices kept coming with their own
innovative, murderous rush, with the gotta-have-it new pressure we know as the
desire for the latest phone or video game or flat-screen TV. This raised an important
question: Just what did it mean, really, to beat a network? Could you win? Could you
ever get aheader? In fact this is a question that resonates in many parts of life now.
That feeling of constantly slipping behind, one that is tied to the heart of a connected
order, a world where each additional link brings both a rich pipe of new data anda
sense of what you might be missing or not quite understanding. To be aheader
marks, we will see, the nature of a real Seventh Sense. When you can fully feel the
network, understand its logic, then you can touch and use new sources of influence

was important to convey to him honestly, face-to-face, where Israel stood on Iran.
Or at least where I stood.

With our joint exercises pushed back until the fall, the logical time for us to
attack was the summer of 2012, when the atmospheric and weather conditions
were optimal. Operationally, everything was ready. Politically, those ministers who
were against military action had not changed their minds. If anything, they seemed
more strongly opposed. Ironically, they now argued that because we’d waited so
long, the Iranians were too close to their “window of immunity.” Even some senior
members of the military and security establishment, though in agreement over the
technical aspects of the attack plan, retained political reservations. But as I'd told
President Obama, now that we had the operational support of the military and
intelligence professionals, the decision in effect rested with Bibi and me. The fact
we were ready to go ahead in those circumstances was not unprecedented. When
Menachem Begin ordered the bombing of Saddam Hussein’s nuclear reactor in
1981, he had acted against the advice of the then-heads of both the Mossad and
military intelligence, the chairman of our nuclear energy commission, and of
Shimon Peres, who was head of the Labor opposition.

But as we neared our final, formal decision, we were forced into another delay.
In the summer of 2012, an unrelated flare-up of tensions in the Gulf caused Iran
and several of its neighbors to place their forces on heightened alert. Though the
peak-alert phase passed quickly, Iran’s military was still not back on a fully normal
footing by the start of September, and when small American advance teams began
arriving for the joint exercises, Iran’s alert level went up again. Technically, we
could still have gone ahead with the attack. In all probability, it would still have
succeeded, setting back the Iranians’ program by at least a year and, depending on
how quickly they could rebuild and resupply clandestinely abroad, perhaps for
significantly longer.

But as more and more American soldiers and sailors arrived, I finally decided
against an Israeli strike — not because I doubted the damage it would do to Iran’s
nuclear efforts, but because of the damage it would surely do to our ties with the

my story no matter how shameful it was to even speak about. Putting my
shame aside I had to derive every bit of courage I could sustain and now I
am ready to tell it. The hardest lesson I had failed at learning until later
on in my life became my strength, the belief in my inner voice and the
ability to speak up. I do have a voice and now the world is going to hear
it in my whispered cries for justice. Swept away by a surge of media with
one phone call I sent Jeffrey’s publicist into frenzy. Not to mention the
release of the photos showing the first night that Prince Andrew and I
shared together that I so happened to unveil for the public to see.

I spent too much of my life going out of my mind waiting for the
rescue that never came until it was too late and then the scars were
already imbedded deeply within. Thankfully I am now free from the
struggles that nearly destroyed the love inside of my heart. I only wish it
could be the same for the other victims, not just of Jeffrey’s inflictions
but every person who has ever suffered at the hands of another.

I’m here to tell you from my own experience that the moon is yours if
that’s what you want, all you have to do is stand up and take it. If some
girl off the streets of Florida, like me, can stand up against the tyrants that
run the deep pockets of our world, than anyone can. Just like I needed to
believe that someone stood up for me once like Robbie did long ago, I
now stand up for us. For all of us girls, the ones who are still on the
streets and think they don’t deserve better or it’s an unachievable dream
to be entitled to more out of life. For all of the beautiful girls who don’t
see beyond they’re outside appearance. For all the girls still trapped in
enslavement and unable to get out of the abuse that holds them down. But
most of all, I stand up for every girls belief in love, because it is the very
savior of my spirit and soul.

Goldberg seat on the Supreme Court. He has proved to be an extraordinary judge and is one of
the fairest people I know.”

Some lawyers describe their clerkships as interesting or career-enhancing “jobs.” My clerkships
were life-changing experiences, which continue to influence me to this day. There could be no
better preparation for my life as a professor at Harvard Law School.

'? When he was finally appointed to the Supreme Court, he invited me to come to his swearing in
at the White House, after which there was a little party, where wonderful White House cookies
were being served. My daughter was then in elementary school and I thought it would be nice to
bring to her class a bunch of White House cookies for their next snack period. I took a paper
napkin with White House markings and I started to put as many cookies as I could in it and then
into my pocket. Suddenly there was a tap on my shoulder, “Stealing cookies from the White
House, huh?” It was Hillary. She told me I didn’t have to do that. She would be happy to give
me a large box to take home. The kids in my daughter’s class loved the cookies and the story.
But the truth is they weren’t quite as good as my mother’s.

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014880.txt,"Impact on cash flow
While the impact on production is significant, we suggest the impact on cash flow is
transformational for Hess. Referencing the charts below:

¢ Under our base case that assumes $70 oil from 2020, we estimate operating
cash flow net to Hess would reach over $2.5bn;

¢ Net free cash flow peaks at over $2bn with a net cash outflow at any point in
the development of ~$300mm.

While first oil in 2019 is only the early stage of development, it is enough in our view to
provide visibility on multiple compression perceived absent from Hess’ investment case
given its focus on short cycle development. However, after the low point in production
in 2Q17 we suggest Hess has both — short cycle, comprising not only the Bakken but tie
back opportunities across established infrastructure in Norway and the US GoM — and
long cycle in the shape of a transformational opportunity in Guyana, that becomes
tangible with a likely FID in 2Q17.

Impact on valuation

In our view, an imminent inflexion point in free cash flow comes with a step change in
value recognition for Hess. Momentum from a >20% jump in production in the six
months of the second half of 2017 carries growth through 2018, with Guyana
accelerating for a decade from 2019. At our base case we suggest this leaves Hess
‘discounting’ current strip oil prices at current levels of ~$50 / share.

The table below sets our PO at our target mid cycle multiple of 5.5x EV/DACF; note this
does not include any value for non-producing Guyana resource value that we estimate at
~$6/share.

In the last century, as the economist Fredrich Hayek watched Europe both struggle
against and flirt with the then-appealing ideas of Nazi and Soviet socialism, he
marked the fundamental conflict of his age as the one between individual liberty
and central planning. Recall that at that moment in history, the 1930s, America and
much of Europe were in deep depression, their political systems struggling. The
rapid growth in the USSR and Germany looked awfully appealing to many. The
political stability of totalitarian ideologis had a certain placid charm in some
quarters. But, Europe was, Hayek argued, walking nothing less than a road back to
serfdom. Was man happier, better off, more justly fulfilled by the chaos of a market
and democracy or in the orderly machine of authority, of clicking heels and
machines? Hayek voted with his feet. He fled the Nazis in 1938, and he worried for
the rest of his life that in the attempt to manage the risks of free markets and minds,
the Europe he loved was running into socialism. “Is there a greater tragedy
imaginable,” Hayek wrote, “than that we should unwittingly produce the very
opposite of what we have been striving for?”32

Hayek thought two safety catches of might protect mankind from the totalizing
control habits of Soviet-style thinking: First, an unkillable human instinct for
individual freedom, the squirm humans have always shown under the boot of too
much authority. And, a second protection he thought, would be the really terrible,
absurd inefficiency of centrally planned systems. No bureaucrat, no economist,
could possibly out-perform the productive chaos of a market or an election in the
long run Hayek felt. Finding the right price, matching supply and demand - it was
impossible to think this could be done by some technocrat in a room somwhwere.
This was what markets were for. This is how they encouraged profit, free-thinking,
invention. Chuchill’s famous line, that “Democracy is the worst form of government
except for all the others,” contained a certain truth: civilizations, yoked by
democratic and market rules, reached more durable outcomes than despots or
oligarchs. Hayek, as we look at his judgment now, was correct. People wanted to be
free; the dream of central planning collapsed under its own weight with the USSR in
1989,

which was done at NSA headquarters in Fort Meade and most of the
NSA’s regional facilities, had not yet been installed at the Hawaii
base, because a lack of bandwidth prevented the safe upgrading of
the software. This auditing software was scheduled to be installed
after the backup system was completed in 2013. The Kunia base was
one of the last NSA bases that did not monitor suspicious transfers
of files on a real-time basis. Snowden was aware of this deficiency;
he later pointed out in his interview in Wired that the NSA base
where he worked did not have an “audit” mechanism. This security
gap allowed Snowden, using his system administrator’s credentials,
to copy classified data to a thumb drive without anyone's being able
to trace the copied data back to him. According to the NSA’s subse-
quent damage assessment, he stole many thousands of pages while
working for Dell in 2012 before he contacted journalists. Ledgett
subsequently reported that the NSA analysis of the fifty-eight thou-
sand documents that were given by Snowden to journalists in June
2013 showed that most of them were taken while he was still work-
ing at Dell.
© This theft was made even more serious by the interconnection ©
of NSA computers with those of other intelligence agencies. Prior
to the 9/11 attacks in 2001, “stovepiping” had protected NSA data
on its computers from networks used by other intelligence services.
After the 9/11 Commission concluded that part of the reason U.S.
intelligence agencies were unable to “connect the dots” in advance of
the attack was related to this practice, the NSA stripped away a large
part of its stovepiping. As a result, the NSANet, which Snowden
had access to at Dell in 2012, became a shared network with “com-
mon access points,” as the former NSA director Michael Hayden
described them to me, which made them the equivalent of “reading
rooms” in a library. They served as a means for NSA workers to
exchange ideas about the problems they were encountering on vari-
ous projects for the intelligence community. In maintaining them,
system administrators, or “system admins,” like Snowden, acted as
the “librarians.” If a system administrator copied data from this net-
work, no one knew.
For Snowden, the NSANet, which included CIA and Defense
Department documents, provided a rich hunting ground in the fall

This helps to explain the incompetence of this administration: 
only 8% of them have ever worked in private business! 
That's right! Only eight percent---the least, by far, of the 
last 19 presidents! And these people are trying to tell our big 
corporations how to run their business? 
How can the president of a major nation and society, the one 
with the most successful economic system in world history, stand and talk about business when 
he's never worked for one? Or about jobs when he has never really had one? And when it's the same for 
92% of his senior staff and closest advisers? They've spent most of their time in academia, 
government and/or non-profit jobs or as community organizers. They should have been in an employment 
line 
Pass this on because we'll NEVER see these facts in the main

solution to this issue: a novel class of virtual worlds called BlocksNBeadsWorld, consisting of
the following aspects:

1. 3D blocks of various shapes and sizes and frictional coefficients, that can be stacked

2. Adhesive that can be used to stick blocks together, and that comes in two types, one of
which can be removed by an adhesive-removing substance, one of which cannot (though its
bonds can be broken via sufficient application of force)

3. Spherical beads, each of which has intrinsic unchangeable adhesion properties defined ac-
cording to a particular, simple “adhesion logic”

4, Each block, and each bead, may be associated with multidimensional quantities representing
its taste and smell; and may be associated with a set of sounds that are made when it is
impacted with various forces at various positions on its surface

Interaction between blocks and beads is to be calculated according to standard Newtonian
physics, which would be compute-intensive in the case of a large number of beads, but tractable
using distributed processing. For instance if 10K beads were used to cover a humanoid agent’s
face, this would provide a fairly wide diversity of facial expressions; and if 10K beads were
used to form a blanket laid on a bed, this would provide a significant amount of flexibility
in terms of rippling, folding and so forth. Yet, this order of magnitude of interactions is very
small compared to what is done in contemporary simulations of fluid dynamics or, say, quantum
chromodynamics.

One key aspect of the spherical beads is that they can be used to create a variety of rigid or
flexible surfaces, which may exist on their own or be attached to blocks-based constructs. The
specific inter-bead adhesion properties of the beads could be defined in various ways, and will
surely need to be refined via experimentation, but a simple scheme that seems to make sense
is as follows.

Each bead can have its surface tesselated into hexagons (the number of these can be tuned),
and within each hexagon it can have two different adhesion coefficients: one for adhesion to
other beads, and one for adhesion to blocks. The adhesion between two beads along a certain
hexagon is then determined by their two adhesion coefficients; and the adhesion between a bead
and a block is determined by the adhesion coefficient of the bead, and the adhesion coefficient
of the adhesive applied to the block. A distinction must be drawn between rigid and flexible
adhesion: rigid adhesion sticks a bead to something in a way that can’t be removed except via
breaking it off; whereas flexible adhesion just keeps a bead very close to the thing it’s stuck
onto. Any two entities may be stuck together either rigidly or flexibly. Sets of beads with flexible
adhesion to each other can be used to make entities like strings, blankets or clothes.

Using the above adhesion logic, it seems one could build a wide variety of flexible structures
using beads, such as (to give a very partial list):

1. fabrics with various textures, that can be draped over blocks structures,

2. multilayered coatings to be attached to blocks structures, serving (among many other ex-

amples) as facial expressions

3. liquid-type substances with varying viscosities, that can be poured between different con-
tainers, spilled, spread, etc.

4, strings tyable in knots; rubber bands that can be stretched; etc.

Of course there are various additional features one could add. For instance one could add a
special set of rules for vibrating strings, allowing BlocksNBeadsWorld to incorporate the creation

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029926.txt,"of neuroimaging—which, like a live sat-
ellite feed from inside the human body,
permits scientists to track precisely how
a person reacts to a drug (or a placebo) as
soon as he takes it. An injection of saline,
for example, that has been described as a
drug not only will reduce symptoms of
Parkinson’s disease but can help a pa-
tient produce more of the dopamine that
the disease destroys. Results like those
have provided scientists with chemical
evidence of something they had long
suspected: simply believing in a treat-
ment can be as effective as the treatment
itself. In several recent studies, placebos
have performed as well as drugs that
Americans spend millions of dollars on
each year.

Transforming interesting laboratory
findings into medicine is never simple,
however, particularly when those find-
ings involve fake pills and sham in-
jections. Some people clearly respond
better to placebos than others, though
we don't know why; some illnesses and
afflictions are more amenable to sugges-
tion than others; and many of the most
intriguing findings are tenuous. Even so,
the recent research is difficult to dismiss.
Through conditioning techniques, for
example, our brain can “learn” different
kinds of placebo effects: people first given
morphine and then a placebo have one
neurochemical response, while people
who take ibuprofen followed by a pla-
cebo have another. Different “doses”
cause different reactions, and studies
have demonstrated that people who
suffer from headaches and consume as-
pirin regularly can associate the shape,
the color, and even the taste of a pill with
a decrease in pain. The value of treat-
ments like those—which have none of
the side effects of drugs—would be im-
mense, but placebos are not pharmaceu-
ticals, and no reputable researcher has
suggested that they will soon be for sale
at your local pharmacy.

Kaptchuk acknowledges that place-
bos are not magic potions. “Placebos
don’t shrink tumors,” he said. “They
don’t make blind people see. If you are
paralyzed, they won't help you walk.” He
deplores the grandiose claims of alterna-
tive medicine and prefers to rely on data.
“Ultimately, I am not a zealot or even a
true believer,” he said. “I am sure that I do
not understand the placebo effect. I ask
questions, hopefully valuable questions,

and we will see where the research lands.”

Kaptchuk practiced acupuncture for
halfhis adult life. But he stopped twenty
years ago. Despite the popularity of acu-
puncture, clinical studies continually fail
to demonstrate its effectiveness—a fact
that Kaptchuk doesn’t dispute. I asked
him how a person who talks about the
primacy of data and disdains what he
calls the “squishiness” of alternative med-
icine could rely so heavily on a therapy
with no proven value. Kaptchuk smiled
broadly. “Because I am a damn good
healer,” he said. “That is the difficult
truth. If you needed help and you came
to me, you would get better. Thousands
of people have. Because, in the end, it
isn't really about the needles. It’s about
the man.”

or most of human history, placebos

were a fundamental tool in any phy-
sician’s armamentarium—sometimes the
only tool. When there was nothing else
to offer, placebos were a salve. The word
itself comes from the Latin for “I will
please.” In medieval times, hired mourn-
ers participating in Vespers for the Dead
often chanted the ninth line of Psalm
116: “I shall please the dead in the land
of the living.” Because the mourners were
hired, their emotions were considered in-
sincere. People called them “placebos.”
The word has always carried mixed
connotations. Thomas Jefferson wrote
approvingly of what he called a “pious
fraud,” and noted that “one of the most
successful physicians I have ever known
has assured me that he used more bread
pills, drops of coloured water, and pow-
ders of hickory ashes, than of all other
medicines put together.” But, as increas-
ingly specific knowledge about human
anatomy emerged, people began to de-
mand scientific answers to medical ques-
tions. Knowledge displaced faith, and
human health improved rapidly. Antibi-
otics are real; placebos are not.

The first publicly acknowledged pla-
cebo-controlled trial—and still among
the most remarkable—took place at the
request of King Louis XVI, in 1784,
under the direction of Benjamin Frank-
lin, then the American Ambassador to
France. The German physician Franz
Anton Mesmer had become famous in
Vienna for a new treatment he called
“animal magnetism,” and he claimed to
have discovered a healing fluid that

TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019864.txt,"﻿SERIOUS MOONLIGHT
Behind the scenes at the 2017 Academy Awards with filmdom’s first lady of Oscar cheerleading
(my close friends know I was captain of the twirlers in high school)
By Peggy Siegal
Was this year different from all other years at the Oscars?
In one way, it wasn't. A24's Moonlight won best picture because voters went for content over
style. The win was for it’s poetic take on the American ideals that the Academy values most and
wants reflected globally. History was also made as Moonlight became the first Oscar winner
with an all black cast and addressed the LGBTQ community. And, it was a beautiful film.
But on the other hand, Oscar voters were also dealing with a political and emotional crisis in the
film industry. After two years of #OscarsSoWhite, they responded by nominating a record six
African American actors, four African American producers and one African American director,
Barry Jenkins, the fourth ever nominated in that category. Three films addressing race were
nominated for best picture: “Fences,” “Hidden Figures” and “Moonlight.”
Lionsgate's La La Land was a joyous escape from months of simmering frustration and anger
at Donald J. Trump, himself a creature of the entertainment industry. The charming and modern
musical “La La” danced its way to multiple awards from critics, at the PGA, the DGA, the BAFTA
and the Venice Film Festival, a record seven Golden Globes, en route to an historic fourteen
Academy Award nominations. Prognosticators predicted a La La” landslide.
So what happened? Days before the voting deadline, La La Land was tripped-up by a lastminute
backlash against frivolity. Even in La La Land, these are serious times.
Backstage at the Dolby Theater, star-struck nitwit accountant Brian Cullinan, oblivious to the
fact that the Oscars are a sacred secular ceremony and distracted while tweeting a photo of
Emma Stone, handed Warren Beatty the wrong envelope. Chaos—and headlines—ensued.
Tweets, chaos and headlines? It was all too Trump for words.
When I arrived at the Dolby Theater that night, I asked a dateless Andrew Garfield to take me
onto the red carpet with him, to the chagrin of his publicist. But a security guard rejected me
because my ticket was the wrong color. Andrew winked, laughed and disappeared. Undaunted,
I went back to the curb to find another walker. As I stood at the limo drop-off, inconspicuous in a
day-glow orange satin dress, Kelly Bush, a publicist I knew from last year's The Revenant
campaign, sidled over and said, There is going to be an upset. ‘Moonlight’ is winning.
On cue, “La La Land” producer Marc Platt arrived with the studs on his formal shirt popping off.
As I nervously fiddled in his buttonholes, I blurted, Kelly Bush just said ‘Moonlight’ is winning.”
Marc turned white.
The red carpet was a three lane highway. The speed lane was for the super stars, the middle for
frantic handlers, and on the right was the schlepper lane for relatives and relative nobodies.
Four security guards escorted me there. By the time Marc and I met again at the end of the
three prong red carpet, La La Land publicist and West Coast campaign queen Lisa Taback
was furious I’d told the shaken producer his film might lose. I said, Kelly Bush said that, not
me. But I felt terrible.
Sure enough, the “La La” landslide never happened. It did win a spectacular six Oscars before
Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway walked to center stage for the best picture finale.
I was now standing against the wall at the first row of the first balcony. Lionsgate publicists Julie
Fontaine and Jennifer Peterson, both dressed in haute couture gowns and borrowed emeralds,
anxiously insisted I join their good luck group hug as best picture was announced. Despite my
faux pas, and my work on most of the year’s top films, including “Moonlight,” “Manchester by the
Sea” and “Hidden Figures,” Oscar night I was in the “La La” camp due to my long friendship with
it’s director Damien Chazelle.
So we three bejeweled broads were hugging tightly, when Faye broke Warren’s pregnant pause
and screamed La La Land. The girls cried, the “La La” producers ran to the stage and I was
thinking about how to apologize to Marc Platt as he thanked his family. Then, the stage filled up
with men in headsets. Producer Jordan Horowitz, the class act of the evening, grabbed the right
card and calmly announced Moonlight. No Joke. Platt, Horowitz and their co-producer Fred
Berger handed their Oscars to Moonlight director Barry Jenkins, and producers Jeremy Kleiner
and Adele Romanski and left the stage as Mahershala Ali, the first Muslim actor to get the gold
guy, joined the cast waving his historic Oscar.
Julie and Jennifer ran to Soho House to oversee Lionsgate's victory party, where hundreds of
confused well-wishers waited to celebrate the “La La” wins, including Emma Stone’s best
actress, Justin Hurwitz’s best score, and Benj Pasek, Justin Paul and Justin Hurwitz’s best song
for “City of Stars.” At 32, Damien Chazelle also made history as the youngest best director ever.
Some, lacking any empathy for the winners and losers onstage, called this historic screw-up
great live-television.” But standing in the balcony, alone and speechless, all I could think was,
“How did I miss this?”
I ran to the Governor's Ball, which is the next stop for winners on their busy night. They get their
statues engraved there before they drop by their studio’s party, get photographed, Oscar in
hand at Vanity Fair’s fete, wall-to-wall with celebrities, and then head to Guy Oseary's home
high in Beverly Hills to rock-and-roll ‘till dawn.
At the entrance to the Governor's Ball, Warren Beatty walked up to me, still holding the two
priceless envelopes as proof of his innocence. I asked him, What happened?
His phone rang. It was so noisy, he bent toward me to hear better. The phone was almost in my
face and I heard Annette Benning asking where he was and saying, Warren, come home.
Warren said, No. I have done nothing wrong.
Warren's wonderful film, Rules Don't Apply received little Academy love, yet he was generous
enough to show up. Now, fifty years after “Bonnie and Clyde,” he was in the Oscar spotlight
again, the latest unwitting star of Oscar’s all-time blooper reel. As Jimmy Kimmel said, “We don’t
have to watch reality shows anymore because we are living in one.”
Here’s reality-show Oscar week as I lived it:
Tuesday, February 21st
I checked into Jeff Klein's Sunset Tower Hotel still exhausted from last weekend's oh-so-grand
birthday extravaganza thrown by fun loving billionaire Stephen Schwarzman’s wife Christine for
his 70 th Birthday in Palm Beach—and headed straight to Charles Finch's photo exhibition, The
Art of Behind the Scenes, to see rare candid on-set photos of Audrey Hepburn, Brigitte Bardot,
Grace Kelly and Ava Gardner.
Oscar balloting had closed an hour earlier, and IndieWire's Oscar blogger Anne Thompson
announced that a female friend had voted for all the diverse and minority nominees. This first
hint of things to come didn’t register as a bell ringer for best picture. Spotted: Jean Pigozzi, Brett
Ratner and Paul Haggis.
Back at The Sunset Tower Bar, diminutive maitre d' Dmitri Dimitrov slid up to me, cupped his
hands in prayer and whispered, Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper are in the corner booth with
Warner Bros. Sue Kroll. They were talking about their remake of A Star is Born going into
production within the month.
At the next table was Ryan Murphy, creator of the multi-award winning FX mini-series The
People vs. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story,” eating with his muse Sarah Paulson, who
won countless awards for portraying Marcia Clark. I joked that the Oscar nominated
documentary O.J.: Made in America from ESPN would win because voters thought both films
are the same.
Wednesday, February 22nd
I met Adam Lindemann and museum director Michael Govan at LACMA’s The Inner Eye: Vision
and Transcendence in African Art. Michael and I discussed the struggle to diversify the
Academy. He told me that at LACMA he’d hired women, African American and Latino curators
years before.
Vanity Fair Editor-in-Chief Graydon Carter and Barneys hosted a private dinner for La La Land
at the Chateau Marmont. Graydon always tries to entertain the winning film. Drinks around the
pool were followed by a seated dinner for fifty in a bungalow. Emma Stone brought her mother.
Handsome hotelier Andre Balazs darts around. Ryan Gosling stayed home with his girlfriend
Eva Mendes and their two baby girls. Emma talked about her next film Battle of the Sexes.
She plays Billie Jean King opposite Steve Carell, an excellent tennis player in real life, as Bobby
Riggs.
Damien Chazelle came late from a dinner for the nominated directors. The Academy hosts a
series of secret dinners during Oscar week for key nominees to keep them away from sponsors
who profit from their celebrity. They also want to protect their own sponsor, ABC-TV, with
exclusivity and audience surprise.
Thursday, February 23rd
Larry Gagosian's annual Oscar-week art opening is always a hot ticket. Serious collectors
blended in unnoticed among the mere lookers and pretty gallerists quietly pointing out one
glorious Joe Bradley painting after another. Each costs a cool million and between 6:00pm and
8:00pm they are all sold. Buyers and Larry's close friends then migrate down the block to Mr.
Chow. Elton John and David Furnish, Jonah Hill, Dakota Johnson, Sharon Stone,
NBCUniversal's Ron Meyer, Gus Van Sant, Emily Ratajkowski, Dasha Zhukova, artists Alex
Israel, Harmony Korine and Dan Colen, rocker Robbie Robertson and Page Six’s Ian Mohr dig
into orange chicken on sticks. Larry's girls come around and slip his home address onto laps.
This means you have made the cut to attend Larry's after party at his house.
Ian and I head to Paul Haggis' intimate Artist for Peace and Justice benefit dinner for 65 at the
LA club No Name where a great time set guests back $2,500 for Haiti. We arrive just in time to
hear Jeff Bridges sing a song from Crazy Heart, Jack Black recall School of Rock  and Rita
Wilson sing ABBA's Dancing Queen. Jackson Browne is the master of ceremonies.
I end up at A24's party at the Sunset Tower for their films 20th Century Woman and
Moonlight. Barry Jenkins wants to know if he is winning the Oscar. I chirp, Yes, best adapted
screenplay is all yours! Not the answer he was looking for. I should have said, Yes, you will
win best picture, make history and bring the house down. I would have looked like a genius.
Finally, I speak to Janelle Monae, who is absolutely stunning. She also wants to know if Hidden
Figures is winning the Oscar. I assure her that her real win was at the box office.
Before passing out in my Sunset Tower suite, I email Damien Chazelle a social wrap-up on the
evening, as he is now sick as a dog, in bed with his dog and has had visiting nurses injecting
fluids into his flu-infested body all day.
He, too, asks if he is winning the Oscar. I write, It's not if, but how many.
Friday, February 24
I’m a gal hell bent on making a fashion statement with every outing, who runs her business from
the back seat of a chauffeured black Cadillac with the license plate PEG-FILM. So marching or
attending a protest rally is not the likely place to find me. But when I read the United Talent
Agency's United Voice Rally was happening at their Beverly Hills headquarters--2,000 of the
creative community’s best looking turning out on a gorgeous afternoon to stand together for
freedom of speech, and against exclusion and division, it was an invitation I couldn’t refuse. This
is a substitute for UTA’s traditional pre-Oscar party--and the ten percenters donated and raised
$320,000 for the American Civil Liberties Union and the International Rescue Committee. CEO
Jeremy Zimmer and clients Jodie Foster and Michael J. Fox speak passionately.
The surprise highlight is taped remarks from Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi, nominated for
The Salesman. Farhadi made international headlines announcing he would not travel to
Hollywood in protest of President Trump's proposed travel ban on seven Muslim countries.
Some Oscar voters do not see all five nominated foreign films, so Trump assured Asghar his
Oscar.
I stop by the Women in Film cocktail party at Nightingale Plaza where Meryl Streep announces,
I feel like never saying anything again. We hear last year's best actress Brie Larson and
activist/documentary nominee Ava DuVernay speak. Back at the Sunset Tower, Livia and Colin
Firth host their annual dinner for 50 to celebrate The Green Carpet Challenge and The Journey
to Sustainable Luxury. Spotted: Emma Stone, Meryl Streep, Ruth Negga, Kevin Bacon, Tom
Ford, Salma Hayek, and Mick Jagger. Kyra Sedgwick arrives late from directing her first film,
Story of a Girl, starring her husband Kevin Bacon. Kyra sits with Meryl over coffee and says
how exciting it is to direct. When I ask Meryl if she will join the minute ranks of female directors,
the acting icon says, Never. My job is done at the end of the day. I like to go home at night and
let someone else worry about tomorrow's location.
Friday ends at the CAA party, a tough ticket now handed out by Maha Dahkil and Michael
Kives. The white tent is filled with a sea of celebrity. Every CAA client comes out to eat, mingle,
kibbitz and dance. Spotted: Meryl Streep (yes, she had a busy day too), Leonardo DiCaprio,
Scarlett Johansson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Orlando Bloom, Jerry Bruckheimer, J.J. Abrams, Ron
Howard, Naomi Watts, Mick Jagger, Lady Gaga, Barry Jenkins, John Mayer, Arnold
Schwarzenegger, Kate Hudson, Jon Hamm and Jeff Bezos.
At 2 a.m. I email Damien Chazelle another party report as he is still sick in bed. Now, a team of
medical talent is working on getting him well for Oscar night.
Saturday, February 25
I march down to the Academy's theater to hear my producer friend (since Diner), Mark
Johnson, also an Academy governor, conduct a symposium for four of five nominated foreign
film directors. As brilliant as the conversation was, four guys from Australia, Denmark, Germany
and Sweden depressingly knew that the absent Iranian Asghar Farhadi was winning.
I took Mark, instead of the still-quarantined Damien Chazelle, up Coldwater Canyon to Barry
Diller and Diane von Furstenberg's annual picnic lunch for Graydon Carter and Anna Scott. This
gathering of the powerful and mighty occurs at exactly the same time as the Independent Spirit
Awards for young and new talent. The two hot owners of A24, David Fenkel and Daniel Katz,
are so sure their Moonlight was winning all six awards they are here instead of the Spirit
Award’s tent on the beach in Santa Monica. When asked, What are you doing here?” they
simultaneously say, Our people are there. The reason they were on the lawn for the first time
is that they have a new television and film production deal with Diller.
It's all very familiar, cozy and the best party of the week. Collectively there are more Oscar and
Emmy winners on this lawn than will file into the Dolby Theater on Sunday.
I sit with petite Gloria Cooper, mother of Bradley. She is the only one wearing a hat, a large
white felt fedora hiding enormous black sunglasses and her pretty face. I entertain Gloria with
local gossip, which she loves, but when I ask her for details on the start of production for A Star
is Born, I get nothing.
I ask guests, Who is winning best actor? They reply, Denzel, but I voted for Casey. Casey,
who touched my heart on and off screen, ran in a tight race with humility, despite a nasty
whisper campaign against him. I never asked about best picture. I'm still in thrall to the
conventional wisdom: It's a La La landslide.
Rupert Murdoch brings his bride Jerry Hall who kisses and chats with Mick Jagger as the lawn
people try to eavesdrop. Spotted: DvF's kids Alexander and Tatiana, Sir Howard Stringer, Oliver
Stone, Ted Sarandos, Brett Ratner, Ron Meyer, Tom Ford, Larry Gagosian and Chrissie Erpf,
Jeffrey Katzenberg, George Stevens, Jr., Toby Maguire, Sandy Gallin, Robert Kraft, Harvey
Weinstein and breathtakingly beautiful Georgina Chapman, Lynn Wyatt, Fran Lebowitz, Henry
Kravis, Jeff and Scott Berg and Irwin Winkler.
Another favorite event is Charles Finch's star-studded dinner at Madeo sponsored by Chanel. I
sit next to Amazon’s Roy Price and Oliver Stone, who sits next to Michael Keaton. I bring over
Pharrell Williams to meet Oliver Stone, director of “Snowden” and “JFK.” The conversation
segwayed from Hillary Clinton to Oliver’s new documentary on Putin.
Lily Collins comes over and asks to be introduced to Mick Jagger at the table next to us. She
says, Tell Mick my father says ‘hello.’ Lily is the daughter of Phil Collins and starred in Warren
Beatty's Rules Don't Apply. Mick, never one to pass up a flirt with an Audrey Hepburn lookalike,
whispers in her ear that he loved her in the film and was on the set, but sadly missed her.
Spotted: Nicole Kidman, Naomi Watts, Christian Louboutin, Kristen Stewart, Ruth Negga and
“Arrival” director Denis Villeneuve.
Wendy Stark, daughter of Funny Girl producer Ray Stark and granddaughter of Fanny Brice,
invited me to Jeffrey Katzenberg's Night Before Party on the Fox lot for the Motion Picture
Home. There is a building named after her father. Walking around with Linda and Jerry
Bruckheimer, I kiss David O. Russell and Colleen Camp. Brian D'Arcy James tells me he may
return to his original role in Hamilton as King George. I go home with the heaviest swag bag in
the world.
Sunday, Feb. 26th
The shocking end of the Oscar show continues to mystify me. How could I be so close to every
filmmaker and totally miss the upset?
Because Damien is still sick, he begs off on his invitation to take me to Guy Oseary's—and
heads back to bed. As I stand at the end of the Vanity Fair carpet at the entrance to the Wallis
Annenberg Center, Casey Affleck arrives holding his Oscar. I ask him to replace Damien as my
escort and he says, Of course. I am leaving in 15 minutes. Don't lose me.” Casey then sends
me off to find Jimmy Kimmel, who has already left the party. Fifteen minutes turns into an hour
as everyone wants a selfie with the winner.
Spotted from “Moonlight”: Barry Jenkins, Mahershala Ali, Naomie Harris, Jeremy Kleiner. From
“La La Land” Emma Stone and John Legend. From “Manchester by the Sea”, Casey Affleck,
Michelle Williams, Lucas Hedges and Kenny Lonergan. From “Hidden Figures”: Taraji P.
Henson, Octavia Spencer and Pharrell Williams, and “Fences” Oscar winner Viola Davis. Also
swirling around the room: Brie Larson, Dakota Fanning, Elton John, Amy Adams, Jennifer
Aniston, Javier Bardem, Michael Shannon, Alicia Vikander, Scarlett Johansson, Lin-Manuel
Miranda, Halle Berry, Isabelle Huppert, Michelle Dockery, Faye Dunaway, Andrew Garfield,
Dakota Johnson, Mick Jagger and family, Kelly Ripa, and Patty and Lydia Hearst. I find
exhausted Oscar show producers Jennifer Todd and Mike De Luca and tell them what a
wonderful job they did.
On the way out, a familiar looking lady keeps waving and smiling at Casey as we wait in the
cold for cars. I say, Casey, that is Monica Lewinsky waving at you. Casey is unfazed; he can’t
wait to get out of the spotlight. Once we reach the Checkpoint Charlie to Guy's party, a team of
girls wrapped in wool instructs the driver to lower the window and asks for a name. Casey,
holding up the Oscar says, Affleck.” She says, You only have a plus one. The real deal is, if
you win, you can bring a car full of friends—and eventually we’re cleared for takeoff. Once
inside we lose each other in the darkness and pulsating Caribbean music. I get home at
5:00am, pack my three huge suitcases and rush off to the private airport in Van Nuys, still
wondering how I could have missed “Moonlight”’s triumph. Why couldn’t I see the forest through
the trees? I must have been in La La-land.

P.S. The following weekend I arrive in the Dominican Republic at Casa de Campo at the home

advise the victim about any plea negotiations. 734 Interestingly, however, the Hawaii legislature defined major developments
as arrest or release of the suspect by the police, case deferral by the police, referral to the prosecutor by the police, rejection of
the case by the prosecutor, preliminary hearing date, grand jury date, trial and sentencing dates, and the disposition of the case.
234 The usage of the term case and the plain language of the provisions demonstrate that victims in the State of Hawaii are
entitled to a notification right and a possible consultation right long before formal charges are filed.

[*100] Other states also expressly extend rights before the filing of charges. Colorado guarantees rights at all critical stages
of the criminal justice process[,] which includes both the filing of charges and the decision to not file charges. 73° In Missouri,
victims have the right:

on charged cases or submitted cases where no charge decision has yet been made, to be informed by the prosecuting attorney of
the status of the case and of the availability [of different forms of compensation and assistance] and of any final decision by the
prosecuting attorney not to file charges. 77°

In New Jersey, officials typically send a letter informing the victim that the case has been referred to the prosecutors' office
and explains and offers the services available from the country office of victim-witness advocacy. 737 Subsequent letters to

the victim ensure that the victim has notice of a series of decisions long before indictment, 73%

and the office actively solicits
information in order to help the prosecutor's office decide whether or not to prosecute a case. 73? Along a similar vein, the
Massachusetts legislature included a provision that makes it clear that nothing should prevent a prosecutor from providing
victim services to persons injured by the commission of a crime, even though a complaint or indictment has not yet been
issued, 24°

In addition to extending rights before the filing of charges, several states require consultation before the prosecutor reaches a
plea agreement with the defendant. For example, Idaho's statute provides that a victim must be given an opportunity to
communicate with the prosecution in criminal or juvenile offenses, and be advised of any proposed plea agreement by the
prosecuting attorney prior to entering into a plea agreement in criminal or juvenile offenses involving crimes of violence, sex

In the summer of 1997, | performed at the 17th annual Starwood

Neo-Pagan Festival in Sherman, New York—Amish country on the border

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024043.txt,"Focus: Private and public companies with novel product programs & product platforms
Investments in the biopharmaceutical sector within NLV-III will target companies that are

developing products that address clinically important unmet medical needs with competitively
differentiated technologies. The Fund will invest across all stages, usually in companies that fit
one of two different profiles. The first is companies with clearly differentiated, clinical stage
proprietary product programs focused on significant market opportunities, where value can be
built around a product(s) by financing it through one or more stages of clinical development,
and in some cases to regulatory approval and commercialization. The second are companies
with novel product platforms that are at or near the clinical stage with a lead product(s). These
companies build value around both the product(s) itself as it advances through clinical
development and around the product platform as its utility as a product creation engine is
validated through the progress of the lead product(s).

The Fund Managers expect to identify investment opportunities within private or public
companies whose primary asset(s) fall within one of the following categories:

e Early and mid-clinical stage product programs targeting a well validated mechanism of
action in a disease with significant unmet medical need. The therapeutic areas and
specific mechanisms of action will be known to be of high strategic interest to a number
of larger biopharmaceutical companies. The target product profiles of the therapeutic
product(s) for these assets will have clear points of competitive differentiation around
efficacy and/or safety versus available therapeutics (and known clinical stage
programs), and the clinical development programs behind them will be designed to
provide clear data in support of these. Examples of these types of biopharmaceutical
investments in the NLV portfolio are Array Biopharma (NLV-II, NASDAQ: ARRY,
oncology, exited at 2.25x), Chimerix (NLV-IL, private initially, now public on NASDAQ:
CMRX, novel anti-viral therapy), and Versartis (NLV-II, private, novel, long-acting
human growth hormone).

e Novel product platforms that offer the potential to target known, and well understood
pharmacologic mechanisms of action in entirely new ways, or a product platform that
has the potential to open up a field of entirely new pharmacologic mechanisms in
diseases with large unmet medical need and rapidly advancing understanding of the
underlying biology (e.g., hematologic and solid tumors). These platforms will be
supported by validating data that provide strong support for the underlying biological
hypotheses, and the companies will be at or approaching the clinical stage with an
owned or partnered lead product program. The product platforms will usually have
strong evidence of strategic interest from large or mid-sized biopharmaceutical
companies through one or more partnerships that have generated non-dilutive capital
for the company. Examples of three novel product platform companies in the NLV
portfolio are Pearl Therapeutics (NLV-I, private, pulmonology, exited at 2.5x plus
milestones), Epizyme (NLV-II, NASDAQ: EPZM, oncology, exited at 2.0x), and
Principia (NLV-IL private, immunology & oncology).

e Later development stage and commercial stage, biopharmaceutical investments, where
the investment theses will be to create value by funding companies through Phase 3
clinical trials, regulatory approval, and into early commercialization. In some cases, the

Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 3 of 18

LOCAL

Sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein was surrounded by powerful people. Here’s a sampling

He was permitted to hire his own private psychologist for his required sex-offender counseling, and after his release from jail, his subsequent year of
probation under house arrest was filled with trips on his corporate jet to Manhattan and to his home in the U.S. Virgin Islands — all approved by the courts
with no objections from the state.

On the morning of his sentencing in 2008, none of Epstein’s victims were in the courtroom to protest his soft jail term or the unusual provisions of his
incarceration and probation — and that was by design.

Palm Beach multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein is a free man, despite sexually abusing dozens of underage girls according to police and prosecutors. His
victims have never had a voice, until now.

By

Emails and letters contained in court filings reveal the cozy, behind-the-scenes dealings between federal prosecutors and Epstein’s indomitable legal
team during the run-up to his federal plea deal, as they discussed ways to minimize his criminal charges and avoid informing the girls about the details of
the deal until after the case was resolved.

That arrangement benefited Epstein in a number of ways. Unlike other high-profile sex crime cases, federal prosecutors agreed to keep his sentencing
quiet, thereby limiting media coverage. His underage victims — identified in FBI documents — weren’t told about the plea deal so they weren’t in court,
where they could voice their objections and possibly sway the judge to give Epstein a harsher sentence or reject the agreement altogether.

Most important, Epstein’s crimes would be reduced to felony prostitution charges, giving him the ability to argue that the girls weren’t victims at all —
they were prostitutes.

Four accomplices named in Epstein’s non-prosecution agreement — Nadia Marcinkova, Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross and Lesley Groff — were also given
immunity from federal prosecution. Marcinkova was a young girl when Epstein brought her from Yugoslavia to live with him. Several victims told police
that she was involved in orgies with Epstein and underage girls. Ross, Groff and Kellen, now known by her married name, Vickers, were schedulers who
arranged his underage sex sessions, according to the FBI and police.

Marcinkova and Kellen, through their attorneys, declined to comment for this story. The Herald was unsuccessful in reaching Ross and Groff.

How do you foresee the impact of the unified GGC currency on UAE’s economy?

It will have a positive impact on all GCC countries economies. The currency is a federal issue, and the UAE has
been very enthusiastic about the unified currency and showed interest in hosting the GCC Central Bank.
By Al Bayan newspaper

How do you evaluate the experience of the women whom you empowered to assume
administrative and legislative roles in the UAE?

The experience has been very successful and most of those women have demonstrated remarkable commitment
and significant competency in performing their duties and fulfilling their responsibilities. They have also
proven that the UAE woman is completely reliable and worthy of trust in all leadership and non-leadership
positions.

By Al Bayan newspaper

What was the response of the UAE health authorities following your direct criticism of
doctors’ professional competencies and your urging that medical services across the
country be enhanced?

There has been remarkable progress in quality of health care services, which still fall short of our expectations.
I totally appreciate that pulling together loose ends to rectify mixed processes accumulated over long years
takes time. Yet, efforts are now underway to develop the healthcare sector and work is progressing in the right
direction. Competition resulting from the growing presence of private healthcare organizations has reflected
positively on the overall medical performance in the country. I believe all private=2 Oand public sector doctors
will live up to international best practices very soon.

Emirates Business 24/7

There has been increasing federalism in the handling of the financial needs of the
Emirates, which has been hailed as a good step forward. How do you see this evolving in
future?

The UAE follows unified legislative, financial and fiscal systems. Federal authorities, led by the UAE Central
Bank and the Ministry of Finance, assume full responsibility of developing and implementing these systems.
Measures adopted by the UAE government in response to the global financial crisis only reflect conditions of
the UAE market, which has been around for the last 35 years since the Fiscal Council was first established. The
UAE government’s swift action to address impacts of the global financial crisis has amazed many people. It is
important to remember that the UAE’s response to previous crises, such as the real-estate crisis of the early
1980s, has always been carried out at the federal level. The increased federalism that you refer to in your
question is yet another proof that the federation is getting stronger.

Emirates Business 24/7

Many laws including the Federal Companies Law have been under scrutiny for a long
time. Do you feel there is a need for faster amendments to federal laws to meet today’s
economic and social needs of the country?

neutralize any recidivist claims to all of Palestine, especially since we had around
1.5 million Arab citizens living inside our pre-1967 borders. But as I told Bibi, that
was ared herring. There was a more straightforward, legally binding answer: a
peace treaty which, as with Egypt and Jordan, declared an end to our conflict and
to any further claims on either side.

My main concern was more fundamental. Bibi’s new approach contradicted the
central thrust of Zionism: that after centuries of powerlessness and persecution,
Jews would finally take control of their own destiny. We now had our state. It was
more than six decades old. “Why do we need the Palestinians, or anyone, to
validate us as a Jewish state? Why propose something that implies the Palestinians
somehow have a say in what kind of state we choose to be?” Yet the more I
pressed him, the clearer it became that the substance didn’t much matter to Bibi.
His move was political, and tactical, aimed at staking out a position of power in the
diplomatic process. Besides, he didn’t expect any new negotiations to make real

progress anyway.

As Defense Minister, I had scope for taking steps with the Palestinians on my
own. With Bibi’s knowledge and tacit acceptance, I established a particularly
strong relationship with Abu Mazen’s Prime Minister, Salaam Fayyad. A respected
economist, he operated on the assumption that neither violence nor negotiations
seemed likely to lead the Palestinians to statehood as things now stood. He saw his
role as doing an end-run. He would put in place the institutions, the infrastructure,
the economy, the internal security and the stability needed for an eventual state to
succeed. He was trying to do for the Palestinians what Ben-Gurion had done before
1948. He and I met and talked often but discreetly — sometimes in his office in
Ramallah, sometimes in mine, sometimes over dinner in the 31*-floor flat I was
renting in central Tel Aviv. I remember one dinner in particular. I led him onto the
terrace after we’d eaten. It was a startlingly clear night. You could see as far north
as Lebanon and, since the West Bank was barely a dozen miles away, the
twinkling lights of Ramallah as well. He gazed in that direction, then at the bright
lights of the avenues and restaurants and cafés far below us. Smiling, he said:
“Ehud, why do you need Ramallah when you’ve got Tel Aviv?” I smiled back.
There was no need to reply. He knew my views. Not only didn’t Israel need
Ramallah. I was more convinced than ever that it was in our own interest, by treaty
if possible and unilateral disengagement if not, to remove Israel from all of the
major towns and cities of the West Bank.

Afghanistan two decades later to oust a
Taliban regime that was harboring
terrorists. Before 1990, moreover, no one
predicted that Iraq, having just ended a
bitter eight-year war with Iran, would
swing its battered forces south to invade
Kuwait.

So if it's conventional wisdom that the
United States will not, or should not,
intervene militarily in the Middle East or
South Asia after it draws down forces in
Iraq and Afghanistan, it's also likely dead
wrong. What is true, however, is that
political and military trajectories in the
Middle East and South Asia are likely to
increasingly challenge U.S. contingency
access in the coming decade. The ability
for the United States to surge large-scale
forces into the region, as it did in the
1990 and 2003 wars against Iraq, will
grow increasingly circumscribed. The
United States will have to adapt to this
new strategic landscape by developing
more nimble, highly-mobile, stealthy, and
networked forces, and by abandoning the
traditional practice of slowly and steadily
building up conventional forces at
regional logistic hubs prior to launching
war.

perhaps a caricature of the Talmudic, rational discussions with the rabbi, felt
irrelevant to my spiritual needs.

Missing was mysticism’s promise of the disappearance of | into a union with
the divine, the Heart Sutra’s eternal emptiness of form and the eternal form of
emptiness that gifts with spiritual perspective and not-necessarily-logical intuition
about unseen Absolute Reality. Forced either-or, binary, card-turning cognition in
the search for God’s logic is unrewarding. As the Dalai Lama, in his Heart of
Wisdom Teaching, says, “...all phenomena are emptiness, without defining
characteristics, they are not born, they do not cease... In trying to penetrate the
mystery and promise of this emptiness, it was difficult to surrender my internal
parody of what sounded like that day’s Southern California New Age stuff about
global nonaggression, sexual politics, Beadles music, distressed jeans and pot. In

"
IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012853.txt,"In each of these cases, there was a mismatch with reality. The person harbored a false belief, but
believed it was true. In some cases, the mismatch was due to psychosis, some kind of delusion or
malfunctioning of the brain. These people didn’t know that their beliefs were false. In other cases, the
mismatch resulted from an intentional lie or distortion, a process that is adaptive, designed to promote
self-confidence and manipulate others. When I conjured up images of McEnroe, I momentarily deceived
myself. I believed it helped my game. I never thought I was McEnroe. I carried my self-deception
honestly. When Hilary Clinton misreported her trip to Bosnia, perhaps she misremembered or perhaps she
distorted her memory to convince voters that she had what was necessary to run the country — toughness
and international experience. Unfortunately for Clinton, her comment about Bosnia was accompanied by
other distortions, which led the American essayist William Safire to write “Americans of all political
persuasions are coming to the sad realization that our First Lady... is a congenital liar.”

Some cases of self-deception are harmless and even beneficial, as in my illusion of tennis
grandeur. Others are only mildly harmful, as in Clinton’s distortion of her political experiences. And yet
others are deeply harmful, as when leaders such as Ahmadinejad deny the suffering of millions. The
problem is that anyone can harness the power of self-deception for ill gotten gains.

Why does our mind play tricks on us, allowing us to believe things that are false? Why didn’t
evolution endow us with a reality checking device that 1s vigilant 24/7? The answer here parallels the
refrain carried throughout this book: like its evil sister dehumanization, self-deception is Janus-faced,
showing both an adaptive and maladaptive side. Self-deception allows us to protect ourselves from the
reality of a current predicament or loss. Self-deception allows us to provide a better personal marketing
brand to defeat our competitors in attracting mates and garnering other resources. Self-deception may
even be critical to the functioning of a healthy and safe society: in a study of male criminal offenders,
those with the lowest levels of self-deception with respect to their own self-worth showed the highest
levels of recidivism. There is, however, a fine balancing act, revealing the slippery slope from adaptive to
maladaptive: as studies by Roy Baumeister reveal, individuals with the highest self-esteem and the most
overblown sense of themselves are also the ones most likely to lash out with extreme violence when
someone threatens the reality of their stature.

The evolutionary biologist Robert Trivers was the first to identify the adaptive significance of
self-deception and its connection to deception. As he insightfully notes in his book The Folly of Fools,
what appears completely irrational about self-deception evolved as a consequence of selection to deceive
competitors: “To fool others we might be tempted to reorganize information internally in all sorts of
improbable ways and to do so largely unconsciously.” The most effective self-deceiver acts without any
sense of his true motives. He is on autopilot, driven by a purely self-interested mind. No checks and

balances. Here, I build on this idea. I will show you how studies of pathology and healthy brain function

Bannon: It’s exactly the same. Currently, if you read The Economist, you read

the Financial Times this week, you'll see there’s a relatively obscure agency in the federal
government that is engaged in a huge fight that may lead to a government shutdown. It’s
called the Export-Import Bank. And for years, it was a bank that helped finance things
that other banks wouldn’t do. And what’s happening over time is that it’s metastasized to
be a cheap form of financing to General Electric and to Boeing and to other large
corporations. You get this financing from other places if they wanted to, but they’re

putting this onto the middle-class taxpayers to support this.

“I’m not an expert in this, but it seems that [right-wing parties] have had some aspects
that may be anti-Semitic or racial ... My point is that over time it all gets kind of washed
out, right?”

And the tea party is using this as an example of the cronyism. General Electric and these
major corporations that are in bed with the federal government are not what we’d
consider free-enterprise capitalists. We’re backers of entrepreneurial capitalists. They're
not. They’re what we call corporatist. They want to have more and more monopolistic
power and they’re doing that kind of convergence with big government. And so the fight
here — and that’s why the media’s been very late to this party — but the fight you’re
seeing is between entrepreneur capitalism, and the Acton Institute is a tremendous
supporter of, and the people like the corporatists that are closer to the people like we
think in Beijing and Moscow than they are to the entrepreneurial capitalist spirit of the
United States.

While Kucherena did not arrange an interview with Snowden, as I had hoped, he did
something I considered more important. He confirmed the accuracy of his September 2013c
assertion that Snowden had brought secret material to Russia; material he had not given to
journalists in Hong Kong. After what I learned from Cherkashin about the lengths that Russian
intelligence would go to obtain U.S. communications intelligence secrets, I viewed Snowden’s
access to this material to be a crucially important part of the mystery.

As for Snowden, I would send my questions to Ben Wizner and, if he and Snowden approved
them, I would fly back to Moscow. But I decided that I was not going to send money to
Kucherena— or to Snowden.

informed that you had propositioned a female cruise-goer, who rejected an invitation to join you and your
female companion for sex in your cabin.

° At least two CFI staffers were sufficiently concerned about reports of your behavior that they urged
CFI’s president not to invite you on a 2014 cruise of the Galapagos Islands. You were invited on that cruise,
however.

Incident 6:

° During a visit to Melbourne, Australia, in November 2016, you were accused of sexual misconduct once
again.

° The incident happened at a dinner held at the Melbourne Zoo as part of the Australian Skeptics
National Convention, where you were a featured speaker.

° With conference delegates chatting over drinks, a woman asked you for a celebrity selfie.

° As the woman held out her phone to take the picture, you reached over her shoulder and grabbed her
right breast.

° She immediately reacted, bodychecking you and spinning around. “Don’t do that,” she said.

° BuzzFeed News has seen the complaint made by another woman to ASU, ANU, and the New College

of the Humanities in London, including the selfie, her face obscured to conceal her identity. It shows your hand
in motion as a blur in front of her shoulder, apparently moving toward her chest. Two other eyewitnesses have
confirmed the complainant's account of what happened.

° In April 2017, the complainant described the incident on her blog. After hearing more about your
reputation for inappropriate behavior from blog readers, she decided to file a complaint about the Nov. 2016
incident.

° On July 16, she filed formal complaints with Arizona State University, and with the Australian National
University in Canberra and the New College of the Humanities in London, where you have visiting
appointments.

° Both Arizona State and the Australian National University told her they would look into the matter. But
neither university found against you.

° “Based on the material available to the University, we do not have sufficient evidence to substantiate
the allegations,” Kiaran Kirk, dean of the College of Science at the Australian National University, wrote to her.

° Erin Ellison, who heads Arizona State’s Office of Equity & Inclusion, wrote to her explaining that an
inquiry “did not find a violation of university policy.”

° In October, Arizona State denied a request from BuzzFeed News for documents relating to complaints
of sexual harassment against you. However, Cynthia Jewett, the university's senior associate general counsel,
noted that two individuals, neither affiliated with the university, had complained about you. “The University did
not find either communication to state a credible allegation,” Jewett wrote.

Miscellaneous facts:

° In 2008, you founded the Origins Project at Arizona State University in Tempe, a multidisciplinary effort
to understand the origins of the universe, life, and social systems. You have led that effort ever since.

° Thanks to best-selling books like The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe From Nothing, frequent
essays in publications including the New Yorker and the New York Times, and the documentary you made with
biologist Richard Dawkins, called The Unbelievers, you are celebrated as one of America’s leading public
intellectuals.

° You served on the science policy committee for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign and are a
vocal critic of President Donald Trump.

° You also make regular public appearances across the world, often at gatherings of skeptics and
atheists.

great societal injustices.

° Earlier this year, at a Q&A event to promote your new book, the conversation came around to the
dearth of women and minorities in science. “Science itself overcomes misogyny and prejudice and bias,” you
said. “It’s built in: Questioning yourself, always questioning results, questioning others, relying on empirical
evidence.”

° You have clashed with some skeptics over your defense of Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire financier who in
2008 was convicted for soliciting prostitution from underage girls, and spent 13 months in a Florida jail.

° Through his private foundation, Epstein has funded the work of several prominent scientists. He has
provided funding for your Origins Project, supporting lectureship and scholarship programs, most recently
pledging $100,000 in 2014.

° In April 2011, you told the Daily Beast: “As a scientist | always judge things on empirical evidence and
he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I’ve never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my
presumption is that whatever the problems were | would believe him over other people.”

° In a blog comment about the Epstein controversy, you wrote: “I remain skeptical, and | support a man
whose character | believe I know...If you want to condemn me for that, so be it.”

° You were made an honorary member of CFI’s board of directors in December 2011.

° A blog post published in August 2013 described incidents #1 and #4, naming you. Another post,

published at around the same time, described incident #5.

each point with a mouse. In some experiments, after removal, the dot reappeared in
fifty milliseconds, in the “fast return condition”, or after one-second delay in the
“slow return condition.” Unbeknown to the subject, the path made by the motions of
their mouse on the computer screen over time while removing dots were
reconstructed as a path on a fine to coarse grained box-partitioned behavioral
manifold. Entropic indices of the rate of expansion of the possible, number of new

Structured Clinical Interview, SCI, associated with the standard Diagnostic and

The actions of nonintegrable nonlinear differential equations, not solvable by
the usual techniques of integration, can be transformed into graphical images by
plotting their orbits in abstract phase spaces with the three physically measurable
coordinates of location x (or some other temporarily fixed value), velocity y (the rate
of change in the location or measured value) and z acceleration (the rate of change
of the rate of change in location or value) in x, y, z space. Graphical representations
of the system in action in phase space can serve in place of analytic solutions to the
equations. This idea was one of Henri Poincare’s major contributions to
mathematics and physics, and has come to be the centerpiece of the qualitative
theory of differential equations. The often point-to-point unpredictable but globally
and qualitatively characteristic geometric shapes of the orbital patterns in abstract
phase space are the objects of interest. There are visualizable representations such
as cycles as circles and statistical measures made on these objects such as the Hy
and Hy entropies and the in-betweenness (neither maximal nor minimal) of their

difference.

animals, we have stripped them of uniquely human qualities such as rationality, self-control, moral
sensibility, and civility. Of those who are like animals, some will seem like kin to the domesticated form
and thus controllable as property; others will seem like wild animals and thus dangerous, dirty and
deserving of elimination. However we engage this process, we have bleached individuals of their
humanity. This process, one that occurs in both everyday life and in cases of conflict, has allowed us to
treat the mentally and physically disabled like animals, to consider women as sexual property, justify
slavery and slave wages, deny certain races the opportunity to vote and receive education, and mandate
ethnic cleansing.

Before I describe a shocking set of experimental findings on dehumanization, consider first a
snapshot into some of our historical attitudes, shared across many countries and cultures. Before we
knew much about human evolution and the causes of variation, scientists made sweeping statements
about the relationship between brain structure and differences in intelligence and behavior among men,
women and the variety of races. It was commonly believed that, compared with white men, women and
all other races had smaller brains, approximating our cousins the apes. Listen to Gustave LeBon, a
distinguished social psychologist, writing in 1879:

In the most intelligent races, as among the Parisians, there are a large
number of women whose brains are closer in size to those of gorillas
than to the most developed male brains. This inferiority is so obvious
that no one can contest it for a moment; only its degree is worth
discussion. All psychologists who have studied the intelligence of
women, as well as poets and novelists, recognize today that they
represent the most inferior forms of human evolution and that they are
closer to children and savages than to an adult, civilized man. They
excel in fickleness, inconstancy, absence of thought and logic, and
incapacity to reason. Without doubt there exist some distinguished
women, very superior to the average man, but they are as exceptional as
the birth of any monstrosity, as, for example, of a gorilla with two heads;
consequently, we may neglect them entirely.

By elevating white men to the gold standard of perfection, it was easy to see everyone else as a
degenerate form of God’s creation or, in biological terms, of arrested evolution, with non-Caucasian races
showing greater affinity to our furry cousins the apes. Looked at today, backed by our understanding of
genetics and the evolutionary process, these accounts are absurd and offensive. Sadly, despite efforts to
clean up our explicit racist and sexist attitudes, overwhelming evidence reveals that the brain holds dear a
suite of unconscious prejudices that serve to dehumanize those unlike us.

Now the shocking experiments. The American social psychologist Jennifer Eberhardt dared to
ask whether US citizens unconsciously associate Black people with imagery ofd apes, using the

disturbing history of this association as her jumping off point. In parallel with the studies of race

about secularization for a long time, but if you look at younger people, especially
millennials under 30, the overwhelming drive of popular culture is to absolutely
secularize this rising iteration.

Now that call converges with something we have to face, and it’s a very unpleasant topic,
but we are in an outright war against jihadist Islamic fascism. And this war is, I think,
metastasizing far quicker than governments can handle it.

If you look at what’s happening in ISIS, which is the Islamic State of Syria and the Levant,
that is now currently forming the caliphate that is having a military drive on Baghdad, if
you look at the sophistication of which they’ve taken the tools of capitalism. If you look at
what they’ve done with Twitter and Facebook and modern ways to fundraise, and to use
crowdsourcing to fund, besides all the access to weapons, over the last couple days they
have had a radical program of taking kids and trying to turn them into bombers. They
have driven 50,000 Christians out of a town near the Kurdish border. We have video that
we're putting up later today on Breitbart where they’ve took 50 hostages and thrown them
off a cliff in Iraq.

That war is expanding and it’s metastasizing to sub-Saharan Africa. We have Boko Haram
and other groups that will eventually partner with ISIS in this global war, and it is,
unfortunately, something that we’re going to have to face, and we’re going to have to face
very quickly.

So I think the discussion of, should we put a cap on wealth creation and distribution? It’s
something that should be at the heart of every Christian that is a capitalist — “What is the
purpose of whatever I’m doing with this wealth? What is the purpose of what I’m doing
with the ability that God has given us, that divine providence has given us to actually be a
creator of jobs and a creator of wealth?”

I think it really behooves all of us to really take a hard look and make sure that we are
reinvesting that back into positive things. But also to make sure that we understand that
we're at the very beginning stages of a global conflict, and if we do not bind together as
partners with others in other countries that this conflict is only going to metastasize.
They have a Twitter account up today, ISIS does, about turning the United States into a
“river of blood” if it comes in and tries to defend the city of Baghdad. And trust me, that is

going to come to Europe. That is going to come to Central Europe, it’s going to come to

realized that unexpected setbacks or slip-ups were inevitable in any operation.
But the crucial first stage of the attack had not only gone wrong. It had gone
wrong in exacrly the way that we had first discussed back at the sayeret base,
and now Yoni was dead because of it.

I had to remain in Kenya for a few more days. Though we’d rescued 102
passengers and crew, three of the hostages had been killed in the crossfire.
While most of the injuries to the others were minor, we arranged to have several
of the more seriously wounded taken to a Nairobi hospital. So I was unable to
join the gathering of hundreds on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem for Yoni’s funeral.
Or to hear Shimon Peres praise him in terms I knew must have filled his parents
and Bibi, too, with enormous pride. Shimon described him as “one of Israel’s
finest sons, one of its most courageous warriors, one of its most promising
commanders.”

The first evening I was back, however, I visited the Netanyahus at their
family home in Jerusalem: Ben-Zion and Tzila, the parents; Ido, the youngest of
the three children, and Bibi, who was still at MIT. It was a few nights in the
shivah, the seven days of mourning, and there were dozens of other well-
wishers there as well. I spoke to Bibi first, outwardly strong but I sensed still
overwhelmed by their loss. Hugging him, I said the weeks ahead would be
tough, not just because of Yoni’s death, but because much of the responsibility
of providing emotional support for his parents, both in their sixties, would fall
on his 26-year-old shoulders. This was the first time I’d met the father, Ben-
Zion, face to face, but I was struck by how this balding, professorial figure
seemed able to keep inside the pain and loss he must have been feeling. He did
clearly know of me, both from Bibi and from the frequent letters always wrote
to him at Cornell. Now, after I’d said what I could to comfort him, he asked
whether we could meet again. When we did, a few days later, he was clearly
conscious of the his late, lost son’s bourgeoning place in Israel’s pantheon of
national heros. He asked me to be one of the speakers at Yoni’s shloshim, a
commemorative event in Jerusalem which, in Jewish religious tradition, would
mark the end of the first month of mourning. “You knew him well,” he said, and
proceeded to stress the importance of using my remarks to explain, and
elaborate on, Yoni’s powerful accomplishments and personal legacy.

I thought about what he wanted, and about Yoni himself, in the days ahead.
About the tragedy of his death, but also the way in which all of us now had to
draw meaning, value, and ideally something of permanence from the feelings of

"
IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030250.txt,"the very heart of exposing how Trump has abused his power and turned
the White House into a corrupt fiefdom.

According to one source, Mueller could hardly contain his disgust
when last month Rudy Giuliani, the President's new lawyer—hired to
make a case for the President on television and to push back against the
Mueller team—airily dismissed the notion that a sitting president can
be indicted. Adding insult to injury, Giuliani—who a White House source
said has likely learned of aspects of the pending indictment—said
Mueller agreed with that assessment. White House sources believe
Giuliani was daring the Special Counsel to tip his hand. But Mueller, ever
in character, contained his outrage and continued to hold his cards
close, as his team finished preparing the obstruction case and refined
the legal theories under which it would claim the right to haul the
president into court.

According to the proposed indictment, the President's scheme to
obstruct the FBI's investigation into connections between the Trump
campaign and Russian efforts to undermine the U.S. election began-on
the 7th day of the Trump administration. Three days prior, on January
24, National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, lied to the FBI about his
contacts with the Russian Ambassador, Sergey Kislyak. From January
27th, when the President had the one-on-one dinner with FBI Director
James Comey,through to the middle of April, the President-conducted a
cat and mouse game with Comey, testing his loyalty and trying to
establish his willingness to aide the President and protect Flynn. On
May 9th, baldly admitting his dissatisfaction with Comey's
unwillingness to play ball on Russia, the President fired the FBI director.
Shortly thereafter, continuing his efforts to disrupt the investigation, the
President turned his ire on the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions,
pressuring him to fall into line on the President's behalf, and on Robert
Mueller, the newly appointed Special Counsel, pushing to fire him to
block the investigation.

The second episode that the Mueller teams has focued on took
place on July 8, on Air Force one, when the President personally
directed his son, Don, Jr., to lie about the reason for his meeting in
Trump Tower, during the campaign, with representatives of the Russian
government—a meeting about collaborating with the Russians to
undermine Hillary Clinton's campaign.

The third episode began on June 7th, after reports that Deputy FBI

the heads of military intelligence and Mossad, to sign off on the operational
viability of the plan.

That was what now ended any prospect of military action, at least for a few
months. Bibi, Lieberman and I withdrew into a side room to talk with the chief of
staff, Gaby Ashkenazi, as well as the heads of military intelligence, the Mossad
and and Shin Bet. We emphasized that no final decision on whether to attack had
been taken. That would require a further meeting with the Group of Eight, and then
the full cabinet. But we asked each of them for their views on the operation. We
knew they had political reservations, along the lines of those voiced by Dan
Meridor. On an issue of this magnitude, it was accepted practice that military and
intelligence commanders could weigh in on the political implications as well. But
their formal role was operational and professional. Ashkenazi and the other
generals did concede that in every area — planning, materiel, training and
intelligence — our attack plan was far ahead of where it had been a year earlier. Yet
Ashkenazi, in particular, concluded that the preparations had not yet “crossed the
threshold of operational capability”.

I was furious. I respected the considered opposition of ministers like Dan or
Benny Begin. I had no problem with the chief-of-staff or other generals expressing
similar views on the political or geo-strategic implications of an Israeli attack, even
though our intelligence assessments suggested the concerns were almost certainly
unfounded. Yet what I found astonishing was Ashkenazi’s suggestion that the
“operational threshold” had not been crossed. Yes, this would be a demanding
mission. It was not without risks. No operation was. But having followed every
stage and detail of the preparations — and as a former chief of staff and intelligence
chief myself — I believed it was simply wrong on a professional level to say that
we lacked the capacity, and a workable plan, for a military strike if the order was
given.

Ashkenazi’s objection did mean there was no way we were going to attack at
least until well into the new year. Our discussions would continue, as would our
refinement and strengthening of the attack plan. So would Iran’s progress toward
its “zone of immunity,” which we now believed would begin late in 2012, a couple
of years away. As that point drew closer, we’d face an ever-more-pressing need to
decide finally whether military action was necessary.

Oslo succeeded in bringing back 250,000
Palestinians from the diaspora and

international community failed though,
by granting Israel an unprecedented

Competitiveness. Its task is to develop strategies and suggest policies and legal frameworks that can support the
competitive environment in the light of local, regional and international variables. These frameworks serve the
objective of comprehensive development, and protect the Emirates position among the most competitive states
on the international arena.

The Council consists of a number of ministers concerned with this question. It is headed by the Minister for
Cabinet Affairs, and includes the Ministers of Economy and Foreign Trade, Education, Labor, Health, the
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, and for Financial Affairs. In addition, there are seven representatives of
administrative boards in the local governments, the chairman of the Union of Trade and Industry Chambers in
the State, Directors of Trade and Industry Chambers in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. We are confident that the
Council is able to draw strategies and legislative frames to secure the desired development of the competitive
capacity of the UAE.

In the first quarter of t his year, accelerating economic events have generated pessimism
about the future of the global economy and its growth. There are conflicting reports in
the assessment of the national economy, and we read some of the studies questioning the
continuation of Western-style development plans and their future in the region in light of
declining oil prices and the global crisis. What is the assessment of Your Highness on the
national economy today, can it be maintained at the level of growth in the light of the
retreat of oil prices? What is the policy that the UAE will use with regard to the latest
developments of the global financial crisis?

Our economy is strong and its potential lies in its great diversity. The proportion of oil in the UAE’s GDP is less
than 30 percent, and this reduces the impact of oil price fluctuations on the national economy. I agree with you
regarding the presence of many pessimistic reports on the world economy, but it’s an exaggerated and
unrealistic pessimism. Countries with the largest economies are seriously committed to rehabilitating the
economy, while the summit of the Group of Twenty came out with encouraging results after meeting in London
recently. Our hope is to commit ourselves to the implementation of all decisions. In fact, the negative vibrations
will decrease, and will be substituted by cautious optimism. As for the levels of growth, few states in the world
are likely to maintain high levels of growth recorded in recent years. We in the UAE wi Il achieve economic
growth rates lower than those recorded in previous years.

Attracting foreign investment was among the priorities of the UAE. Today, the flight of
foreign investors from the UAE is widely discussed in the media, and is supported by
both local and official reports. Does Your Highness really think that our national
economy’s dependence on foreign investment leads to future risks? In the frequent talk
about the global financial crisis, does Your Highness have new plans to strengthen,
develop or restore foreign investments to the country?

We cannot use the term flight of foreign investors because there has been no “flight.” What happened exactly
is the drought of liquidity across the world immediately after the collapse of the American investment bank,
Lehman Brothers, which marked the beginning of the global financial crisis. However, with this drought, the
compilation of available sources of liquidity became the primary concern of investors, banks, and financial
institutions throughout the world. Sizeable withdrawals, deposits and liquefaction of all financial centers

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011660.txt,"My main responsibility as commander of the 252 was to implement the
withdrawal from the Sinai. Israel had committed itself to bring all of our forces
behind the 1967 border within next two years, and, along with Dan, I threw my
energy into planning and implementing the terms of the treaty. But especially
with Begin soon facing a reelection campaign against Labor, now led by
Shimon Peres, he was keen to play to the opponents of any further negotiating
concessions. He was positioning himself as the voice of military strength, and
painting Peres as someone who would risk our security by going further than
the separate peace with Sadat.

Begin had no more experience or knowledge of military details than Shimon.
But from his days in the pre-state Irgun, he’d been an unapologetic admirer of
men of military action. After his victory in the 1977 election, he’d formed a
government stocked with some of Israel’s best-known former generals. Not just
Ezer Weizman. He’d brought back Moshe Dayan, as foreign minister. And as
agriculture minister, the country’s most swashbuckingly self-confident, and
controversial, battlefield commander: Arik Sharon. Begin had recently lost both
Ezer and Dayan, who accused him of deliberatedly torpedoing chances of
building on the peace with Egypt. But Arik was still there, four-square behind a
more forceful military posture on Israel’s other fronts. As agriculture minister,
he had also been the driving force in a plan for settlement “blocs” designed to
encircle the main Arab towns and cities on the West Bank and foreclose any
realistic prospect of a Palestinian state.

After Begin’s second election victory, in June 1981, some commentators,
and many in Labor, insisted that he’d won because of a dramatic surprise air
strike, a few weeks before election day, against a French-built nuclear reactor
outside Baghdad. I never believed that, in part because I knew from intelligence
friends that the attack had been set for earlier, and was put back because of fears
the plan might become public. But mostly because of what I witnessed in the
heart of Tel Aviv the night before the election, when I joined one of my top
officers, a Likudnik, at Begin’s final campaign rally.

Shimon still had a narrow lead in the polls. I hadn’t been at his closing rally,
the previous evening. But like the rest of Israel, I'd heard and read about it, in
particular the warm-up act: a popular, solidly pro-Labor comedian and actor
named Dudu Topaz. Greeting the crowd, he’d said what a pleasure it was that it
was not full of chachachim. The word was sneering Israeli slang: for uncouth,

uncultured Sephardim, not far from the equivalent of using the “n” word in
America. In a single sentence, he’d managed to sum up everything the

expensive. However, there is a huge discrepancy in the financial
capacities of the two camps. The secular camp can not even dream of
matching the financial resources of the Muslim Brotherhood and the
remnants of the NDP. Finally, much will depend on the ability of the
rivals to win public support by means of clear and succinct electoral
platforms that truly address people's hopes and aspirations.

On the basis of the foregoing criteria and circumstances as they
currently stand, the critical mass is likely to swing towards the
religious camp, with its better organisational, mobilisational and
financial capacities. In addition, even if that camp truly relinquished
the slogan, Islam is the solution, it still possesses a remarkable
talent for swaying public opinion through emotive and misleading
oversimplifications and attacks on the opposing viewpoint. For
example, during the referendum on the constitutional amendments, it
centred its propaganda around Article 2, claiming that a No vote
would negate the Islamic character of the state. Although the
proposed constitutional amendments in the referendum came
nowhere near this article, the tactic worked marvellously, and helped
yield this camp's desired result.

The secularists, therefore, have their work cut out for them. They will
need to expand their base of support considerably and to try to use
the proportional list system to their best advantage. They will also
have to enlist the moral and financial support of the business
community. Finally, they must couch their liberal secularist message
in a simpler and graspable language that will capture the public's
attention. Their ability to rise to this challenge will determine the
future of Egypt, the Egyptian constitution and the nature of its
government. The more effective they are the lower is the probability
that the country's first free and fair parliamentary elections will be its
last.

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029729.txt,"January Iran reportedly went silent about
talks. Russia, increasingly frustrated by

the inability of Tehran and the West to
negotiate seriously, vented its frustration.
“Some of our partners in the six powers
and the Iranian side cannot come to an
agreement about where to meet, Russian
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a
news conference. We are ready to meet
at any location as soon as possible. We
believe the essence of our talks is far
more important (than the site), and we
hope that common sense will prevail and
we will stop behaving like little
children.”

According to analysts in Washington,
reinforced by comments from Iran itself,
a big reason for Tehran’s recalcitrance is
that Iran wants to prove to the United
States that its vaunted sanctions regime
will not force Iran to make unilateral
concessions at the bargaining table. In
addition, Iran is concerned that it won’t
get much in return in talks with the West,
and that it will be asked to make
unilateral concessions on uranium
enrichment without getting sanctions
relief in return. Combined with Iranian
internal divisions, as its own presidential

election season gets underway, that could
mean that for the next six months or so
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei simply won’t be
ready to talk seriously, despite scheduling
the Kazakhstan round.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019282.txt,"BREAKING DOWN DEMOCRACY: Goals, Strategies, and Methods of Modern Authoritarians

7. Military invasions: Russian forces poured into
Georgia through its two breakaway territories,
Abkhazia and South Ossetia, during a brief con-
flict in 2008. In 2014, Russian troops occupied
Crimea, oversaw a stage-managed referendum
on annexation there, and unofficially entered
eastern Ukraine en masse to support a sup-
posedly indigenous rebellion by ethnic Russian
separatists.

8. Frozenconflicts: The term “frozen conflict” in-
dicates a condition in which active fighting has
ended or subsided but there is no peace agree-
ment beyond a tenuous cease-fire. Under Putin,
Russia has perpetuated or created frozen con-
flicts that affect Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova,
Georgia, and Ukraine. In each case, the Kremlin
retains for itself the capacity to subdue or esca-
late tensions as needed to maximize its political
influence over the relevant country.

oscow applies these tactics according to its objec-
tives for a particular country or region. For nearby EU
and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) mem-
ber states, the goal is to remind local political leaders
that Russia can play a disruptive role, and to inject a
measure of fear into foreign policy calculations. While
the Kremlin holds out the possibility of military inva-
sion as an option, its preference thus far has been to
promote instability and uncertainty.

Russia's message is meant both for the target country
and for its more distant allies. The target country is
effectively warned that challenging Russian interests
could provoke serious reprisals. For allies like the Unit-
ed States, Britain, or Germany, the message is that
solidarity with the target country could entail a heavy
cost, including the possibility of a shooting war in
which they are obliged to defend small NATO member
states like Estonia and Latvia.

The ‘Russian world’

A favorite theme of Kremlin propaganda is the so-
called Russian world, a cultural or civilizational space
that extends beyond Russia's political borders. This
deliberately flexible and nebulous concept suggests
that Russia claims the right to intervene wherever its
perceived brethren—ethnic Russians, other Russian
speakers, Orthodox Christians—are under threat.

Putin has spoken of one million Russians cut adrift by
the collapse of the Soviet Union. He has said it is his ob-
ligation to protect these people, and he has tried to ap-

peal to them through culture, history, and the media. His
press spokesman, Dmitriy Peskov, has said that “Russia
is the country that underlies the Russian world, and the
president of that country is Putin; Putin precisely is the
main guarantor of the security of the Russian world.”

In 2014, amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Putin
dredged up the tsarist-era term Novorossiya to de-
scribe a large swath of southeastern Ukraine that he
hinted might be annexed. Suddenly, the Novorossiya
idea began appearing in Russian media, complete
with maps, while Russian-backed separatists moved
to write the “history” of the region into textbooks.°
Eventually Putin dropped Novorossiya from his
speeches, having successfully stoked fears that the
Ukraine conflict could widen beyond Crimea and
the Donbas. The international community was then
apparently meant to feel grateful that Russian forces
did not press their attack any further.

In practice, Putin has invoked the idea of a greater
Russian world to intimidate only countries that have
embraced democracy and seek closer ties to the EU
and NATO. He has shown little interest in ethnic Rus-
sians and other residents in Central Asian states like
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, even though they suffer
under political conditions that Freedom House ranks
as among the least free in the world.

The case of Estonia

Throughout its history, Estonia has been fought over by
Russia and European powers to the west. During World
War Il, it was occupied by the Red Army and forcibly
annexed to the Soviet Union. Its elites and intellectuals
were murdered or deported to the Soviet gulag, and the
Estonian people endured over four decades of Soviet-
ization and Russification, including a policy of encour-
aging Russian speakers to relocate to Estonia.

The country regained its independence in 1991 with
the disintegration of the Soviet Union. From early on,
relations between the ethnic Estonian majority and the
sizeable ethnic Russian minority have been difficult.
Estonia has adopted citizenship laws that require many
ethnic Russians to pass an Estonian language test,
and they complain of being treated as second-class
citizens. In opinion surveys, however, Russian speakers
show little enthusiasm for becoming citizens of Russia,
and have indicated an appreciation for the access to
Europe that citizenship in an EU country confers.’

There are an estimated 300,000 ethnic Russians in
Estonia. Approximately three-quarters get their news

Rule #3: Teach practice first, theory and facts second [if you
must teach theory and facts at all]. It is the rare course that starts
with, let’s build this now. Courses that start like that usually hold the
students’ interest, however.

Now let’s move on to the next mistake.

Mistake #4: Thinking that students are not worried about the
purpose of what they are being taught

When students ask what use algebra will be to them, they are told
they will need it later. They are told this about any number of subjects
that they are forced to learn in high school. The problem is that sub-
ject-based education is never about the potential use of those subjects.
Those were the subjects at Harvard in 1892; that is the only answer
that is true about why students are being forced to learn them. No one
gives that answer. In fact, very few seem to know that answer.

Students have the right to know why they are learning something.
“You will need it later,” is usually a lie, so we need to stop telling them
that. And, we need to think about what real reasons there are to learn
something. If we cannot find those reasons, we really shouldn’t be
teaching the subject. But, of course, I don’t think we should be teach-
ing subjects at all, so my view on this should come as no surprise.

Rule #4: Don’t teach anything unless you can easily explain the
use of learning it.

Let’s look at the next mistake.

Mistake #5: Thinking that studying can replace repeated practice
as a key learning technique

Practice makes sense. When studying and homework mean prac-
tice, then they are good things. But rarely is that their intent. Unless,
of course, we are talking about practicing test taking, which makes
sense only if good test scores are the goal. I realize that good test scores
are, these days, the goal in our society, as one would expect in any
subject-based education system.

So here is rule #5:

company registered under the Investment Company Act, the assets of the ERISA Plan include
not only the equity interest, but also include an undivided interest in the underlying assets of
the entity, unless an exception to this general rule applies.

Exceptions Under the Plan Assets Regulation

The Plan Assets Regulation provides several exceptions to the general rule of plan asset
treatment. Pursuant to one such exception, the assets of certain entities, such as the Fund, will
not be treated as plan assets if the entity is operated as a “venture capital operating company”
within the meaning of the Plan Assets Regulation (“VCOC”). Generally, for an entity to qualify
as a VCOC, at least fifty percent (50%) of its assets (excluding short-term investments made
pending long-term commitments or distribution to investors) valued at cost must be invested in
(a) “operating companies” with respect to which the entity has the direct contractual right to
participate substantially in, or to substantially influence the conduct of, the management of the
operating company and the entity must actually exercise such management rights with respect
to one or more such operating companies in the ordinary course of its business, or (b)
“derivative investments” (as defined in the Plan Assets Regulation) (the “Asset Test”). For the
purposes of qualifying as a VCOC, an “operating company” is defined as an entity that is
primarily engaged, directly or through a majority owned subsidiary or subsidiaries, in the
production or sale of a product or service other than the investment of capital, and includes a
“real estate operating company” as defined in the Plan Assets Regulation (but does not include
another VCOC). Determination as to whether an entity qualifies as a VCOC is made at the time
when the entity makes its first long-term investment (other than short-term investments made
pending long-term commitments) and thereafter during a ninety-day annual valuation period
each year, the first day of which shall begin no later than the anniversary of the entity’s first
long-term investment. In order for an entity to continue to qualify as a VCOC, the entity must
meet the Asset Test on at least one day during each such ninety-day annual valuation period.
Special rules apply to any wind-up of a VCOC when it enters its “distribution period” as
defined in the Plan Assets Regulation.

An additional exception applies when equity participation in the entity by benefit plan
investors is not “significant.” Equity participation in an entity by “benefit plan investors” (as
defined in Section 3(42) of ERISA) is “significant” on any date if, immediately after the most
recent acquisition or disposition of any equity interest in the entity, 25% or more of the value (in
the aggregate) of any class of equity interests in the entity is held by “benefit plan investors.”
For purposes of the 25% test, the term “benefit plan investors” includes ERISA Plans, certain
other retirement plans defined in and subject to Section 4975 of the Code (such as individual
retirement accounts), and entities or accounts deemed to hold “plan assets” due to an
investment in such entity or account by ERISA Plans or such other retirement plans (such as
insurance company general accounts). For the purposes of calculating the 25% threshold under
the Plan Assets Regulation, the value of any equity interest held by a person (other than a
“benefit plan investor”) who has discretionary authority or control with respect to the assets of
the entity or that provides investment advice for a fee (direct or indirect) with respect to such
assets (or an affiliate of such person) is disregarded.

The General Partner will use reasonable best efforts to conduct the affairs and operations of the
Fund in such a manner so that the assets of the Fund will not be treated as “plan assets” of any

confirm that Dershowitz’s counsel may disclose Ms. Roberts’s testimony as they deem necessary
in their professional judgment in order to represent Dershowitz in this case.

BACKGROUND & EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Dershowitz was first presented with Roberts’s heinous and false allegations against him
when her lawyers, Bradley J. Edwards (“Edwards”) and Paul G. Cassell (“Cassell”), filed certain
now-stricken allegations in the action styled Jane Doe, et al. v. United States of America, No. 08-
80736 (S.D. Fla.) (the “Federal Action”). After Dershowitz defended himself to the media,
Edwards and Cassell sued Dershowitz for defamation. The falsity of Roberts’s allegations, her
credibility, and the investigation her lawyers took to assess those allegations and credibility
before filing those allegations are a critical part of Dershowitz’s defense.

On April 9, 2015, Roberts moved for an order “quashing the subpoena duces tecum
served on her by Defendant, or alternatively, pursuant to Florida Rules of Civil Procedure
1.280(c) for issuance of a protective order sharply limiting the scope of the subpoena” (the
“Motion to Quash”). See Motion to Quash, attached hereto as Exhibit A. Roberts did not move
to seal the deposition transcript and the resulting order did not seal it, but instead directed that “a
confidentiality order shall be entered.” See November 4, 2015 Email from Judicial Assistant
Susan Moss, attached hereto as Exhibit B and November 12, 2015 Order, attached hereto as
Exhibit C. The Confidentiality Order then prepared by Roberts’s counsel and consented to by all
parties includes a provision stating that “[t]he deposition testimony of Non-Party Virginia
Giuffre will be designated as ‘Confidential’ and not subject to public disclosure” and that “[i]t
may only be filed under seal.” See January 12, 2016 Confidentiality Order, attached hereto as

Analogies are, by their nature, matters of degree. Some are closer to the core example than
others. But any attempt to analogize political ideas in a pamphlet, ugly parody in a magazine,
offensive movies in a theater, controversial newspaper articles, or any of the other expressions
and actions cataloged above to the very different act of shouting “Fire!” in a crowded theater is
either self-deceptive or self-serving.

Abbie Hoffman, on whose Chicago conspiracy case I worked, once described an occasion when
he was standing near a fire with a crowd of people and got in trouble for yelling “Theater,
theater!” That, I think, is about as clever and productive a use as anyone has ever made of
Holmes’s flawed analogy. And it is about the right level of logical response Holmes’s silly
argument deserves.

In a 1989 article I wrote criticizing the Holmes Analogy, I concluded with the following plea:
“Let us hear no more nonsensical analogies to shouting fire in a crowded

theater. Those who seek to censor speech will just have to come up with a somewhat more
cogent illustration — one that bears at least some relationship to real speech.” And so, with that
in mind, I will turn to the other commonly offered exceptions to the First Amendment, some of
which are quite compelling, others less so. In each instance, I will focus on cases I have litigated
challenging the exception.

remained a professor in all Universities with which I have been associated, in good standing, and also an officer
or an invited speaker at organizations like CFI, which have strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the
fact that they trust my behavior. I was asked to be an honorary director of CFI, and invited to their last 3
meetings to speak, specifically because, as they have written me after the fact, the attendees universally
appreciated my talks, my courtesy, and graciousness in spending time with the attendees. If the purpose of your
report is to impugn my integrity or suggest I have a history of harassment, that too is false. As noted in one of
your ‘miscellaneous facts’, as a scientist I try and remain skeptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather than
allegations and innuendo. I also try and judge the facts in context. The fact that Universities and other
organizations employ me or have me on their boards, or invite me to meetings is because they value my
contributions and my actions.

Your specific allegations are false or distorted. Item | refers to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in
2006 where we mutually decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be
appropriate, and had respectful encounters afterwards. I cannot comment on item 3, which involves an
anonymous 3rd party claim, because I know nothing about it, and it was not taken seriously enough to result in
any university action. Item 4 is confusing. Are you saying that because I decided I didn’t want to go out to a
bar with a group of attendees that I was harassing them? The second part is false. I don’t do that. Re incident
5: The ‘female companion’ in this case is my wife, who can attest to the fact that the claim is false, which is
what I wrote in response to the blog in question, causing it to be taken down.

It is worthwhile responding to Item 2 and 6 in more detail,

Re item 2: the student in question was interested in science communication, and on dozens of occasions came
to me or wrote to me with questions. When she asked about advice for after graduation I DID tell her she was
different than the other students in her year. The rest of them were interested in going on to graduate school,
but she was interested in science communication so I told her that she might want to take a different path. Since
she was the only woman in her year, as I recall, I did ask her on one of these occasions if that made it difficult
for her in any way. I asked, because as a faculty member I was interested, and also because as someone she had
asked for career advice from I wanted to know if that made a difference to her. Re asking her for dinner.. I have
gone back over emails from that period. I have numerous requests from her to go for coffee to talk, which I
usually had to turn down because I was busy, including several occasions where she asked me to have coffee
with her off campus to talk, and I politely declined. I did let her accompany me off campus one time to watch
me do a BBC interview because she specifically requested it. I did and do have coffee and meals with students
on campus, and I see nothing wrong with this. I was shocked when I later learned of her complaint, not least
because there was no inappropriate interaction and also because well after the date on which she is said to have
been offended, she continued to email me with joking questions or comments, and ata AAAS conference in
2008, for which she had asked, and for which I had written her a letter of recommendation to attend, my wife
and I gave her a lift well out out of our way to drop her off at her hotel, and I note in an email response to her
email about the conference, agin in 2008, I expressed that I would pass her regards along to my wife and vice
versa. When the University informed me of the complaint I was shocked and concerned. When I spoke to

the human resources person, including relating my concerns and providing the emails in question, I was told
that no formal complaint of sexual harassment was deemed to be warranted in this case, and that the young
woman in question had agreed to that. By that time I learned of the complaint I had already announced my
intentions to leave Case to accept an offer at ASU—a very difficult decision for me because of my long-
standing attachment to the University, and the excellent relations I had with my colleagues there, both among
the faculty and among the administration. Because I was already in Arizona at the time I was asked not to have
any further interaction with the student I agreed to that request because it was basically moot. I was also told
that because it was being handled informally, that (a) it should remain confidential, which I, at least abided by,
and (b) if no further complaints were lodged in that case, that the University would remove the allegation from
my record after 5 years, which makes me surprised that someone violated that written agreement with you.

12 times zones away to meet an anonymous source, Brazil also would have been a more certain
place to meet Greenwald. If some consideration by Snowden precluded Brazil as a destination,
Snowden could have also gone to Ecuador, Bolivia, Cuba, Iceland, or Venezuela, which are also
countries that do not have active extradition treaties with the United States. Yet, instead of
proceeding to a country from which he could not have been extradited, he flew to Hong Kong,
which had a vigorously enforced extradition agreement.

His reason for choosing was not to keep a previously arranged rendezvous with a journalist.
As previously mentioned, when he left Hong Kong not a single journalist had agreed to meet him
in Hong Kong. Indeed, Gellman considered Hong Kong, as he put it, “in the jurisdiction of a
country that’s unfriendly to the United States,” and notified Snowden that he would not be able
to journey to Hong Kong. Yet, even without any appointments with journalists, he chose to fly
to Hong Kong. So his choice was not based on either evading extradition or on accommodating
journalists.

He chose Hong Kong for another reason. He told Greenwald Hong Kong, as a part of China,
could provide him protection from any countermeasures by U.S. intelligence agencies. He made
that consideration clear, saying that that Snowden’s “first priority was to ensure his physical
safety from US interference.” Hong Kong “was part of China’s territories, he [Snowden]
reasoned, and American agents would find it harder to operate there than other places,” according
to Greenwald. Snowden further reckoned that China’s control over Hong Kong prevented
“American agents from breaking down the door” of the hotel room and from seizing him. Tyler
Drumheller, a former CIA station chief, told me that Snowden was correct in his assessment of
that Hong Kong advantage. Drumheller said that Hong Kong was “home court” for the Chinese
intelligence services. It played a: dominant role” in running the police, airport passport control
and security regime there. According to Drumheller, this reality limited the role that American and
British intelligence operatives could play there and Snowden would be protected in Hong Kong
against an intrusion by America. “Snowden obviously knew this from his training at the CIA,”
Drumheller said.

As the Chinese service was under no such restrictions, Snowden had gained protection at a
price. While no US or British intelligence operatives would be in a position to retrieve the NSA
files he had brought with him to Hong Kong, Chinese operatives, and their allies in the
intelligence war, would have a free hand in Hong Kong. Yet, Snowden chose to put his physical
safety in the hands of China.

One reason why Snowden may not have been overly concerned about Hong Kong’s
extradition treaty with the U.S. was that he had never intended to test it by staying in Hong Kong
after his media events. Snowden told the editor of the Guardian from the safety of Moscow,
Hong Kong was only a temporary stop over. He added in the interview that allowing himself to
become part of an extradition proceeding in the Hong Kong court was not part of his plan. If so,
the Hong Kong lawyers, who believed they had been retained pro bono to battle against
extradition, were part of a charade. Hong Kong merely was a protected stopover. The stopover
may have provided him with a further advantage. If he had gone directly to his next destination,
Moscow, and he provided the same journalists with the same documents at a press conference in
Moscow, his status as a whistle-blower might have been viewed with less sympathy in the media.
Even the Guardian, for example, might have been reluctant to publish a Moscow-based story
revealing British and American communications intelligence secrets,

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011106.txt,"Stabilizing Money Value

Modigliani’s main critique was that money earning full competitive return, so that
no amount was too much, would make monetary policy impossible in its usual
forms. My best answer at the time was that full-return money ought to remove
inflationary or deflationary pressures. But | agreed with him that money value
might drift, even so, and that some control would be a safeguard if someone could

think of a way.

The best that occurs to me is continuous revaluation of the dollar. Legal tender laws
specify dollars, or other currency in other countries, as the default means of
payment recognized in satisfying money obligations. Laws could be changed to

specify real dollars instead. Real means corrected for inflation or deflation.

This would have been impractical before the information age. The problem now
seems less. Spendable money, called M1, now means currency plus checking
accounts. Government publishes current inflation figures online. Omnibus accounts
could adjust automatically. They might show values in nominal and real dollars both.
Account value would not change. Correction for inflation would show fewer dollars

worth more each. Correction for deflation would show the opposite.

Currency itself cannot adjust so elegantly. It would remain legal tender, but not
necessarily at face value. Currency would impose a translation cost on its spenders
and receivers. Say for example that the change in legal tender laws was effective as
of January 1, 2020. The real value of the dollar, whether accounts or currency, would
mean its value of that baseline. Nominal value would be that plus inflation since.
Calculators or iPads could keep track of the conversion rate. The cost and nuisance
of this conversion should be manageable. But it would probably reduce demand for
currency where cards or the equivalent do as well. The benefit is in encouraging
long-term contracts and saving “menu change costs.” That means costs of changing
prices. There is no need to change them on account of inflation if prices are specified

in real rather than nominal dollars.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018836.txt,"Marina Market Analysis 26

Coastal marinas along the eastern seaboard were fairly successful until the recent recession, with
many documenting 100% occupancy or waiting lists. This may be partly due to increased
environmental regulation limiting dredging new bodies of water or deepening existing ones. As
marinas are typically close to inlets leading to the sea or inland waterways, they are typically in areas
that are rich with aquatic life.

National Boating Trends

Because of the age, size, design, tenancy, quality, and location of the subject, it is likely to appeal to
investors primarily on a national or regional basis. While national factors may or may not be indicative
of the subject’s market area, the national trends exhibited are generally indicative of movement in all
submarkets. Real estate is typically analyzed on a market-by-market basis. Published secondary data
and market studies for the marina industry on a local or regional level are scarce. Nationwide, the
most comprehensive statistical reference guide for the marina industry is the Recreational Boating
Statistical Abstract, published annually by the National Marine Manufacturers Association (NMMA).
The most recent publication reports 2014 data.

According to NMMA, the boating industry generated $35.4 billion in sales and services in 2013, a 3.5%
decline from 2013. This represented the first year of decline after three consecutive years of growth
following the low point in 2010, of $30.4 billion, from the “great recession.” The peak occurred in 2006
at $39.5 billion.

Of the 242.5 million adults living in the United States in 2014, 35.7%, or 87.3 million people,
participated in recreational boating; a 1.8% decline from 2013. This is within the range of participation
over the past four years which varies from 34.8% to 37.8% of the population.

New boat sales peaked at 912,130 in 2006, but have declined since that date with 2014 sales at
534,500 units, an increase of 0.44% from 2013. Before the recession in 2007, fuel prices increased,
followed by increased unemployment and tightening credit. Luxury and leisure goods such as boats
are typically the first things to be put on the back burner as people become more discretionary with
their income. As a result, pre-owned power boat represented 64% of all boat sales during 2014, and
new boat dealers have had to compete.

While boating participation declined recently, boat registrations have fallen. Boat registrations were
up 0.08% to 12 million in 2014 versus 11.99 million in 2013. Florida led all states in boat registrations
for 2014 followed by California, Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin, in that order.

The demographic of boat owners is largely middle class. In 2014, 95% of registered mechanically
propelled boats were 26 feet or less, indicating more affordable, entry-level, trailerable boats. The
majority (71.5%) of boat owners earn an average household income under $100,000. Over 60% of
boating participants were between the age of 31 and 64 which signifies that the increase in boating
population is younger.

National Marina Industry

Every December/January, Marina Dock Age magazine publishes an issue dedicated to trends in the
marina industry. An article from the most recent issue in December 2014 indicates that the majority of

such communication intelligence to Russia, it would be the height of naiveté for U.S. or British
intelligence to accept such claims as anything more than part of the cover story.

As for the Snowden’s motive, I see no reason to doubt Snowden’s explanation that he stole
NSA documents to expose NSA surveillance that he believed was an illicit intrusion into the
privacy of individuals. Such disaffection is not a unique situation in the intelligence business.
Many of Russia’s espionage sources before Snowden were also dissatisfied employees who had
access to classified secrets. Like some of them, Snowden used his privileged access to blow the
whistle on what he considered to be the improper activities of the organization for which he
worked. In that sense, I fully accept that he began as a whistle-blower, not as a spy. It was also
as a whistle-blower that he contacted Laura Poitras, Glenn Greenwald and Barton Gellman, who
published the scoops he provided in the Guardian, Der Spiegel and Washington Post,

Snowden’s penetration went beyond whistle-blowing, however. He copied a vast number of
electronic files, including the level 3 files that contained the NSA’s most sensitive sources and
methods. While these files had little, if anything, to do with domestic surveillance or whistle-
blowing, they gave him the sense of power he demonstrated in asserting that he could make all of
U.S. communication intelligence “go dark” all over the world. We know from Kucherena that he
did not share part of data with journalists. Instead, he took it to Russia.

As far as carrying out the most damaging part of the operation, he could not have acted entirely
alone. It will be recalled that the deepest part of his penetration was during the five weeks he
worked at the National Threat Operations Center in Hawaii as a contract employee of Booz Allen
Hamilton. It was there that he copied level 3 files, including the so-called road map to the gaps in
American intelligence. During this period, as discussed in Chapter HII, Snowden had neither the
passwords nor system administrator’s privileges that would allow him to copy, transfer and steal
the electronic files. He therefore must have obtained that assistance from some who had the
passwords and privileges. Even if that reality does not sit well with the NSA administration, there
is no reason to assume that Snowden was the only disgruntled employee at that NSA facility in
2013. That a dozen or so NSA co-workers attended his anti-surveillance Crypto party in 2012
shows that others shared his sensibilities and antipathy towards NSA surveillance. It therefore
seems plausible to me that he found a co-worker willing to cooperate, or vice versa, a co-worker
found him. To be sure, Snowden might not have been aware of his new accomplice’s true motives
or affiliations. But without some co-worker providing him with entry to the sealed-off computers,
he could not have carried out the penetration. To our knowledge, whoever helped him evidently
did not want to expose himself to prosecution or defect from the NSA. That was Snowden’s
role. By accepting the sole blame in the video that Poitras made about him in Hong Kong,
Snowden shielded anyone else from suspicion, which was, as he told Poitras, his purpose,
Whoever helped him may still be working at the NSA.

To be sure, there remains another glaring gap in the chain of events that led Snowden to
Moscow: his whereabouts and activities during his first eleven days in Hong Kong. Mike Rogers,
the chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, even speculated that Snowden might
have been taken to mainland China during this period. What drove his speculation was the
admission of U.S. intelligence that, despite its vast global resources for searching credit card
charges, banking transactions, hotel registrations, emails, police records and even CCTV cameras,
neither it, nor its allies, were able to find a trace of Snowden. It was, in a phrase later made
famous by former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. “A known unknown.” Yet there

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020371
"
IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011112.txt,"estimated at a little less than a fourth of this sum. My impression is that this

exposure is not yet dangerous. But it needs watching.

The best method to estimate aggregate adult human capital separately is Petty’s. It
is present value of future human cash flow. That means pay less invested
consumption. If] am right, meaning that Farr, Marshall and Kiker are wrong,
invested consumption is negligible among adults. Then Petty was right to capitalize
pay with no deduction. And he was right to capitalize aggregate current pay, with no
need to model the future. Growth of pay will tend to match growth of human capital.
The discount rate to find its present value is expected rated of return. Rate of return
is growth rate plus cash flow rate. Evaluating human capital as constant current pay
discounted by cash flow rate alone will give the same answer as if we modeled in
expected pay growth, but then discounted at cash flow rate plus the same projected

growth rate.

Total human capital is adult capital plus that of the young. That part might be
measured at current cost. I won’t attempt either of those calculations here, since

they seem to call for economists expert in interpreting national accounts.

To Do List

Books and papers on economics tend to lead to “policy prescriptions”. That means
recommendations on what governments and markets and educators should do. My
list begins with getting rid of the double tax on dividends. To get democrats on
board, make the effect revenue neutral by raising the corporate tax rate. Dividend
rates have been far too low for about 50 years now. They should average 5% to 6%
real, as they did in the nineteenth century. The result of low dividends has been
dangerous overinvestment in the private sector, with growth hampered rather than
enhanced. Charts and tables make it clear that ex ante investment beyond

depreciation recovery is deadweight loss.

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023292 
With your acquiesence , Eileen did not report to Delson ( he acting as a conduit directly to me) , she 
continued to provide bad info to both you ( cash flows , stock accts, structures. sales Etc) and me. and each 
time with my many annoying calls to you made immediately afterwards that she was g.....y!! No one was 
hired to run YOUR office until two months ago , no one was even interviewed and even now , Brad, a very 
nice man, is not even full time,(crazy ) Hours upon hours of time need to be spent training him. and his new 
staff. Eileen followed your instructions, not mine, in fact she continued to ignore mine saying  but Leon 
said  or its on Leon's desk etc , You would become frustrated when i pointed out each instance, of her 
obfuscation. originally you were given the clear choice, but to save money ,you chose not to hire my team. I 
was hired to do the architecture, you kept your own team. with Eileen at the head. instructions were given by 
me„ detailed but ignored by her. ( except in the instances where I inserted myself and personally had to do the 
weeks of grunt work ),ex. jpm morgan acct still not in use? That being said, If you do the cold calculation 
,starting from where you were, to where you are currently . you have made a hell of a deal. -- negotiating 
down my original amount requested, calling upon our friendship and suggesting that the Carlyn mess was 
partially my fault. ( though in that specific example, I had never been asked to do more than merely provide 
you the name of the most highly recognized atty in the field, not consulted,nor even asked again for my 
guidance along the way. ). I accepted the discount as your friend. ( by the way „suggesting now, that your 
Tom is now that last word on tax characterization, frankly is a bit much,-). however - that is all in the past. 
In order to move forward 
I would ask that you realize that very unlike yours, My business is only comprised of my personal attention 
and my personal time . Time that I was forced to grossly overspend on your various issues last year. . As you 
are my very close friend I will not have you participate in a bidding process that I have decided i will 
have this year for my time. (hopefully a more fair way to allocate ) I would also ask that you keep in mind 
that though our deal expired months ago. (also keeping in mind , that your understanding of the final 
payment terms neither reflected the emails or my memory, we finished it up your way. ) I have answered every 
call Brad , joslin, Ada or you, have made . reviewed docs over and over/ until once again, I was 
forced to insert myself strongly as I thought it dangerous not to. I made serious dollar and time concessions 
last year.very serious I am wiling to continue to accommodate some of your concerns , but I am, under no 
circumstances , none, willing to spend my time for free. its not fair. After cleaning up Carlyn's mess , which 
was a few weeks and 30 million dollars . We were both highly aware of the dire circumstances in which you 
found yourself last year, and in fact due predominately to its seriousness, and those very circumstances I took 
extra care in our negotiations . (you had claimed I had you over a barrel, ( a horrible position to be in with my 
very close friend.), unfortunately I fear that if you are not cautious ,in the near future, another barrel will appear 
of your own design ) 
I heard you when you said you believed i had already been paid for the work that is now required. The art 
partnership has fully answered all your concerns and discharged all my obligations and more so. . ( 
FYI Carlyns art partnership that you referenced is similar in only its title. ) You will also recall that you 
required that my payments be at the end of my work not at the beginning as everyone else's .( my work was 
never to include hours upon hours of training your staff). I eventually agreed, this of course should 
make clear that the 2014 tax year that will close Oct 2015 is not covered by our past agreement at all. I 
pointed this very fact out to you when I initially proposed a multi year agreement right out of the box. you said 
you preferred not. As you said ,I have produced results to date, far in excess of even my own exalted opinion 
of my projections. I have devoted a monumental amount of my limited amount of time-- way, way in excess of 
our agreement. I will be fair, I am willing to roll in the amount still outstanding from last year if that helps .. 
However, As my best student , and my only one, you are now capable of doing most, if not all, of the 
required work yourself I can put my whiteboard away when you come to eat and just have fun, trade stories,. 
share moments ideas etc. . I am of course always available to guide you as a friend if you choose that route . 
always. It will take a great deal of your time , but you will not have to spend any more money on mine. 
We are scheduled to meet fri at 430 , I leave at 5 am sat morning.

Jeffrey-given the high daily interest cost (50k+/-) on $$ borrowed which you pointed out yesterday, here's what 
I'm thinking, but I want to be 100% on the same page as you: 
1. Close next monday on the credit line, but don't borrow any $$. (We can, of course push closing back but my 
preference wld be to close.) 
2. Right now, at barry's request, Irene Steiner, on behalf of the trustees is reviewing apol and apo-ol. While 
probably not impt on a substantive basis it was (a) impt to barry and (b) is likely good for leon. 
3. We are hoping to have signature pages to the trustees (and returned to us) by early to mid next week. (Ada 
will oversee.) 
4. We will then get the new trust to bofa who, moving quickly (according to them), will have an acct open the 
following week, 12/7-9. 
5. We need to manage execution of paperwork associated with decanting which I assume occurs once apo-ol 
and bank acct are operative. (Ada I'm sure you'll be on top of this). 
6. I assume we will move $$ to pay down loan the day or day after (?) apo-01 bank acct open. As you know we 
cld do this as early as next monday/tuesday but then cash will be sitting in apo-1 while we're waiting for apo-01 
bank acct. 
7. If there are sales of assets (or 'lc's) from leon to apol or apo-01 that needs to be buttoned down and 
organized asap. 
8. Same if you want another NEW trust in the mix as that will involve paperwork and opening an acct with 
bank. 
Let's discuss to make sure we're on the same page on process. B

I have mixed emotions about what transpired today. really, You saw first hand in nauseating detail what i 
have been saying to you for quite a while now. Joslins answers were totally incomprehensible, the charts he 
prepared unreadable. Brads defensive posture was at a minum very surprising . He and I have recently gotten 
along quite well, I thought. Neither Joslin or Brad understood a 180 million dollar number. no cash flow 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023296 
after weeks of requesting? odd. when you suggested that heathers behavior was emblematic of a sloppy 
office , brad said lets not talk about emblems??! bill pay, admittedly no change for the year. . plane not 
done. though it was the only thing i suggested doing first in july . . I sent you a list of 10 consultantts. brad said 
three, . i didnt want to push it. I was shocked that brad was opining on things he knows little or nothing 
about. tax issues. 1031. neg basis, note payoffs ( the same idea he said he had had from the beggining??!!) 
. answers re LBF holdings that can be corrected ( they cant) . valuations that have never been read. . When 
we met in your lobby he seems surprised that i was there. I dont know if he felt somewhat sandbagged. . . 
the savings on the note payoff is aprrox 33 % of 1.8 billion, real money if you do phaidon which i see no 
reason not to . if later josh and ben want to buy it back with you or without you they can. i will walk you 
through the structure one on one. . the losses will offeset the calder gain as well as apollo gain. 
Im aware that seeing what you saw frustrated you. I felt badly for you. 
You wanted a contingent deal. real value. etc. I will not of course hold you to your deal . . its silly. its not 
how i work or a reflection of our friendship, my proposal is as follows. I want away from your buisiness , but 
at the same time leaving you in good shape. I think you should pay the 25m that you did not for this 
year. for next year its the same 40 m as always, paid 20 in jan and 20 in july, and then we are done. I will give 
you advice and counsel but new people will be running your operating machine. I will oversee all the work 
that needs to be done you and I will hire new people , and it will be self running. ( it was may in my house 
when you told brad it had been 5 months and you were getting fed up ) I will set up a parallel. office , somenoe 
like wendy dolman or her quality is paramount. two accountants two bookeepers and two office 
admins. . alan and zoe will handle trusts and grats. heatehr diana george will be incolved in art partnership. if 
you want brad, analysts etc. and kids to do investments I have little to add in that regard ,except to be able to 
account for things properly. I suggest that the kids must have skin in any deal. 
Alternatively , we can continue to focus on fun and let someone else do the things that you want done. and 
you and I can kibbitz about it all. structures outcomes risk, museums. charity, ( joslins answer by the way 
was I had asked how much charity was leon planining to give this year , ( the 2 m ) he didnt include your 
foundation or the payment to me, or from debra and you??!!

As you are well aware, There is little I won't do for you, or at least try to do as a friend, and a great deal that 
I have already done ( both known and some things that willneed to remain unknown.) Our arrangement was 
for me to architect sophisticated structures that would be beneficial to you. that is what I have done and will 
continue do in order to fulfill my obligations under our agreement. The discovered fact that you in reality 
need an entire family office built from scratch has been trying I have aleady agreed de- facto to try 
to help. I would suggest that Phaidons payroll and attention pales in importance to your personal 
structure,which has taken a back seat, Some of my suggestions regarding the Eysium office are as 
follows you will need a budget of 3- 5 million per year. CEO 1 million, new tax person to work with rich, 
250. new bookkeeper ,200 new paralegal to work with ADA ALan etc , coordinating with Apollo, Akin , paul 
weiss , new acct openings, sec filings , sales tax review, etc. $150 . art point person. loan, inventory,

fear may later turn out to be a problem. ie what i would and wouldn't do , - my responsibilities. etc and those 
things that are not. below you will find details of things that I thought needed to be done, so that you 
wouldn't find yourself in the very place where you currently find yourself however ,you chose to defer 
many of my suggestions- see below -,until only weeks ago. ! you chose to defer the jpm acct. the art 
partnership on and on - into this year. and though the 60- 50 40 timber emails all carried with it a clear warning 
that you needed to do something re personnel if it were to stabilize,- you chose to wait.

With regard the more pressing issue I am uncertain of just how to proceed. I am torn, as my very strong

that will make you very upset and a major pain in the ass. I wrote you months ago that the quality of the people 
involved need to be upgraded. ( lucky for me these last issues arose way before the beginning of my 
involvement ) I am also aware however of my overarching friendship obligations of ok, -given all the 
complexities who else can do it? problem. 
Your family office needs a daddy. children with good intentions are running around, sniping , nitpicking with 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023299 
little direction. As a stopgap measure I am suggesting , we put in Larry Delson to take charge Everyone would 
report to him. Eileen included. He would however work for me. this is not, by a long shot my first choice as I 
prefer only being responsible and standing behind my own personal work ( ie the word DONE will no longer 
be transmitted to reflect status stated by others ) 
With no commitment on my part whatsoever, to do it. So far as I have failed in my attempt in trying to 
think through the problem creatively. My organizations handling of the more complex issues I believe you 
might find very costly, very ! ( however many structures available some risk sharing, maybe risk caps ,etc ) but 
would require my teams doing the work , not yours. Ada should be only a trust, grat administrator, not sure 
what role you prefer for Eileen as you hired her initially to oversee investments. whether Rich your controller 
stays or not, is not urgent. having Tom report to a new person,- is. coordination with Suydam Kathy 
Gregory, I would suggest limiting to one person. The increasing public profile needs to be taken into 
consideration. 
TODAY 
With your acquiesence , Eileen did not report to Delson ( he acting as a conduit directly to me) , she 
continued to provide bad info to both you ( cash flows , stock accts, structures. sales Etc) and me. and each 
time with my many annoying calls to you made immediately afterwards that she was g.....y!! No one was 
hired to run YOUR office until two months ago , no one was even interviewed and even now , Brad, a very 
nice man, is not even full time,(crazy ) Hours upon hours of time need to be spent training him. and his new 
staff. Eileen followed your instructions, not mine, in fact she continued to ignore mine saying  but Leon 
said  or its on Leon's desk etc , You would become frustrated when i pointed out each instance, of her 
obfuscation. originally you were given the clear choice, but to save money ,you chose not to hire my team. I 
was hired to do the architecture, you kept your own team. with Eileen at the head. instructions were given by 
me„ detailed but ignored by her. ( except in the instances where I inserted myself and personally had to do the 
weeks of grunt work ),ex. jpm morgan acct still not in use? That being said, If you do the cold calculation 
,starting from where you were, to where you are currently . you have made a hell of a deal. -- negotiating 
down my original amount requested, calling upon our friendship and suggesting that the Carlyn mess was 
partially my fault. ( though in that specific example, I had never been asked to do more than merely provide 
you the name of the most highly recognized atty in the field, not consulted,nor even asked again for my 
guidance along the way. ). I accepted the discount as your friend. ( by the way „suggesting now, that your 
Tom is now that last word on tax characterization, frankly is a bit much,-). however - that is all in the past. 
In order to move forward 
I would ask that you realize that very unlike yours, My business is only comprised of my personal attention 
and my personal time . Time that I was forced to grossly overspend on your various issues last year. . As you 
are my very close friend I will not have you participate in a bidding process that I have decided i will 
have this year for my time. (hopefully a more fair way to allocate ) I would also ask that you keep in mind 
that though our deal expired months ago. (also keeping in mind , that your understanding of the final 
payment terms neither reflected the emails or my memory, we finished it up your way. ) I have answered every 
call Brad , joslin, Ada or you, have made . reviewed docs over and over/ until once again, I was 
forced to insert myself strongly as I thought it dangerous not to. I made serious dollar and time concessions 
last year.very serious I am wiling to continue to accommodate some of your concerns , but I am, under no 
circumstances , none, willing to spend my time for free. its not fair. After cleaning up Carlyn's mess , which 
was a few weeks and 30 million dollars . We were both highly aware of the dire circumstances in which you 
found yourself last year, and in fact due predominately to its seriousness, and those very circumstances I took 
extra care in our negotiations . (you had claimed I had you over a barrel, ( a horrible position to be in with my 
very close friend.), unfortunately I fear that if you are not cautious ,in the near future, another barrel will appear 
of your own design ) 
I heard you when you said you believed i had already been paid for the work that is now required. The art 
partnership has fully answered all your concerns and discharged all my obligations and more so. . ( 
FYI Carlyns art partnership that you referenced is similar in only its title. ) You will also recall that you 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023300 
required that my payments be at the end of my work not at the beginning as everyone else's .( my work was 
never to include hours upon hours of training your staff). I eventually agreed, this of course should 
make clear that the 2014 tax year that will close Oct 2015 is not covered by our past agreement at all. I 
pointed this very fact out to you when I initially proposed a multi year agreement right out of the box. you said 
you preferred not. As you said ,I have produced results to date, far in excess of even my own exalted opinion 
of my projections. I have devoted a monumental amount of my limited amount of time-- way, way in excess of 
our agreement. I will be fair, I am willing to roll in the amount still outstanding from last year if that helps .. 
However, As my best student , and my only one, you are now capable of doing most, if not all, of the 
required work yourself I can put my whiteboard away when you come to eat and just have fun, trade stories,. 
share moments ideas etc. . I am of course always available to guide you as a friend if you choose that route . 
always. It will take a great deal of your time , but you will not have to spend any more money on mine. 
We are scheduled to meet fri at 430 , I leave at 5 am sat morning.

Transaction complete ! 
. this - in spite of your collection of Elysium misfits. !!! 
With Brad out of the office and unable to run his usual interference , the level of his utter incompetence was 
brought front and center, he may be a step up from Eileen, but if he is, then it is not certainly not by much, . 
Though you and I have spent many many hours discussing the importance of details and mechanics. I was not 
shown one document re phaidon,- not one.. Brad wanted to keep it private between he and his so called 
advisors however as he was out of the office during the most important transaction of the year, I did get 
to spend time with joslin Joe and john, - the situation in your office is wholly ludicrous - to summarize - the 
list I provided to Brad last December - things I thought were a priority to get done after consulting with your 
office still remains virtually undone. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023304 
IT, still desperately needed- reporting flawed cumbersome and inaccurate . all done by hand as one -off 
exercises , - airplane: re structure, (my only suggested priority in june ) is really ,no further ahead, consultants 
up the kazoo but nothing at all done.( the office was told that i cannot even see the proposals received without 
brads specific authorization ) - brad has no idea even as to what questions to ask. he knows little of finance, is 
run roughshod over by almost everyone in the office. he is a little man , using your power, to appear larger. 
Eileen was self aware enough to know she was over her head , that is a huge difference. bad info is 
rampant ie 3 million in deductions Im told are taken for art space but on closer examination it turns out 
they cannot be used at all. ( ZERO benefit ) though you will be told yes they were deducted on the return they 
said that is the question they get asked !  were they deducted  not 2 is there a benefit !! I asked for the 
balance sheet and P and L for Regan arts , a basic first step in order to check your financials. sorry we never 
got one? though 9.8 million invested, no p&l, nothing, a construction project run amok, no budget, the coo 
fired after only 3 months. , no clue . I can add that artspace financials are also a total mess. 
As your friend and in order toturn the page. I will try to be constructive 
The following is a list of things I think would be in your interest to get done asap .but definitely not by me 
i suggest you form new grats. , hire a high level tax partner. use your trading accounts as they remain 
the paramount requirement 16 months after i emailed to you their importance. , I suggest you 
consider having the 49percent of phaidon merged into artspance and have Richard buy artspace. re-do bank 
loans, no need to pay interest at higher rates on boat or plane. . as Richard is now no longer trustee. re- do 
will, make suydam executor , with Barry, and john as back up. pay 1 million a year for executor role. get rid 
of Judy Black trust, deal with gifts and their tax returns, . review amounts to kids at fixed ages. put more 
protections in for Alex and Victoria. , distribute some money to kids let them make decisions. , decide art 
division with children in attendance . have fire drill done on estate. fill out estate returns as if you and Debra 
died today, choose advisers - rick bronstein said the only 1040 he ever filled out was his own. ( this is brads 
chosen advisor??!) Halperin has a conflict that should be addressed., Debra should enter a tenants in common 
agreement with kids. you have airplane consultants tax consultants it consultants. plane operation consultant. 
. boat consultants. architects, lighting , art, legal, . foundation, deal with TRA , BRH , rationalize 
investments, cash flow, reporting, gaming disclosures, foreign, gift. . prepare tax projections for 15 and 16,. 
deal with neg basis ( tufts gain, debt financed, art partnership, pledges. sell stock, art, deal with phaidon 
debt. athene,? income, capital, foreign, exit, corporate, insurance regs, out and inbound 
issues, basis, appropriate discount rates. ? terminations. control. , qualified dividends, corporate 
tolls, inversion rules. , grat issues, short swing and other sec disclosures, Rothshcild bank, 150 b they have a 
distribution network with no products , private bank Rockefeller Rothschild. financial service, deal with UK 
visa issue sooner rather than later. we can talk about Rowen request re Athene , 2 billion in taxes on 
transaction. ?! 
the facts as i see them 
in June and then again Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout., then after weeks of thinking about 
the issue ( which I fully understand ) . the payout was unilaterally changed. 5m woudl be reserved for the 
future ? . and out of the remaining 15m,? i would receive only 5. ( note : I'm confident that both the debt, and 
the artspace investment will also lead to a write off of another 30 m. plus ) In my dining room ,you were 
surprised when I said that i require most people to pay their advisory fee up front so that I am assured that I 
will be properly compensated for my work when strategies that I devise are implemented. you may recall that 
you appeared offended and said  are you suggesting that i would go back on my word I said no , of course 
not ! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is that when amounts get large, people tend to get 
unhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay,. 
From day zero a 50 - 60 million price was attached as the fair price of the transaction just completed . 
though this amount was already substantially less thanour agreed and negotiated formula. - I was 
never told that this was out of range. in fact, alternative methods of payment. plane -in-kind etc, were 
discussed ( ie keeping the 30m portion of fee outstanding till March ) ,I provided as requested a 
detailed step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that i was given access to. ( Phaidon was not 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023305 
forthcoming ) in order to make my many corrections. I was then told that Alans involvement warranted a 
discount. Even in the best of light , though it is beyond question that not one-,not -one time in three 
years has he ever proposed a unique idea. (including the new tenant in common idea,) and lets say he made 
a contribution to the plan andeven that it was 50 %. though no one could posit such a large amount unless they 
were wearing a brightly colored clown suit. , the price of doing the deal was known . It had both sent in 
writing and spoken about on the phone numerous times, a detailed execution plan was provided. then and 
only then after all was laid out for the group I was told that after a number of conversations with brad karp 
that only 20m would be paid, (and even that was more than originally contemplated ) for both transactions . I 
feel It was remarkably unfair. Did brad even know of our prior agreement.? I called him and he said he was 
never told.?, I would ask that you I and Brad karp sit together if you think it would be helpful. . I would like to 
send him this email, with your consent of course. If the transactions were never consummated, i would not be 
owed a dime, however , the price was known up front. , the detailed step by step plan was followed and 
overseen by me, the price that had been requested before the transaction was begun, and had 'ready heavily 
discounted, out of friendship, from our agreement. I believe the decision re paying only 20 m has frankly 
left me felling quite uneasy.

Transaction complete ! 
When we had our meeting in your home in Bedford. You asked me for my help. I told you multiple times 
that i thought it was a very bad idea, in that I preferred to have no financial interactions. I dont have many 
friends and didnt want money to interefer with our unique relationship. For five years you had the kind but 
goofy Eileen Alexandersson managing your accounting, legal, investments, reporting, trusts etc. When I told 
you in no uncertain terms that I firmly believed she was incompetent you admonished me for speaking out of 
both sides of my mouth . With regard Brad Wechsler, there is no  both sides. . I have 
consistantly maintained since day one that he was highly unsuited for the job. When you initially asked me to 
help convince him to take the role , promising him a postion to manage mirage investments I sent you a note 
saying instead you should pay up and get first class people. I have reiterated the same message for over a year 
now.. Brad, not me was tasked with hiring new people and as you wanted him to take ownership of the 
staff,he conducted many interviews, you may recall that as late as may, you told him in my presence that he had 
had six months and had not hired anyone. since then I have rectified errors in sales tax, use tax, income 
tax, fbar reporting, 1031 reporting, 8 million of deductions. ,( last nov ) 11 million found in dormant accounts 
and 4 million in the drawer. errors in cash flow both personal and Phaidon. Oversight on new grats first at 22 
and then at 19 that were done without my consulatation were resolved only as aresult of my intervention. . 600 
million in after tax savings was just accomplished. 
With Brad out of the office and unable to run his usual interference , the level of his total and 
utter incompetence was brought clearly, front and center. He may be a step up from Eileen, but, if he is, 
then it is certainly not by much, A major difference is that Eileen knew she was over her head. Brad struts his 
stupiditly whenever he gets a chance. 
A critical example. - Though you and I have spent many many hours discussing the importance of care 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023307 
and attention to details and mechanics. with regard Phaidon I was not shown one single document, not 
one.!! Brad wanted to keep it private between he, and his so called advisors however as he was out of the 
office during the most important transaction of the year, I did get to spend time with joslin Joe and john, - the 
situation in your office is totally ludicrous - to summarize - the list I provided to Brad last December - 
of things I thought were a priority to get done - still remains in the whole unresolved. 
The IT, is virtually untouched and is still in desperate need of a format - reporting flawed cumbersome and 
inaccurate . all done by hand as one -off exercises , when either you or brad ask for it - airplane: re structure, 
(my only suggested priority in june ) is really ,no further ahead, consultants up the kazoo but nothing at all 
done.( the office was told by Brad not to share the outside proposals with me - brad has no idea even as to 
what questions to ask. he knows little of finance, is bullshitted over by almost everyone in the office. a little 
man , using your power, to appear larger. Eileen was self aware enough to know she was over her head , that is 
a huge difference. bad info is rampant a simple emblematic example- 3 million in deductions Im told 
were taken for art space but on closer examination it turns out they cannot be used at all. ( ZERO benefit 
) though you will be told yes they were deducted on the return they said that is the only real question you were 
focused on !  were they deducted not 2 is there a benefit !! I asked for the balance sheet and P and L 
for Regan arts , a basic first step in order to check your financials. sorry we never got one? though 9.8 
million invested, no p&l, nothing!, a construction project run amok, no budget, the coo fired after only 3 
months., no clue. fyi artspace financials are also a total mess. ( no receivables ??). when i asked for a list of 
what got done and did not, i received the email from Brad basicailly mind you own business, so much was 
promised. !!! 
As in your words probably your closest friend and in order to turn the page. I hope the following to 
be constructive 
Here is a list of things I think would be in your interest to get done asap .but definitely not by me. 
i suggest you form new grats. , hire a high level tax partner. use your trading accounts as they remain 
a paramount requirement 16 months after i emailed you re their importance. THe Phaidon transaction papered 
and structured as contemplated DOES NOT WORK, its as simple as that. DOES NOT !! I suggest again 
that you re-do bank loans, no need to pay interest at higher rates on boat or plane. . as Richard is now no 
longer trustee. re- do will, make suydam executor , with Barry, and john as back up. pay 1 million a year for 
executor role. get rid of Judy Black trust, deal with gifts and their tax returns, . review amounts to kids at fixed 
ages. put more protections in for Alex and Victoria. , distribute some money to kids let them make 
decisions. , decide art division with children in attendance. have fire drill done on estate. fill out 
estate returns as if you and Debra died today, choose advisers - rick bronstein said the only 1040 he ever filled 
out was his own. Halperin has a conflict that should be addressed., A strategy of the use of art should be 
implemented. . you have tax consultants it consultants. plane operation consultant. . boat 
consultants. architects, lighting , art, legal, . foundation, deal with TRA, BRH , rationalize 
investments, cash flow, reporting, gaming disclosures, foreign, gift. . prepare tax projections for 15 and 16,. 
deal with neg basis ( tufts gain, debt financed, art partnership, pledges. sell stock, art, deal with phaidon 
debt. athene,? income, capital, foreign, exit, corporate, insurance regs, out and inbound 
issues, basis, appropriate discount rates. ? terminations. control. , qualified dividends, corporate 
tolls, inversion rules. , grat issues, short swing and other sec disclosures, I still think you might consider a 
Rothshcild bank transaction they have 150 b and a distribution network with no products , private 
bank Rockefeller Rothschild. financial service, deal with UK visa issue sooner rather than later. we can talk 
about Rowen request re Athene , complex 2 billion in taxes on transaction. ?! 
the facts as i see them 
in June and then again Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout., then only after weeks, when you 
delayed any detailed discussion of money wanting to give the issue a thoughtful response ( which I fully 
understand ) . you unilaterally changed changed our agreement. . 5m would be reserved for the future ? . and 
out of the remaining 15m,? i would receive only a third. ( note : I'm confident that both the debt, and the 
artspace investment will also lead to a write off of another 30 m. plus ) In my dining room ,you were 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023308 
surprised when I said that i require most people to pay their advisory fee up front so that I am assured that I 
will be properly compensated for my work when strategies are implemented. you may recall that 
you appeared offended and said  are you suggesting that i would go back on my word I said no , of course 
not ! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is that when amounts get large, people tend to get 
unhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay 
I included in this letter the email i sent to you on April 15, the day i was examining your returns It laid out 
my understanding of the compensation for a transaction of the magnitude to the penny of the one just 
completed. though the number was great it was clear. When it appeared that the details could now be worked 
out I was the first to say, it is too much money, however. 
From day zero I proposed to discount to 50 - 60 million the fair price of the transaction just completed. 
including Phaidon. . though this amount was already substantially less than our agreed and negotiated 
formula. - I was never told that this was out of range. in fact, alternative methods of payment. plane, or 
an -in-kind payment were discussed ( ie including keeping the 30m portion of fee outstanding till March ) ,I 
provided as you specifically requested a detailed step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that 
i was given access to. ( Phaidon was not forthcoming ) in order to make my many corrections. I was then 
told that Alans involvement warranted a discount. Even in the best of light , though it is beyond question 
that not one time in the three years of his retainer has he ever proposed a unique idea. (including any wayt 
to deal with the use issue on debras death ,or even the most basic review of your largest asset by far , the BRH 
agreement. ) O.K. - lets say he made a contribution to the plan and stretch reality beyond the pale and say it 
was 50 %. though no one could posit such a large amount unless they were wearing a brightly colored clown 
suit., the payment associated with the deal was known . It had both sent in writing and spoken about on the 
phone numerous times, a detailed execution plan was provided. then and only then after all was laid out for 
the group I was told that after a number of conversations with brad karp that a total of only 20m would be 
paid, (and even that was more than originally contemplated ) for both transactions . Leon I feel It 
was remarkably unfair. I wondered whether brad even knew of our prior agreement.? I called him and he 
said he was never told.?, I would ask that you I and Brad karp sit together if you think it would be helpful. . I 
would like to send him this email, with your consent of course. If the transactions were never consummated, i 
would not be owed a dime, however , the expected fee was known up front. , the detailed step by step plan 
was followed and overseen by me, the amount that I had requested before the transaction was even begun, 
and had already been heavily discounted, out of friendship, from our agreement . I believe the decision re only 
paying 20 m has frankly, left me felling quite uneasy. 
since you asked since last nov. i found 11 million dollars in dormant accounts. 4 million dollars in eileens 
drawer.. went through cash flows for phaidon showing that john murphy is not an accountant. redid your 
gagosian contract , . organized structure in case of divorce, set up gift trust. stopped ada from including 
multiple times things not in your interest, dealt with bad sales tax use tax income tax . created 8 millino in 
deductions ,500k in mistakes , found bank of scotland fbar problems, . . reorg bad art purchases , funds taken„ 
charitable decisions , helped with fincancial statements, gaming commission. . boat deductions, rescued stock 
from grats.. may 1 after months of brad not finding anyone i sent an email saying you would have to pay 
more. . on april 15. I sent an email detailing payments owed if i could figure out the basis issue, please see 
attached,. 
questions you might ask your team ask them to provide a balance sheet or p&l for REgan arts. . doesn't 
exist 
ask. either wechsler or haperin to tell you what brh is, or how the tra works. . . ? as bronstein to tell you why 
the proposed phaidon transaction DOES not work. . ask them to give you a plan for the plane. ? ask them to 
show you the cash mgmt for over 100 million dollars. . ask them to show you the IT system progress after one 
year. separate from making it more secure though you are not a trader with inside info the approval process for 
payables. . the cash flow projections? assumptions? ask for a comparative review of investments, ask haperin 
to describe to you in any detail BRH, the major asset of his two biggest clients, tax basis, disposition in the 
estate. . etc. ask brad to show you the liquidation of the intervening art space cos? that has been on the table for

PLEASE READ CAREFULLY, 
Mark was here this morning , the proposed transactions are extremely complex . and would take a great deal 
of detailed time. I do not know how, and if ,to move forward - our last transaction. a transaction which you 
saved 600 million in tax. even if as you say it could be 20 years away, ( i hope longer) discounted to today is 
a savings of 300 million . for some reason you chose to ignore our agreements , verbal written and emailed - 
and decided that it was only worth 8 million dollars to you.. ( assuming phaidon -richard happens. the 
calculation that you can see is a 24 m savings not including artspace and debt benefits- certain to come later

you've agreed that 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023312 
Your office is a multi billion dollar responsibility, your children will inherit it, in order to oversee their 
financial lives- I feel for you, truly ,but the facts are the facts, your ceo ( Brad) has provided one bad 
document after another for over a year, no getting away from it,, bad cash flows no new IT, each time 
with its gettting better no in fact -! its not. - the excuse, that Brad is not the numbers guy, is ludicrous. 
of course he didnt actually prepare the statements. - no ceo would ,- but over and over he presented them to 
you and me , after, holding them back for his personal review multiple times and after multiple drafts. weeks 
of his editing, the consistant but inexplicable missing the obvious serious errors . ( gaming ) inaccuracies, 
( cashflow ) and mistakes (tax returns). why, ?! the simple answer is that at best, he is a c minus, (note. I, like 
you ,also give points for effort. )- ! an elegant art partnership gone fallow. ??!!I and its core reason to exist. 
not used ? no docs for plane?, still ! why? no docs for decantings why? the docs for deal 1 received last 
night,  no docs at all for deal 2, the biggest  . why wasn't Tom brought in, after 4 times of my incessant 
reminders i spoke to him , he knows little of either transaction except for over view, never saw pahidon 
anything except projections until yesterday ? ?and this after your clear admonition etc. re the trading 
accounts no activity, at all, 
Barry Cohen is great. more like him please . 
you asked, - I did my best trying to train your brad chosen people in the face of my telling you that they were 
never going to be more than c-minuses, thousands of emails thousands ? Brad at its head . you can't as a 
ceo, have an accountant give you multiple pages with the most important numbers missing altogether and not 
notice, you and I saw the errrors right away ,as did my very junior bookeeper after only a cursory glance. He 
told me he didnt know the details of his note? ! , my guess is that he wanted to pay less. no more than that, any 
other story is blather. its silly. Talk to richard yourself. 
re your estate. Yes another Brad issue - your will, needs revision, the tenants in common structure I assume 
Alan has carefully walked you through. it is way overdue, needed and exciting. I won't list the more serious 
issues in an email but we can speak over the weekend. 
How can I help? We agreed at the time when you hired Castrucci , that when you fired him, I would bear no 
responsibility because it was clear that he shouldnt be hired. brad and you both said , its on us, but... the 
equivalent of your art consultant pointing to a picasso and calling it a renoir. then a brancusi and calling it a 
michaelangelo. those were the types of erros that i saw immediatily, you said give them more time. at least 
they saw it was a painting and not a photo? 
being weaned of our biz /pay realtionship has been our mutual goal. However since novemebr, you chose to 
do so by ignoring' our agreement re, phaidon,and your oft stated commitment to me of large payments for 
large value, ( 37 percent was our number ). chose to pay me a number picked by what appears to be only by 
whim,- have yet to justify it except for telling me that you and Brad Karp talked.. . 
What should we do? the next two years in biz world appears to both you and I , very fragile. Im happy to 
have brad sit in ?

consideration of all the things I did for the entire past year separate and apart from your unique free after

josh's arrival cut short our needed conversation. I understand we have a difference of opinion, friends 
sometimes disagree, I shook on the 20 so you have no further obligation, none, I am willing to have brad 
karp hear both sides. as my view, you and i had an agreement. on phaidon /publishing, and then a long 
standing what you say is 28, which is correct AFTer TAx. , 37 pre. . that was our numbers. I was clear what 
i thought the transactions were worth. far less than full. alan etc. , had you said i will pay you only 20. i 
would have said ill pass. you never told me that 50-60 the number that i put on the table at the very beginning 
was not right, you asked that i lay out my plan step by step. and what i believe would have been the fair thing 
to do is say to me, I will pay you only 20 if you do as i ask, not tell me for the first time only after i laid it 
all out. had it not been you, i would have required payment in escrow. BEFORE fyi the reason I sent you 
an invoice so that if you decided that you wanted me to continue this year . it would be applied to last years

Tenancy in common is a type of shared ownership of property, where each owner owns a share of the 
property. Unlike in a joint tenancy, these shares can be of unequal size, and can be freely transfered to other 
owners both during life and via a will. Even if owners own unequal shares, however, all owners have the right 
to occupy and use all of the property.

were confident that everything had been read, and after years , of you telling me that Im not an attorney, it is

glad to see you are personally on the mend - as well as the fence. -- As you know i dread money 
discussions with you-- however -we should address the issue of what you would like to do moving forward. re-
do family office, accounting trusts , estate and apollo agreements . Along with your  payment  last year 
we agreed. no further obligations on each side. yes, i continued to moan. I realize that though I ve done 
quite a lot this year already , it is not your responsibility. . As you often like to remind me- you've paid a 
great deal of money to date. that being said - If you want my involvement moving foward, I suggest 
you pay my regular 1 fee of 40 m. 20 now. 20 on completion or as per the invoice issues at the end of last 
year pay 30 all at once. - 
To help out . im keenly aware of your current cash position. so I will consider an in-kind payment - real 
estate ( Miami )„art , financing of my new plane (allows you to spread over years or of course the preferred 
cash. Get rid of Castrucci,it is over a year since the same story of findign the right guy at the top. you 
entire accounting needs to be re done. , office downsized, reporting re done. meetings to recitify, categlorize 
, the various docs re appollo, rowen, suydam, alan etc. Brad can direct investment guys, ( hopefully) my 
people will be in your office for a few months . reorganizing IF you decide not to pay I fully understand, as I 
m sure you will re my no longer spending any serious time on these things. 
Of course re any non financial issues, I am always there for you and will continue to be the best friend I can 
be

he do the same thing that he had planned for the day- he wanted to check that he was doing things that he 
really wanted to. after three days of getting back an answer of no, he would change what he was going to do. . 
he also did not believe in LONG term plans. I dont think either one of us will figure out what we want to do 
long term so my thinking is that we should try to have fun everyday, and welcome serendipity. 
I think another trust and estate lawyer should be brought in to deal with the issues of how not to allow your 
family to get screwed by your partners on death. Alan, for years told me that paul weiss had drawn the

To: Melanie Spinella 
Lets start. I am aware that you are currently angry at the world. . me, karp wechsler. even 
yourself, all willing absorbers of the current high heat. (though you ,calling me ,Debra, did take away some 
of the sting ) I am sorry to see you this way. 
emblematic; I was asked to opine on whether to hire castrucci. an hour after I gave a preliminary yes. . I 
called you then texted you that i had thought more about it and changed my mind. The next day brad called 
and asked for my vote. I told him ,in no uncertain terms it is a no , I categorically vote no. I called 
you . you came to see me. I said it was a bad idea. you said you were going to do it anyway , I said and 
followed up in writing IT IS A MISTAKE . and added Please don't come back to me with anything suggesting 
otherwise , you and I should be clear I think it is wrong . A very strong NO. you of course can hire whomever 
you like. 
early on I told you I thought Tom remarkably careless . Eilleen goofy and your art lawyer not well informed to 
say the least. you told me Tom was a senior partner. Eileen had headed the trading desk, and Ralph Lerner had 
to know what he was doing as he wrote the book. . I said I thought you deserved better ,should get better 
people and no , I am not an HR person. yesterday you told me that the reason you have hired whomver you 
could find was to avoid being dependent on me. a decision by far, not the best place to try to save money ) 
Joslin- who you say I hired. I neither found nor hired. With a two person given choice I approved joslin over 
some woman that eileen preferred. against my repeated advice you and eileen decided the pay range at under 
300k. I told you at that time that I would personally pay the difference for a higher quality person, that was 
years ago. I have sent over a hundred emails to you clearly saying he needs to be closely managed by 
better professionals. initially, that referred to Eillen and Ada.and after, brad. john etc. THere are 
many emails each and every month from me, telling you , he is slipping failing cracking fragile. . crazy, nuts, 
heading towards incompetence. Unless YOU- TAKE ACTION! when I pressured him for accurate numbers, 
you told him, to tell me, that he works for you and NOT for me. . When I continued to press for accuracy from 
your office , you told me that they were now all afraid of me and i should let brad communicate any requests, ( 
you now tell me  we know what Brad is?). When I told you you office needs to be reviewed and changed you 
told me i was being destructive rather than constructive, when i ultimately confronted joslin, in an attempt to 
protect you, told him that his numbers were wildly inaccurate , you told me that i had caused his ultimate 
resignation and now have an affirmative obligation to fill in the resultant gap. 
I did give you a bad number, and apologized as soon as i realized it. an error that was an embarrassment for me 
, the fact that that the accurate number is still way below what you agreed to pay, has fallen by the 
wayside.( the preposterous argument that the end of year transaction was Alans idea , which you now know 
was not true and that me not receiving Phaidon documents was unexplainable, was your justification 
though, for non - full payment ) 
Hopefully You will recall that when you initially asked for my help. I declined repeatedly with the 
admonition that that having a financial arrangement is fraught with danger and could complitcate our 
friendship (as you will be unhappy paying what you will view as a large sum. while choosing to ignore 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023316 
the financial benefits, ). In Bedford , I repeated my concern. THe current circumstance is distressing to me , I 
have done my utmost to keep you safe. and will continue to do so. reckless choices in accounting or 
otherwise does not bode well. at each turn I have put your interests first, including in some instances 
attempting to fight your choices. 
your current circumstance needs nuanced attention. as you know, there are a few areas with very serious 
consequences. whether it be , having Ada, form grats without review, brad doing phaidon without review. 
payments make without review.merely in order to be weaned, is one more high risk choice. review of outside 
accounting firms , CANNOT be done by brad. to have your accounting dept sit in on Alans trust accounting 
lecture. in order to learn the filed is reminiscent of elieen reading the tax regs. ( she also was going to take a 
course)

Does that format work (for you and internal use) or do you want it simplified/modified. Let's discuss.

legal and accting, I'd like to tell the staff that we are answering an information request from the irs on the 
grats. It will generally be helpful for them to know why the work is impt.

Subject: tight schedule lets try a set time to speak 
To: Melanie Spinella 
Leon, you hired me to produce a work of art. it was not inexpensive, the value far exceeds any other piece in 
your collection.- by FAR. It took me 30 years to be able to craft such a work. I understand your desire to 
modifiy my work, in doing so you have brad telling me, just a bit more red., here let me show 
you, you yourself pick up a brush a add some strokes. you have joslin spray water on it to maintain it. I 
vigorously complain that joslin in ruining my work. . you describe me as zeus, i describe it as artist and a 
reaction to his work being ruined. however Im aware that you own the work and you have the right to paint 
over it. tear it up , put it in the closet in the basement . its yours. 
I was told that Toms office is sending someone in ,or some people in, to review some things. brad told me 
,the partnership accounting. I know absolutely nothing more than that. though bringing in his team was my idea 
. Having them review things without even asking for my input, or let alone my direction ,is ridiculous. but.. I 
guess you wanted to save money. ? 
The audit has brought to the fore the lack of your office quality that i have been violently squawking about. ie 
. children playing with works of art. . It is inconceivable to me that John castrucci is still there, joslin part 
time, but relied on. joe error prone and brad a corporate bandleader talking about the office's finance team, 
accounting dept, and directing wendy to do things that are clearly not in your interest. ( saving money again 
?) its nuts!! . a still non-existent IT dept. impossible, it was the first thing on my list of things that were 
needed to be done. Still no trading accounts to speak of, though its prophylactic quality has been discussed 
over and over during the past three years. computers do not read Page Six. the women at the IRS do. ! you 
said your motivation in keeping this group of part timers was a consequence of the high cost of my 
artwork. . the unfortunate result was easily predictable. - now 
If you want my and my atelier to continue, I will oversee the audits. take charge of the TRA BRH 
assignments and review 2012 amendment options!!( note :your redo of the estate fire drill has not progressed 
very far ). Lots of paper needs to be collected and reviewed, At MY direction. the outside team will be brought 
in at my expense working for me and you. coming in for interviews and reviews, . sucession, technology, tax 
and compliance, investment reporting „ computerized timelines for filings etc. . household 
classifcations and reporting with a system of best practices. 
My goal is clear - to end, not extend, our financial interactions, you will have a machine that works , it 
will not be complexto oversee , to create it, is some thing else . Unfortunatley for us both, the price for my 
works has not changed since day one. 40m per year, I m willing to discount it to 35 as I did give you a bad 
number when asked and should pay an embarassment fine. Im also aware, as you made perfectly clear. that 
you have already paid what you consider a great deal of money, for my work , but again its value exceeds 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023318 
anything else by far in your collection at a cost less than agreed upon. . please also remember that you and i 
agreed no more demands on my time after the last payment for the big transaction. 
OR, you can decide that brad , tom, and whomever else you choose can screw with my work and they can 
oversee your audits. they are both aware and sensitive to the issue at hand. alan could be brought in but i 
would be extra careful having paul weiss given access to entire story. 
-On an unrelated note- you recently seemed shy to discuss certain things. , please be assured I make no 
judgement on any of your activities , whether or not i agree with them. not my role I am always on your side 
on the table. I hope your personal life quiets. you 've had a rough 15 months.

As i said yesterday, pointing out places where i think my friend might be taking unnecesarry risks has

unilatierally decided to pay me much less than our agreed amount , we agreed NO MORE money 
discussions NO MORE after care. The silliness has reached its pinnacle when you suggest i am responsible for 
the lack of sophisticaiton and thoughtfulness of the 1031 transactions that NO one even told me about. asked 
my advice or gave me any notice at all before the fact. same as the structure for the CAlif house. I would

Leon, Congragulations on biting the bullet. at least 18 months late , but I m encouraged and glad for 
you. When you interviewed Brad two years ago you asked that i not tell him what a disaster lay before 
him. what would you like me to tell Barry? 
There is a HUGE amount of work to be done in the next 9 -12 months. mostly the exact same work that i 
outlined in my email of 2 years ago. now complicated by years of mess on top. ( you can send it again if you 
like ) . Brad wechsler was never up to the task. sorry, I realize I have been saying the very same thing for a 
long time. he was a not a step up from Eileen but a step sideways. in the beginning there was Eileen and 
Tom and Ralph Lerner. all your hand picks. then brad. john, Joe. . joslin was chosen from a pool of 2 
people. each that would be limited by a salary of 250k. ( yes i personally augmented his comp in order to get 
him ) I did say hire both Lisa to do the bookkeeping and joslin tax, He complained for over a year, re his 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023319 
direction by eileen and ada, and then brad. His breakdown was not a surprise after months and moths of 
warnings. Though disabled, he ran your office this year. with john and joe. He ran amok, and as i told 
you he rarely failed to remind me in our conversations that you told him that he works for you and not for 
me and that brad needs to pays him . 
. Asking me who to hire , estate attny tax people etc. : 
I have taken heat for years over the fact that i gave you no more than carlyns name, . no follow up 
questions no interactions , not even one single question asked of me re her work. ( that was Eileen ) but 
somehow carlyns fuck up was my doing. . when i told you that i thought Eileen wasn't up to the task, you 
bellowed that i was talking out of both sides of my mouth. . You told me this year , that by trying to protect 
you from crazy joslin, I had in essence fired him and it was my responsibility to do his work. it then turns out 
that he didn't consider himself fired at all he just received less money. and continued to make a really 
dangerous mess. . Joshn castrucci, in your eyes, was also my doing , though email after email said , I take no 
responsibility for him,and iYOU SHOULD NOT HIRE HIM .!!! „ your response was that was my opinion 
was only because i didn't trust him. then to add insult to injury last jan you told me he was gone. however he 
too is still there, and a waste of money and space. 
My time is complicated by Donald's potentially eviscerating any reason for anyone to use the foreign 
funds repatriation plan that i had put together. . however as you are aware I have some decisions to make re 
my time allocation in the next year or two. so at least for a few weeks I am unable to commit much time and 
make any future plans to guide you in the redoing of your procrastination produced mess. 
That being said, the tasks at hand are the following. 
You have a bomb of colored string that your retarded children have formed , It has to be very carefully 
unwound , even the substitution of Barry for your next trustee, needs a careful focus on procedure.s It would 
be much preferable if Wechsler was not his replacement. do you have any person you trust ??! . I am 
concerned re brad taking barrys place re )(XXX. In the beginning Barry will need to find and learn 
ACCURATE . org charts. books , balance sheets. trust valuations, are all a part. Barry will need 2 months 
to just get his arm around what is there, this is before any needed modifications., 
a way overdue re- fresh of your estate plan. . clats , trust. partnerships. grats. Ilcs. bank accounts, filing 
requirements. etc. the long awaited review of the brh tra and shareholders agreement to see how they fit into 
new plan. .  planning. art partnership engagement.. , airplane re-do. , buying another. . ? boat 
sale , Miami sale. . TRADING ACCOUNTS. . three years over due. . an accounting system. fire john 
.. joslin stays for a year. or so. so does tom and. except for heather everyone should be replaced with 
new. . Sell Artspace and shut down regan arts. . rationalize, cash flow reporting. cash mgmt. stock 
sales. sec irs. gaming. foreign reporting. the 8865 mess will take months to review now. . you 
CANNOT file unreviewed audited documents. . CANNOT!!! this will be very detailed work. . a self 
inflicted wound - all avoidable if professionals had been in place to limit. or contain it. . . you will need 
3 new hires .a s there is no one in your office that is truly an A player. I have great hope in Barry as you 
know. He will need to be trained. note 
; One year is my guesstimate After 4 years of telling you , that you could do better than Halperin,: im glad 
that you now are willing to follow barrys advice . I take no offense, in fact I take comfort in the fact that after 
only one conversation with Barry you are now convinced to make that change . will take a year or more. 
I expect as a friend you will understand that 
I will no longer, not even for one day , work on your affairs . without the compensation that is long 
overdue. . your unilateral idea of after care , not imposed on any other professional , except me, not paul 
weiss ,( caesars alone , a direct screw up on their part ) tom, akin„ no one. needs to end. . you and I had 
previously agreed no more of that, and this after you decided not to pay me per our agreement. to be fair I can 
not say im surprised as you have email after email , stating that , if you save a great deal of money, you 
wont want to pay, so limit it to 40m per year. - water under the bridge 
If I can find the time to work, on your project , which is not by any means certain as I have said, I hope 
you understand that it now will have to be under my standard terms and conditions. and well documented so as 
to avoid any more of the he said she said. I never want to have any more uncomfortable money moments with 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023320 
you , I find it very distasteful. . so to be clear , my terms are as follows. I will only work for the usual 40 
million per year. It needs to be paid, 25 million upon signing an agreement. 5 million every 2 months 
thereafter for 6 months ie march may june . this can begin if i am able in January. I will immediately stop 
work, if the payment is not received. If you want me to work this year until Jan 15 , it will be 10 
million, paid upfront. after one year you will be left with a new estate plan a running office. staffed with 
professionals overseen by Barry. ( hallelujah ) a tax plan . and an investment that returns more than any 
painting you could possible own. . no agreement - no work. however - I of course will talk to Barry for the 
hour that i promised , and take your guidance as to what I should say.

. If you are quarterbacking ,ok with me. just please let everyone know. you must deal with the outrageous 
incompetence in your family office.. Alans words  but I was told that.. , but I was told by the office (sic) 
that ... , BUT i was told by joslin,. , but I was told by.  why is leon blaming me for .. . I ve have always 
given you my best advice, If you reflect on your financial life, you have been kept safe , had remarkable 
results and no disasters. I have repeatedly urged you to get rid of the people in your office. , you 
have repeatedly chosen to ignore my advice , you told me last week that the emotional reason was in order 
to be weaned off my group and not have to pay my high fees. ( though ignoring the benefit of between 1.5 
and 2b to the better. ) . and no explosions. You have email after email ,where i remind you that I am not 
your bookkeeper or accountant ( in brads corporate speak his finance dept ??!!) that it should be redone .I 
have reviewed a multitude of the silly reports given to you and have pointed out the continued numerous 
inaccuracies . your question so what if the numbers are off, so what if the categories are off whats the big 
deal??. I suggest you de risk you finances and make the tough decisions necessary - pay the right amounts ( 
high) to get the work done properly or , you are, Im afraid, certain to get an unhappy answer.. tom will be

him. what would you like me to tell Barry? 
There is a HUGE amount of work to be done in the next 9 -12 months. mostly the exact same work that i 
outlined in my email of 2 years ago. now complicated by years of mess on top. ( you can send it again if you 
like ) . Brad wechsler was never up to the task. sorry, I realize I have been saying the very same thing for a 
long time. he was a not a step up from Eileen but a step sideways. in the beginning there was Eileen and 
Tom and Ralph Lerner. all your hand picks. then brad. john, Joe. . joslin was chosen from a pool of 2 
people. each that would be limited by a salary of 250k. ( yes i personally augmented his comp in order to get 
him ) I did say hire both Lisa to do the bookkeeping and joslin tax, He complained for over a year, re his 
direction by eileen and ada, and then brad. His breakdown was not a surprise after months and moths of 
warnings. Though disabled, he ran your office this year. with john and joe. He ran amok, and as i told 
you he rarely failed to remind me in our conversations that you told him that he works for you and not for 
me and that brad needs to pays him . 
. Asking me who to hire , estate attny tax people etc. : 
I have taken heat for years over the fact that i gave you no more than carlyns name, . no follow up 
questions no interactions , not even one single question asked of me re her work. ( that was Eileen ) but 
somehow carlyns fuck up was my doing. . when i told you that i thought Eileen wasn't up to the task, you 
bellowed that i was talking out of both sides of my mouth. . You told me this year , that by trying to protect 
you from crazy joslin, I had in essence fired him and it was my responsibility to do his work. it then turns out 
that he didn't consider himself fired at all he just received less money. and continued to make a really 
dangerous mess. . Joshn castrucci, in your eyes, was also my doing , though email after email said, I take no 
responsibility for him,and iYOU SHOULD NOT HIRE HIM .!!! „ your response was that was my opinion 
was only because i didn't trust him. then to add insult to injury last jan you told me he was gone. however he 
too is still there, and a waste of money and space. 
My time is complicated by Donald's potentially eviscerating any reason for anyone to use the foreign 
funds repatriation plan that i had put together. . however as you are aware I have some decisions to make re 
my time allocation in the next year or two. so at least for a few weeks I am unable to commit much time and 
make any future plans to guide you in the redoing of your procrastination produced mess.

that you now are willing to follow barrys advice . I take no offense, in fact I take comfort in the fact that after 
only one conversation with Barry you are now convinced to make that change . will take a year or more.

sent to you JAN 29th 2016 
you've agreed that 
Your office is a multi billion dollar responsibility, your children will inherit it, in order to oversee their 
financial lives- I feel for you, truly ,but the facts are the facts, your ceo ( Brad) has provided one bad 
document after another for over a year, no getting away from it,, bad cash flows no new IT, each time 
with its gettting better no in fact -! its not. - the excuse, that Brad is not the numbers guy, is ludicrous. 
of course he didnt actually prepare the statements. - no ceo would ,- but over and over he presented them to 
you and me , after, holding them back for his personal review multiple times and after multiple drafts. weeks 
of his editing, the consistant but inexplicable missing the obvious serious errors . ( gaming ) inaccuracies, 
( cashflow ) and mistakes (tax returns). why, ?! the simple answer is that at best, he is a c minus, (note. I, like 
you ,also give points for effort. )- ! an elegant art partnership gone fallow. ??! !I and its core reason to exist. 
not used ? no docs for plane?, still ! why? no docs for decantings why? the docs for deal 1 received last 
night,  no docs at all for deal 2, the biggest  . why wasn't Tom brought in, after 4 times of my incessant 
reminders your admonition etc. the trading accounts ? 
Barry Cohen is great. more like him please . 
you asked, - I did my best trying to train your brad chosen people in the face of my telling you that they were 
never going to be more than c-minuses, thousands of emails thousands ? Brad at its head . you can't as a 
ceo, have an accountant give you multiple pages with the most important numbers missing altogether and not 
notice, you and I saw the errrors right away ,as did my very junior bookeeper after only a cursory glance. He 
told me he didnt know the details of his note? ! , my guess is that he wanted to pay less. no more than that, any 
other story is blather. its silly. Talk to richard yourself. 
re your estate. Yes another Brad issue - your will, needs revision, the tenants in common structure I assume 
Alan has carefully walked you through. it is way overdue, needed and exciting. I won't list the more serious 
issues in an email but we can speak over the weekend. 
How can I help? We agreed at the time when you hired Castrucci , that when you fired him, I would bear no 
responsibility

Subject: tight schedule lets try a set time to speak 
To: Melanie Spinella______________________________ 
Leon, you hired me to produce a work of art. it was not inexpensive, the value far exceeds any other piece in 
your collection.- by FAR. It took me 30 years to be able to craft such a work. I understand your desire to 
modifiy my work, in doing so you have brad telling me, just a bit more red., here let me show 
you, you yourself pick up a brush a add some strokes. you have joslin spray water on it to maintain it. I 
vigorously complain that joslin in ruining my work. . you describe me as zeus, i describe it as artist and a 
reaction to his work being ruined. however Im aware that you own the work and you have the right to paint 
over it. tear it up , put it in the closet in the basement . its yours. 
I was told that Toms office is sending someone in ,or some people in, to review some things. brad told me 
,the partnership accounting. I know absolutely nothing more than that. though bringing in his team was my idea 
. Having them review things without even asking for my input, or let alone my direction ,is ridiculous. but.. I 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023325 
guess you wanted to save money. ? 
The audit has brought to the fore the lack of your office quality that i have been violently squawking about. ie 
. children playing with works of art. . It is inconceivable to me that John castrucci is still there, joslin part 
time, but relied on. joe error prone and brad a corporate bandleader talking about the office's finance team, 
accounting dept, and directing wendy to do things that are clearly not in your interest. ( saving money again 
?) its nuts!! . a still non-existent IT dept. impossible, it was the first thing on my list of things that were 
needed to be done. Still no trading accounts to speak of, though its prophylactic quality has been discussed 
over and over during the past three years. computers do not read Page Six. the women at the IRS do. ! you 
said your motivation in keeping this group of part timers was a consequence of the high cost of my 
artwork. . the unfortunate result was easily predictable. - now 
If you want my and my atelier to continue, I will oversee the audits. take charge of the TRA BRH 
assignments and review 2012 amendment options!!( note :your redo of the estate fire drill has not progressed 
very far ). Lots of paper needs to be collected and reviewed, At MY direction. the outside team will be brought 
in at my expense working for me and you. coming in for interviews and reviews, . sucession, technology, tax 
and compliance, investment reporting „ computerized timelines for filings etc. . household 
classifcations and reporting with a system of best practices. 
My goal is clear - to end, not extend, our financial interactions, you will have a machine that works , it 
will not be complexto oversee , to create it, is some thing else . Unfortunatley for us both, the price for my 
works has not changed since day one. 40m per year, I m willing to discount it to 35 as I did give you a bad 
number when asked and should pay an embarassment fine. Im also aware, as you made perfectly clear. that 
you have already paid what you consider a great deal of money, for my work , but again its value exceeds 
anything else by far in your collection at a cost less than agreed upon. . please also remember that you and i 
agreed no more demands on my time after the last payment for the big transaction. 
OR, you can decide that brad , tom, and whomever else you choose can screw with my work and they can 
oversee your audits . they are both aware and sensitive to the issue at hand. alan could be brought in but i 
would be extra careful having paul weiss given access to entire story. 
-On an unrelated note- you recently seemed shy to discuss certain things. , please be assured I make no 
judgement on any of your activities , whether or not i agree with them. not my role I am always on your side 
on the table. I hope your personal life quiets. you 've had a rough 15 months.

IT, still desperately needed- reporting flawed cumbersome and inaccurate . all done by hand as one -off 
exercises , - airplane: re structure, (my only suggested priority in june ) is really ,no further ahead, consultants 
up the kazoo but nothing at all done.( the office was told that i cannot even see the proposals received without 
brads specific authorization ) - brad has no idea even as to what questions to ask. he knows little of finance, is 
run roughshod over by almost everyone in the office. he is a little man , using your power, to appear larger. 
Eileen was self aware enough to know she was over her head , that is a huge difference. bad info is 
rampant ie 3 million in deductions Im told are taken for art space but on closer examination it turns out 
they cannot be used at all. ( ZERO benefit ) though you will be told yes they were deducted on the return they 
said that is the question they get asked !  were they deducted  not 2 is there a benefit !! I asked for the 
balance sheet and P and L for Regan arts , a basic first step in order to check your financials. sorry we never 
got one? though 9.8 million invested, no p&l, nothing, a construction project run amok, no budget, the coo 
fired after only 3 months. , no clue . I can add that artspace financials are also a total mess. 
As your friend and in order toturn the page. I will try to be constructive 
The following is a list of things I think would be in your interest to get done asap .but definitely not by me. 
i suggest you form new grats. , hire a high level tax partner. use your trading accounts as they remain 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023326 
the paramount requirement 16 months after i emailed to you their importance. , I suggest you 
consider having the 49percent of phaidon merged into artspance and have Richard buy artspace. re-do bank 
loans, no need to pay interest at higher rates on boat or plane. . as Richard is now no longer trustee. re- do 
will, make suydam executor , with Barry, and john as back up. pay 1 million a year for executor role. get rid 
of Judy Black trust, deal with gifts and their tax returns, . review amounts to kids at fixed ages. put more 
protections in for Alex and Victoria. , distribute some money to kids let them make decisions. , decide art 
division with children in attendance. have fire drill done on estate. fill out estate returns as if you and Debra 
died today, choose advisers - rick bronstein said the only 1040 he ever filled out was his own. ( this is brads 
chosen advisor??!) Halperin has a conflict that should be addressed., Debra should enter a tenants in common 
agreement with kids. you have airplane consultants tax consultants it consultants. plane operation consultant. 
. boat consultants. architects, lighting , art, legal, . foundation, deal with TRA , BRH , rationalize 
investments, cash flow, reporting, gaming disclosures, foreign, gift. . prepare tax projections for 15 and 16,. 
deal with neg basis ( tufts gain, debt financed, art partnership, pledges. sell stock, art, deal with phaidon 
debt. athene,? income, capital, foreign, exit, corporate, insurance regs, out and inbound 
issues, basis, appropriate discount rates. ? terminations. control. , qualified dividends, corporate 
tolls, inversion rules. , grat issues, short swing and other sec disclosures, Rothshcild bank, 150 b they have a 
distribution network with no products , private bank Rockefeller Rothschild. financial service, deal with UK 
visa issue sooner rather than later. we can talk about Rowen request re Athene , 2 billion in taxes on 
transaction. ?! 
the facts as i see them 
in June and then again Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout., then after weeks of thinking about 
the issue ( which I fully understand ) . the payout was unilaterally changed. 5m woudl be reserved for the 
future ? . and out of the remaining 15m,? i would receive only 5. ( note : I'm confident that both the debt, and 
the artspace investment will also lead to a write off of another 30 m. plus ) In my dining room ,you were 
surprised when I said that i require most people to pay their advisory fee up front so that I am assured that I 
will be properly compensated for my work when strategies that I devise are implemented. you may recall that 
you appeared offended and said  are you suggesting that i would go back on my word I said no , of course 
not ! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is that when amounts get large, people tend to get 
unhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay,. 
From day zero a 50 - 60 million price was attached as the fair price of the transaction just completed . 
though this amount was already substantially less thanour agreed and negotiated formula. - I was 
never told that this was out of range. in fact, alternative methods of payment. plane -in-kind etc, were 
discussed ( ie keeping the 30m portion of fee outstanding till March ) ,I provided as requested a 
detailed step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that i was given access to. ( Phaidon was not 
forthcoming ) in order to make my many corrections. I was then told that Alans involvement warranted a 
discount. Even in the best of light , though it is beyond question that not one-,not -one time in three 
years has he ever proposed a unique idea. (including the new tenant in common idea,) and lets say he made 
a contribution to the plan andeven that it was 50 %. though no one could posit such a large amount unless they 
were wearing a brightly colored clown suit. , the price of doing the deal was known . It had both sent in 
writing and spoken about on the phone numerous times, a detailed execution plan was provided. then and 
only then after all was laid out for the group I was told that after a number of conversations with brad karp 
that only 20m would be paid, (and even that was more than originally contemplated ) for both transactions . I 
feel It was remarkably unfair. Did brad even know of our prior agreement.? I called him and he said he was 
never told.?, I would ask that you I and Brad karp sit together if you think it would be helpful. . I would like to 
send him this email, with your consent of course. If the transactions were never consummated, i would not be 
owed a dime, however , the price was known up front. , the detailed step by step plan was followed and 
overseen by me, the price that had been requested before the transaction was begun, and had 'ready heavily 
discounted, out of friendship, from our agreement. I believe the decision re paying only 20 m has frankly 
left me felling quite uneasy. 
since you asked since last nov. i found 11 million dollars in dormant accounts. 4 million dollars in eileens

ignored. and im not sure how to respond.

brad, leon. 
After I spoke to you both, I excused myself from a dinner with some heads of state to walk into the bathroom 
to make some calls re 8865. I wondered whether any group that we could assert had control had filed in the 
past years. I called Fenn and he told me- yes.???!! he said that on friday, for the first time he learned that 
AGM was not delinquent at all. and had filed.!! I asked why no one had ever told me or given me the 
purported justification for no filings in the past for the founders. and he said Well, sorry, it was discussed 
on fridays call. ? the call i was not on . not invited to ,the call wechsler didnt listen in and joslin didnt 
transmit , if it is true. Im also now told there is a note from Deloitte re 13 and 14 that says the founders DO 
NOT have to file. but fenn could not tell me who wrote it and said Deloitte says to ignore it. , that s why they 
are pushing now. 
Melanie Spinella 
steps 1 8865 has many exemptions for filing, let see if we can find one . ( an elegant position might be josh 
and agm if he is panicked and leave us out ). The requirments are FACT specific , so without the facts we still 
have nothing. fenn said he has now put someone on it 
2 leon, I suggest need to focus on 1040 , 2015. , we may even consider filing the minimum 8865 , 
and wait until we are sure of our specific requirements, and file an amendment for 15 as well as past. no harm 
no foul\

To: Melanie Spindle___________________________ 
Leon, Congragulations on biting the bullet. at least 18 months late , but I m encouraged and glad for 
you. When you interviewed Brad two years ago you asked that i not tell him what a disaster lay before 
him. what would you like me to tell Barry? 
There is a HUGE amount of work to be done in the next 9 -12 months. mostly the exact same work that i 
outlined in my email of 2 years ago. now complicated by years of mess on top. ( you can send it again if you 
like ) . Brad wechsler was never up to the task. sorry, I realize I have been saying the very same thing for a 
long time. he was a not a step up from Eileen but a step sideways. in the beginning there was Eileen and 
Tom and Ralph Lerner. all your hand picks. then brad. john, Joe. . joslin was chosen from a pool of 2 
people. each that would be limited by a salary of 250k. ( yes i personally augmented his comp in order to get 
him ) I did say hire both Lisa to do the bookkeeping and joslin tax, He complained for over a year, re his 
direction by eileen and ada, and then brad. His breakdown was not a surprise after months and moths of 
warnings. Though disabled, he ran your office this year. with john and joe. He ran amok, and as i told 
you he rarely failed to remind me in our conversations that you told him that he works for you and not for 
me and that brad needs to pays him . 
. Asking me who to hire , estate attny tax people etc. : 
I have taken heat for years over the fact that i gave you no more than carlyns name, . no follow up 
questions no interactions , not even one single question asked of me re her work. ( that was Eileen ) but 
somehow carlyns fuck up was my doing. . when i told you that i thought Eileen wasn't up to the task, you 
bellowed that i was talking out of both sides of my mouth. . You told me this year , that by trying to protect 
you from crazy joslin, I had in essence fired him and it was my responsibility to do his work. it then turns out 
that he didn't consider himself fired at all he just received less money. and continued to make a really 
dangerous mess. . Joshn castrucci, in your eyes, was also my doing , though email after email said, I take no 
responsibility for him,and iYOU SHOULD NOT HIRE HIM .!!! „ your response was that was my opinion 
was only because i didn't trust him. then to add insult to injury last jan you told me he was gone. however he 
too is still there, and a waste of money and space. 
My time is complicated by Donald's potentially eviscerating any reason for anyone to use the foreign 
funds repatriation plan that i had put together. . however as you are aware I have some decisions to make re 
my time allocation in the next year or two. so at least for a few weeks I am unable to commit much time and 
make any future plans to guide you in the redoing of your procrastination produced mess. 
That being said, the tasks at hand are the following. 
You have a bomb of colored string that your retarded children have formed , It has to be very carefully 
unwound , even the substitution of Barry for your next trustee, needs a careful focus on procedure.s It would 
be much preferable if Wechsler was not his replacement. do you have any person you trust ??! . I am 
concerned re brad taking barrys place re )(XXX. In the beginning Barry will need to find and learn 
ACCURATE . org charts. books , balance sheets. trust valuations, are all a part. Barry will need 2 months 
to just get his arm around what is there, this is before any needed modifications., 
a way overdue re- fresh of your estate plan. . clats , trust. partnerships. grats. Ilcs. bank accounts, filing 
requirements. etc. the long awaited review of the brh tra and shareholders agreement to see how they fit into 
new plan. .  planning. art partnership engagement.. , airplane re-do. , buying another. . ? boat 
sale , Miami sale. . TRADING ACCOUNTS. . three years over due. . an accounting system. fire john 
.. joslin stays for a year. or so. so does tom and. except for heather everyone should be replaced with 
new. . Sell Artspace and shut down regan arts. . rationalize, cash flow reporting. cash mgmt. stock 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023330 
sales. sec irs. gaming. foreign reporting. the 8865 mess will take months to review now. . you 
CANNOT file unreviewed audited documents. . CANNOT!!! this will be very detailed work. . a self 
inflicted wound - all avoidable if professionals had been in place to limit. or contain it. . . you will need 
3 new hires .a s there is no one in your office that is truly an A player. I have great hope in Barry as you 
know. He will need to be trained. note 
; One year is my guesstimate After 4 years of telling you , that you could do better than Halperin,: im glad 
that you now are willing to follow barrys advice . I take no offense, in fact I take comfort in the fact that after 
only one conversation with Barry you are now convinced to make that change . will take a year or more. 
I expect as a friend you will understand that 
I will no longer, not even for one day , work on your affairs . without the compensation that is long 
overdue. . your unilateral idea of after care , not imposed on any other professional , except me, not paul 
weiss ,( caesars alone , a direct screw up on their part ) tom, akin„ no one. needs to end. . you and I had 
previously agreed no more of that, and this after you decided not to pay me per our agreement. to be fair I can 
not say im surprised as you have email after email , stating that , if you save a great deal of money, you 
wont want to pay, so limit it to 40m per year. - water under the bridge 
If I can find the time to work, on your project , which is not by any means certain as I have said, I hope 
you understand that it now will have to be under my standard terms and conditions. and well documented so as 
to avoid any more of the he said she said. I never want to have any more uncomfortable money moments with 
you , I find it very distasteful. . so to be clear , my terms are as follows . I will only work for the usual 40 
million per year. It needs to be paid, 25 million upon signing an agreement. 5 million every 2 months 
thereafter for 6 months ie march may june . this can begin if i am able in January. I will immediately stop 
work, if the payment is not received. If you want me to work this year until Jan 15 , it will be 10 
million, paid upfront. after one year you will be left with a new estate plan a running office. staffed with 
professionals overseen by Barry. ( hallelujah ) a tax plan . and an investment that returns more than any 
painting you could possible own. . no agreement - no work. however - I of course will talk to Barry for the 
hour that i promised , and take your guidance as to what I should say.

To: Melanie Spinella_________________________________ 
I have told the brads and barry,- I am done. its not a negotiation, out!! - fyi given my carlyn joslin 
castrucci, admonishments,- though my involvement in those - in one instance only gave a name - in 
another only given an eileen dictated choice btween two 250k preparers. and for castrucci, I actually sent 
emails that i take no responsiblity for his being hired. - however you felt strongly that I should be saddled 
with their outcomes .even with brad wechsler, i again said two months in, Leon, he doesnt get it. I tell you 
this so that you will understand that I will not interview, recommend or vet any new hire. 
A story - In 1993 trump and I had a friend that kept telling his pilots how to fly, and when to fly, he couldnt 
help himself from hiring morons as co pilots, and maintenance people based on cheapest rates. Donald and I 
tried and tried to talk some sense into him, to no avail. Donald and I were in aspen, sitting at little 
nells. when the friends plane crashed into the side of aspen mountain , klliing him and all on board,- Trump 
looked at me and said without a blink , I guess NOW he wishes he would have listened to us.- a metaphor for 
your office. . . had we not waited to the very last hour having had a six month window and tens of 
unasnwered text and emails re decisions needed including the 1031. you would have saved way more than 
you often feel obliged to argue about. . silly but i reallize you are stressed. 
Barry will need to sit with brad for months, to absorb all the co's , structures. cash flow, financial statments 
etc. I will present barry my thoughts on the overall redo , it will be the exact same email that i presented to 
you and brad two years.ago . accurate numbers first. and foremost. . ( last week gaming report stil 
funky). IT etc I pointed out some of the more glaring errors to barry to give him a flavor of what is to come. 
Tuesday if you like we should discuss Giacometti , and pesner . difficult to finesse him if they are 
filing documents that you won't. these ridiculous conversations with tons of people on the phone , removes 
any claim you might have to not be considered a WILLFUL NON-FILER. ( after youve been told by attnys

To: Melanie Spinella - 
Leon, 
Yesterday, I again spent hours upon hours of my time with your office. ,( speak to brad to get flavor) and 
you and i will discuss the results in gory gruesome detail on Friday. it mirrored many other weeks spent doing 
the things that I don;t have the time to do. 
In order to keep things in perspective, maybe reviewing an analogy I have used before with you, might be 
helpful. You and your family are a 6 billion dollar corp. with an income between 250 -500 million dollars per 
year. It contains a few operating biz's , a large wide array of existing investments, in various categories, 
a desire to enter into others. A panoply of loans, notes. purchases, wide range of all types of taxes. , planes. 
boats homes. . trusts ,grats. a crazy number of bank accts. ( with no oversight ) . law firms, acct firms, 800 
page tax returns, foreign firms. art consultants. construction consultants bill payers, 
home mgmt.,vast multitude ofllc's , including foreign, and with all that you only have a combined overhead 
of less that 3 million dollars. 
I have previously sent you the very same note that i have enclosed again below ,this time with highlights 
. I wrote it to you over a year ago. As my acute disability ( selective memory) seems to have been raised 
as one of your concerns , as a rule I try to memorialize things in writing in an attempt to lay out issues that I 
fear may later turn out to be a problem. ie what i would and wouldn't do , - my responsibilities. etc and those 
things that are not. below you will find details of things that I thought needed to be done, so that you 
wouldn't find yourself in the very place where you currently find yourself however ,you chose to defer 
many of my suggestions- see below -,until only weeks ago. ! you chose to defer the jpm acct. the art 
partnership on and on - into this year. and though the 60- 50 40 timber emails all carried with it a clear warning 
that you needed to do something re personnel if it were to stabilize,- you chose to wait. 
ONE YEAR AGO 
Feb 17 2014 i wrote : 
With regard the more pressing issue I am uncertain of just how to proceed. I am torn, as my very strong 
inclination is not to be involved at all. It is extremely time consuming, delicate, fraught with many pitfall many 
that will make you very upset and a major pain in the ass. I wrote you months ago that the quality of the people 
involved need to be upgraded. ( lucky for me these last issues arose way before the beginning of my 
involvement ) I am also aware however of my overarching friendship obligations of ok, -given all the 
complexities who else can do it? problem. 
Your family office needs a daddy. children with good intentions are running around, sniping , nitpicking with 
little direction. As a stopgap measure I am suggesting , we put in Larry Delson to take charge Everyone would 
report to him. Eileen included. He would however work for me. this is not, by a long shot my first choice as I 
prefer only being responsible and standing behind my own personal work ( ie the word DONE will no longer 
be transmitted to reflect status stated by others ) 
With no commitment on my part whatsoever, to do it. So far as I have failed in my attempt in trying to 
think through the problem creatively. My organizations handling of the more complex issues I believe you 
might find very costly, very ! ( however many structures available some risk sharing, maybe risk caps ,etc ) but 
would require my teams doing the work , not yours. Ada should be only a trust, grat administrator, not sure 
what role you prefer for Eileen as you hired her initially to oversee investments. whether Rich your controller 
stays or not, is not urgent. having Tom report to a new person,- is. coordination with Suydam Kathy 
Gregory, I would suggest limiting to one person. The increasing public profile needs to be taken into 
consideration. 
TODAY 
With your acquiesence , Eileen did not report to Delson ( he acting as a conduit directly to me) , she 
continued to provide bad info to both you ( cash flows , stock accts, structures. sales Etc) and me. and each 
time with my many annoying calls to you made immediately afterwards that she was g.....y!! No one was 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023332 
hired to run YOUR office until two months ago , no one was even interviewed and even now , Brad, a very 
nice man, is not even full time,(crazy ) Hours upon hours of time need to be spent training him. and his new 
staff. Eileen followed your instructions, not mine, in fact she continued to ignore mine saying  but Leon 
said  or its on Leon's desk etc , You would become frustrated when i pointed out each instance, of her 
obfuscation. originally you were given the clear choice, but to save money ,you chose not to hire my team. I 
was hired to do the architecture, you kept your own team. with Eileen at the head. instructions were given by 
me„ detailed but ignored by her. ( except in the instances where I inserted myself and personally had to do the 
weeks of grunt work ),ex. jpm morgan acct still not in use? That being said, If you do the cold calculation 
,starting from where you were, to where you are currently . you have made a hell of a deal. -- negotiating 
down my original amount requested, calling upon our friendship and suggesting that the Carlyn mess was 
partially my fault. ( though in that specific example, I had never been asked to do more than merely provide 
you the name of the most highly recognized atty in the field, not consulted,nor even asked again for my 
guidance along the way. ). I accepted the discount as your friend. ( by the way „suggesting now, that your 
Tom is now that last word on tax characterization, frankly is a bit much,-). however - that is all in the past. 
In order to move forward 
I would ask that you realize that very unlike yours, My business is only comprised of my personal attention 
and my personal time . Time that I was forced to grossly overspend on your various issues last year. . As you 
are my very close friend I will not have you participate in a bidding process that I have decided i will 
have this year for my time. (hopefully a more fair way to allocate ) I would also ask that you keep in mind 
that though our deal expired months ago. (also keeping in mind , that your understanding of the final 
payment terms neither reflected the emails or my memory, we finished it up your way. ) I have answered every 
call Brad , joslin, Ada or you, have made . reviewed docs over and over/ until once again, I was 
forced to insert myself strongly as I thought it dangerous not to. I made serious dollar and time concessions 
last year.very serious I am wiling to continue to accommodate some of your concerns , but I am, under no 
circumstances , none, willing to spend my time for free. its not fair. After cleaning up Carlyn's mess , which 
was a few weeks and 30 million dollars . We were both highly aware of the dire circumstances in which you 
found yourself last year, and in fact due predominately to its seriousness, and those very circumstances I took 
extra care in our negotiations . (you had claimed I had you over a barrel, ( a horrible position to be in with my 
very close friend.), unfortunately I fear that if you are not cautious ,in the near future, another barrel will appear 
of your own design ) 
I heard you when you said you believed i had already been paid for the work that is now required. The art 
partnership has fully answered all your concerns and discharged all my obligations and more so. . ( 
FYI Carlyns art partnership that you referenced is similar in only its title. ) You will also recall that you 
required that my payments be at the end of my work not at the beginning as everyone else's .( my work was 
never to include hours upon hours of training your staff). I eventually agreed, this of course should 
make clear that the 2014 tax year that will close Oct 2015 is not covered by our past agreement at all. I 
pointed this very fact out to you when I initially proposed a multi year agreement right out of the box. you said 
you preferred not. As you said ,I have produced results to date, far in excess of even my own exalted opinion 
of my projections. I have devoted a monumental amount of my limited amount of time-- way, way in excess of 
our agreement. I will be fair, I am willing to roll in the amount still outstanding from last year if that helps .. 
However, As my best student , and my only one, you are now capable of doing most, if not all, of the 
required work yourself I can put my whiteboard away when you come to eat and just have fun, trade stories,. 
share moments ideas etc. . I am of course always available to guide you as a friend if you choose that route. 
always. It will take a great deal of your time , but you will not have to spend any more money on mine. 
We are scheduled to meet fri at 430 , I leave at 5 am sat morning.

Transaction complete ! 
. this - in spite of your collection of Elysium misfits. !!! 
With Brad out of the office and unable to run his usual interference , the level of his utter incompetence was 
brought front and center, he may be a step up from Eileen, but if he is, then it is not certainly not by much, . 
Though you and I have spent many many hours discussing the importance of details and mechanics. I was not 
shown one document re phaidon,- not one.. Brad wanted to keep it private between he and his so called 
advisors however as he was out of the office during the most important transaction of the year, I did get 
to spend time with joslin Joe and john, - the situation in your office is wholly ludicrous - to summarize - the 
list I provided to Brad last December - things I thought were a priority to get done after consulting with your 
office still remains virtually undone. 
IT, still desperately needed- reporting flawed cumbersome and inaccurate . all done by hand as one -off 
exercises , - airplane: re structure, (my only suggested priority in june ) is really ,no further ahead, consultants 
up the kazoo but nothing at all done.( the office was told that i cannot even see the proposals received without 
brads specific authorization ) - brad has no idea even as to what questions to ask. he knows little of finance, is 
run roughshod over by almost everyone in the office. he is a little man , using your power, to appear larger. 
Eileen was self aware enough to know she was over her head , that is a huge difference. bad info is 
rampant ie 3 million in deductions Im told are taken for art space but on closer examination it turns out 
they cannot be used at all. ( ZERO benefit ) though you will be told yes they were deducted on the return they 
said that is the question they get asked !  were they deducted  not 2 is there a benefit !! I asked for the 
balance sheet and P and L for Regan arts , a basic first step in order to check your financials. sorry we never 
got one? though 9.8 million invested, no p&l, nothing, a construction project run amok, no budget, the coo 
fired after only 3 months. , no clue . I can add that artspace financials are also a total mess. 
As your friend and in order toturn the page. I will try to be constructive 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023334 
The following is a list of things I think would be in your interest to get done asap .but definitely not by me. 
i suggest you form new grats. , hire a high level tax partner. use your trading accounts as they remain 
the paramount requirement 16 months after i emailed to you their importance. , I suggest you 
consider having the 49percent of phaidon merged into artspance and have Richard buy artspace. re-do bank

the facts as i see them 
in June and then again Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout., then after weeks of thinking about 
the issue ( which I fully understand ) . the payout was unilaterally changed. 5m woudl be reserved for the 
future ? . and out of the remaining 15m,? i would receive only 5. ( note : I'm confident that both the debt, and 
the artspace investment will also lead to a write off of another 30 m. plus ) In my dining room ,you were 
surprised when I said that i require most people to pay their advisory fee up front so that I am assured that I 
will be properly compensated for my work when strategies that I devise are implemented. you may recall that 
you appeared offended and said  are you suggesting that i would go back on my word I said no , of course 
not ! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is that when amounts get large, people tend to get 
unhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay,. 
From day zero a 50 - 60 million price was attached as the fair price of the transaction just completed . 
though this amount was already substantially less thanour agreed and negotiated formula. - I was 
never told that this was out of range. in fact, alternative methods of payment. plane -in-kind etc, were 
discussed ( ie keeping the 30m portion of fee outstanding till March ) ,I provided as requested a 
detailed step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that i was given access to. ( Phaidon was not 
forthcoming ) in order to make my many corrections. I was then told that Alans involvement warranted a 
discount. Even in the best of light , though it is beyond question that not one-,not -one time in three 
years has he ever proposed a unique idea. (including the new tenant in common idea,) and lets say he made 
a contribution to the plan andeven that it was 50 %. though no one could posit such a large amount unless they 
were wearing a brightly colored clown suit. , the price of doing the deal was known . It had both sent in 
writing and spoken about on the phone numerous times, a detailed execution plan was provided. then and 
only then after all was laid out for the group I was told that after a number of conversations with brad karp 
that only 20m would be paid, (and even that was more than originally contemplated ) for both transactions . I 
feel It was remarkably unfair. Did brad even know of our prior agreement.? I called him and he said he was 
never told.?, I would ask that you I and Brad karp sit together if you think it would be helpful. . I would like to 
send him this email, with your consent of course. If the transactions were never consummated, i would not be 
owed a dime, however , the price was known up front. , the detailed step by step plan was followed and 
overseen by me, the price that had been requested before the transaction was begun, and had 'ready heavily 
discounted, out of friendship, from our agreement. I believe the decision re paying only 20 m has frankly 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023335 
left me felling quite uneasy. 
since you asked since last nov. i found 11 million dollars in dormant accounts. 4 million dollars in eileens

questions you might ask your team ask them to provide a balance sheet or p&l for REgan arts. . doesnt exist 
ask. either wechsler or haperin to tell you what brh is, or how the tra works. . . ? as bronstein to tell you why 
the proposed phaidon transaction DOES not work. . as them to give you a plan for the plane. ? ask them to 
show you the cash mgmt for over 100 million dollars. . ask them to show you the IT system progress after one

clients, tax basis, disposiotion in the estate. . etc. ask brad to show you the liquidation of the inteveing art space 
cos? . 
Last year you asked, for my help I told you I preferred not as we would be better off having no financial 
intereactions. the risk was not worth it. You told me that as my friend i had to do it I agreed., here we are 
in what I find to be an awkward situation. the transactions that i decvised were used , our agreement was 
ignored. and im not sure how to respond.

I have mixed emotions about what transpired today. really, You saw first hand in nauseating detail what i 
have been saying to you for quite a while now. Joslins answers were totally incomprehensible, the charts he 
prepared unreadable. Brads defensive posture was at a minum very surprising . He and I have recently gotten 
along quite well, I thought. Neither Joslin or Brad understood a 180 million dollar number. no cash flow 
after weeks of requesting? odd. when you suggested that heathers behavior was emblematic of a sloppy 
office , brad said lets not talk about emblems??! bill pay, admittedly no change for the year. . plane not 
done. though it was the only thing i suggested doing first in july . . I sent you a list of 10 consultantts. brad said 
three, . i didnt want to push it. I was shocked that brad was opining on things he knows little or nothing 
about. tax issues. 1031. neg basis, note payoffs ( the same idea he said he had had from the beggining??!!) 
. answers re LBF holdings that can be corrected ( they cant) . valuations that have never been read. . When 
we met in your lobby he seems surprised that i was there. I dont know if he felt somewhat sandbagged. . . 
the savings on the note payoff is aprrox 33 % of 1.8 billion, real money if you do phaidon which i see no 
reason not to . if later josh and ben want to buy it back with you or without you they can. i will walk you 
through the structure one on one. . the losses will offeset the calder gain as well as apollo gain. 
Im aware that seeing what you saw frustrated you. I felt badly for you. 
You wanted a contingent deal. real value. etc. I will not of course hold you to your deal . . its silly. its not 
how i work or a reflection of our friendship, my proposal is as follows. I want away from your buisiness , but 
at the same time leaving you in good shape. I think you should pay the 25m that you did not for this 
year. for next year its the same 40 m as always, paid 20 in jan and 20 in july, and then we are done. I will give 
you advice and counsel but new people will be running your operating machine. I will oversee all the work 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023337 
that needs to be done you and I will hire new people , and it will be self running. ( it was may in my house 
when you told brad it had been 5 months and you were getting fed up ) I will set up a parallel. office, somenoe 
like wendy dolman or her quality is paramount. two accountants two bookeepers and two office 
admins. . alan and zoe will handle trusts and grats. heatehr diana george will be incolved in art partnership. if 
you want brad, analysts etc. and kids to do investments I have little to add in that regard ,except to be able to 
account for things properly. I suggest that the kids must have skin in any deal. 
Alternatively , we can continue to focus on fun and let someone else do the things that you want done. and 
you and I can kibbitz about it all. structures outcomes risk, museums. charity, ( joslins answer by the way 
was I had asked how much charity was leon planining to give this year , ( the 2 m ) he didnt include your 
foundation or the payment to me, or from debra and you??!!

Mark was here this morning , the proposed transactions are extremely complex . and would take a great deal 
of detailed time. I do not know how, and if ,to move forward - our last transaction. a transaction which you 
saved 600 million in tax. even if 20 years away, ( i hope longer) even discounted is a 300 million 
savings . for that you ignored our agreements , verbal written and emailed -and decided that it was only 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023338 
worth 8 million dollars. ( assuming phaidon srichard happens. 24 m savings not including artspace and debt 
benefits certain to come later ) FYI the phaidon transaction cannot happen as currently comtemplated IT 
will not work . NOT 
When we had our meeting in your home in Bedford. You asked me for my help. I told you multiple times 
that i thought it was a very bad idea, in that I preferred to have no financial interactions. I dont have many 
friends and didnt want money in any way to interfere with our unique relationship. Reminder, For five years 
you had the kind but goofy Eileen Alexandersson as the sole manager of your accounting, legal, investments. 
reporting, trusts etc. When I first told you in no uncertain terms that I firmly believed she was incompetent you 
admonished me for speaking out of both sides of my mouth . With regard Brad Wechsler, there has never 
been a  both sides. . I have consistantly maintained since day one that he was highly unsuited for the 
job. When you initially asked me to help convince him to take the role , promising him a position to manage 
mirage investments I sent you a note saying that instead of hiring him you should pay up and get first class 
people. I have reiterated the same message for over a year now. . Brad, not me ,was tasked with hiring new 
people , according to his org chart.(nauseating ) and as you wanted him to take ownership of the staff,he 
conducted many interviews alone. . you may recall that as late as may, you told him in my presence that 
though six months had passed he had not hired anyone. since then I have rectified errors in sales tax, use 
tax, income tax, fbar reporting, 1031 reporting, 8 million of deductions missed errors of millions on the 
returns. ,( april ) Oversight on new grats- first at 22 and then at 19 that were done without my consultation and 
needed to be resolved soley as a result of my last minute intervention. . 600 million in after tax savings was 
just accomplished, though you left the 30 million outstanding that I had said should only be done if that was 
my additional fee. not used for non biz purposes and not art. 
in June and then again Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout first projected at 20 . but less when 
artspace and debt taken out, - then only after weeks, when you delayed any detailed discussion of money 
wanting to give the issue a thoughtful response ( which I fully understand ) . you unilaterally changed our 
agreement. . 5m would be reserved for the future ? . and out of the remaining 15m,? i would receive only a 
third. ( note : I'm confident that both the debt, and the art space investment will also lead to a write- off of 
another 30 m. plus ) In my dining room ,you were surprised when I said that i require most people to pay 
their advisory fee up front so that I am assured that I will be properly compensated for my work when 
strategies are implemented. you may recall that you appeared offended and said  are you suggesting that i 
would go back on my word I said no , of course not! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is 
that when amounts get large, people tend to get unhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay. 
I include below the email i sent to you on April 15, the day i was examining your returns It laid out my 
understanding of the compensation agreed for a transaction of the magnitude to the penny of the one just 
completed.ie 600m When it appeared that the transcation would and could go foward I was the first to point 
out that our agreement would cost you too much money, therefore 
From day one I proposed to discount our agreement to a 50 - 60 million range. An extremely fair price for 
all the transactions just completed. including Phaidon. - I was never told that this was out of range. in 
fact, alternative methods of payment. ie my plane, or an -in-kind payment were discussed ( 
ie including keeping the 30m portion of the fee outstanding till March ) ,I provided, only because you 
specifically requested a detailed step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that i was given 
access to. ( Phaidon was never forthcoming ) in order to make my many corrections. ( as i said more needed 
on phaidon ) . I was then told that Alans involvement warranted a discount. Even in the best of light , 
though it is beyond question that not one time in the three years of his retainer has he ever proposed a 
unique idea. (including any way to deal with the use issue on debras death ,or even the most basic review of 
your largest asset by far , the BRH agreement. ) O.K. - lets say he made a contribution to the plan and stretch 
reality beyond the pale and say it was 50 %. though no one could posit such a large amount unless they were 
wearing a clown suit. , the payment and our formula of 37 percent associated with the deal was known . It 
had both sent in writing and spoken about on the phone numerous times, a detailed execution plan was 
provided. then and only then, after the entire transaction was laid out for the group to follow You told 
me that after a number of conversations with brad karp that a total of only 20m would be paid, (and even that 
was more than you originally contemplated ) for both transactions . Leon I feel It was remarkably unfair. Did 
brad even knew of our prior agreements.? ?, I would ask that you I and Brad karp sit together if you think it 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023339 
would be helpful. . I would like to send him this email, with your consent of course. If the transactions were 
never consummated, i would not be owed a dime, however , the expected fee was known up front. , the 
detailed step by step plan was followed and overseen by me, the amount that I had requested before the 
transaction had even begun, had already been heavily discounted, out of friendship, . I believe the decision re 
only paying 20 m has frankly, left me felling quite uneasy. and colors the view about the Athene or 
Rothschild transaction.

glad to see you are personally on the mend - as well as the fence. -- As you know i dread money 
discussions with you-- however -we should address the issue of what you would like to do moving forward. re-
do family office, accounting trusts , estate and apollo agreements . Along with your  payment  last year 
we agreed. no further obligations on each side. yes, i continued to moan. I realize that though I ve done 
quite a lot this year already , it is not your responsibility. . As you often like to remind me- you've paid a 
great deal of money to date. that being said - If you want my involvement moving foward, I suggest 
you pay my regular 1 fee of 40 m. 20 now. 20 on completion or as per the invoice issues at the end of last 
year pay 30 all at once. - 
To help out . im keenly aware of your current cash position. so I will consider an in-kind payment - real 
estate ( Miami )„art , financing of my new plane (allows you to spread over years or of course the preferred 
cash. Get rid of Castrucci,it is over a year since the same story of findign the right guy at the top. you

m sure you will re my no longer spending any serious time on these things. 
Of course re any non financial issues, I am always there for you and will continue to be the best friend I can 
be 
Steve jobs said that everyday he woke up , and asked himself, if he knew he was going to die tomorow , would 
he do the same thing that he had planned for the day- he wanted to check that he was doing things that he 
really wanted to. after three days of getting back an answer of no, he would change what he was going to do. . 
he also did not believe in LONG term plans. I dont think either one of us will figure out what we want to do 
long term so my thinking is that we should try to have fun everyday, and welcome serendipity. 
I think another trust and estate lawyer should be brought in to deal with the issues of how not to allow your 
family to get screwed by your partners on death. Alan, for years told me that paul weiss had drawn the 
docs so no issue but when recently pushed by my new fire drill he asked akin to draft.?! PLease ask brad

Leon, Congragulations on biting the bullet. at least 18 months late , but I m encouraged and glad for 
you. When you interviewed Brad two years ago you asked that i not tell him what a disaster lay before 
him. what would you like me to tell Barry? 
There is a HUGE amount of work to be done in the next 9 -12 months. mostly the exact same work that i 
outlined in my email of 2 years ago. now complicated by years of mess on top. ( you can send it again if you 
like ) . Brad wechsler was never up to the task. sorry, I realize I have been saying the very same thing for a 
long time. he was a not a step up from Eileen but a step sideways. in the beginning there was Eileen and 
Tom and Ralph Lerner. all your hand picks. then brad. john, Joe. . joslin was chosen from a pool of 2 
people. each that would be limited by a salary of 250k. ( yes i personally augmented his comp in order to get 
him ) I did say hire both Lisa to do the bookkeeping and joslin tax, He complained for over a year, re his 
direction by eileen and ada, and then brad. His breakdown was not a surprise after months and moths of 
warnings. Though disabled, he ran your office this year. with john and joe. He ran amok, and as i told 
you he rarely failed to remind me in our conversations that you told him that he works for you and not for 
me and that brad needs to pays him . 
. Asking me who to hire , estate attny tax people etc. : 
I have taken heat for years over the fact that i gave you no more than carlyns name, . no follow up 
questions no interactions , not even one single question asked of me re her work. ( that was Eileen ) but 
somehow carlyns fuck up was my doing. . when i told you that i thought Eileen wasn't up to the task, you 
bellowed that i was talking out of both sides of my mouth. . You told me this year , that by trying to protect 
you from crazy joslin, I had in essence fired him and it was my responsibility to do his work. it then turns out 
that he didn't consider himself fired at all he just received less money. and continued to make a really 
dangerous mess. . Joshn castrucci, in your eyes, was also my doing , though email after email said, I take no 
responsibility for him,and iYOU SHOULD NOT HIRE HIM .!!! „ your response was that was my opinion 
was only because i didn't trust him. then to add insult to injury last jan you told me he was gone. however he 
too is still there, and a waste of money and space. 
My time is complicated by Donald's potentially eviscerating any reason for anyone to use the foreign 
funds repatriation plan that i had put together. . however as you are aware I have some decisions to make re 
my time allocation in the next year or two. so at least for a few weeks I am unable to commit much time and 
make any future plans to guide you in the redoing of your procrastination produced mess. 
That being said, the tasks at hand are the following. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023341 
You have a bomb of colored string that your retarded children have formed , It has to be very carefully 
unwound , even the substitution of Barry for your next trustee, needs a careful focus on procedure.s It would 
be much preferable if Wechsler was not his replacement. do you have any person you trust ??! . I am 
concerned re brad taking barrys place re )(XXX. In the beginning Barry will need to find and learn 
ACCURATE . org charts. books , balance sheets. trust valuations, are all a part. Barry will need 2 months 
to just get his arm around what is there, this is before any needed modifications., 
a way overdue re- fresh of your estate plan. . clats , trust. partnerships. grats. Ilcs. bank accounts, filing 
requirements. etc. the long awaited review of the brh tra and shareholders agreement to see how they fit into 
new plan. .  planning. art partnership engagement.. , airplane re-do. , buying another. . ? boat 
sale , Miami sale. . TRADING ACCOUNTS. . three years over due. . an accounting system. fire john 
.. joslin stays for a year. or so. so does tom and. except for heather everyone should be replaced with 
new. . Sell Artspace and shut down regan arts. . rationalize, cash flow reporting. cash mgmt. stock 
sales. sec irs. gaming. foreign reporting. the 8865 mess will take months to review now. . you 
CANNOT file unreviewed audited documents. . CANNOT!!! this will be very detailed work. . a self 
inflicted wound - all avoidable if professionals had been in place to limit. or contain it. . . you will need 
3 new hires .a s there is no one in your office that is truly an A player. I have great hope in Barry as you 
know. He will need to be trained. note 
; One year is my guesstimate After 4 years of telling you , that you could do better than Halperin,: im glad 
that you now are willing to follow barrys advice . I take no offense, in fact I take comfort in the fact that after 
only one conversation with Barry you are now convinced to make that change . will take a year or more. 
I expect as a friend you will understand that 
I will no longer, not even for one day , work on your affairs . without the compensation that is long 
overdue. . your unilateral idea of after care , not imposed on any other professional , except me, not paul 
weiss ,( caesars alone , a direct screw up on their part ) tom, akin„ no one. needs to end. . you and I had 
previously agreed no more of that, and this after you decided not to pay me per our agreement. to be fair I can 
not say im surprised as you have email after email , stating that , if you save a great deal of money, you 
wont want to pay, so limit it to 40m per year. - water under the bridge 
If I can find the time to work, on your project , which is not by any means certain as I have said, I hope 
you understand that it now will have to be under my standard terms and conditions. and well documented so as 
to avoid any more of the he said she said. I never want to have any more uncomfortable money moments with 
you , I find it very distasteful. . so to be clear , my terms are as follows . I will only work for the usual 40 
million per year. It needs to be paid, 25 million upon signing an agreement. 5 million every 2 months 
thereafter for 6 months ie march may june . this can begin if i am able in January. I will immediately stop 
work, if the payment is not received. If you want me to work this year until Jan 15 , it will be 10 
million, paid upfront. after one year you will be left with a new estate plan a running office. staffed with 
professionals overseen by Barry. ( hallelujah ) a tax plan . and an investment that returns more than any 
painting you could possible own. . no agreement - no work. however - I of course will talk to Barry for the 
hour that i promised , and take your guidance as to what I should say. 
her the last two places. ?

Leon please read the attached proposed response to the IRS , see if you can understand it !!!. lye asked for a

incompetence in your family office.. Alans words  but I was told that.. , but I was told by the office (sic) 
that ... , BUT i was told by joslin,. , but I was told by.  why is leon blaming me for .. . I ve have always 
given you my best advice, If you reflect on your financial life, you have been kept safe , had remarkable 
results and no disasters. I have repeatedly urged you to get rid of the people in your office. , you 
have repeatedly chosen to ignore my advice , you told me last week that the emotional reason was in order 
to be weaned off my group and not have to pay my high fees. ( though ignoring the benefit of between 1.5 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023342 
and 2b to the better. ) . and no explosions. You have email after email ,where i remind you that I am not 
your bookkeeper or accountant ( in brads corporate speak his finance dept ??!!) that it should be redone .I 
have reviewed a multitude of the silly reports given to you and have pointed out the continued numerous 
inaccuracies . your question so what if the numbers are off, so what if the categories are off whats the big 
deal??. I suggest you de risk you finances and make the tough decisions necessary - pay the right amounts ( 
high) to get the work done properly or , you are, Im afraid, certain to get an unhappy answer.. tom will be

Leon, 
Yesterday, I again spent hours upon hours of my time with your office. ,( speak to brad to get flavor) and 
you and i will discuss the results in gory gruesome detail on Friday. it mirrored many other weeks spent doing 
the things that I don;t have the time to do. 
In order to keep things in perspective, maybe reviewing an analogy I have used before with you, might be 
helpful. You and your family are a 6 billion dollar corp. with an income between 250 -500 million dollars per 
year. It contains a few operating biz's , a large wide array of existing investments, in various categories, 
a desire to enter into others. A panoply of loans, notes. purchases, wide range of all types of taxes. , planes. 
boats homes. . trusts ,grats. a crazy number of bank accts. ( with no oversight ) . law firms, acct firms, 800 
page tax returns, foreign firms. art consultants. construction consultants bill payers, 
home mgmt.,vast multitude ofllc's , including foreign, and with all that you only have a combined overhead 
of less that 3 million dollars. 
I have previously sent you the very same note that i have enclosed again below ,this time with highlights 
. I wrote it to you over a year ago. As my acute disability ( selective memory) seems to have been raised 
as one of your concerns , as a rule I try to memorialize things in writing in an attempt to lay out issues that I 
fear may later turn out to be a problem. ie what i would and wouldn't do , - my responsibilities. etc and those 
things that are not. below you will find details of things that I thought needed to be done, so that you 
wouldn't find yourself in the very place where you currently find yourself however ,you chose to defer 
many of my suggestions- see below -,until only weeks ago. ! you chose to defer the jpm acct. the art 
partnership on and on - into this year. and though the 60- 50 40 timber emails all carried with it a clear warning 
that you needed to do something re personnel if it were to stabilize,- you chose to wait.

prefer only being responsible and standing behind my own personal work ( ie the word DONE will no longer

might find very costly, very ! ( however many structures available some risk sharing, maybe risk caps ,etc ) but 
would require my teams doing the work , not yours. Ada should be only a trust, grat administrator, not sure

stays or not, is not urgent. having Tom report to a new person,- is. coordination with Suydam Kathy

consideration. 
TODAY 
With your acquiesence , Eileen did not report to Delson ( he acting as a conduit directly to me) , she 
continued to provide bad info to both you ( cash flows , stock accts, structures. sales Etc) and me. and each 
time with my many annoying calls to you made immediately afterwards that she was g.....y!! No one was 
hired to run YOUR office until two months ago , no one was even interviewed and even now , Brad, a very 
nice man, is not even full time,(crazy ) Hours upon hours of time need to be spent training him. and his new 
staff. Eileen followed your instructions, not mine, in fact she continued to ignore mine saying  but Leon 
said  or its on Leon's desk etc , You would become frustrated when i pointed out each instance, of her 
obfuscation. originally you were given the clear choice, but to save money ,you chose not to hire my team. I 
was hired to do the architecture, you kept your own team. with Eileen at the head. instructions were given by 
me„ detailed but ignored by her. ( except in the instances where I inserted myself and personally had to do the 
weeks of grunt work ),ex. jpm morgan acct still not in use? That being said, If you do the cold calculation 
,starting from where you were, to where you are currently . you have made a hell of a deal. -- negotiating 
down my original amount requested, calling upon our friendship and suggesting that the Carlyn mess was 
partially my fault. ( though in that specific example, I had never been asked to do more than merely provide 
you the name of the most highly recognized atty in the field, not consulted,nor even asked again for my 
guidance along the way. ). I accepted the discount as your friend. ( by the way „suggesting now, that your

In order to move forward

have this year for my time. (hopefully a more fair way to allocate ) I would also ask that you keep in mind 
that though our deal expired months ago. (also keeping in mind , that your understanding of the final 
payment terms neither reflected the emails or my memory, we finished it up your way. ) I have answered every 
call Brad , joslin, Ada or you, have made . reviewed docs over and over/ until once again, I was 
forced to insert myself strongly as I thought it dangerous not to. I made serious dollar and time concessions 
last year.very serious I am wiling to continue to accommodate some of your concerns , but I am, under no

was a few weeks and 30 million dollars . We were both highly aware of the dire circumstances in which you 
found yourself last year, and in fact due predominately to its seriousness, and those very circumstances I took

very close friend.), unfortunately I fear that if you are not cautious ,in the near future, another barrel will appear 
of your own design )

required that my payments be at the end of my work not at the beginning as everyone else's .( my work was 
never to include hours upon hours of training your staff). I eventually agreed, this of course should 
make clear that the 2014 tax year that will close Oct 2015 is not covered by our past agreement at all. I 
pointed this very fact out to you when I initially proposed a multi year agreement right out of the box. you said

been brought in- house but created more issues that didn't exist. and phaidon was its own animal 
Dec 13. you were again annoyed that i said that they needed to be replaced and said i was talking out of both 
sides of my mouth. first time ( email available) 
Jan 14, you decided that no third year was necessary for my help. and i told you i thought that unwise and 
even suggested giving you an option at 40 m so there would be no tension 
Mar 14, I told you that to do the job right, my team would need to do it. not yours it would not be

emblematic of my frustration and ,in the end what I believe is a waste of our time energy money and 
resources. is the very simple question of bidco bank accounts. 4 months ago I asked the question, does it 
have a bank account and if so , who has authority, where is it located and what transacations ran through it. it 
is only one question out of hundreds that need to be answered. hundreds. . you asked that i not behave like 
Zeus and try to explain why I want need certain things. since i said to placate Brad's inquisitive ness and his 
desire to learn I said a filing might be required. instead of merely getting me the answer. he has talked to 
joslin paul weiss , you, you wanted to ask brad karp. ( maybe a filing that reopened things, ) 
none of this as a practical matter has any influence upon the ultimate action taken . I merely needed to 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023349 
know a simple answer. and today after asking at least every week since then do not have an answer. I have 
been trying not to add stress to your day. i try to explain things and take the time to do so gently, ( not my forte 
. this is one question out of hundreds. the fact that a 21 year old was in the office only xeroxing for a 
month, was obvious to everyone in the office. having a 26 year old xeroxing instead doesnt move us 
forward, answers first. copying old files. can wait.

Subject: another flowery email. 
To: Melanie Spinella 
I am sorry. I realize you are under tremendous stress, In Bedford you asked me for my help I could not have 
been more clear that thought it very unwise as in my words I did not want any financial arrangment between 
us, it risked conflict and tension what neither of us needed more of and did not want to risk torturing our 
friendship into the likes of the kind you have with Mark nor Josh, : now,- I dont have anyone but you yelling 
at me, in my own house. no one. it is highly unpleasant but I am trying my best to be understanding. sorry 
. From the outset and as you told me you recall. i tsuggested that three years should be the period of 
engagment. as planning is not a one year excericse . you declined to commit to a number of alternatives 
presented to you for payment of the third year. I told you in nov that you should decide whether to now sign 
on for that very third year as the vast majority of my work ended on oct 15. you recently told me you thought i 
was kidding. .you hired brad patting him on the back that after months of inquiry he can now, finallly tell you 
which Ilc owns the cars?? 
once he has all the facts what next ??. whether or not you refer to a portion of the third year as after care, or 
whatever term besides 'scoundrel you choose to use, I m not sure why you assume now it should be free.( 
I HATE THIS CONVERSATION < HATE , ) and i heard you when you said you told me what was I work 
still to be done you thought valuable enough to pay for. please tell me. and then we can decide the next steps 
if any. I consider my work rarefied art. I guess the value is in the eye of the beholder. IT reminds me of 
those people looking at a modern art piece and saying  my child could do that . hope you are feeling better.

1. nothing in the first quarter and these are only papers that need signing. 
I suggest your thinking on my role and compensation for my work might benefit, from a mental shift - think 
mark and josh, without the mutual resentment ( HAHA) only in terms of sharing ,thanks, I am and have been 
your financial partner i.. rectifying circumstances that appear in hind sight unexplainable. I wish you woudl 
have asked me earllier to review your things , but i understand. I do know that soley as a result of my actions 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023350 
your personal bottom line has increased dramatically, if you had thought of me as your partner in this 
endeavor , instead of an employee, i think your reaction to sharing t benefits would be different. 
If you recall, you wanted me to be paid , unlike others at the END of my work. we discussed this ad 
nauseum, and agreed OCT 15, last year was the end. You had wanted more comfort initially on the art 
partnership so that date was delayed. It has now been six monhts since then, your concept of aftercare. . for 
free. was already unique, in your words this has to have an end.( weaned ) if the actions of josh and 
mark led to one hundred million dollars , what would be their share. Im not sure why it is different in your 
mind, but i respect the fact that it is, Is it because their work seems harder. it cannot be simply because they 
devote more time to you .or it appears to involve more effort. I am happy to continue to play a partnership 
role. as I have been in many areas of your life.. I am also happy to move on and have no more of these 
emails. I find them as tedious as you do. if you prefer a partnership structure, ok with me, I tried to minimize 
the amount of money i would recieve by making it a flat fee . as i wanted you to feel good and have no second 
thoguths somehow if the payment comes from a partnership structure you seem relaxed as opposed to writing 
a check, I focus on trust and friendship first, and the fact that you don't include josh and mark in that 
category, gives me great pause . I proposed 33 percent of money made for you.. in the past you agreed that 
amount. it will be huge, but ok with me, I can talk today at 945 as you suggested. or if you woudl rather

Subject: Picasso agreement - question 
To: Brad Wechsler L 
<jeevacation@gmail.com> 
_ 
1>, Jeffrey Epstein cjeevacation@gmail.com) 
Brad and Jeffrey, 
Gagosian has one final change to the Picasso agreement. As you know, we have structured this agreement with 
the Buyer as either Narrows Holdings LLC or AP Narrows LP, and given both of those entities the right to 
assign the agreement to any one among Leon, Debra, the kids, or family trusts including AP01 and AP02. 
Gagosian wants us to agree that, if Narrows/AP Narrows assigns the agreement to someone else, Narrows/AP 
Narrows shall not be discharged from its liabilities under this Agreement and shall remain primarily liable to 
Seller. Larry is concerned that we might assign to the Black kids or to a trust that has no assets, and then when 
he has to sue us because we don't make the final payment of the purchase price but have possession of the art, 
the entity/person to which we have assigned the agreement has no money. 
I think this is a valid concern and that we should agree to it. 
However, Ada just reminded me that it is possible that Narrows/AP Narrows (really, Leon's) agreeing to 
effectively guarantee payment by the assignee might be considered a gift to the assignee. In the discussions 
with Alan about rearranging the bank loan once AP Narrows is operational, Alan agreed that there could be 
deemed to be a potential gift from Leon to AP01/AP02 if Leon provides a guarantee to the bank that is for the 
benefit of the trusts as partners in AP Narrows. Alan suggested mitigating this risk by having the trusts sign 
side agreements with Leon which say that if AP Narrows defaults on the loan and the bank goes after Leon on 
his guarantee, the trusts will make him whole. 
This issue only arises if we assign the agreement. The risk is also limited in time because it would run from the 
moment we assigned the agreement until the final payment is made, which even if we assigned immediately 
after signing, would only be 11 1/2 months. 
Shall I agree to Gagosian's request that Narrows/AP Narrows remain liable even if they assign the agreement? 
I'm in the office if you would like to discuss this, but I would love to get back to Gagosian ASAP so we can 
have this agreement signed today. 
Thanks,

NO sorry not until i hear from leon 
leon. to be fair, I had sent the first note to you one year ago . stating that my work would come to an end on 
oct 15. that day had meaning as everything would be closed, you asked that i continue to help brad. as of 
nov though he would officially start in jan. I said ok, but.....  you told me to continue as we would work 
something out I told you my fee then was 40. feb you came with ben while kathy ruemmler was here. and 
said next week, debra got bad news. and I quickly prioritzed not adding stress to your situation. I wont 
regurgitate the interim, though millions of dollars were saved since. millions. . it is now one year later and you 
propose 10 mIllion , plus a contingent fee . I have said that i would work with you, and if contingent and a 
percentage of something. I strongly believe that is not in your interest. I continue to put our friendship first 
and dont want you to write a check for over 100million andthe i will have to listen to lewie for the next few 
years. but if you prefer over my objection a percentage deal then it should be of all savings not just 
phaidon. ( a random concept) . The idea that i am somehow even marginally responsible for neither you nor 
heather, ever telling me that there was an unresolved issue, though you said you had been pinged a number of 
times is emblematic . 
I can do a call with you and Karp. anytime you like today, but i can assure you 100 percent that there is no 
light between our positions. ZERO. and he is ready to do his best to try to explain it to you.

I think you should consider the fact that your family office will be the most central component of what you 
leave to your children , wife heirs. it is the core of your assets. your art might be sold. your houses may lie 
empty, the apollo stock could be sold. you will pass on your office, . it will be the primary player in your 
estate tax. probate, transition. Brad has taken it from a D minus to a C minus, If I were you I would set the 
goal of an A. just like your paintings. . Like a house you could attempt to renovate it. it will take more time 
and money. or. in essence as I suggested in dec of 13, start from scratch. A financail head of 
office. - brad could move to being richards replacment as trustee. . barry cohen would be perfect but carries 
the trustee taint now. . take a tax partner from a major firm. to replace joslin, cost 1 + mil . keep heather

better IT than your multi billlion dollar antique opersation. data breaches are not your concern, precision is. . 
either re do the office layout. or get enterly new space. the proposals to focus on following on a monthly basis

the familys financial life and temp future, it needs a heart operation

Radical but my preferred idea. . START from total scratch. there is absolutely nothing worth keeping in 
your family office except for heather, nothing at all . I remember when i bought my first house in order to 
renovate and jack robertson said forget it. knock it down start again, I could n't believe it. but he was 
right. Like your tax returns that were done in triplicate. TOM RICH ALAN. . tom and rich were not really 
useful in the end. Alan was the only smart one. you should in my opinion Start a brand new office. hire 
cfo. bring joe over, heather and samantha, run parallel for 6 months and close down the mess of elysium 
forever, leave your kids a functioning operation professionally constructed and managed. NOT BY ME!!! 
LAst nov i laid out priorities IT , being the first nothing as of today. in July I said focus on airplane as a test 
. to examine procedure and proficiency, so far mostly a waste of resources time people etc. Only last week 
told debra owns 49 percent of plane. no IT to speak of. bens house unaccounted for. tax returns very 
very sloppy, . boat still argued as third home. . pilots bonuses? , structure unkown by all. cash sitlling at the 
same time loans outstanding. 
Phaidon, looks like close to breakeven in a few years. others totally unknown. Query, do you really want 
this ? : I m not sure how you both want to have an investment office and have cash flow being eaten by 
publishing and loans amounts outstanding increased by art. --interest rates will be going up.- . your plane will 
cost 10 million to refinance - so will boat if sold next year-. art space and regan , both needs more cash. with 
little return, taxes , art purchases . Part of radical solutition is to sell publishing.altogether. (are the children 
really interested.) . restrucuture plane from scratch. layers unncessary. simplify crazy structure s bank 
accounts trading accounts accounts payble. credit cards. etc. The best way to wean yourself away from me 
is to have someone else do the whole thing from scratch. . move brad to be the replacement for Richard. . he is 
nice but this is not what he does. Him saying it is s0000 fucked up to me , was only an echo of me sayint it to

To: jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> 
Hi Jeffrey, 
As you will recall, we used this same exchange agent last year on the Calder 1031. At the time, we discussed 
the merits of using a gallery versus a commercial exchange agent and my recommendation to Leon was to use a 
gallery. I felt that there were advantages to using a commercial exchange agent instead of a gallery on the 1031 
side (e.g., less likelihood of a breach of confidentiality, IRS familiarity with CDEC in the event of an audit, 
security of funds), but that a commercial exchange agent gave us less comfort on the sales tax side. Leon did 
not want to use a gallery because he was concerned about confidentiality and he did not want to have to ask a 
gallery that he did not do much business with to act as exchange agent. 
When Leon first discussed the exchange for the Cezannes with me a few weeks ago, I asked him if he wanted 
to use the same exchange agent as last year, or if he wanted to use a gallery. I said that a gallery carried little to 
no risk on the sales tax side, but I reminded him that he had not wanted to use a gallery last year for the Calder 
because of confidentiality reasons. He said to use the same exchange agent as before, which made sense to me 
because he was extremely concerned about confidentiality with the purchase of the Cezannes. 
I will find out about sales tax audits and will let you know. The exchange agent has had a New York resale 
certificate since 2014 and has been engaged in art transactions like this since then, but I do not believe they 
have been audited. I will check, though, and I will also ask the Herrick lawyer if any of his clients who have 
done similar deals have been audited. 
Best, 
Heather

In order to get out of the conspiracy, according to the government, Reems was obliged “to take
up affirmative actions to defeat and destroy the conspiracy.” But what could Reems have done?
He could not have “exposed” the crime, as one might expose a secret conspiracy, since everyone
knew that Deep Throat was being distributed throughout the world. He could not have prevented
the distribution and exhibition of the film, since he retained no legal rights to it. The prosecutor
apparently expected him to physically destroy the thousands of prints of Deep Throat that were
then in theaters and on video.

The jury, selected from residents of Memphis, a city proud of being called “the buckle of the Bible
Belt,” convicted Reems and his co-conspirators and Harry went off in search of an appellate
lawyer. Because of my involvement in the I Am Curious Yellow case, he called me.

When we first met, Reems described himself to me as “a nice Jewish boy earning his livelihood by
doing what lots of people would pay to do.” He was born in Scarsdale, New York, with the
name Herbert Streicker, attended the University of Pittsburgh, dropped out, joined the Marines,
and later set out to become a stage actor. He had performed with the La Mama troupe, the New
York Theater Ensemble, and the National Shakespeare Company in New York City. He had even
done a Wheaties commercial. During Christmas of 1969, “when things got rough and there was
no work around...,a fellow said he knew where I could make $75 doing a stag film.” He
nervously accepted and reported for work. His two female costars, both doctoral students in
sociology at NYU, put him at ease, and he completed several “loops.” Streicher was successful,
not so much because of his looks or size, but rather because of his extraordinary ability to perform
repeatedly on cue. In a business where time is money and the major cause of delay is male
incapacity, a porno actor capable of filming several sequences in one day’s shooting is in demand.

Streicker told me how he ended up as the male star of Deep Throat. He had been hired—at $150
per day—as a sound and lighting technician for a sex film being shot near Miami, Florida, in
January 1972. When the original male lead failed to appear, the director, Gerard Damiano, asked
Streicker to fill in—at a $50 cut in salary. Since it took only one day to shoot the film’s sex shots,
he earned only $100 for his performance. His contract did not call for royalties. When the
filming was completed, Streicker’s role in the enterprise was over: he did not participate in the
editing or distribution of the film—not to mention its enormous profits. Even his stage name
“Harry Reems’—with some vague sexual allusion in mind—was picked by the director, without
even consulting Streicker. He was pleased, of course, that the film was well-received and widely
shown. He retained “Harry Reems” as his professional name, and performed in several other sex
films. But his role in Deep Throat was over, or so he thought, until he was arrested two years
later in his Greenwich Village apartment. An FBI agent handed him a warrant requiring his
presence in Memphis, Tennessee, a city that Streicker had never even visited.

The prosecuting attorney was a young Bible Belt fundamentalist named Larry Parrish. (The
names of all the participants sounded like puns: Reems, Streicker, Lovelace, Parrish.) Parrish
was dubbed by the press as “Mr. Clean,” “The Memphis Heat,” and “the Memphis Smut Raker.”
A born-again Christian, and an elder in the First Evangelical Church, Parrish believed that
pornography was the bane of modern America. He once told a reporter, “I’d rather see dope on
the streets than these movies,” explaining that drugs could be cleansed from the body, but
pornography’s damage was “permanent.” When asked why be became a prosecutor, Parrish cited

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023937.txt,"How the Best Universities Inadvertently Ruin Our Schools 197

hire folks who can contribute. I was trying to build educational soft-
ware but the principle was the same. I hired programmers, researchers,
assistants to do lower level work, video staff, artists, and, of course,
graduate students.

And, now you know what I did all day. I managed this enterprise.
Eventually my institute had 200 people working in it. I did what any
person in charge of 200 people does. I set the direction and checked
on progress. Also, I wrote books and thought deep thoughts. This is
what any professor does who brings in grant money. I was just doing
it on a larger scale than most.

All of this is about winning the prestige game. Any university
wants pre-eminent professors. Universities want the best faculty so
their name is mentioned a lot, so they get applications from students,
attention from the media, and more grant money. That is what uni-
versities do. Teaching? Well, how exactly does teaching fit in with all
that?

It really doesn’t. Most professors agree that the university is a lot
nicer place when there aren’t all those undergraduates around. From
May to September New Haven was an idyllic place. Smart people, good
weather, interesting conversation. Then in September, thousands of
young people, making a racket and expecting to be taught. But, there-
in lies the problem. Are students really expecting to be taught?

It doesn’t take very long for a professor to learn that those brilliant
Yale students, the ones who killed themselves to get into the place, may
not be there solely to enter into the life of the mind. While everyone
is thinking great thoughts and doing great research over the summer,
professors manage to get themselves believing that the job of a profes-
sor at a great university is to be an intellectual. What they forget easily
enough is who is paying the bills. And, they forget the real agenda of
those who are paying the bills. They are reminded soon enough.

Students want courses to be easy, not bother them too much with
work outside the classroom, and help them get a good job. Of course,
I am oversimplifying here. Many students attend Yale to learn what it
is that you, the professor, really know and want to teach. In 15 years
at Yale I met a number of them. I remember their names because there
weren't that many. We can hope that all professors have met their
share of that type of student.

Most college students are 18-year-olds who are on their own for
the first time. They are more interested in exploring themselves and
their new freedoms than they are in working hard at intellectual

substantially longer periods before liquidity is achieved in comparison with historical values,
which would reduce the returns that could be achieved by the Fund. In addition, factors
specific to a portfolio company may have an adverse effect on the Fund’s investment in such
company. The General Partner may rely upon its own or a portfolio company’s projections
concerning the portfolio company’s future performance in making investment decisions. Such
projections are inherently subject to uncertainty and to certain factors beyond the control of the
portfolio company and the General Partner. Prospective investors are particularly cautioned
that the investment sourcing, selection, management and liquidation strategies and procedures
exercised by partners of the General Partner in the past may not be successful, or even
practicable, during the Fund’s term.

Industry Specific Terminology

Prospective investors are cautioned that certain terms and phrases of common usage within the
venture capital industry may be misleading to those unfamiliar with such usage. In particular,
individuals who participate in the management of a fund often are referred to, in a colloquial
sense, as “general partners” even though they are not actually general partners of any
partnership. Prospective investors are reminded that the Fund will be a limited partnership,
that the General Partner will be a limited partnership, that the general partner of the General
Partner will be a limited liability company, and that the individuals directing the management
of the Fund through the General Partner will be members of such limited liability company. It
is not intended that the Fund will have any general partner other than the General Partner or
that any actual general partnership will in any manner be associated with the formation,
operation, dissolution or termination of the Fund. Prospective investors must not presume or
rely upon the existence of any actual legal entities other than the Fund, the General Partner and
the general partner of the General Partner. With respect to all matters involving industry
specific terminology, prospective investors are urged to consult with their own legal and other
advisors.

Fund and General Partner Not Registered

The Fund will not be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
“Investment Company Act”) pursuant to an exemption set forth in Sections 3(c)(1) and/or
3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance that such exemptions will
continue to be available to the Fund. Due to the burdens of compliance with the Investment
Company Act, the performance of the Fund’s investment portfolio could be materially
adversely affected, and risks involved in financing portfolio companies could substantially
increase, if the Fund becomes subject to registration under the Investment Company Act.
Neither the Fund nor its counsel can assure investors that, under certain conditions, changed
circumstances, or changes in the law, the Fund may not become subject to the Investment
Company Act or other burdensome regulation. The General Partner is not registered as a
broker/dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and
with the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the “NASD”) and is consequently not
subject to the record keeping and specific business practice provisions of the Exchange Act and
the rules of the NASD.

into the diplomatic fray. With no early sign, however, of Arafat agreeing to
leave, Arik now steadily tightened what amounted to a siege on west Beirut. For
seven weeks in July and August, our forces pounded the PLO-controlled
neighborhoods from land, air and sea; intermittently cut water and electricity
supplies; and hoped that the accumulated pressure, and casualties, would force
Arafat and his men to agree to Habib’s terms for a wholesale evacuation.

By this point, I was spending most of my time in the Airya, with periodic
visits north, sometimes with Arik or Raful, to our positions on the eastern,
Phalangist-controlled, side of Beirut. On several occasions, I helicoptered back
with Habib or his deputy, Morris Draper. In one instance, I accompanied Draper
into a meeting with Arik. In what I imagine had become a familiar, and
frustrating, part of the US mediation mission, he pressed Arik to rein in our
bombardments, arguing that we were in danger of ruining the chances of getting
a negotiated deal on Arafat’s leaving. Arik argued straight back. His view was
that unless the PLO felt squeezed into submission, they would stay put.

On that, I thought Ank was probably right. Other Israeli generals with far
more experience, and weight, also seemed to agree. Notably, Yitzhak Rabin. He
was no longer in government, nor even in charge of Labor. But he had always
had a soft spot for Arik, as did Sharon for him. With uneasiness, questions and
outright criticism of the siege building both internationally and inside Israel,
Arik got Rabin to helicopter north with him to Beirut. Yitzhak spent six or
seven hours there. His verdict on the siege, at least as reported in the Israeli
press, was more than Arik could have hoped for. Lehadek, he said. “Tighten it.”
In the end, I’m convinced the siege did have a critical effect on getting the
evacuation deal. But unleashing our single most relentless series of air attacks,
on August 12, when the deal was basically done, seemed both perverse and
excessive, and not just to me. Habib, and President Reagan himself, fumed. So
did a lot of Begin’s own ministers, with the result, unprecedented in Israeli
military annals, that they formally removed Arik’s authority to decide on future
air force missions. That turned out not to matter, however, because August 12
effectively marked the end of the siege.

On the afternoon of Saturday, August 21, the first shipload of an eventual
total of nearly 10,000 Palestinian fighters left Beirut harbor for Cyprus, and then
for a variety of new host countries. On this score at least, Arik’s grand design
had proven beyond him: the Palestinians were not bound for Jordan. By far
most of them headed for the PLO’s new political base, the north African state of

We are confident that our national establishments’ abilities, combined with the economic measures undertaken
by the government, will lead to economic growth this year. Yet, we expect that growth may not come at the
same rate of pervious growth records we sustained over the past few years. While speculating global economic
contraction of 0.5 percent, international financial bodies forecast a slight growth for the UAE economy. Other
forecasts speculate a 3 percent growth for the UAE economy.

By Al-Sharq al-Awsat Daily

Maybe every cloud has a silver lining. The financial crisis has restored balance to the
markets following years of inflation which posed a threat to Dubai’s and the UAE’s
economies. Do you see this tough correction, for instance to the real estate market, a good
solution to a problem that could have escalated in the future?

Sometimes opportunities are born from the wombs of crises. The most important thing is to focus on the future
and develop appropriate frameworks that guarantee highest levels of performance on heels of the crisis.
Measures undertaken by the government on both local and federal levels will ensure that we shall emerge from
the global financial crisis with least damage. The UAE has proven remarkable ability in facing and overcoming
previous crises. Specialized committees and task forces are closely monitoring the development of the global
crisis and analyzing its impacts on our economy and subsequently propose action plans to resiliently cope with
these ongoing changes.

By Al-Sharq al-Awsat Daily

Many rumors are targeting Dubai claiming it has turned into a ghost city and that tens of
thousands are being laid off every week. Don’t you feel upset about these rumors and the
way the impact of the crisis has been perceived outside Dubai?

Actually, we don’t pay attention to rumors and our response always comes in actions rather than words. As a
matter of fact, Dubai visitors these days are surprised by these rumors and I’ve met with many of them recently
and they expressed their amazement at Dubai’s traffic jams, overbooked hotels and crowded markets.

Dubai’s success -- which it has sustained over the past years -- is the true reason behind this type of mixed
reports. Those who spread such rumors -- are they aware of the fact that global nature of Dubai makes it more
sub ject to impacts of global changes than any other city? We totally endorse freedom of expression but we
always urge responsible freedom that promotes principles of integrity and objectivity.

It is truly sad to find international publications that have usually boasted about factual and precise reporting
issuing articles based on mere rumors and baseless speculations. We are fully aware of the hidden fierce global
economic competition between different parties who are in the same line of business. When a city or a country
decides to integrate itself as an effective international player, it should not expect an easy journey full of roses
and good wishes.

Do you know how many major international airlines are closely monitoring Emirates’ performance? Do you
think that international port services companies are happy with the success accomplished by DP World in
managing and operating dozens of ports around Europe, Asia and Africa? Do you expect international financial
markets are pleased with Dubai Financial Market’s success in its accusation of some of the world’s most
important financial markets in the world?

conflicting explanations over the past six months about who is responsible for ensuring that he is complying with the law.

On Nov. 14, the Herald asked the sheriff’s office for a full accounting of Epstein’s check-ins for 2018. The record the office supplied two days later showed
he registered in January and in July — as required. But PBSO also inexplicably had him registering on Nov. 14 — the very same day that the Herald asked
for the records from the sheriff’s office.

When asked about this sudden registration, Barbera replied: “The information we provided you was a snapshot from the FDLE website. Perhaps,
someone from FDLE can provide a reason for you.”

Said FDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger in an email: “The screenshot is not on the public registry. This is information inputted by the local agency when
the offender comes into the local sheriff’s office to register.”

Plessinger said Epstein is not covered by the state’s new three-day rule, which requires sex offenders to re-register when they come to stay in Florida for
three days or more. His town of Palm Beach home is already on file, as a temporary residence, she said.

So it’s not clear why he would have suddenly registered a third time on Nov. 14.

State Sen. Lauren Book, a child sex abuse survivor and vocal advocate for tough sex offender monitoring, called the case an appalling example of how
those in the justice system allow wealthy people to skirt the law and bend the rules.

“These prosecutors, and judges and sheriffs who are making these decisions and allowing things to fly — we have to hold these people accountable. They
are supposed to uphold the law — regardless of who a person is and how much money they have in the bank or who they had on their airplane.”

Piece by piece

Over the years, Courtney Wild, Virginia Roberts and more than a dozen other women who say they were victims of Epstein have been quietly challenging
the traditional legal norms that have failed to punish Epstein and other men in positions of power for sexual abuse.

Epstein has paid millions of dollars in civil compensation that, for the most part, has kept the details about his operation out of the public eye. As a result,
much — but not all — of the testimony and evidence collected as part of the vast litigation has been sealed or redacted from public court records.

Feb 4, 2013 -- Now that he has finished
his consultations with the country's
political parties and charged Benjamin
Netanyahu with forming a new coalition,
Israel’s respected President, Shimon
Peres, is once again very much in the
news. In his speech inviting Netanyahu to
form the next government, the President
spoke forcefully about peace and even
seemed to influence Bibi to mention
peace, a word he never used in his
election campaign. Peres has rightly
earned respect for this from many
quarters, but now, as the coalition is
being formed, it might be a good time to
examine one aspect of Israel’s political
culture: the lack of respect for the task of
a parliamentary opposition. Peres is at
least partly to blame for this, as he almost
always preferred to join various
administrations—even as a junior
partner—rather than lead the opposition,
ofen citing “our grave situation” and
“national responsibility.” Now is surely
a better time to criticize Peres than in
June, when the world (maybe even
including President Barack Obama) will
be coming here to celebrate his 90th
birthday. Then, surely, everyone will be
paying deserved tribute to the wisdom of
this elder statesman and prophet of peace,
and it would be a shame to spoil the

remembering that, in spite of Israel’s insistence from 1948 onward that we would
never ask others to do our fighting for us, even as Leon and I were meeting, US
radar operators were working around the clock to provide us with early warning
against any incoming Iranian missiles. Patriot batteries were ready to deploy in
Israel within 72 hours of any attack. AEGIS naval vessels were within 96 hours of
our shores, to reinforce Israel’s Arrow missile defense system with sea-launched
weapons.

Panetta made no secret of the fact he didn’t want us to launch a military strike,
effectively killing off the many months of intensive work the Americans had
devoted to building international political and economic pressure on the Iranians.
He urged me to “think twice, three times,” before going down that road. But he
recognized that Israel would be affected far more dramatically by a nuclear Iran.
“It’s your conflict. It’s your neighborhood,” he said. At one point, he asked me
outright: “If you do decide to attack the Iranian facilities, when will we know?” I
told him we couldn’t give him more than a few hours’ notice. Otherwise, the
Americans would have to alert their bases in the Gulf, and worldwide. That might
well put Iran on guard before our operation was launched. But I did recognize our
responsibility not to leave the Americans in the dark, not only because they were a
key ally but because their own military and naval personnel might be at risk from
any Iranian retaliation. “We know your command-post deployment and the
communications protocols with your forces,” I told him. “We’ll make sure you
have enough time to tell your people,” I said. “We won’t endanger a single
American life, any of your positions or your personnel.”

My most important meeting was with the President. Though I knew him less
well than I did Panetta, we had met on a number of occasions. The first time was
when he was still Senator Obama, on a visit to Israel during the 2008 presidential
campaign. As Defense Minister, I escorted him to Sderot, the town in southern
Israel bearing the brunt of Hamas rocket attacks from Gaza. Back in Jerusalem, we
spent a half-hour talking in my office: about Iran. I argued that a nuclear Iran was a
challenge not only for Israel and the Middle East, but for America, too. I urged
him, if elected, to commission an early study of what the Iranians were seeking to
do and what could be done to stop them either by diplomatic means or, if
necessary, by force. Also, what the Iranians could, or more relevantly could not, do
in response to an American or indeed an Israel attack, since our intelligence
assessments suggested their options for retaliation would be fairly limited. Obama

Hoffenberg began paying twenty-five thousand dollars per
month for Epstein’s expertise as a consultant.

The SEC had already looked into Hoffenberg’s affairs, set-
tling with him out of court in a matter relating to unregistered
securities. But Hoffenberg was dangling a very big prize.

In the 1980s, several major financial players were involved in

of the greenmailing of publicly traded companies. What green-
CH APTER 27 + mailing means, in practice, is that a brokerage house or group of
investors will start buying shares in companies that seem to be
vulnerable to takeover attempts. To ward off the attempts, exec-
utives at those companies will buy the shares back at a premium.

It’s risky, but very often the investors stand to make a handsome
profit.
_ Yet another thing Hoffenberg wanted was to take over Pan
American World Airways. The iconic airline had already entered
its downward trajectory, but it was still a giant.

Mr. Hoffman inquired about the late penalties and Mr. Gerry said they were based on a monthly penalty of 10% per month.  In response to Mr. Ochstein’s question, Mr. Gerry explained that both the business and the property owner were cited.  Mr. Fried inquired about service and Mr. Gerry said it was sent by certified mail.  Mr. Ballentine asked if any attempts, other than by mail, were made to get in touch with someone at the business.  Mr. Gerry said he went to the business, was told the owner was difficult to reach and left his business card but had not received any response.

		Violation of Chapter 46, Section 46-68 of the Town of Palm Beach Code of Ordinances, annual fire and life safety inspection fees not paid 



		Code Enforcement Officer Gerry presented the facts of the case and recommended a finding of non-compliance, administrative costs in the amount of $150.00 and payment of the fire inspection fee in addition to any late penalties and costs by July 21, 2008.  Mr. Gerry said he also tried to make contact with the owner of this business as it is the same owner as the other case at this location but was unable to make contact. Mr. Ochstein remarked this was the same business that had been before the Board before and had even “bounced a check” to the Town and wanted to know if there was something more that could be done other than the standard $150.00 costs.  Mr. Gerry said he could review the case further to see if it could be brought back for additional fines. Mr. Hoffman asked if these cases were brought to Code Enforcement by the Finance Department and Mr. Gerry said they came from the Fire Prevention Bureau who handles their own billing and explained the procedure for that.  Mr. Hoffman said it seemed like a year was a long time for these cases to be in arrears.  Mr. Gerry said the cases were coming over quicker now from Fire Prevention and he thought it would improve in the future.

		Violation of Chapter 46, Section 46-68 of the Town of Palm Beach Code of Ordinances, annual fire and life safety inspection fees not paid 



		Code Enforcement Officer Gerry presented the facts of the case and said he had spoken with Robin Gert who advised him the bill had been mishandled and gotten lost in their system.  He said he spoke to her yesterday and was told the payment was still in process.  The Town recommends a finding of non-compliance, administrative costs in the amount of $150.00 and payment of the fine inspection fee in addition to all late penalties and costs by August 4, 2008.

	G.	Case # 08-2516, 313 ½ Worth Ave., # B2, David Clark

          Violation of Chapter 114, Section 114-32 of the Town of Palm Beach Code of Ordinances, business tax receipt required

          

          Code Enforcement Officer Gerry presented the facts of the case and said Mr. Clark had submitted his paperwork and paid the fee but there was a zoning issue still in question.  The Zoning Administrator is out of the office this week on jury duty and based on the inability to get the issue resolved, the Town recommends the case be postponed until the August 21, 2008 hearing date.

          

          Mr. Fried questioned what the zoning issue had to do with a business tax receipt and Mr. Gerry said the Town records do not show this particular suite existing at this address but Mr. Clark has documents showing it there.

		

          

	

	

          Mr. Gerry said zoning is tied into business tax receipts because zoning requirements do not allow certain businesses in some districts.  There is also the question of whether the space is legitimate because people will subdivide suites and make two spaces where there should only be one.  Mr. Gerry said it looked like a legal space from the documentation Mr. Clark provided but the Zoning Administrator needed to approve it.

	H.	Case # 08-2517, 2270 E. Ibis Isle Road, Mark Remson Trust

		REPEAT Violation of Chapter 42, Section 42-86 of the Town of Palm Beach Code of Ordinances, Environment, properties to be maintained in a good condition.



		Code Enforcement Officer Weymer presented the facts of the case and said the violation was discovered from routine patrol in the area but shortly after the notice of repeat violation was sent out, a citizen complaint was received as well.  Mr. Weymer said there had been at least seven previous letters to this property owner regarding lack of maintenance on the property. A repeat notice of code violation was mailed out on June 24, 2008 with a mandatory hearing date.  The lot was cut on or around July 2, 2008.  This particular violation is a Class II violation under the fine schedule which calls for a fine of $400.00, however, by law, the Board has the ability to impose a fine of up to $500.00 because it is a repeat violation.  Mr. Weymer said he believes it is important to look at the track record of this property in considering the fine.  The Town recommends a finding of non-compliance, administrative costs in the amount of $150.00 and a fine of $500.00, which is the maximum fine for a repeat violation.



		Mr. Hoffman said it seemed that every time the property owner gets notified he comes into compliance but he has to be notified.  Mr. Weymer says there are times when he comes into compliance but on at least two other occasions, he has been before the Board because he has not complied by the time set.  Mr. Ochstein asked if he has been fined in the past and Mr. Weymer said there are two outstanding fines for which liens have been placed on the property.

	I.	Case # 08-2518, 230 Esplanade Way, Kenneth J. Horton

          	Violation of Chapter 42, Section 42-86 (19) of the Town of Palm Beach Code of Ordinances, cleared land must be re-sodded or replanted to prevent the creation of windblown dust or dirt and Chapter 42, Section 42-86, unsightly, unsafe or unsanitary conditions not permitted and properties to be maintained in good condition.

          

          Code Enforcement Officer Weymer presented the facts of the case and said the violation was discovered on routine patrol.  Mr. Weymer has been in contact with a property representative, Louis Pascerelli who said Mr. Horton had not been in Town to receive his mail. Mr. Weymer said Mr. Pascerelli had proposals from Hansen Landscape for the clean up and re-sod of the lot and a weekly maintenance contract to assure this does not happen again.  Tropical Irrigation has also been contacted to put in a new irrigation system.  The Town recommends a finding of non-compliance, administrative costs in the amount of $150.00 and the property owner given until August 18, 2008 to come into compliance. Mr. Fried said he believed a fine of some sort should be imposed.  Mr. Ballentine asked how long Mr. Horton had been out of compliance.  Mr. Weymer said the original warning was sent out on June 5, 2008 and a notice of violation and hearing was sent out on June 20, 2008.  Mr. Weymer said the first contact with him was July 7, 2008.  Mr. Ballentine asked if the August compliance date was reasonable and Mr. Weymer said Jim Hansen of Hansen Landscape thought it would be done before that date but he wanted more time in case he ran into any problems.

	J.	Case # 08-2519, 206 Dunbar Road, AMF Estate Management

          	Violation of Chapter 42, Section 42-230 of the Town of Palm Beach Code of Ordinances, leaf blower over 65dBA at 50 ft.

          

          Code Enforcement Officer Weymer presented the facts of the case and said he witnessed the violation on June 26, 2008.  AMF had previously been warned on February 19, 2008 for using a leaf blower over 65dBA.  Mr. Weymer performed a decibel test for this violation and the reading was 79.6 dBA at 50 feet. This is a class II violation under the fine schedule which has a $125.00 fine for the first offense.  The violation was issued on site to a superintendant for AMF and has not been paid.  The Town recommends a finding of non-compliance, administrative costs in the amount of $150.00 and payment of the $125.00 fine.

          

          Mr. Hoffman asked whether this company had participated in the leaf blower testing being offered by Code Enforcement.  Mr. Weymer said AMF had participated in the testing program and had several leaf blowers certified.  He said the truck he was out with had 2 other leaf blowers on the truck that he could identify as being over 65dBA but he only tested the one they were using and wrote a violation for that one.  Ms. Van Buren asked about the testing method and Mr. Weymer explained how it was done.

	K.	Case # 08-2520, 165 Brazilian Ave., Richard Lynn

          Violation of Chapter 10, Section 10-45 (i) of the Town of Palm Beach Code of Ordinances, if any dog attacks and causes severe injury or death to any human or domestic animal more than once, the owner shall be required to have said dog removed from the Town or humanely euthanized at his/her sole expense and violation of Chapter 10, Section 10-6 of the Code which prohibits animals from creating nuisances which are detrimental to the public safety and welfare.

          

          (Mr. Ochstein recused himself, stating that he has a relative who has a business relationship with Dr. Lynn and Mr. Hoffman advised Mr. Vanneck would be a voting member in this case) 

          

          	Sgt. Curtis Krauel said this case was brought to Code Enforcement through a culmination of events spanning back over a period of 4 years.  Sgt. Krauel explained Section 10-6 of the Code and said he was going to be showing some graphic photographs.  Sgt. Krauel presented the facts of each of the documented cases involving attacks by Duke from March 17, 2004 until May 11, 2008.

          

          Mr. Hoffman questioned how the Code Enforcement Board came into this procedure since the Town Council had already said Duke is a dangerous dog. Mr. Randolph explained that Town Council does not have the authority to fine.  Originally, the police department did not issue a code enforcement board citation but ordered the dog be removed from the Town or humanely euthanized which was appealed to Town Council.  Town Council denied the appeal. Since that time, Dr. Lynn has refused to comply with the order of the Town Council so a citation was issued by Code Enforcement to bring the matter before the Board to determine whether there should be a finding of violation and at a later time, whether a fine should be imposed. Mr. Randolph said it was now the jurisdiction of the Code Enforcement Board and not the Town Council.  Mr. Hoffman questioned whether or not the Board had to determine if the dog was going to be euthanized or removed from the Town and Mr. Randolph explained that this was not the Board’s determination.  The Board was only to determine whether or not there had been a violation of the Town Code.  



		Sgt. Krauel continued his presentations remarking that once Duke had been found “potentially dangerous” by Animal Care and Control, there had been another attack but due to an administrative error by Animal Care and Control by failing to document their records appropriately, Duke was classified as “potentially dangerous” again.  This is an error that Animal Care and Control completely acknowledges. 



		After the last attack on May 11, 2008, Duke was taken into custody by Animal Care and Control and after a hearing, was classified as “dangerous”.  Sgt. Krauel noted that the hearing before Special Magistrate Earl Mallory did not classify Duke as vicious because Duke had no documented cases of attacks on humans.  After this last case was reviewed by Code Enforcement, sufficient evidence was also found to classify Duke as dangerous and Dr. Lynn was notified by registered mail.  Dr. Lynn appealed to Town Council and that appeal was denied by Town Council by a 5-0 vote.  The Town recommends a finding of non-compliance with Chapter 10, Section 10-6 as the Town has the two required affidavits of residents of the Town occupying separate households.  The Board had been provided with copies of four (4) affidavits.  



		Sgt. Krauel then proceeded with an explanation of Chapter 10, Section 10-45 and said the Town was requesting a separate motion for a finding of non-compliance of Chapter 10, Section 10-45 (i) and that he be given until July 18, 2008 to come into compliance by either removing the dog from the Town or having it humanely euthanized.  If compliance is not achieved, the Town recommends a daily fine of $250.00 a day commence on July 19, 2008 and continue until compliance is achieved.  



		Mr. Randolph requested that the Board treat these two sections of the Code separate and apart.  He said the first evidence heard related to Section 10-6 (3) and involved the affidavits from the residents of the Town.  Because of the dispute Dr. Lynn’s attorney has with regard to the manner that Section 10-45 was applied, he recommended that the two Code sections not be mixed up.  Mr. Randolph said he would like for the Board to first consider whether there had been a violation of 10-6 and to make a motion one way or the other with regard to the Staff’s recommendation.  He then requested that Section 10-45 be entertained separately after Dr. Lynn’s attorney and anyone else who wanted to speak had an opportunity to do so.  



		Vivian Dorris, 155 Brazilian Ave. said her beagle/bassett, Charlie, was viciously attacked by Dr. Lynn’s dog, Duke and she has sustained approximately $8500 in vet’s bills.  She said her dog will never walk properly again because of severe nerve damage.  She does not feel there are enough precautions being taken for the safety of residents on Brazilian Ave.  She asked that the Board take this into consideration and thanked them for their service.



		Wayne Gerl, 149 Brazilian Ave. said he has two dogs and every time he exits his driveway or front yard, he has to stop and peek around and make sure the other dogs are not in the area.  He said he was bitten by Duke a couple of years ago.  He was talking with Dr. Lynn and the dog just reached out and bit him, tore his pants and broke the skin.  He said he had been friends with Dr. Lynn and Margrit for many years but it was just unsafe for anybody and any animals in the area. 



		Bobby Goodnough said he was jogging in the area and the dog lunged at him causing him to have to dive through a twelve (12) foot hedge to get away from it.   He said he just thought it was a matter of time before the dog got a person or a child. Sgt. Krauel asked if Mr. Goodnough had reported the incident to the police department or had a time frame for when it occurred.  Mr. Goodnough said he had not made a police report but it occurred about two (2) years ago. 



		Laura Klein, 130 Seaspray Ave., said she had lived here for 12 years, having moved here from Washington, D.C. for a sense of security.  She said she was now in the process of installing surveillance cameras.  She said she could no longer walk her dog without constantly looking around, worrying if Duke had once again escaped from the open gates.  She said it is a privilege to own a dog and dog ownership and responsibility should go hand in hand.  She said Dr. Lynn was issued a citation in August of 2002 for locking his dog in a car with the windows rolled up. She said she mentioned this to prove his irresponsibility.  She said his voluminous file from Animal Care and Control would attest to this.   She said no one was safe while Duke is in Palm Beach.  



		James Merola was present on behalf of Dr. Lynn and said he was present on a revised Notice of Code Violation and Hearing dated July 15, 2008.  He said he was not denying there were incidents with Duke.  Palm Beach County had the dog taken into custody and the hearing was held June 5, 2008.  At that hearing, it was agreed upon by the County and Dr. Lynn that the dog would be classified as dangerous.  The dog was classified as dangerous which required certain restrictions on the dog which Dr. Lynn complied with and the dog was returned to him.  In the event Duke has another incident, pursuant to state and county law, but some reason not Town law, the dog would be taken into custody and euthanized.  Mr. Merola said Dr. Lynn feels very badly about the situation and agreed with the County to do what they required.   Mr. Merola said Dr. Lynn then received a letter, dated June 16, 2008 from the police department, mentioning the order of the County and stating for the first time, the Town was declaring the dog dangerous and giving him ten (10) days to appeal, which he did not. On June 20, 2008, four (4) days after the dog was declared dangerous by the Town, the police department sent a second letter, citing 10-45 (i), advising that since the dog already had two incidents, they wanted it removed or euthanized.  The dog had not done anything since being declared dangerous.  This letter did not mention an appeal, but he sent a letter anyway, stating that they did not agree with that.  He said the dog was declared dangerous on the 16th, requirements were imposed and they complied with those, including the filing of a $1000 bond and they did not agree the dog should now be removed.  There was a Town Council hearing on August 8th and the Council said they needed to have the dog removed or euthanized.  Mr. Merola went into detail about the requirements of 10-45 and said Dr. Lynn had complied with all of those.  Then the letter of June 20th came, requiring Dr. Lynn to remove the dog or euthanize it.  Mr. Merola read subsection (h) into the record and said the Code Enforcement Board did not have any jurisdiction over subsection (i) as subsection (h) just mentioned (d) through (g).  The Town has filed a lawsuit and he and Mr. Randolph were before Judge Hoy this morning.  The Town is asking to have the dog removed or euthanized and asking for a permanent injunction, stating an emergency situation.  Judge Hoy gave them a hearing at 1:30 p.m. on Tuesday where it will be determined whether the dog is a nuisance, whether 10-45 (i) even applies to the situation and if the Board have authority over 10-45 (i).  If the Judge says the dog has to go, they are not going to argue with the Court but he believes they have a right to present their case.  He does not believe that the Town’s position that the fine should start tomorrow is correct.  He believes the Board can only find violations of subsections (d) through (g) of 10-45.  There have been no allegations that Dr. Lynn has violated subsections (d) through (g).  Mr. Merola believes it is clear that the Code Enforcement Board has no authority under (i). Mr. Merola then addressed 10-6 and said he believed that since all precautions have been taken under 10-45, the dog does not constitute a nuisance.  Mr. Merola said that he has an injunction relief request before the Judge to stop the Board from making this decision.  Mr. Merola said Mr. Randolph has asked them to determine these two (2) ordinances separately and he does not believe 10-45 (i) is in the Board’s purview, and as to the nuisance, the dog has to be a nuisance now and it is not.  This is all going to be determined Tuesday and he is asking the Board to either deny the Town’s recommendation because the Town cannot prove the dog is a nuisance now or reset this case until next month’s hearing.  



		Sgt. Krauel advised he wanted to make a rebuttal to some of Mr. Merola’s comments. The service of notice Mr. Merola referred to in declaring the dog dangerous was when the police department spoke with Dr. Lynn on June 12, 2008 and had been told Duke was being housed at a kennel in Palm Beach County.  A notice could not be served to Dr. Lynn to have him come into compliance with something he was already in compliance with.  The dog was not in the Town.  The police department did not find out the dog was in Town until June 20th when Laura Klein reported the dog attempted to break free of Dr. Lynn to attack her and this is when the letter was sent out requesting compliance with Section 10-45.  Dr. Lynn was given the entire ordinance on June 10th, not just sections or specific acts that he needed to comply with.  Duke was not on the property at that time and no notification to remove the dog from the property could be served at that time because the dog was not there.  As far as the police department was concerned, Dr. Lynn was in compliance with the ordinance.  Sgt. Krauel pointed out that the Town does not abide by the state and the county ordinances, that the Town has the ability to enforce more stringent and strict ordinances and that is what we have done here.  



		Sgt. Krauel said he was prepared, based on Counsel’s recommendation, to recommend a motion to find Dr. Lynn in non-compliance with Section 10-6 and move to postpone 10-45 (i) until after further consideration by the Circuit Court on Tuesday.  The Town recommends administrative costs in the amount of $150.00 and a fine of $250.00 a day to start on June 19, 2008 if compliance is not achieved by tomorrow.  



		Mr. Ballentine asked for clarification on the motion and was advised by Mr. Randolph that it would be a finding of non-compliance of Chapter 10, Section 10-6, administrative costs of $150.00 and a compliance date of July 18, 2008 with a fine to be considered at the next meeting if compliance was not achieved.



		Ms. Duemler said she believed that the dog, besides being a nuisance, is a threat to society and she hoped that by Tuesday the dog did not break loose from Dr. Lynn and maul some child, that she believed it is a disgrace and she supports the Town.

		MOTION BY MR. FRIED TO FIND DR. LYNN IN VIOLATION OF CHAPTER 10, SECTION 10-6,  ASSESS ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN THE AMOUNT OF $150.00 AND REQUIRE HIM TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE BY JULY 18, 2008

		MOTION SECONDED BY MR. BALLENTINE

		MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY



		

		Mr. Randolph asked if a motion could be made to defer the consideration of violation of Chapter 10, Section 10-45 (i) until the August 21, 2008 meeting and Ms. Greenberg advised she would make that motion.  Mr. Fried asked Mr. Randolph if he would explain the reason for this.  Mr. Randolph said the argument had been made that 10-45 should not apply because the dog has already been deemed dangerous by the County and pursuant to the Town’s Code.  Mr. Randolph said he believed the argument was going to be made in court on Tuesday that it is not appropriate for the Town to move forward with regard to 10-45 (i) because that only applies to any incident that occurs after the dog has been declared dangerous.  The argument has been made that Dr. Lynn has done everything he is required to do.  Mr. Randolph said he hesitated to explain further if the matter was going to be deferred.  Mr. Randolph said the position of Staff is that item (i) stands on its own merits, that it is not connected to 10-45 (a) through (h).  It is also the position of Staff that it is appropriate to bring a violation of (i) to the Code Enforcement Board even though it does not specifically state that in 10-45 because Section 2-439, which is the citation fine schedule, sets forth all of the sections of the Code of Ordinances which can be brought before the Code Enforcement Board and 10-45 is listed.  Code Enforcement has the right to bring a violation directly to the Code Enforcement Board instead of issuing the fine set forth in the fine schedule. Mr. Randolph said the Board could move forward in considering 10-45 instead of deferring it to the next meeting. 



		Mr. Fried commented that based on the egregious nature of what they had been presented with, he believed the Board should do everything they could to put pressure on Dr. Lynn to comply.  Mr. Randolph questioned whether the Town would be requesting a separate fine of $250.00 a day for non-compliance and Sgt. Krauel said that was his recommendation, that there would be two concurrent fines running.  Mr. Hoffman asked about the administrative costs and Sgt. Krauel said the Town was only asking for one.

		SECONDED BY MS. GREENBERG

		MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY



		Mr. Merola questioned what the order was with regard to 10-6, if it was to have the dog removed or euthanized by Friday or just to abate the nuisance.  He said he needed to know what to tell Dr. Lynn what had to be done by Friday to avoid the potential fine.  Mr. Hoffman said Dr. Lynn needed to either remove the dog or have it euthanized and Mr. Fried said that was his intention in making the motion. 









VI.	Old Business:



	A.	Case # 08-2484, 515 N. County Road, Trump Properties, LLC	

		Violation of Chapter 18, Section 18-205 of the Town of Palm Beach Code of Ordinances, the Architectural Commission may attach conditions to any approval it grants.



		Lead Code Enforcement Officer Walton advised this case would be heard at Town Council on August 11, 2008 and requested this case be postponed until the August 21, 2008 hearing date.  Mr. Trump’s attorney and the attorney for the new purchaser were both present.  



		Robert Brody said he was the attorney for County Road Property LLC, who had just purchased the property two days ago.  He said it was the intent of his client to comply with the Town and also to work with the Town.  There is an appeal pending and Mr. Brody said it was his client’s intent to work everything out with ARCOM prior to that appeal. He said he had recommended to his client that he withdraw the appeal. Mr. Brody said his client had hired the Lawrence Group and Gene Lawrence planned to work with ARCOM.  



		







		MOTION BY MS. DUEMLER TO POSTPONE THE CASE UNTIL THE AUGUST 21, 2008 MEETING

		SECONDED BY MS. VAN BUREN

		MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY



		

VII.	Fine Consideration:	

	

	

	A.	Case # 08-2432, Beachfront Vista Property, Nightingale Beach Club Association

		Violation of Chapter 134, Section 134-1472 (3) of the Town of Palm Beach Code of Ordinances, no additional walls, fences, hedges or other structures or growth shall be erected or be grown eastwardly of Ocean Boulevard to a height greater than four (4) feet above the surface of the Ocean Boulevard.



          (Ms. Duemler recused herself as part of a previously declared conflict and Mr. Hoffman advised Mr. Vanneck would be a voting member in this case) 



          Lead Code Enforcement Officer Walton said Nightingale Beach Club had previously been found in violation and were given time to obtain a permit.  A permit had been obtained but there were some conditions attached to it.  There have been two (2) inspections with the Florida Wildlife Commission and an agreement was reached to not require the vegetation to be trimmed until after turtle season.  Since they have already been found in non-compliance, the Town recommends the time fro compliance be extended to November 7, 2008 and if compliance is not achieved by that date, a fine of $250.00 a day be imposed.  

          

          Jack Maxey, 244 Nightingale Trail, presented some documents to the Board and advised he was president of the Nightingale Trail Beach Club Association.  He said one of the documents was his application under duress for the permit.  Mr. Maxey advised he had not been sworn in and was administered the oath of office by Recording Secretary Houston.  

          

          Mr. Maxey said he has had a long correspondence with the legal department of the Department of Environmental Protection and he believes on an emotional level, they do not believe the trees should come down but they told him they could not find any statutory way to force the Town not to enforce the permit.  They told him it should be the jurisdiction of a court, not the DEP. Mr. Maxey said the Town was cutting down its own sea grapes in violation of the permitting process. Mr. Maxey said he had all kinds of burdens in this permit that he needed to comply with, one of which was replacement of the whole plant if anything over 6 feet which was larger than 3 inches in diameter was cut down.  He said he was supposed to provide a signature on the document putting himself at risk of a $10,000 a day fine if he did not comply with the requirements of the permit. Mr. Maxey said Jean Higgins, a biologist for the State Fish & Wildlife, recommended sea grapes should not be trimmed because they are the best source of protection against the lighting.  Ms. Higgins made some suggestions such as changing light fixtures and extinguishing lights during turtle season and maintaining a substantial healthy vegetation light blocking buffer.  

          

          Mr. Maxey said an approximate 24 inch piece of aluminum is hanging from the light on Nightingale Trail and it seemed highly unusual that a shield of that nature would only be necessary on that light when the recommendations given by Fish & Wildlife are recommendations with broad reaching impact for the entire island.  He noted that the street lights in Palm Beach do not go off during turtle nesting season.  He said a field permit for trimming of the sea grapes at the Nightingale Beach Club Association was not recommended during the nesting season.  He said the indifference to materials he had brought forth more than a year ago that had now been brought forth officially by the DEP were offensive to him and that is one of the reasons he had continued to “hammer” this.   He said he believed the Board should recommend to the Town Council that they remove that section of the Code, given the current environmental regime, especially when one considers the public relations downside of fighting him on this issue and spending $2,000,000 to fight Lake Worth on the other side.  Mr. Maxey said this was probably not a win-win situation and that NOAA had not even been brought into the fold yet.  

          

          Mr. Ochstein wanted to know if the Board was precluded from enforcing the ordinance now.  Mr. Walton said it should not be enforced now, that in speaking with Mr. Wettstein from DEP and Ms. Higgins from FWC, an agreement had been reached to wait until the end of turtle season to require the trimming.  The Town recommends granting the Nightingale Beach Club until November 7, 2008 to come into compliance.  The permit is good until that date. In response to Mr. Hoffman’s question, Mr. Walton said the permit was issued on June 16, 2008.  Mr. Maxey said he applied on March 19, 2008.  Mr. Balletine inquired as to whether seven (7) days was sufficient for compliance after the end of turtle season and Mr. Walton said it was not a large area and he believed it was. Mr. Maxey said he did not believe it was sufficient, that it would be an economic hardship if he had to replace every tree that is over 3 inches in diameter in order to get it below 6 feet and he brought up other issues involved with the trimming.  Mr. Balletine told Mr. Maxey he just wanted to know whether he could comply in a 7 day period without going into a lot of detail.  Mr. Maxey said that before he could remove any native plant, he had to first remove every single non-native one from the property and he had some questions whether or not he could comply within the time period.  He also said he had some real questions about whether the law, both at the State and the local level had been equally applied within the Town. Mr. Maxey said he is in consultation with an attorney to find out what measures he can take.  The Town did not apply for a permit to cut its own sea grapes and judging from the guidelines he has in his permit, the Town would be in violation of almost everyone of those guidelines.  The DEP counsel’s office asked him to provide photographs of the Town’s illegal cutting back in February.  

          

          Mr. Vanneck said there should be more research as to what should and should not be cut.  He believes the Town code may have gone too far.  

          

          Mr. Hoffman said the Board did not have the authority to modify the Code and could only enforce the Codes as they had been written.

          

          MOTION BY MR. OCHSTEIN TO GRANT THE VIOLATOR UNTIL NOVEMBER 7, 2008 TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE AND IF COMPLIANCE IS NOT ACHIEVED BY THAT DATE, TO ASSESS A FINE IN THE AMOUNT OF $250.00 A DAY UNTIL COMPLIANCE IS ACHIEVED

          SECONDED BY MR. BALLENTINE

          

          Mr. Vanneck asked for clarification on what the motion was and Mr. Walton advised the motion was that the sea grapes must be cut after turtle season by November 7, 2008 and if they were not cut by that date, a $250.00 a day fine would commence on November 8, 2008 and continue until compliance is achieved.

          

          Mr. Fried asked who the fine would apply to and Mr. Walton said it would be to the Nightingale Trail Beach Club Association.  Mr. Fried asked if it was a legally constituted body and Mr. Maxey said it was an informal body, that on the deeds, everyone owns this piece of property in common.  There was some additional discussion on the ordinance.  Ms. Van Buren asked if every single property owner on the street was a member of the association and Mr. Maxey said every property owner on Nightingale was and there were one or two houses on North Ocean and North Lake as well.  Mr. Maxey said there were 23 separate memberships.  Ms. Van Buren asked about the finances and Mr. Maxey said there were annual dues of $75.00 a year and a common bank account of $3500 or $3600.  Mr. Maxey said that if a fine was incurred, that is probably where it would come from but he did not believe, because of his fiduciary responsibility to the group, he could fight the decision with any of those monies.  Mr. Ochstein asked if he was an elected officer and Mr. Maxey said he was president and that he keeps the books and makes sure the place is in good condition.

          

          MOTION BY MR. OCHSTEIN TO GRANT THE VIOLATOR UNTIL NOVEMBER 7, 2008 TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE AND IF COMPLIANCE IS NOT ACHIEVED BY THAT DATE, TO ASSESS A FINE IN THE AMOUNT OF $250.00 A DAY UNTIL COMPLIANCE IS ACHIEVED

          Mr. Fried advised Mr. Maxey that the Code Enforcement Board’s position was to enforce the Code and said that he had always found the Town Council members to be very receptive, individually and as a group.  Mr. Fried said it was not beyond the Town Council’s power and authority, if persuaded, to look into an ordinance and suggested Mr. Maxey address it with them.  

          

          

          

          

	B.	Case # 08-2508, 227 Brazilian Ave., 2F, Hillen J. Smith

          Violation of Chapter 18, Section 18-241 of the Town of Palm Beach Code of Ordinances, building permits required to construct, install, repair or alter any building or building system

          

          Lead Code Enforcement Officer said Mr. Smith was found in violation, assessed $150.00 in administrative costs and given until July 16, 2008 to come into compliance.  Compliance has not been achieved so this is the time a fine would be assessed.  Mr. Walton said the contractor was present to speak.  

          

          Steve Pappanelli said he was hired by Mr. Smith after Mr. Smith had been cited and he was 90% complete with the job.  He was just waiting on his final inspections and he should have it by next week but the building is closed to all construction inspections for two (2) weeks. Mr. Pappanelli said he was present on Mr. Smith’s behalf to request a three (3) week extension.   Mr. Walton said the Town did not oppose the extension of time.  Mr. Walton said the three weeks was necessary because the building would not let inspections be done while their maintenance man was on vacation.  Mr. Walton said if compliance was not achieved by August 7, 2008 then he would ask for a $250.00 a day fine to commence on August 8, 2008.  

          

          Ms. Greenberg asked some questions about the type of permits and remarked that it is unfortunate in multi-family dwellings that this type of situation would exist to begin with because electrical and plumbing can have catastrophic effects on other owners.  She said it is unfortunate the people do not do the right thing until they get caught.  Mr. Pappanelli said he was not the contractor working without permits.  

          

          

          MOTION BY MR. OCHSTEIN TO GRANT AN EXTENSION OF TIME UNTIL AUGUST 8, 2008 TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE AND TO ASSESS A FINE OF $250.00, RETROACTIVE TO JULY 17, 2008 IF COMPLIANCE WAS NOT ACHIEVED

		SECONDED BY MS. GREENBERG



		During discussion on the motion, Ms. Duemler stated she believed the retroactive fine was a little harsh.  Mr. Ballentine said he agreed and asked what the reason for the retroactive fine was.  Mr. Ochstein said there are so many people who do work without a permit and they know they need a permit.  That is a very dangerous thing in a multi-family dwelling and it should be egregious.  



          MOTION BY MR. OCHSTEIN TO GRANT AN EXTENSION OF TIME UNTIL AUGUST 8, 2008 TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE AND TO ASSESS A FINE OF $250.00, RETROACTIVE TO JULY 17, 2008 IF COMPLIANCE WAS NOT ACHIEVED

VIII.	Fine Reduction:



	

     A.  Case # 08-2301, 167 E. Inlet Drive, The Landfall Group, 

          Violation of Chapter 18, Section 18-242, Subsection 104.5.1.6, medium projects, all new or remodel construction projects 4000 sq. ft, to 8,999 sq. ft. under roof be allowed 22 months

          

          

          Lead Code Enforcement Officer Walton said in October, 2007, Ajax Equity LLC was found in violation of going over the construction time limits.  On November 15, 2008 they still were not in compliance and a daily fine of $250.00 started running. The final inspection was obtained in March, 2008.  The fine ran for 137 days prior to compliance being achieved and the accumulated fine due is $34, 250.00 and the have $150.00 hearing costs have not been paid.  

          

          Frank Lynch advised he was the attorney for both The Landfall Group and

          Ajax.  He said when they appeared before the Board in October, Lazslo Wagner, the principal of The Landfall Group, who has built homes throughout the Town of Palm Beach for 26 years acknowledged that he was unaware of this particular Code provision.  Had he been, they would have applied for an extension of time to complete the construction.  At the hearing, Mr. Koeppel made a motion to allow them an additional sixty (60) days to complete the construction, find them in non-compliance and assess the $150 fee.  After a significant amount of discussion, that motion went to a vote and failed 4-3.  A second motion was made and Ms. Duemler thought the $250.00 fee was significant and she believed the fine should be $125.00 a day.  Mr. Lynch gave Mr. Walton a copy of that transcript to put in the record.  As part of their request, they are asking the Board to consider what Ms. Duemler suggested at the meeting. At the same time, Mr. Lynch said he would like them to consider that The Landfall Group is a good corporate citizen and made a legitimate mistake.  As a result, a fine was incurred and they are willing to accept some level of fine, some level of responsibility for what they did.  The construction was continually on going, there were no delays other than the construction process itself.  This was not someone’s house, it was a speculative venture.  There had been some concerns with the shell contractor and the finish items themselves were significant enough that there were substantial delays.  At that same hearing, Code Enforcement Officer Gerry said it was the position of Code Enforcement to get more assertive at the suggestion of Town Council and that these projects were to be more aggressively pursued.  Under the new ordinance, for a house of approximately 5,000 sq. feet, they would be entitled to 24 months.  This would have brought them to November 2007 and they would have gotten additional time for Hurricane Wilma which would have brought them to December.  If they were under the new Code, they would not be before the Board today and may not have a fine at all.  He realizes a mistake was made, he realizes something has to be paid but he thinks $35,000 is a significant fine.  The Board has gotten their attention and they would ask for a significant reduction in the fine.

          

          Mr. Fried asked how long it took to get the final inspection after the 22 months had run.  Mr. Walton said they had been given 23 months due to the hurricanes and they were 5 months and 9 days beyond that.  Mr. Ballentine asked how far out they would be under the new rules.  Mr. Walton said they would be given 24 months which with the hurricane would be 25 months.  Mr. Lynch said that at the end of that 24 month period, if they had not sought an extension of time prior to that within the required time period, no earlier than 6 months and no later than 45 days, before the expiration of that 24 months, their project would have been shut down.  Mr. Wagner’s lack of knowledge of this particular situation would have become irrelevant because they would have been red tagged on that next day after the 24 month period.  Mr. Lynch said Mr. Wagner did not know because he has been a good corporate citizen, he had never been before the Board except on one occasion and that was beyond his control, it was a maintenance item on the Glazer house.  Mr. Walton said that situation was not due to Mr. Wagner’s fault, that he was just representing the owner.  

          

          Mr. Ballentine asked how Mr. Wagner did not know the Code requirement if he had built so many homes in the area and he said he had difficulty with the ignorance of that.  

          

          Mr. Fried said he agreed with Mr. Ballentine and he found it hard to believe that Mr. Wagner did not know the time limits. He said some reduction should be considered but he was not sure on what basis.  

          

          Mr. Ochstein remarked that the fine was around $35,000 and the house was on the market for $10.6 million dollars so he did not see the hardship.  Mr. Lynch said he did not know the price but he would accept Mr. Ochstein’s statement on that.  Mr. Lynch said the hardship was in the imposition of the fine itself, there were mistakes made and he believed that Council would have given them a significant extension of time if Mr. Wagner had been aware of the situation and filed the proper notice with Town Council.  

          

          Mr. Lynch said if some sort of arrangement could be reached today, his client would be in a position to pay within the next two weeks.  Mr. Hoffman said he was concerned because he believed that when the case was originally heard, they had the option of fining $250.00 a day and they gave them a fine reduction at the time they initiated the fine of $125.00 a day.  Mr. Walton corrected Mr. Hoffman, advising that there was a motion for a fine of $125.00 a day which failed and the fine that is in effect is $250.00 a day.  Mr. Lynch said he believed the record reflects something different than that.  Mr. Walton said his records reflect $250.00 a day but he would review it.  Mr. Walton reviewed the transcript and noted that it showed $125.00 a day but the Board order specified $250.00 a day and he would have to do further research.  

          Mr. Fried advised he could make a motion to postpone the matter to the next meeting and have Mr. Walton bring back the correct information.  There was additional discussion about the amount of the fine and Mr. Lynch said he was seeking a reduction of the $17,125.00 which would be the amount of the fine if it was $125.00 a day.  Mr. Hoffman said he would find that hard to accept.  Mr. Hoffman read from the minutes that a motion was made by Mr. Fried that the defendant was found in non-compliance, ordered to pay an administrative fee in the amount of $150.00, obtain a final building inspection by October 25, 2008 and a fine of $125.00 to commence on October 26, 2007.  He said that motion passed 4-3.  Mr. Walton said he could not dispute that but he would have to do some research.  Mr. Hoffman said he would not be in favor of reducing the $17, 125.00 any further.

IX.	Comments:



     Ms. Greenberg said that the presentation using the “slides” made it too dark in the room.  She wanted to know if there was anything they could do as a Board in making a suggestion to the Council about an ordinance that could address people not pulling permits because of the safety issues in terms of multi-family dwellings.  Capt. Blouin said there was a provision in place.  If work is done without a permit, there is a penalty involved.  There was an ordinance drafted last year that requires them to pay four times the permit fee.  

     

     Mr. Fried asked Mr. Randolph if he had spoken to Mr. Elwell about the foreclosure action being brought to the Board’s area of responsibility as opposed to the Town Council. Mr. Randolph said he had but did not have an answer yet and would try to get one.  Mr. Fried asked Ms. Houston about progress on the fines and she said the Town was now inputting fines into the computer system and if someone had outstanding fines they could not get any permits. People are contacting Code Enforcement because they cannot get permits and are either paying or asking to come back to the Board for a fine reduction.  

     

     Capt. Blouin advised that with regard to any foreclosure action, the police department is scrutinizing each and every one of them as some of these cases we have liens on were pre-existing prior to coming to the police department.  We do not want to bring a case to the board that can be handled in a different manner.  

     

     Mr. Walton remarked that it was a good thing that there are a number of working without permit cases being brought to the Board, that it means Staff is doing their job.



X.	Adjournment:

     

     The meeting was adjourned without benefit of a motion.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012843.txt,"Subjects in an experiment first listened to people reading trivia, such as “A giraffe can go without
water longer than a camel can,” and then judged whether the sentence was true or false. If the sentence
was read in a foreign accent, subjects were more likely to say that it was false than if it was read in the
native accent. Subjects voiced this opinion even though the experimenter told them that the reader was
not expressing an opinion, but merely reading the passage as instructed. In a second experiment, British
subjects listening to a non-guilty plea by a person on trial were more likely to judge the person as guilty if
he committed a blue collar crime and spoke with a non-standard British accent (e.g., Australian). In
contrast, they were more likely to judge a white collar criminal as guilty if he spoke with a standard
British accent. Even within the class of British accents, biases emerged: subjects from the Worcester
region were more likely to judge supposed criminals as guilty if they spoke with a Birmingham accent
than with a Worcester accent. Together, these studies paint a bleak picture: accents from an out-group are
perceived as less truthful than others, and in the context of a criminal case, more guilty as well.

Accents are learned early in life, and once in place, are both clear markers of your origins and
difficult to undue. As such, they are honest indicators of at least one dimension of group membership.
What about dimensions that can readily be acquired at any point in life, and just as easily dropped? How
do these influence not only our perception of those who share these dimensions in common, but how we
treat them? In the last chapter I discussed a study by Tania Singer in which both men and women showed
more pain empathy — as revealed by activation in the insula region of the brain — when they watched a
cooperator experiencing pain. Further, men showed a reduction of activity in this area when a cheater
experienced pain, and increased activity in a reward area— the nucleus accumbens. This pattern fits well
with the research on human and nonhuman animals showing that winning, and watching winners win,
triggers a choreographed ballet of physiological responses associated with reward. Singer took this work
further, asking whether an individual’s support for a sport’s team might similarly modulate both the
feeling of pain empathy as well as reward. Subjects, all soccer fanatics, sat in a scanner and watched as a
player from their favorite team or a rival experienced pain. Next, Singer provided subjects with three
options for interacting with these players: help them by personally taking on some of the pain they would
receive, letting them take on all the pain but watch a video as distraction, or let them take on all the pain
and watch as it happens. Option one is costly altruism, two is blissful ignorance, and three is
schadenfreude.

In parallel with the earlier work on fairness, here too Singer observed greater pain empathy when
the favorite team player experienced pain than when the rival experienced pain. She also observed that
subjects were more likely to help favorite team players by taking on some of their pain, but more likely to
watch rivals receive pain. The higher the activation level in the insula, the more they took on their

favorite team player’s pain session — the more they helped. When they watched rivals experience pain,

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031265.txt,"° In an incident that occurred in fall of 2007 while you were a physics professor at Case Western Reserve
University, a student tried to talk to you about her plans after graduation. You mentioned to her how tough it
must be to have all the other physics majors asking her out on dates.

° In a second incident in December of 2007, while you were still at Case Western, the same student
visited your office to interview you for a student science journal. You closed the door behind her, and ignored
the questions she had prepared. Then you made a casual comment about taking her out for dinner.

° Later, in a regular column for the school paper, she described her experiences with you, without
mentioning you by name. “There was even one particular creep of a professor who once told me he thought
differently of me compared to other students and asked me to dinner: a situation so disturbing that it left me
upset for weeks afterward,” she wrote.

° She was then approached by a dean at the university, who suspected that she was referring to you,
based on a previously reported incident with another student. He encouraged her to make a complaint, and
she did.

° University investigators interviewed both you and the student.

° On September 4, 2008, Susan Nickel-Schindewolf, the university’s associate vice president for student
affairs, wrote to the student, telling her that the investigation was complete. She wrote that you had been told:
“This type of behavior could constitute sexual harassment in violation of the university’s sexual harassment
policy.”

° The letter also stated that you were prohibited from making contact with the student as long as she
remained at Case.

° The letter also stated that you are required to get approval from the dean or the chair of the physics
department before setting foot on the campus again.

° The letter also stated, “Dr. Krauss expressed regret about having a negative impact on you, and also
his willingness to use this complaint as an opportunity to reflect and improve on his future interactions with
students.”

° By then, you had already left Case, taking up your current position at Arizona State University the
month before.

° “The opportunities being offered at ASU are simply too great to turn down at this stage in my career,”
you told Case colleagues, in an email announcing your departure on April 16, 2008.

Incident 3:

° A former Case Western physics department administrator confirmed that she had reported a previous
incident involving a student who had confided in her about your inappropriate behavior towards her.

Incident 4:

° You met a student from another university, an atheist activist, in March 2008 at the American Atheists
Convention in Minneapolis. She wanted to expand the atheist group she ran at the midwestern university she
was attending, and hoped to convince you to come and speak. You initially seemed enthusiastic.

° During the convention, attendees including you and Richard Dawkins went for dinner with the student
and volunteers for Dawkins’ foundation.

° Afterwards, the student invited you to join the volunteers for a drink.

° You asked her to come get you in your hotel room. She was wary of your intentions, and so brought a
male friend with her. Opening the door to find them both there, you informed her you had decided not to go.
° You met this student again at the American Atheists Convention in Des Moines, lowa, in April 2011.

° You pulled over a chair for her in the bar, and then started running your hand up her leg under the
table.

° She tried to shift her body away from you, and you persisted in putting your hand on her leg. She

crossed her legs, and you kept trying. Then she turned her entire body away.

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031271.txt,"Re item 2: the student in question was interested in science communication, and on dozens of occasions came
to me, asked me to talk over coffee, or wrote to me with questions. When she asked about advice for after
graduation I DID tell her she was different than the other students in her year. The rest of them were interested
in going on to graduate school in physics, but she was interested in science communication so IJ told her that she
might want to take a different path. Since she was the only woman in her year, as I recall, I did ask her on one
of these occasions if that made it difficult for her in any way. I asked, because as a faculty member and
department chair I was interested in knowing what we could do, if necessary to encourage more women to go
into physics, and also because as someone she had asked for career advice from I wanted to know if that made a
difference to her. Re asking her for dinner.. I have gone back over emails from that period. I have numerous
requests from her asking me to go for coffee to talk, which I usually had to turn down because I was busy, and
on several occasions she asked me to have coffee with her off campus to talk, and I politely declined. I did let
her accompany me off campus one time to watch me do a BBC interview because she specifically requested it,
and I believe she found it useful. I did and do have coffee and meals with students on campus, and I see
nothing wrong with this. I try to treat students as respected colleagues if possible. I was shocked when I later
learned of the complaint she was apparently asked to lodge to the University, not least because there was no
inappropriate interaction but also because, well after the dates you listed on which she was apparently offended,
she continued to email me with joking questions or comments. Also, at a later AAAS conference, again in
2008, for which she had asked, and for which I had written her a letter of recommendation to attend, my wife
and I gave her a lift in our taxi well out out of our way in order to drop her off at her hotel, and I note in an
email response to her email about the conference, again in 2008, I expressed that I would pass her regards along
to my wife and vice versa. When the University later informed me of the complaint I was shocked and
concerned. When I spoke to the human resources person, including relating my concerns and explaining the
situation, I was told that no formal complaint of sexual harassment was requested. By that time I learned of the
complaint I had already announced my intentions to leave Case to accept an offer at ASU—a very difficult
decision for me because of my long-standing attachment to the University, the excellent relations I had with my
colleagues there— both among the faculty (many of whom in physics I had hired while department chair)) and
among the administration, along with a very attractive counter-offer by Case. Because I was already in Arizona
at the later time I was asked not to have any further interaction with the student I agreed to that request, both to
respect her sensitivities and also because it was basically moot because I was not on campus. Following this
episode, as indicated in the letter to the student, I did assess what might have led to misinterpretations by this
student, and became more careful in offering advice when talking to students. I was also told by human
resources that because it was decided to handle this informally and not formally, that (a) it should remain
confidential, which I, at least abided by, and (b) if no further complaints were lodged in that case, that the
University would preserve its confidentiality and remove the complaint from my record after 5 years, which
makes me surprised and concerned that someone violated that written agreement with you.

Re item 6: You report on ASU’s response to item #6 , without including the fact that the University specifically
stated there were never any allegations of sexual misconduct or harassment by me at the University, and
moreover that the ‘outside complaints’ were in fact related specifically to your item #6. Further you neglect to
mention that this complaint was by an anonymous third party, not the individual who was allegedly harassed,
who never lodged a complaint, and that no specific evidence was provided of the alleged transgression. I was
surprised and dismayed that both ASU and ANU launched investigations on the basis of this but was told by
both Universities that because of my high profile even such unsubstantiated third party complaints at private
events unrelated to the University would be investigated. The complaint was investigated by both ASU and
ANU and both came to the conclusion that it was not credible and no university policies had been violated. In
addition ANU’s investigation, which took a full month, found various inconsistencies in the allegation, which
suggest distortion and fabrication, I will quote from the ANU report. The initial complaint, which in fact
resulted in a temporary suspension of my position at ANU until it was dismissed, outlined the claim you made
in the words you quoted in your note to me, but it also stated

It is the University’s understanding that a complaint was lodged directly to the conference organisers at the
time of the incident.”

Issues of culture and brain chemistry came together in several accounts about

Over these years | collected many nauseating, upper and lower bowel

angular geometries of visual pattern-generating DMT, the animistic breathing of
bush and flower breathing peyote cactus, the darkly forbidding shadows of the
psylocybin-containing mushrooms, the irreversible rocket launches into the
electrically buzzing, kaleidoscopic circus of LSD-containing vials from Sandoz and
the optimistic, trust engendering, expansively warm rush of six of Sacha Shulgin’s

who believe in the underpinnings of the Judeo-Christian West, I don’t believe that we
should have a bailout. I think the bailouts in 2008 were wrong. And I think, you look in
hindsight, it was a lot of misinformation that was presented about the bailouts of the
banks in the West.

And look at the [unintelligible] it. Middle-class taxpayers, people that are working-class
people, right, people making incomes under $50,000 and $60,000, it was the burden of
those taxpayers, right, that bailed out the elites. And let’s think about it for a second.
Here’s how capitalism metastasized, is that all the burdens put on the working-class
people who get none of the upside. All of the upside goes to the crony capitalists.

The bailouts were absolutely outrageous, and here’s why: It bailed out a group of
shareholders and executives who were specifically accountable. The shareholders were
accountable for one simple reason: They allowed this to go wrong without changing
management. And the management team of this. And we know this now from
congressional investigations, we know it from independent investigations, this is not
some secret conspiracy. This is kind of in plain sight.

In fact, one of the committees in Congress said to the Justice Department 35 executives, I
believe, that they should have criminal indictments against — not one of those has ever
been followed up on. Because even with the Democrats, right, in power, there’s a sense
between the law firms, and the accounting firms, and the investment banks, and their
stooges on Capitol Hill, they looked the other way.

So you can understand why middle class people having a tough go of it making $50 or
$60 thousand a year and see their taxes go up, and they see that their taxes are going to
pay for government sponsored bailouts, what you’ve created is really a free option. You
say to this investment banking, create a free option for bad behavior. In otherwise all the
upside goes to the hedge funds and the investment bank, and to the crony capitalist with
stock increases and bonus increases. And their downside is limited, because middle class
people are going to come and bail them out with tax dollars.

And that’s what I think is fueling this populist revolt. Whether that revolt is in the
midlands of England, or whether it’s in Middle America. And I think people are fed up
with it.

Across the globe, in Eastern and Western cultures, clinicians have reported a consistent pattern of
psychotic delusion, typically associated with schizophrenia: many believe that they are God, God’s
messenger, or the Devil, equipped with extraordinary, invincible powers. This is the same disorder that
led the Australian gentleman we encountered at the start of this chapter to believe that he had two heads
and heard the voices of Jesus and Abraham. Estimates reveal a greater number of cases among Catholic
than Islamic or Protestant societies, and the fewest among Hindu societies, although experts are uncertain
as to why such particular biases exist. The interesting point 1s that there are individual differences in the
expression of religious delusions that are at least partially mediated by the particular beliefs and customs
of the religion. Religious delusions are also held with greater conviction than other delusions, more
resistant to change, and often result in self-mutilation or harming others; when harm occurs, it follows
the narrative from a religious text, plucking out eyes or cutting off genitals as the means to cleansing
sins.

What makes religious delusions like these, in which the individual has created a narrative of
supreme confidence and power, different from non-delusional, non-psychotic forms of distortion? In a
Gallup poll, 10% of the Americans surveyed claimed they had spoken with the devil. In several
psychological experiments, healthy non-psychotic subjects consistently report that they are smarter than
most, more attractive, and more likely to win than lose an athletic competition. Though some of these
people are correct — they are in fact smarter, more attractive, and better competitors — most are wrong
and yet believe they are right. What this research reveals is that we all suffer, some more than others,
from positive illusions — biases that distort our sense of confidence, control, and invincibility These
illusions differ from delusions in that they are less fixed, more flexible, and more amenable to change.
Delusions are highly maladaptive, a signature of brain dysfunction, and the source of great suffering.
Positive illusions, in contrast, are often highly adaptive, generating the confidence necessary to take on
great challenges and challengers, convincing an audience or a group of opponents that we are stronger,
smarter, and sexier. Positive illusions have been linked to direct mental and physical health benefits,
including evidence that distorted optimism can slow disease progression. Positive illusions are, as noted
by the biologists Richard Wrangham, Robert Trivers, and Dominic Johnson, a form of self-deception with
considerable evolutionary benefits. But like the runaway capacity of desire, so too can our illusions of
grandeur runaway. When this occurs, illusion and delusion are virtually indistinguishable. What was
once a narrative centered on the grandiose belief of being god-like has been transformed into the belief of

being God, leading individuals and groups to engage in extreme extortion or violence, not only blind to

on a quest, not just for a job, but for a
career — for a better life that doesn’t just
surpass but far surpasses their parents.”
Countries that fail to do that will have a
youth bulge that is not only unemployed,
but unemployable, he argued. “They will
be disconnected in a connected world,
despairing as they watch others build and
realize their potential and curiosity.”

If your country has either a strong
government or a strong civil society, it
has the ability to rise to this challenge. If
it has neither, it will have real problems,
which is why Egypt 1s struggling. China
leads in providing its youth bulge with
education, infrastructure and jobs, but

operational capacity to mount such an attack, in part because we lacked the
necessary bunker-busting bombs and the tanker aircraft to get us to Iran and back. I
did seek help from the Americans. I met Defense Secretary Bob Gates, CIA
director Mike Hayden, National Security Adviser Steve Hadley and even President
Bush himself. While not explicitly mentioning that we were planning military
action against Iran, I sounded them out on the prospects of getting more heavy
munitions, and possibly leasing several US tanker aircraft.

Yet in our final meeting with President Bush, during a visit to Israel in June
2008, he made it clear to Olmert and me that he knew what we were up to. Olmert
hosted a private dinner for the President. Afterwards, Bush asked to talk privately.
Olmert poured us each a glass of whiskey and lit a cigar, and we sank into brown
leather armchairs. Smiling, the president looked straight at me, and said to Olmert:
“This guy scares the living shit out of me when he tells me what you want.”

He told Olmert how I’d asked for heavy munitions, tankers and a variety of
other military equipment. “Remember. I’m a former F-16 pilot,” he said. “I know
how to connect the dots.” Then, turning more serious, he added: “I want to tell
both of you now, as President, the formal position of the US government. We are
totally against any action by you to mount an attack on the nuclear plants.” The
effect was all the more dramatic because of his Administration’s support for our
attack on the reactor in Syria the year before. “I repeat,” Bush said, “in order to
avoid any misunderstanding. We expect you not to do it. And we’re not going to
do it, either, as long as I am President. I wanted it to be clear.”

Olmert said nothing, so I replied. “Mr President, we’re in no position to tell you
what the position of the United States should be. But I can tell you what I believe
history will have to say. I’m reminded by what we call, in field artillery,
‘bracketing and halving.’” I said that in the wake of the Al-Qaeda attack on the
Twin Towers, he had fired one shell long, in Afghanistan, and another one short, in
Iraq. “But when the time came to hit the real target — Iran — it ended up you’d
already spent two terms, and all your political capital.” He seemed neither insulted
nor unsettled by my remark. He simply nodded. Perhaps, in part, because he was
pretty sure that we lacked the ability to attack the Iranian facilities anyway.

We still lacked that capacity when I became Defense Minister in Bibi’s
government in May 2009. But the main reason I’d stayed in the job, and my main

But Brunel's reputation did not prevent Jeffrey Epstein from
getting involved in his business.

According to a summary judgment court filing by Bradley
Edwards, a victims’ lawyer defending against a lawsuit by Jeffrey
Epstein alleging fabrication of sexual assault cases against him,
Epstein had provided support for Brunel's agency, which changed
its name, in 2005, from Karin to MC2—as in E = mc2.

As a scout for MC2, Brunel traveled the world in search of
undiscovered talent, favoring Scandinavia, Israel, central Europe,
the former Soviet republics, and South America, setting up mod-
eling competitions and negotiating with other international mod-
eling agents and agencies.

But according to the court filing, in which Edwards detailed
the information he had gathered in support of victims, Epstein
and Brunel had used the agency to bring underage girls from for-
eign countries into the United States by promising them model-
ing contracts. These girls were then housed in condominiums
belonging to Epstein. “Epstein and Brunel would then obtain a
visa for these girls,” the document states, “then charge the
underage girls rent, presumably to live as underage prostitutes in
the condos.”

“I strongly deny having participated, neither directly nor

_ Brunel would say. “I strongly deny having committed any illicit

of the /arger picture, the wider issues. From my experience as commander of
the sayeret and during the 1973 war, and from watching other officers whom I
respected, it struck me that this was an essential part of effective leadership.

By “leadership”, at that stage in my life, I did not mean political leadership. I
was thinking in terms of the army. But I’d now finished my masters degree, and
it was impossible to be unaware of the political context in which I’d be
returning to uniform. Since Camp David, our negotiators and the Egyptians had
been trying to thrash out a formal deal. Sadat was being denounced as a traitor
in the Arab world. Begin was seen by most in the outside world, and many
Israelis, as dragging his feet on the negotiations and risking the chance for peace
altogether. If we did manabge to sign a peace treaty, however, we would be
withdrawing for the first time from land captured in 1967. That would mean
finding a new approach to security in the south, as well as a new focus on the
majority of our Arab neighbors who were railing against Sadat and seemed less
interested than ever in making peace.

In some ways, it was hard to leave our mini-kibbutz in Palo Alto. Michal,
now nearly nine, had thrived, quickly learning English and ending up with a
perfectly American accent which has never left her. Yael has less vivid
memories of our time there. But we’d had the nearest thing to a normal family
life since our first, war-truncated, time at Stanford. During the university
holidays, we’d also travelled: to Canada. Mexico. Lake Tahoe. Even Las Vegas,
where, thankfully, we lacked the money to chance our luck, but where my years
in the sayeret suddenly came in handy. We spent the day at Circus Circus, a
joint casino-and-theme park tailored for families with kids. At a shooting
gallery in the amusement area, I had no trouble landing dead-center hits on a
passing procession of metal geese, to the consternation of the guy behind the
counter but the delight of my two young daughters. In probably the single
greatest moment of parental accomplishment I’d experienced since their birth, I
bagged a huge fluffy teddy bear for each of them.

I returned to Israel not just with the hope, but a reasonable expectation, that I
would get command of one of Israel’s two regular armored divisions: the 252,
which was responsible for defending the south and, at least for now, was based

in the end, truth will prevail and will defeat all rumors.

Al Emarat Al Youm:

The UAE government has taken notable measures in combating corruption, referring
senior officials to court. Are there further steps the government intends to undertake in
the same regards? And does Your Highness believe that an independent watchdog body
might be needed to audit governmental and semi-governmental organizations?

The UAE has efficient independent watchdog bodies that include the federal State Audit Institution, as well as
local auditing departments. I’ve visited the State Audit Institution lately where I was updated on its activities.
I’ve given directives to revamp its systems and provide all necessary tools to enhance its performance. Sy
stems and processes of the Dubai Financial Audit Department are also being reviewed and enhanced. Besides,
there are other auditing bodies that operate under the Rulers’ Courts across the seven Emirates.

Al Emarat Al Youm:

Your Highness received His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the
President of the UAE, in Dubai last week, and escorted His Highness on a tour that
included key landmark developments across the Emirate. What was the significance of
this visit?

I meet with His Highness Sheikh Khalifa on regular basis. We are companions on our journey of development,
and he is our Leader and our President. Dubai is his home and he is most welcome at anytime. The visit comes
in line with His Highness’ ongoing follow up on development efforts across the seven Emirates. He is always
keen on meeting his people across the country to listen to their views and ensure their own welfare.

As a matter of fact, all His Highness visits to Dubai are important. His latest visit was significantly important as
he toured Dubai’s new landmarks, expressing his satisfaction at Dubai’s milestone achievements. He was also
very keen on visiting “Dar Al Ittihad” (the Union House) where establishment of the United Arab Emirates
federation was proclaimed. The visit was in honor of this remarkable achievement.

Questions by Al Shorouk Egyptian Daily

Arab funds, particularly GCC ones, have suffered big investment losses in international
markets due to the global financial crisis. Sovereign Arab funds have also lost a lot of
their money. How did the UAE benefit from this tough lesson, and does it intend to direct
more money into Arab markets? Are there any plans to direct part of this money into

Egypt

mean that when someone was in his pocket, they owed him favors.”

Roberts elaborated in her interview with the Herald, saying that Epstein had access to girls through a modeling agency that recruited them from overseas.

Epstein, who was close to Les Wexner, the owner of Victoria’s Secret, often talked about his connections to people in the modeling, fashion and acting
industries, Roberts told the Herald.

“He [Epstein] would tell the girls, ‘Hey, I will give you a modeling contract if you go have sex with this man [whichever acquaintance Epstein
designated],’” she said.

Roberts’ story about the modeling agency is supported, to a degree, by the sworn statement of a Miami woman named Maritza Vasquez, who was later
interviewed in New York by an FBI agent from Miami. Vasquez worked as a bookkeeper for Mc2, owned by Epstein associate Jean-Luc Brunel. He
employed scouts in South America, Europe and the former Soviet Union to find him models to bring to the United States, Vasquez said in a 2010 sworn
court deposition obtained by the Herald.

Vasquez stated in the deposition that from 2003 to 2006 she handled all the finances and payroll for the agency, including a bank transaction involving
Epstein. She said Epstein invested $1 million in Mc2.

The models were often very young — 13, 14 and 15 — and some of them were housed in apartments at 301 E. 66th St. in New York, a building purportedly
owned by Epstein, the deposition said.

Epstein didn’t charge the girls rent, Vasquez said, but Brunel charged them $1,000 a month, with four of them at a time sharing one apartment. The girls
who were the youngest and most beautiful stayed at the 66th Street apartments, which were more luxurious than the other apartments that were used to
house models who were not as young and desirable, she said.

Vasquez once let one of the models, who was 14, stay overnight with her after the girl ran into trouble with police for trying to get into a Manhattan
nightclub. Vasquez also testified that she helped a lawyer obtain visas for the foreign models, and assisted with their transportation to and from modeling

assignments and parties.

Vasquez said that even though the agency employed 200 to 300 models, the company didn’t make any money and Brunel was always broke. Brunel would
later sue Epstein, alleging that the financier’s sex scandal had caused his business to fail, but the suit was eventually dropped.

Vasquez testified it wasn’t unusual for the agency to send girls to an assignment with a wealthy client for $100,000 or more, but the girl wouldn’t be paid
the full amount — or anything at all — if she refused to be “molested.”

Vasquez considered herself a mother figure and often coached the youngest girls to stick to the 9-to-5 modeling assignments because she didn’t think it
was appropriate for them to be having sex.

She said she met Epstein only once, but she often helped arrange for girls — many of them underage — to be sent to his homes in New York, Palm Beach
and his island in the Caribbean for parties. She heard salacious rumors about Epstein’s parties, but testified she had no firsthand knowledge about
whether they involved sex.

Vasquez said that she was questioned by the FBI and she tried to tell agents where to look for evidence.

Vasquez was eventually let go from the agency after she was accused of stealing money — money she claims was given to her by Brunel. Vasquez said she
was placed on probation for the theft. She never heard from the FBI about Epstein again.

The Herald was unsuccessful in reaching Brunel through his former attorney.

In a written statement released in 2015, Brunel denied any involvement in trafficking underage models.

“I strongly deny having participated, neither directly nor indirectly, in the actions Mr. Jeffrey Epstein is being accused of,” he said. “I strongly deny
having committed any illicit act or any wrongdoing in the course of my work as a scouter or model agencies manager.”

Too old at 19

In 2003, when Roberts turned 19, it was clear that Epstein had lost interest because she was too old for him, she said. She convinced him to pay for her to
get training to become a real professional masseuse so that she could move on.

In an interview, she explained that Epstein arranged for her to take a class in Thailand, but it came with a hitch: She said she was instructed to pick up a
Thai girl he had arranged to come to the States.

Next, the U.S. needs to keep the WTO
current with a vastly changed world
economy. The past WTO agreements are
valuable for all 158 WTO members. But
some economies want to go further by
reducing barriers in important sectors
such as the services trade, environmental
goods and services, government
procurement, and the digital economy.

The services trade, for example, 1s vital
for boosting innovation, productivity and
jobs in developing and developed
countries alike—but regulatory,
licensing, zoning and other barriers to
services are often equivalent to a 30%
tariff or higher. Because liberalization in
the WTO has been stuck, countries have
turned increasingly to bilateral and
multilateral free-trade agreements, some
of which have addressed these newer
topics. The U.S. should foster the WTO
principle of world-wide liberalization by
adopting standards in various industries
and sectors that would be open to all
economies that reciprocate. The WTO
also needs new rules for fair trading by
state-owned enterprises.

Yet the U.S. also should use free-trade
agreements to open markets. Trade

system. This form of digital totalitarianism would allow
the state to gather information on Chinese citizens
from a variety of sources and use it to maintain scores
or rankings based on an individual's perceived trust-
worthiness, including on political matters. Chinese
officials have claimed that by 2020, the system will
“allow the trustworthy to roam everywhere under
heaven while making it hard for the discredited to take
a single step.”! A citizen could receive bad marks for
petitioning the government, participating in protests,
or circulating banned ideas on social media.

As for Russia, the Kremlin complemented its covert in-
terference overseas with open and ugly acts of repres-
sion at home. In one brief period in early 2017, Russian
opposition politician Aleksey Navalny was blocked from
competing in the 2018 presidential contest through

a trumped-up criminal conviction, dissident journalist
Vladimir Kara-Murza nearly died from his second sus-
pected poisoning, and the Russian parliament passed
a law to decriminalize domestic violence that results in
“minor harm such as small lacerations and bruising.
Proponents of the domestic abuse law hailed it as a
win for traditional family values.

The confluence of authoritarian gains and setbacks
for democracy suggest a number of conclusions:

1. Modern authoritarianism is a permanent and
increasingly powerful rival to liberal democracy
as the dominant governing system of the 21st
century. Variations on the systems that have
proved effective in suppressing political dissent
and pluralism in Russia and China are less likely
to collapse than traditional authoritarian states,
given their relative flexibility and pragmatism.

2. The most serious threat to authoritarian systems
lies in economic breakdown. However, Russia,
China, and other major autocracies have shown
themselves capable of surviving economic set-
backs that, while affecting the standard of living,
did not push citizens to the limits of endurance.
The catastrophic case of Venezuela is a notable
exception. Of the main countries examined in
this study, only in Venezuela did the political leac-
ership attempt to impose a socialist economic
system and wage war on the private sector.

3. Illiberalism in democratic environments is more
than a temporary problem that can be fixed
through an inevitable rotation of power. In Hun-
gary, the Fidesz government has instituted poli-

cies that make it difficult for opposition parties
to raise funds or present their political message,
creating a structurally uneven political playing
field. Other elected leaders with authoritarian
mindsets will take notice and follow suit.

. Authoritarian states are likely to intensify efforts

to influence the political choices and govern-
ment polices of democracies. The pressure will
vary from country to country, but it will become
increasingly difficult to control due to global
economic integration, new developments in
the delivery of propaganda, and sympathetic
leaders and political movements within the de-
mocracies. Putin and his cohorts have learned
well how to use democratic openness against
democracy itself.

. Authoritarian leaders can count on an increas-

ingly vocal group of admirers in democratic
states. For several years now, European parties
of the nationalistic right and anticapitalist left
have forged ties with Moscow and aligned their
goals with Putin's. The 2016 U.S. presidential
election revealed a new constituency, albeit
small, that harbors respect for Putin despite

his hostility to American interests and his in-
terference in the country’s democratic process.
A disturbing number of advisers to the Trump
campaign, including Trump himself, expressed
admiration for Putin and his system. In addition,
various political figures and commentators have
praised or come to the defense of despotic
rulers including Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Bashar
al-Assad.

. Modern authoritarians can be expected to dou-

ble down on their drive to neuter civil society

as an incubator of reformist ideas and political
initiatives. Civil society can serve as a vibrant
alternative to mainstream democratic parties

as those parties fall prey to corruption, elitism,
and ossification. After the Kremlin effectively
defanged the collection of human rights organi-
zations, conservation projects, election monitors,
and anticorruption committees in Russia, other
autocrats and illiberal leaders began to act in
similar fashion. Both Viktor Orban in Hungary and
the leaders of the Law and Justice party in Poland
have spoken of “bringing order to the nongov-
ernmental sector, though serious restrictions on
freedom of association have yet to be adopted by
an EU state. That could change in 2017.

of Yanta, across from Jobb Jannine.

But as it was making its way there, we got word a cease-fire had been
agreed. It was set for noon the next day, Friday, June 11. The main focus of our
advance shifted to a crossroads a few miles east of Jobb Janine. It was a flat,
open area surrounded by hills, codenamed the Tovlano Triangle on our maps.
We knew we would meet some Syrian resistance. On the way up the valley,
we'd seen signs of reinforcements from inside Syria. But we had overwhelming
superiority in tanks, artillery and infantry in the area, as well as full control of
the air. In our command post, about five miles back from our frontline forces,
Yanoush set in motion the plan for a pre-cease-fire advance to take the hills
overlooking the Tovlano Triangle. It was still about eight miles short of the
Beirut-Damascus road. But the idea was to establish a more secure defensive
position by the time the truce took effect, and to put us in position to advance
further if the cease-fire collapsed or was delayed.

Shortly before sunset, Yanoush left by helicopter for a field commanders’
meeting with Raful in northern Israel. That left me in charge, alongside
Yanoush’s de facto chief-of-staff, Amram Mitzna. A decorated veteran of 1967
and 1973 whom I knew well, Amram had the added distinction of being disliked
by Raful almost as much as I was. Our main reserve division had been ordered
to take control over the hills south of the Tovlano Triangle. One of its brigades,
led by a former Sayeret Matkal soldier named Nachman Rifkind, was sent to
take up a position immediately south of the triangle. Soon after nightfall,
Rifkind radioed in that he was there, and that the area seemed clear of enemy
forces. The divisional command post then ordered a second brigade to move
toward the hills dominating the crossroads.

The first sign of trouble came around midnight. From our overall command
post, we were listening in on all radio traffic, and heard the second brigade
report that it had come under fire while moving toward the crossroads. At first,
we assumed it must be from the remnants of a retreating Syrian unit. But
Rifkind, who had reported the area was clear, now said that he could see flashes
of shellfire two or three miles to his north. Only the following morning did it
become clear that he had not deployed immediately south of the triangle as
planned. He had mistakenly halted at a hill about two miles short of there.

By the time Yanoush returned to the command post a little after midnight,
we were facing another problem. The battalion nearest to the south of the
triangle had spotted a dozen large vehicles armed with missiles a few hundred

but it was sad sad sad that he didn't let me do my job. Was it an intentional con? Very few things he said were 
the truth (but, hey, people liked Bernie Madoff too)....

the family to help transition to the 'new reality' with their loved one with later stage dementia. 
I'm in NYC Friday for the annual meeting of the Circumnavigator's Club, and will stay over the

but Joe probably won't let that happen CD .
