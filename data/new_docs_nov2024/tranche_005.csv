IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020016.txt,"Bannonites would, with lowered voices and certain pity, ask each other how he seemed
and how he was holding up; invariably they would agree about how bad he looked, the
strain etching ever deeper into his already ruined face. David Bossie thought Bannon
“looked like he would die.”

“T now understand what it is like to be in the court of the Tudors,” reflected Bannon.
On the campaign trail, he recalled, Newt Gingrich “would come with all these dumb ideas.
When we won he was my new best friend. Every day a hundred ideas. When”—by spring
in the White House—“T got cold, when I went through my Valley of Death, I saw him one
day in the lobby and he looks down, avoiding my eyes with a kind of mumbled ‘Hey,
Steve.’ And I say, ‘What are you doing here, let’s get you inside,’ and he says, “No, no,
I’m fine, I’m waiting for Dina Powell.’”

Having attained the unimaginable—bringing a fierce alt-right, anti-liberal
ethnopopulism into a central place in the White House—Bannon found himself face to
face with the untenable: undermined by and having to answer to rich, entitled Democrats.

7 OK Ok

The paradox of the Trump presidency was that it was both the most ideologically driven
and the least. It represented a deeply structural assault on liberal values—Bannon’s
deconstruction of the administrative state meant to take with it media, academic, and not-
for-profit institutions. But from the start it also was apparent that the Trump administration
could just as easily turn into a country club Republican or a Wall Street Democrat regime.
Or just a constant effort to keep Donald Trump happy. Trump had his collection of pet-
peeve issues, test-marketed in various media rollouts and megarallies, but none seemed so
significant as his greater goal of personally coming out ahead of the game.

As the drumbeat for Bannon’s removal grew, the Mercers stepped in to protect their
investment in radical government overthrow and the future of Steve Bannon.

In an age when all successful political candidates are surrounded by, if not at the beck
and call of, difficult, rich people pushing the bounds of their own power—and the richer
they were, the more difficult they might be—Bob and Rebekah Mercer were quite onto
themselves. If Trump’s ascent was unlikely, the Mercers’ was all the more so.

Even the difficult rich—the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson on the right, David
Geffen and George Soros on the left—are leavened and restrained by the fact that money
exists In a competitive market. Obnoxiousness has its limits. The world of the rich is, in its
fashion, self-regulating. Social climbing has rules.

But among the difficult and entitled rich, the Mercers cut a path through disbelief and
incredulity. Unlike other people contributing vast sums to political candidates, they were
willing not to win—ever. Their bubble was their bubble.

So when they did win, by the fluke alignment of the stars for Donald Trump, they were

took a deep breath. Things were about to change.

Everything was about to change.

Lifestyle Design from Dubai to Berlin

Tie 4-Hour Workweek has now been sold into 35 languages. It’s been on the bestseller lists for more

than two years, and every month brings a new story and a new discovery.

From the Economist to the cover of the New York Times Style section, from the streets of Dubai to the
cafes of Berlin, lifestyle design has cut across cultures to become a worldwide movement. The original
ideas of the book have been broken apart, improved, and tested in environments and ways I never could
have imagined.

So why the new edition if things are working so well? Because I knew it could be better, and there
was a missing ingredient: you.

This expanded and updated edition contains more than 100 pages of new content, including the latest
cutting-edge technologies, field-tested resources, and—most important—real-world success stories
chosen from more than 400 pages of case studies submitted by readers.

Families and students’? CEOs and professional vagabonds’? Take your pick. There should be someone
whose results you can duplicate. Need a template to negotiate remote work, a paid year in Argentina,
perhaps? This time, it’s in here.

The Experiments in Lifestyle Design blog (www.fourhourblog.com) was launched alongside the book,
and within six months, it became one of the top 1,000 blogs in the world, out of more than 120 million.
Thousands of readers have shared their own amazing tools and tricks, producing phenomenal and
unexpected results. The blog became the laboratory Pd always wanted, and I encourage you to join us
there.

The new “Best of the Blog” section includes several of the most popular posts from the Experiments
in Lifestyle Design blog. On the blog itself, you can also find recommendations from everyone from
Warren Buffett (seriously, I tracked him down and show you how I did it) to chess prodigy Josh
Waitzkin. It’s an experimental playground for those who want better results in less time.

Not “Revised”

Tris is not a “revised” edition in the sense that the original no longer works. The typos and small
mistakes have been fixed over more than 40 printings in the U.S. This is the first major overhaul, but not
for the reason you’d expect.

Things have changed dramatically since April 2007. Banks are failing, retirement and pension funds
are evaporating, and jobs are being lost at record rates. Readers and skeptics alike have asked: Can the
principles and techniques in the book really still work in an economic recession or depression?

Yes and yes.

In fact, questions I posed during pre-crash lectures, including “How would your priorities and

Inside Job (2010) 
NYT Critics' PickThis movie has been designated a Critic's Pick by the film reviewers of The New York 
Times. 
Sony Pictures Classics 
Henry Paulson, Ben Bernanke and Timothy Geithner in the documentary Inside Job. 
Who Maimed the Economy, and How 
By A. 0. SCOTT 
Inside Job, a sleek, briskly paced film whose title suggests a heist movie, is the story of a crime 
without punishment, of an outrage that has so far largely escaped legal sanction and societal stigma. The 
betrayal of public trust and collective values that Mr. Ferguson chronicles was far more brazen and 
damaging than the adultery in Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel, which treated Hester more as scapegoat than 
villain. 
The gist of this movie, which begins in a mood of calm reflection and grows angrier and more incredulous 
as it goes on, is unmistakably punitive. The density of information and the complexity of the subject 
matter make Inside Job feel like a classroom lecture at times, but by the end Mr. Ferguson has summoned 
the scourging moral force of a pulpit-shaking sermon. That he delivers it with rigor, restraint and good 
humor makes his case all the more devastating. 
He is hardly alone in making it. Numerous journalists have published books and articles retracing the 
paths that led the world economy to the precipice two years ago. The deregulation of the financial 
services industry in the 1980s and '90s; the growing popularity of complex and risky derivatives; the 
real estate bubble and the explosion of subprime lending — none of these developments were exactly 
secret. On the contrary, they were celebrated as vindications of the power and wisdom of markets. 
Accordingly, Mr. Ferguson recycles choice moments of triumphalism, courtesy of Lawrence H. Summers, 
George W. Bush, Alan Greenspan and various cable television ranters and squawkers. 
Even as stock indexes soared and profits swelled, there were always at least a few investors, economists 
and government officials who warned that the frenzied speculation was leading to the abyss. Some of these 
prophets without honor show up in front of Mr. Ferguson's camera, less to gloat than to present, once 
again, the analyses that were dismissed and ignored by their peers for so long. 
Dozens of interviews — along with news clips and arresting aerial shots of New York, Iceland and other 
disaster areas — are folded into a clear and absorbing history, narrated by Matt Damon. The music (an 
opening song, Big Time, by Peter Gabriel, and a score by Alex Heffes) and the clean wide-screen 
cinematography provide an aesthetic polish that is welcome for its own sake and also important to the 
movie's themes. The handsomely lighted and appointed interiors convey a sense of the rarefied, privileged 
worlds in which the Wall Street operators and their political enablers flourished, and the elegance of 
the presentation also subliminally bolsters the film's authority. This is not a piece of ragged 
muckraking or breathless advocacy. It rests its outrage on reason, research and careful argument. 
The same was true of Mr. Ferguson's previous documentary, No End in Sight, which focused on 
catastrophic policies carried out in Iraq by President George W. Bush's administration just after the 
overthrow of Saddam Hussein. But whereas that film concentrated on a narrow view of a complex subject — 
the conduct of the war rather than the at least equally controversial rationale for fighting it — Inside 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031986 
Job offers a sweeping synthesis, going as far back as the Reagan administration and as far afield as 
Iceland in its anatomy of the financial crisis. 
Perhaps unsurprisingly, many of the highest-profile players declined to be interviewed. Mr. Summers 
appears only in news footage, and none of his predecessors or successors as Treasury secretary — not 
Robert E. Rubin or Henry M. Paulson Jr. or Timothy F. Geithner — submit to Mr. Ferguson's questions. Nor 
do any of the top executives at Goldman Sachs or the other big banks. Most of the interviewees are, at 
least from the perspective of the filmmaker, friendly witnesses, adding fuel to the director's 
comprehensive critique of the way business has been done in the United States and the other advanced 
capitalist countries for the past two decades. 
Both American political parties are indicted; Inside Job is not simply another belated settling of 
accounts with Mr. Bush and his advisers, though they are hardly ignored. The scaling back of government 
oversight and the weakening of checks on speculative activity by banks began under Reagan and continued 
during the Clinton administration. And with each administration the market in derivatives expanded, and 
alarms about the dangers of this type of investment were ignored. Raghuram Rajan, chief economist at the 
International Monetary Fund, presented a paper in 2005 warning of a catastrophic meltdown and was 
mocked as a Luddite by Mr. Summers. 
Meanwhile, some investment bankers — at Goldman Sachs in particular — were betting against the positions 
they were pushing on their customers. An elaborate house of cards had been constructed in which bad 
consumer loans were bundled into securities, which, were certified as sound by rating agencies paid by 
the banks and then insured via credit-default swaps. One risky bet was stacked on top of another, and in 
retrospect the collapse of the whole edifice, along with the loss of jobs, homes, pensions and political 
confidence, seems inevitable. 
How did this happen? Mr. Ferguson is no conspiracy theorist; nor is he inclined toward structural or 
systemic explanations. Markets are not like tectonic plates, shifting on their own. Visible hands write 
laws and make deals, and in this case a combination of warped values and groupthink seems to have driven 
very intelligent men (and they were mostly men) toward folly. In addition to business and government, Mr. 
Ferguson aims his critique at academia, suggesting that the discipline of economics and more than a few 
prominent economists were corrupted by consulting fees, seats on boards of directors and membership in 
the masters of the universe club. 
When he challenges some of these professors, in particular those who held positions of responsibility in 
the White House or in the Federal Reserve, they are reduced to stammering obfuscation — Markets are 
complicated! Who could have predicted? I don't see any conflict of interest — and occasionally provoked 
to testiness. Mr. Ferguson, for his part, cannot always contain his incredulity or rein in his sarcasm. 
Occasionally his voice pipes up from off camera, saying things like, You can't be serious! 
But it is hard to imagine a movie more serious, and more urgent, than Inside Job. There are a few 
avenues that might have been explored more thoroughly, in particular the effects of the crisis on 
ordinary, non-Wall-Street-connected workers and homeowners. The end of the film raises a disturbing 
question, as Mr. Damon exhorts viewers to demand changes in the status quo so that the trends associated 
with unchecked speculation of the kind that caused the last crisis — rising inequality, neglect of 
productive capacity, endless cycles of boom and bust — might be reversed. 
This call to arms makes you wonder why anger of the kind so eloquently expressed in Inside Job has been 
so inchoate. And through no fault of its own, the film may leave you dispirited as well as enraged. Its 
fate is likely to be that of other documentaries: praised in some quarters, nitpicked in others and 
shrugged off by those who need its message most. Which is a shame. 
Inside Job is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some drug and sex references and pervasive 
obscenity, though not the verbal kind.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020002.txt,"Lyndon Johnson ended up—one of the first modern politicians to have found himself on
the wrong end of both mortal and moral politics.)

But now, after little more than seven weeks in office, Trump saw his own predicament
as unique and overwhelming. Like no other president before (though he did make some
allowances for Bill Clinton), his enemies were out to get him. Worse, the system was
rigged against him. The bureaucratic swamp, the intelligence agencies, the unfair courts,
the lying media—they were all lined up against him. This was, for his senior staff, a
reliable topic of conversation with him: the possible martyrdom of Donald Trump.

In the president’s nighttime calls, he kept coming back to how unfair this was, and to
what Tony Blair had said—and others, too! It all added up. There was a plot against him.

Now, it was certainly true that Trump’s closest staff appreciated his volatility, and, to a
person, was alarmed by it. At points on the day’s spectrum of adverse political
developments, he could have moments of, almost everyone would admit, irrationality.
When that happened, he was alone in his anger and not approachable by anyone. His
senior staff largely dealt with these dark hours by agreeing with him, no matter what he
said. And if some of them occasionally tried to hedge, Hope Hicks never did. She agreed
absolutely with all of it.

At Mar-a-Lago on the evening of March 3, the president watched Bret Baier interview
Paul Ryan on Fox. Baier asked the Speaker about a report on the online news site Circa—
owned by Sinclair, the conservative broadcast group—involving allegations that Trump
Tower had been surveilled during the campaign.

On March 4, Trump’s early morning tweets began:

Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my “wires tapped” in Trump Tower just before the
victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism! (4:35 a.m.)

Is it legal for a sitting President to be “wire tapping” a race for president prior to an election?
Turned down by court earlier. ANEW LOW! (4:49 a.m.)

How low has President Obama gone to tap my phones during the very sacred election process.

This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy! (5:02 a.m.)
At 6:40 he called Priebus, waking him up. “Did you see my tweet?” he asked. “We’ve
caught them red-handed!” Then the president held his phone so Priebus could hear the
playback of the Baier show.

He had no interest in precision, or even any ability to be precise. This was pure public
exclamation, a window into pain and frustration. With his misspellings and his use of
1970s lingo—“wire tapping” called up an image of FBI agents crouched in a van on Fifth
Avenue—it seemed kooky and farcical. Of the many tweets that Trump had seemed to
hoist himself by, from the point of view of the media, intelligence community, and
extremely satisfied Democrats, the wiretap tweets had pulled him highest and most left
him dangling in ignorance and embarrassment.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013816.txt,"While Dale’s teammates were hitting the slopes for extra sessions, he was often buying sake for clients
in Tokyo. In a world of “work harder, not smarter,” it came to pass that his coaches felt he was spending
too much time on his business and not enough time in training, despite his results.

Rather than choose between his business or his dream, Dale chose to move laterally with both, from
either/or to both/and. He wasn’t spending too much time on his business; he and his brother were
spending too much time with Canucks.

In 2002, they moved to the ski capital of the world, Australia, where the team was smaller, more
flexible, and coached by a legend. Three short years later, he received citizenship, went head-to-head
against former teammates, and became the third “Aussie” in history to win winter gold.

In the land of wallabies and big surf, Dale has since gone postal. Literally. Right next to the Elvis
Presley commemorative edition, you can buy stamps with his face on them.

Fame has its perks, as does looking outside the choices presented to you. There are always lateral
options.

NEW CALEDOINA, SOUTH PACIFIC OCEAN

Once you say you’re going to settle for second, that’s what happens to you in life.
—JOHN F. KENNEDY

Some people remain convinced that just a bit more money will make things right. Their goals are

arbitrary moving targets: $300,000 in the bank, $1,000,000 in the portfolio, $100,000 a year instead of
$50,000, etc. Julie’s goal made intrinsic sense: come back with the same number of children she had left
with.

She reclined in her seat and glanced across the aisle past her sleeping husband, Marc, counting as she
had done thousands of times—one, two, three. So far so good. In 12 hours, they would all be back in
Paris, safe and sound. That was assuming the plane from New Caledonia held together, of course.

New Caledonia?

Nestled in the tropics of the Coral Sea, New Caledonia was a French territory and where Julie and
Marc had just sold the sailboat that took them 15,000 miles around the world. Of course, recouping their
initial investment had been part of the plan. All said and done, their 15-month exploration of the globe,
from the gondola-rich waterways of Venice to the tribal shores of Polynesia, had cost between $18,000
and $19,000. Less than rent and baguettes in Paris.

Most people would consider this impossible. Then again, most people don’t know that more than 300
families set sail from France each year to do the same.

The trip had been a dream for almost two decades, relegated to the back of the line behind an ever-
growing list of responsibilities. Each passing moment brought a new list of reasons for putting it off. One
day, Julie realized that if she didn’t do it now, she would never do it. The rationalizations, legitimate or
not, would just continue to add up and make it harder to convince herself that escape was possible.

One year of preparation and one 30-day trial run with her husband later, they set sail on the trip of a
lifetime. Julie realized almost as soon as the anchor lifted that, far from being a reason not to travel and
seek adventure, children are perhaps the best reason of all to do both.

Pre-trip, her three little boys had fought like banshees at the drop of a hat. In the process of learning to
coexist in a floating bedroom, they learned patience, as much for themselves as for the sanity of their
parents. Pre-trip, books were about as appealing as eating sand. Given the alternative of staring at a wall
on the open sea, all three learned to love books. Pulling them out of school for one academic year and
exposing them to new environments had proven to be the best investment in their education to date.

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028750.txt,"DP: The U.S. has been the patron for democracy for a century, since
Wilson’s 14 Points, and a wonderful heritage it has been. When an
American travels the world, he finds himself in country after country
where his country played a monumentally positive role, especially in
democratizing the system. We naturally want to extend this to Muslim-
majority countries. Sadly, these for some time have offered an unpleasant
choice between brutal and greedy dictators or ideological, extreme, and
antagonistic elected Islamists. It’s not a choice we should accept.

TB: So what should we do?

DP: I offer three simple guidelines. One, always oppose the Islamists. Like
fascists and Communists, they are the totalitarian enemy, whether they
wear long beards in Pakistan or suits in Washington.

Two, always support the liberal, modern, secular people who share our
worldview. They look to us for moral and other sustenance; we should be
true to them. They are not that strong, and cannot take power soon
anywhere, but they represent hope, offering the Muslim world’s only
prospect of escape from the dreary dichotomy of dictatorship or
extremism.

Three, and more difficult, cooperate with dictators but condition it on
pushing them toward reform and opening up. We need the Mubaraks of
the world and they need us. Fine, but relentlessly keep the pressure on
them to improve their rule. Had we begun this process with Abdullah
Saleh of Yemen in 1978 or with Mubarak in 1981, things could have been
very different by 2011. But we didn’t.

TB: Egypt might be the test case.

DP: Well, it’s a bit late. Mohammed Mors! 1s not a greedy dictator but he
emerged from the Muslim Brotherhood, and his efforts since reaching
power have been purely Islamist.

TB: What about the recent elections?

DP: I do not believe that a single one of the elections and referenda in
Egypt was fairly conducted. It surprises me that Western governments and
media are so gullible on this score.

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011507.txt,"I was intrigued by the mechanical puzzle and managed to locate two slightly
rusted locks. One was a Yale, the other an Israeli-made lookalike called a
Nabob. One evening after dinner, I searched the ground around the kibbutz
garage for shards of metal that looked like they might fit into the key slot, and
spent the next half-hour or so propped against a tree, trying and failing to coax
either lock to open. I realized I would need to discover how the locks worked.
But how to get inside to see?

Saturday afternoons in Mishmar Hasharon were a quiet time, like the old
Jewish neighborhoods and shtetls back in Europe but minus the religious
trappings. The next day, I waited until mid-afternoon and walked past the
bakery towards the garage. Its roll-down, corrugated door was locked. So was
the structure next to it, where the blacksmith and metalwork shop were. But
attached to the blacksmith’s was a hut where our scrap metal was dumped. I
doubted it would be locked, and it wasn’t. Pausing to let my eyes get used to the
dark, I made my way into the metalwork area. I crossed to the cabinet where the
tools were kept. I took out a steel jigsaw used for cutting through metal and,
hiding it under my shirt, made my way out again.

Fortunately, the saw was up to the task of cutting into the softer alloy that
made up the body of the locks. Once I’d cut inside them, I saw they shared the
same basic construction. There was a series of springs and shafts which, in
response to the indentations of a key, aligned in such a way to allow the lock to
open. I sneaked back into the metalwork shop five or six times. By trial and
error, I managed to shape one of jigsaw blades into a pick tool that seemed like
it should do the job. For days, I manipulated it into each of the padlocks. I knew
I had the principle right, but I still couldn’t get it to work. Blisters formed on my
thumb and fingers. Then, finally, the Yale sprung open! With each successive
try I got better at knowing how to put the blade in, when and where to rotate it
and how much pressure to apply. After fashioning a half-dozen other tools, each
slightly different in width and shape, I reached a point where I could get the
mechanism to work on my first try. Other locks — doors, trunks, closets — were
even easier after I made picks for them as well.

I couldn’t resist sharing my newly acquired skill with a couple of the boys in
my class, and word gradually spread. There was a handful of slightly older boys
who we referred to as the “rogues”. They weren’t delinquents. They were free
spirits, bridling at the uniform expectations and rules of kibbutz life. Over the
next few years, as co-conspirators more than close friends, I found myself
drawn to two of them. Ido and Moshe were 18 months older than me. Though

TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021093.txt,"﻿impressed a pupil's father who then recruited-him to a job on Wall 
Street. Epstein used his mathematical knowledge to develop complex 
formulae that could be applied to financial markets, especially in the 
area of currency exchange. He went on to form his own company and 
began advising Leslie Wexner, the billionaire creator of the Limited 
Brands group, which owns, among other extremely successful 
companies, Victoria's Secret and La Senza. Some on Wall Street believe 
that Wexner is the source of Epstein's fortune, although the version 
Epstein seems to prefer is that he advises a number of very rich clients. 
Intriguingly, he is said to have a permit to carry a gun. Epstein's talents 
are not restricted to mathematics. He plays the piano to concert 
standard (there is a nine-foot Steinway grand in his house) and he 
cultivates Nobel Prize-winning scientists with whom he engages 
in arcane conversation.. . 
'Ghislaine was totally in thrall to him,' Rupert 
Fairfax said:. Ile death of her father left a terrible 
gap in her lifeand Jeffrey-filled it. I remember seeing 
them together in Aspen. Jeffrey was everything to 
her. He lifted her up at a time when she was very 
down.' C4hislainfrfriends have asserted tharshe 
desperately wanted to marry Epstein, but that their 
romance turned into what one has described as 'an 
affectionate business relationship'. Epstein provided 
Ghislaine with a home, a beaux-arts townhouse on 
the Upper Fast Side close to his own residence. He 
also gave her the wherewithal to run it in a grand 
manner; she employed a substantial staff, including a 
full-time butler and maid who had their own 
quarters at the property. Ghislaine appeared effortlessly to establish 
herself as one of New York's leading socialites. Witness, for instance, the 
party she threw for Allegra Hicks, the designer ex-wife ofAshley Hicks, a 
grandson of Earl Mountbatten and second cousin of the Prince of Wales. 
The 80 guests at Ghislaine's house included Hollywood actor Matthew 
Modine, at least one Rockefeller, a Radziwill and numerous 
billionaires. After toasting the future of Allegra's new shop in New York 
with vintage Dom Perignon, Ghislaine took her guests to the library, 
where the books had been given fake spines with titles naming her 
friends. The party, like many she hosted, was a triumph and her success 
gave the slightly gauche Epstein a social entree that had thus far eluded 
him. She is credited with helping him forge a friendship with Bill 
Clinton, among other figures of influence. 
But even Epstein could scarcely have imagined she would create an 
opportunity for friendship with a member of the British royal family — 
Prince Andrew, whom she appears to have met in London when he was 
`Ghislaine was 
totally in thrall 
to him. The death 
of her father left 
a terrible gap in 
her life and Jeffrey 
filled it' 
working at the Minstry of Defence. At the turn of the millennium, 
Ghislaine and Andrew were hardly ever apart, enjoying eight different 
jaunts together in the space of a year. In February 2000, they holidayed 
in Palm Beach. Then they travelled to New York for a fashion show. A 
month later, Andrew was back in New York at a fundraiser for the 
London Symphony Orchestra, again accompanied by Ghislaine. A few 
weeks after that, Andrew returned for another round of socialising with 
Ghislaine. The following month, they met up for another holiday in 
Florida. In the autumn, Andrew flew to New York, where he and 
Ghislaine were spotted together. Just before Christmas, Andrew gave a 
house party at Sandringham to mark Ghislaine's 39th birthday. A few 
weeks later, in January 2001, they were on holiday again, in Phuket. • 
What was going on? Was it a romance? No, said informed sources. 
Because on at least five of the eight occasions when Andrew and 
Ghislaine were together, Jeffrey Epstein was there as 
well. Andrew invited them both to Windsor for the 
Queen's birthday party. One of Epstein's friends, 
Nobel Prize-winning scientist Murray Gell-Mann, 
said he understood that Epstein had given the 
Queen financial advice. 
After almost 10 years together, Ghislaine had 
become what Epstein characterised as his 'best 
friend'. He once denied that she was on his payroll, 
but ratiainquiries suggest that her financial 
infireadiliLdirectly back to Epstein.4 1995 a 
company called Ghislainwas registered in 
Florida, with offices at Epstein's Palm Beach 
address. Whenever Ghislaine is asked what she 
does, she says she is managing director of a company calleddiftiork 
illeirnamb Not much is known about this company except that, 
according to records, it is in the business of investment counselling. 
That is Epstein's area of expertise and closer inspection shows that New 
York Strategy Group is just another part of his financial empire. So if 
Ghislaine really does work for Epstein, what does she do? 
There is, in fact, a clue buried in the court documentation from 
Pennsylvania. In 2003 a writ was filed by Nelson Shanks, the celebrated 
portraitist whose sitters have included Pope John Paul II, Ronald 
Reagan and Diana, Princess of Wales. Shanks claimed that he had been 
hired to paint the clothing billionairelkesliellair his wife Abigail 
and their children. Yet when Shanks finished the picture, Wexner 
refused to pay for it, owing $339,000. When Shanks sued for his money 
— successfully, .gs.it turned out — he also named Jeffrey Epstein and 
Ghislaine Maxwell. It was Ghislaine, he said; who hadapproached him 
and arranged the deal with Wexner. Epstein wa.S also involved, he said. It

Simpson matter, we just did what you do every day’ —that is, defend their
clients by any means necessary and chalk up a bunch of billable hours in
the process—and he got a standing ovation.

In the afterglow of his speech, colleagues came up to Cochran to
shake his hand and get in a little banter. One well-wisher shared this joke:

“If [prosecutor] Chris Darden spent as much time trying to nail O.J.
Simpson as he did trying to nail [prosecutor] Marcia Clark, he might’ ve
won the case.” The other defense attorneys within hearing distance all
had a good laugh at that one.

Dr. Schoenfeld joined the line of lawyers waiting to have photos
taken of themselves standing alongside Cochran. When it was
Schoenfeld’ s turn, Nancy focused her camera. For this particular
occasion, Schoenfeld had stashed a hand-printed card underneath the
standard, plastic-encased ID lapel card. As in the previous poses, Cochran
and Schoenfeld put their arms around each other, although they were
looking, not at each other, but straight ahead and smiling at the camera.

Thus, Cochran didn’ t notice how, just before Nancy snapped their
picture, Schoenfeld subtly managed to pull away the ID card and reveal

the hand-printed card, which declared, in large printed letters, “OJ. DID

(p. 129) The Information Age is also the Dysinformation Age.

What can we do? We need to rethink our priorities with the help of the passionate
but flawed analyses of Wiener, Weizenbaum, and the other serious critics of our
technophilia. A key phrase, it seems to me, is Wiener’s almost offhand observation,
above, that “these machines” are “helpless by themselves.” As I have been arguing
recently, we’re making tools, not colleagues, and the great danger is not appreciating the
difference, which we should strive to accentuate, marking and defending it with political
and legal innovations.

Perhaps the best way to see what is being missed 1s to note that Alan Turing
himself suffered an entirely understandable failure of imagination in his formulation of
the famous Turing Test. As everyone knows, it is an adaptation of his “imitation game,”
in which a man, hidden from view and communicating verbally with a judge, tries to
convince the judge that he is in fact a woman, while a woman, also hidden and
communicating with the judge, tries to convince the judge that she is the woman. Turing
reasoned that this would be a demanding challenge for a man (or for a woman pretending
to be a man), exploiting a wealth of knowledge about how the other sex thinks and acts,
what they tend to favor or ignore. Surely (ding!)?, any man who could beat a woman at
being perceived to be a woman would be an intelligent agent. What Turing did not
foresee is the power of deep-learning AI to acquire this wealth of information in an
exploitable form without having to understand it. Turing imagined an astute and
imaginative (and hence conscious) agent who cunningly designed his responses based on
his detailed “theory” of what women are likely to do and say. Top-down intelligent
design, in short. He certainly didn’t think that a man, winning the imitation game, would
somehow become a woman; he imagined that there would still be a man’s consciousness
guiding the show. The hidden premise in Turing’s almost-argument was: Only a
conscious, intelligent agent could devise and control a winning strategy in the imitation
game. And so it was persuasive to Turing (and others, including me, still a stalwart
defender of the Turing Test) to argue that a “computing machine” that could pass as
human in a contest with a human might not be conscious in just the way a human being
is, but would nevertheless have to be a conscious agent of some kind. I think this is still a
defensible position—the only defensible position—but you have to understand how
resourceful and ingenious a judge would have to be to expose the shallowness of the
facade that a deep-learning AI (a tool, not a colleague) could present.

What Turing didn’t foresee is the uncanny ability of superfast computers to sift
mindlessly through Big Data, of which the Internet provides an inexhaustible supply,
finding probabilistic patterns in human activity that could be used to pop “authentic’-
seeming responses into the output for almost any probe a judge would think to offer.
Wiener also underestimates this possibility, seeing the tell-tale weakness of a machine in
not being able to

take into account the vast range of probability that characterizes the human
situation. (p.181)

° The surely alarm (the habit of having a bell ring in your head whenever you see the word in an argument)
is described and defended by me in Jntuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking (2013).

If the desire of our realists to conduct foreign policy with foreign
despots as if unprincipled cooperation with the bad guys could build
a stable world is unrealistic, the idealism of our enthusiasts that every
new foreign revolution will bring a millennium of democratic peace
is absurd.

American foreign policy cannot expect that revolutions in foreign
countries will rescue us from the painful dilemmas our foreign policy
often confronts. Revolution is not the deus ex machina that will make
the world peaceful; it is a tsunami that sweeps everything before it,
and often leaves the world messier and more dangerous.

Modern history teaches two great lessons about revolution: that
revolutions are inevitable, and that a large majority of revolutions
either fail or go bad. Americans almost instinctively look at
revolutions in terms of our own past: the 1688 Glorious Revolution
that made Parliament more powerful than the King in England, and
the American Revolution that led in relatively short order to the
establishment of a stable and constitutional government.

Most revolutions don’t work like this at all. Many of them fail, with
the old despots crushing dissent or making only cosmetic changes to
the old system. (This happened in Austria in 1848 and something
very like it may be happening in Egypt today.) Others move into
radicalism, terror and mob rule before a new despot comes along to
bring order — at least until the next futile and bloody revolutionary
spasm. That was France’s history for almost 100 years after the
storming of the Bastille. China, Russia and Iran all saw revolutions
like this in the 20th century.

The revolutions that ‘work’ are the exceptions, not the rule. The
peaceful revolutions in the Central European countries as Soviet
power melted in 1989-1990 are a unique exception to the rule that
most revolutions either turn nasty or fail. When many American

Salacious new chapter in Florida billionaire's sex scandal 
effrey Epstein 
or years, the story of South Florida billionairemoney manager Jeffrey Epstein— involving allegations of human trafficking, an international underage sex ring, a Palm Beach 
ansion, a private island inthe Caribbean, and an FBI investigation— has been tabloid fodder inthe United States and the United Kingdom. 
o, Fort Lauderdale lawyer Brad Edwards is helping to write a new chapter inthis murky and sordid tale. Representing two alleged victims identified only as Jane Doe#3 and Jane 
oe #4, Edwards filed a motion in U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach that alleges well-known criminal defense lawyer Alan Dershowitz and Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, 
ere involved in Epstein's international sex ring. 
'There's absolutelyno kemel of truth to this story, said Dershowitz, who represented Epstein. I don't know this woman. I've never been inthe same place with her. She's made up 
he whole story completely from whole cloth. 
dwards' motionrequests that his new clients jointhe case of two other alleged victims — identified as Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe#2 in courtrecords — who are attempting to use the 
me Victims' Rights Act to force the U.S. Department of Justice to prosecute Epstein for sex trafficking of children by fraud and use of interstate commerce to entice a minor to 
ommit prostitution, among other offenses. 
wealthy Wall Streetmoney manager who had once attempted to purchase New York magazine, Epstein traveled the world in circles that included President Bill Clinton and 
usinessman Donald Trump. Despite his vast fortune and mansion in PalmBeach, Epstein kept a low profile and wasn't a regular inthe wealthy island's social scene. 
he low profile vanished in 2005, when a woman contacted the Palm Beach police fearing that Epstein had molestedher 14-year-old daughter. The girl told detectives she'd been 
nvited to Epstein's mansion, where she was paid $300 after stripping to her underwear and massaging Epstein as he masturbated. Police then located a community college student 
who gave a sworn statement that she had taken six girls, all betweenthe ages of 14 and 16, to Epstein. 
olice referred the case to the FBI. In September 2007, Dershowitz helped Epstein negotiate a then-secret non-prosecu on agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office, which deferred

Salacious new chapter n Florida billionaire's sex scandal I The Miami Herald 1/2/15 6:11 PM 
In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to a state charge of solicitingprostitution with a minor and served 13 months of an 18-month sentence. 
After his conviction, Epstein's story grew even more bizarre, with anonymous women accusinghim in federal court of conspiring with Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late British 
mediabaron Robert Maxwell, to operate an international underage sex ring. 
Edwards, the Fort Lauderdale lawyer, and Paul Cassell, a former federal judge who now teaches law at the University of Utah, filed a Jane Doe lawsuit against the U.S. government in 
July 2008, alleging that Epstein had committed crimes against their clients, including sex trafficking of children by fraud. 
The case, whichhas been pending for more than sixyears before U.S. District JudgeKenneth A. Marra, initially involved two women, identified as Jane Doe#1 and Jane Doe #2, who 
said they were sexually abused by Epstein and trafficked as minors. 
On Dec.30, 2014, Edwards asked to have two new accusers added to the case —identified as Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4. 
Jane Doe#3 alleges inthe court filing that Maxwell and Epstein kept her as a sex slave from 1999 through20002, when she escaped to an unspecified foreign country. 
Epstein forced Jane Doe#3, who was then a minor, to have sex with politically connected and wealthy people , the court filing alleges. 
Epstein's purpose in 'lending' Jane Doe [along with otheryoung girls] to such powerful people [was] to ingratiate himself with them for business, personal, political and financial 
gain, as well as to obtain blackmail information, the filing alleges. 
Jane Doe#3 identifies one of the men she was forced to have sex with as Dershowitz, a former Harvard lawprofessorandhigh- profile criminal defense lawyer. 
Dershowitz was an eye-witnesstothe sexual abuse of many other minors by Epstein and several of Epste n's co-conspirators , the filing alleges. 
Dershowitz denied the claims, describing them as part of an extortionplot. He called the filing the sleaziest legal document I have ever seen. 
They manipulated a young, suggestible woman who was interested inmoney, Dershowitz said. 
Dershowitz said he intends to file complaints against Edwards and Cassell. This is a disbarrable offense, and they will be disbarred, Dershowitz said. They will rue the day they ever 
made this false charge againstme. 
Knowingly making defamatory statements in courtrecords can be grounds for disbarment. Jack Thompson, a Miami lawyer who campaigned against violent video games and the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028922 
group 2 Live Crew, was disbarred forprofess onal misconduct that included making defamatory statements. 
We're not comment ngon the story beyond our legal pleading, Cassel said. 
In the most recent court filing, Jane Doe #3 alleges that Epstein forced her to have sex with many otherpowerful men, including numerous prominent American politicians, powerful 
business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known prime minister, and otherworld leaders. 
The filing names Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, as one of those world leaders.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013180.txt,"264 13 Local, Global and Glocal Knowledge Representation

does imply constraints on how knowledge representation in the brain may work, but these are
relatively loose constraints. These constraints do imply that, for instance, the brain is neither a
relational database (in which information is stored in a wholly localized manner) nor a collection
of “grandmother neurons” that respond individually to high-level percepts or concepts; nor a
simple Hopfield type neural net (in which all memories are attractors globally distributed across
the whole network). But they don’t tell us nearly enough to, for instance, create a formal neural
net model that can confidently be said to represent knowledge in the manner of the human brain.

As a first example of the current state of knowledge, we’ll discuss here a series of papers
regarding the neural representation of visual stimuli [QaGKKF05, QKIKF 08], which deal with
the fascinating discovery of a subset of neurons in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) that are
selectively activated by strikingly different pictures of given individuals, landmarks or objects,
and in some cases even by letter strings. For instance, in their 2005 paper titled Tnvariant visual
representation by single neurons in the human brain”, it is noted that

in one case, a unit responded only to three completely different images of the ex-president Bill Clinton.
Another unit (from a different patient) responded only to images of The Beatles, another one to cartoons
from The Simpson’s television series and another one to pictures of the basketball player Michael Jordan.

Their 2008 follow-up paper backed away from the more extreme interpretation in the title as
well as the conclusion, with the title “Sparse but not ‘Grandmother-cell’ coding in the medial
temporal lobe.” As the authors emphasize there,

Given the very sparse and abstract representation of visual information by these neurons, they could in
principle be considered as ‘grandmother cells’. However, we give several arguments that make such an
extreme interpretation unlikely.

TL neurons are situated at the juncture of transformation of percepts into constructs that can be
consciously recollected. These cells respond to percepts rather than to the detailed information falling
on the retina. Thus, their activity reflects the full transformation that visual information undergoes
hrough the ventral pathway. A crucial aspect of this transformation is the complementary development
of both selectivity and invariance. The evidence presented here, obtained from recordings of single neuron
activity in humans, suggests that a subset of MTL neurons possesses a striking invariant representation
or consciously perceived objects, responding to abstract concepts rather than more basic metric details.
This representation is sparse, in the sense that responsive neurons fire only to very few stimuli (and are
mostly silent except for their preferred stimuli), but it is far from a Grandmother-cell representation.
The fact that the MTL represents conscious abstract information in such a sparse and invariant way is

consistent with its prominent role in the consolidation of long-term semantic memories.

It’s interesting to note how inadequate the [QIK KF 08] data really is for exploring the notion
of glocal memory in the brain. Suppose it’s the case that individual visual memories corre-
spond to keys consisting of small neuronal subnetworks, and maps consisting of larger neuronal
subnetworks. Then it would be not at all surprising if neurons in the “key” network corre-
sponding to a visual concept like “Bill Clinton’s face” would be found to respond differentially
to the presentation of appropriate images. Yet, it would also be wrong to overinterpret such
data as implying that the key network somehow comprises the “representation” of Bill Clinton’s
face in the individual’s brain. In fact this key network would comprise only one aspect of said
representation.

In the glocal memory hypothesis, a visual memory like “Bill Clinton’s face” would be hypoth-
esized to correspond to an attractor spanning a significant subnetwork of the individual’s brain

‘A dinner party was held on the fourth night, but it was very formal and businesslike. I saw no girls —

young or otherwise — at the time. We would never have willingly put ourselves in that kind of situation.’

The following day they were flown to St Thomas and transferred by boat to Epstein’s island house, a
sprawling single-storey complex with white walls and a blue roof, maintained by several gardeners, two

boat captains, two laundry ladies and two other women who cared for the house.

Again the couple were there to observe, but after three days they were woken in the night by a phone call
telling them they had to leave the island because a VIP was making an unexpected visit. They were later

told by staff that the guest had been Prince Andrew.
They went back to New York, where Ghislaine explained more of their duties.
‘She said we had to keep quiet about what we saw or heard on the island,’ Cathy recalls.

‘She told us that although Mr Epstein and she were a couple, we would see lots of beautiful girls passing in

and out, but that was his nature.
‘She said that he gets what he wants but that she was always the “Queen Bee” and the one in charge.

‘She often described herself in this way. Although she could be very friendly, I discovered that she was also

rather arrogant.’

Miles took up his post in March 1999 and Cathy followed a month later. Miles realised the kind of lifestyle

their boss enjoyed when, on his first day, Epstein arrived with five young ladies in tow.

‘One was definitely under age, but she had a letter of consent from her parents and was under the
guardianship of a model agency,’ he says.

The Alexanders admit finding a box of sex toys in Friends in high places: Lord Mandelson has also
Epstein’s bedroom, but insist they never saw nor vacationed on Epstein's island
organised any raunchy parties for him or his guests. Cathy recalls that Prince Andrew was the first guest to

visit during their tenure.

‘The Duke came via helicopter with his bodyguard and a woman in her 30s, who said she was a brain

surgeon,’ Cathy says dryly.

‘She was tall, bleached blonde and had big boobs. They shared a room and spent most of their time on the

beach windsurfing, sailing or doing other water sports.

How Avenatti May Have Crossed The Line Into Extortion





By Andrew Strickler 


Share us on: By Andrew Strickler 


Law360 (March 26, 2019, 9:52 PM EDT) -- A day after being accused of trying to extort Nike, attorney and President Donald Trump antagonist Michael Avenatti was on the offensive Tuesday with allegations of corruption on the part of the company, but those counterpunches likely won't help him dodge federal charges that he went beyond hardball advocacy.

According to prosecutors, Avenatti pressed Nike to pay him millions of dollars as an internal investigator in addition to the much smaller figure he demanded from the sports gear giant for his youth basketball coach client.

The lack of nexus between his client's alleged injury at Nike's hands and Avenatti's demand for eight-figure fees as an investigator puts the allegations well beyond the realm of aggressive posturing and into the parameters of federal extortion statutes, said criminal defense attorney Jeremy Saland of Crotty Saland PC.

Being a blowhard is not illegal, but whether what he's claiming Nike did is fact or fiction doesn't justify trying to enrich himself with a job that doesn't help remedy a wrong suffered by a client, Saland said.

On Monday, federal officials in New York arrested Avenatti, charging the pugnacious Los Angeles lawyer with threatening Nike with a stock-price-sinking press conference about recruitment misconduct if it didn't pay up.

Avenatti, who purported to be representing the coach of a youth basketball team once sponsored by Nike, demanded $1.5 million for the client, who had recently seen Nike drop its support, according to the charges. Separately, Avenatti and another attorney — an unnamed co-conspirator since identified as celebrity defense attorney Mark Geragos — also demanded Nike hire them to conduct an internal investigation related to amateur player recruiting.

The cost: at least $12 million and as much as $25 million. Prosecutors said Avenatti was also recorded at a March 21 meeting with Nike lawyers at Boies Schiller Flexner LLP offering to end the entire matter, with no bad publicity for Nike, for $22.5 million.

If the company didn't agree, Avenatti threatened an immediate press conference amid the NCAA basketball tournament about Nike making payments to youth players and their families, prosecutors said, an event he promised would snowball into more bad press and people coming forward with claims of recruiting malfeasance.

In a recorded phone call, Avenatti told Nike attorneys that if the company tried to negotiate a cap on the investigation fees, he would go public and take a billion dollars off your client's market cap, according to the complaint. At a March 21 meeting in New York, Avenatti allegedly continued to wield threats and press for the investigator role, at one point asking Nike attorneys if they'd ever had the balls of a client in [their] hands.

Michael Avenatti may be the best lawyer in the world, according to Michael Avenatti, but there are appropriate courses of conduct to address an alleged wrongdoing, and I don't see how a demand of, 'Give me a job and pay me $12 million,' is ever going to make the client whole, Saland said.

Adam Felsenstein, a white collar defense specialist at Gallet Dreyer & Berkey LLP, called the prosecutor's narrative very extortive, particularly on the allegation regarding Avenatti's demand to be hired directly by the company. If that element of the charges is well-founded, it would effectively leave Avenatti without a cloak of legitimacy that he was acting solely to resolve a dispute on behalf of his client.

The complaint doesn't even refer to anticipated litigation. It's just, 'I'm going to reveal embarrassing information unless you pay me.' And once you start asking for money for yourself like that, you trend into extortion, Felsenstein said.

Barry Temkin of Mound Cotton Wollan & Greengrass LLP similarly characterized the alleged scheme as brazen, and voiced doubt Avenatti would be able to argue that he could pressure Nike to hire him as an investigator and stay within the legal lines.

He's going to them with a demand that they hire him even as he's threatening them with this press conference, which is screwed up on a lot of levels, he said. It's ambulance chasing, which is unethical. It's a conflict of interest, and who would want to hire someone to do an internal investigation who is also shaking them down?

Avenatti was arrested Monday just after he announced via Twitter an impending press conference about a major high school/college basketball scandal and criminal conduct at the highest levels of Nike.

In an unrelated action, federal officials in California charged Avenatti on Monday with defrauding a client out of a $1.6 million settlement and lying to a Mississippi bank to secure loans for his firm and a coffee business.

Avenatti was released in New York later in the day after posting a $300,000 bond. He is due in court on the California case on Monday. He did not respond to multiple requests for comment Tuesday. A message seeking comment from Geragos was also not returned.

Avenatti shot to national prominence last year representing Stormy Daniels, the porn actress who took $130,000 from Trump lawyer Michael Cohen to stay quiet about her affair with the future president and then sued to void the deal.

The brash lawyer seemed to relish needling Trump and others on countless cable news appearances and on Twitter. He also faced mounting legal troubles in the form of a $10 million judgment stemming from the breakup of his old firm, Eagan Avenatti LLP, and accusations from former partners that he hid millions in assets. Avenatti also split with Daniels in recent weeks.

Daniels said Monday she was saddened but not shocked by news of Avenatti's arrest, and that he had dealt with her extremely dishonestly.

Despite the recent setbacks, Avenatti was back on Twitter less than 24 hours after his arrest, saying Nike had made payments to the mother of Phoenix Suns player DeAndre Ayton while he was a college player and to University of Oregon center Bol Bol.

A lot of people at Nike will have to account for their criminal conduct, starting with Carlton DeBose & moving higher up. The diversion charade they orchestrated against me will be exposed, he tweeted. DeBose is the head of Nike's youth basketball division.

A Nike spokesperson on Tuesday referred to a company statement that it has been cooperating with a government investigation into NCAA basketball for more than a year, and would not be extorted or hide information relevant to that probe.

The case is U.S. v. Avenatti, case number 19-mj-2927, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.

Here’s what our U.S. Balanced portfolio looks like right now 1 .
This week’s note reviews some of the factors that affect these
allocations: healthy private sector profits, problems left
over from the recession, and interventions by the world’s
legislatures, treasuries, central banks and multilateral
agencies. This latter group reminds me of the ancient Greek
Gods: they are very powerful, but sometimes flawed, as their
interventions in the world did not always work as planned.
We are getting closer to the Twilight of the Gods, a time when
they are either running out of ammunition, or the ability to use
it without causing even more problems. If so, the private
sector will have to recover on its own. The consequence of
these cross-currents: we invest in equities, but hold 10%-15%
less than what we normally would at this point of the business
cycle, and are positioning for a single-digit year on equities.

PROFITS
The primary (and perhaps sole) justification for carrying the levels of risk shown above relates to corporate profits. As
shown below, profit margins have reached levels not seen in decades. The challenge, which we have discussed many times
before: what is driving these margins 2 ? One useful way to deconstruct profits is to measure them from peak to peak, and
analyze what changed. As shown in the first chart, S&P 500 profit margins increased by ~1.3% from 2000 to 2007. There are a
lot of moving parts in the margin equation, but as shown in the second chart, reductions in wages and benefits explain the
majority of the net improvement in margins. This trend has continued; as we have shown several times over the last two
years, US labor compensation is now at a 50-year low relative to both company sales and US GDP (see EoTM April 26, 2011).

Last week’s train wreck of a labor report included the dour news that labor compensation is now firmly negative in real
terms. Why is US labor compensation so low? The lingering excess labor supply from the recession is one reason, but the 2
billion people in Asia joining the global labor force over the last two decades is another. As shown on next page, EM wages for
production workers remain well below US levels 3 . Another factor helping profit margins: increased US imports of intermediate
goods from Asia. As shown in the accompanying chart, imports from Asia have been rising, and over the same time frame,
Asian import prices only increased at around 1% per year.
1 We use these portfolios to manage assets for clients who give us discretion over their funds, and to provide recommendations to those who
don’t. This is one of several model portfolios we manage globally. They differ by jurisdiction, risk tolerance, tax treatment, eligibility to
purchase vehicles designated for qualified purchasers, and other factors.
2 Empirical Research Partners does more work on corporate profits than anyone else we’ve seen. This section draws on research that Mike
Goldstein at Empirical shared with us at a recent investment committee meeting.
3 A recent study from Boston Consulting Group maintains that the gap between China and the US will close in 5 years. BCG believes that
with Chinese wages growing at 15%-20% per year, US wages growing at 3% per year, higher productivity in the US and rising shipping and
inventory costs, the China advantage will disappear within the decade. Some of these assumptions seem aggressive to apply in perpetuity.

To summarize, we expect today’s margins to last a while longer, since relative costs won’t converge overnight. But we are not
inclined to pay a high multiple for them, given their reliance on weak labor compensation, which in turn requires large
government transfers. The good news: markets are not applying high multiples right now, which is why we own the equities
we do. However, questions about the large but shrinking public sector toolkit knock 10%-15% off of our equity
allocations, compared to where we would normally expect to be 2 years after a recession. We walk through 4 instances
of this below, as it relates to US fiscal policy, oil prices, Chinese inflation and the European periphery.
Twilight of the Gods, part 1: Limited room for fiscal policy to invigorate the US recovery

Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Empirical Research Partners.
The government is facing the unappealing task of having to increase the Federal debt ceiling above 100% of GDP for the
first time since the end of WWII, and only the second time since the debt ceiling was established in 1917
The government has already run out of money from traditional sources. As shown below, since May 16, 2011, the US
Treasury has been raiding the cash, securities and borrowing capacity of government employee retirement and other funds.
Of $270 billion of such balances which existed in May, around 75% has already been used up. There’s not much leeway
left, which is why the government will probably run out of money some time in August.
The debate about the existing Federal debt is the lesser of two problems. As shown on the following page, the present value
of unfunded entitlement obligations (e.g., future debt) dwarfs the existing debt. That’s why there’s so much talk about a
deal to stabilize the long term trajectory of the budget deficit.
The rest is all speculation. The table on the next page shows the revenue and spending factors in play. It’s too early to know
what kind of deal will be crafted. We believe that the deal with be composed of 80% spending cuts and 20% revenue/tax
increases (rather than 50-50), and will be closer to $2 trillion than $4 trillion. While it’s possible that another dose of fiscal
stimulus will be built into the debt ceiling agreement, it might not be that large, and its impact could easily be offset by a
subdued consumer response due to expectations of higher taxes in the long run (e.g., Ricardian equivalence).

Twilight of the Gods, part 2: Can releases of strategic oil reserves keep oil prices down for more than a few weeks?
International Energy Agency member countries agreed to release strategic petroleum reserves to bring oil prices down. They
have a lot of ammunition to do so; government-controlled oil inventories are at least 1.5 billion barrels, and so far, all they have
done is authorize the release of 60 million barrels. The timeline suggests that oil markets began focusing on the release of the
SPR after the Libyan shutdown, the lack of a sufficient OPEC supply response, and weak economic data in the US. As shown
below, oil prices have been rising since the announcement of the supply increase. Are IEA members committed to doing it
again if oil prices reach their May levels?

The problem for the IEA is that the tightness in oil markets
is not just a sudden supply shock. As shown in the bottom
chart we first published in March, there was not much slack
even before the Libyan shutdown, and oil demand is expected
to rise 1-2 mm bpd as the developed and emerging world
continue to grow. One of our colleagues used to work at the
IEA, and in a recent piece 4 , argued that the impact of the SPR
release will be limited to Q3 2011, and that upside oil price
risks to 2012 have increased. Why? The SPR release came at a
time when OPEC tanker traffic made it clear that producing
countries were having problems meeting prior pledges: “As
such, it is difficult to conclude anything except that there is
little or no spare capacity in the oil market”. If that’s the case,
future interventions may not have a lasting impact either.

Twilight of the Gods part 3: Why is everyone assuming that the next Chinese tightening is the last one?
Every time China tightened monetary policy this year, most China research maintained that the tightening cycle is close to its
end. Perhaps; Premier Wen has stated that the country’s efforts to control inflation have worked, that price stability is in an
acceptable range, and that it will drop steadily from here. But last week’s headline inflation release of 6.4% hit a three year
high, and it is not clear to us that China is about to end its various inflation control policy measures.
In favor of Wen’s argument, food inflation has been a large contributor, some of which should be transitory. Blue-ear pig virus
(PRRS) killed hundreds of thousands of pigs in 2010, which affected this year’s supply (2006 was worse). As shown below,
pork prices have soared, but should come down if the supply situation normalizes. [Note: a “Strategic Pork Reserve” can be
released to mitigate price increases]. However, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization 5 , new virulent strains of
the virus have a fatality rate of 20% (even higher for piglets), and what is considered a temporary supply shock may be more
permanent. Chinese pig facilities have the highest animal densities in the world, contributing to the spread of disease to 25 of
China’s 33 provinces. Antibiotics have proven ineffective, and once one pig gets the disease, it tends to spread to the entire
herd in 7-10 days. China has vaccinated 100 million of its 500 million pigs, but existing vaccines do not prevent infection, they
only slow the rate of transmission to other pigs.

A separate issue is that China is doing a lot more to control the supply of money than the cost of money. As shown below, there
have been a lot more increases in bank reserve requirements than interest rate increases. Deposit rates are still negative in real
terms, and bank reserve requirements only affect banks, and not the shadow banking system, which is growing in China.

Forward-looking manufacturing surveys have declined and interbank lending rates (Shibor) have surged, so it’s clear that the
tightening steps are working. But private sector credit is still growing in China, and real estate prices are still rising. The
bottom line is that the substantial stimulus provided by Chinese and other Asian policymakers in the wake of the
recession has not yet been adequately withdrawn, and that more steps will need to be taken to do so.

Twilight of the Gods, part 4:
Is Europe just trying to save its banking system, or is a more comprehensive move towards Federalism underway?
I expected French proposals on a Greek debt exchange to begin to spell out the sacrifices private sector investors will have to
make as Greece spirals towards insolvency. As shown below, I was wrong about that. French proposals don’t entail any
specific commitments by banks, and are merely non-binding indications of interest by banks to roll over debt at some point in
the future as it matures. If bank rollovers of Greek debt or Greek government asset sales fall short of the mark, the EU and IMF
appear committed to providing Greece with funds to pay off maturing debt anyway. The EU taxpayer continues to foot the bill.

So to be clear, the Twilight of the Gods has not arrived in Europe, since the EU appears determined to spend more money
to prevent a sovereign default. I see why they are worried about contagion. The latest signs: Portugal downgraded to junk;
long-term debt of 3 French banks put on downgrade watch; and stress in European unsecured interbank markets 6 , now affecting
Italian banks which rely heavily on them. Italian bank and insurance company holdings of their own government bonds is 2x-
3x higher than the rest of the region, creating the potential for a vicious circle if something goes wrong. Italian banks are bettercapitalized
and have higher quality assets than banks in other European countries, since Italy did not experience a large boombust
in residential property, or a consumer debt binge. However, like Greece and Ireland, Italy’s debt/GDP ratio is above 100%,
and the country suffers from low growth (the lowest in the world from 2000-2010 other than Zimbabwe and Haiti, according to
the Economist). Think about this: Italy has run a primary budget surplus (i.e. ex-interest payments) every year since 1992,
but still hasn’t been able to bring its debt ratios below 100% of GDP. Italy was making progress, but the recession derailed
them, leaving Italy with the same elevated debt burden they started with 20 years ago.
I believe that eventually, the constituency of the European Monetary Union will have to change. However, my colleagues in
J.P. Morgan Securities’ economics group disagree. They believe that the EMU will survive intact, and believe that Europe is
moving towards Federalism, with this crisis as the basis for putting it in place. I have been a skeptic of this idea; how can a
region use the structural failures of its current model as an excuse for expanding it, particularly when popular support for
the European project is at such low levels 7 ? The history of Europe does show that revolutions are often imposed from above
(e.g., Peter the Great, Otto von Bismarck, Napoleon) rather than below, so anything is possible. If my colleagues are right,
losses suffered by holders of Greek, Irish and Portuguese debt may be a lot less than what’s priced in right now. I don’t have
the conviction to make that kind of call, at least not yet; geopolitical investing is a very hard thing to do. We remain cautious
on Europe; are underinvested in government debt, corporate credit and equities across the region; and expect a Greek
sovereign debt restructuring within the next 18 months (see chart from “Five Stages of Greece”, June 30, 2011 ).

6 JP Morgan’s Prime Money Market Fund is indicative of industry concerns about a liquidity squeeze. The fund holds no Greece, Portugal,
Ireland or Spain. Its Italy holdings are less than 2% of the fund, and the portfolio manager does not expect to roll them when they mature.
7 A 2010 Eurobarometer Poll showed very low readings on whether “Membership in the EU is a good thing”. More recently, the centre-left
Foundation for European Progressive Studies polled EU civil servants (a pro-EU constituency if there ever was one) and found that a
majority believe that “the European model has entered into a lasting crisis”. Only a quarter of respondents saw the EU as having evolved
positively over the last decade, or believe that the December 2009 Lisbon Treaty has had a positive effect.

m Joint returns may be filed, usually as an
amended return with a refund claim,
until the three-year limitations period
(or the two-year payment period, if
later) expires. For individuals who filed
2009 tax returns on or before April
15, 2010, the limitations period for
that year is closed. For those who filed
their 2009 returns on an automatic six-
month extension on October 15, 2010,
however, the limitations period for the
2009 tax year remains open until Oc-
tober 15, 2013. To claim joint return
status on an amended 2009 tax return
under the three-year rule, both married
partners’ original tax returns must have
been filed within that extended period.

m ‘Taxpayers who filed protective refund
claims prior to the Supreme Court’s deci-
sion should be on the alert to any forth-
coming IRS guidelines that may facilitate
the agency's processing of those claims.

CCH Tax Briefing

m ‘Taxpayers who had a lower combined
overall tax liability filing as unmarried sin-
gle individuals during an open year appear
to be under no obligation now to file an
amended return to file jointly (or as mar-
ried filing separately if at least one partner
does not consent to a joint return).

IRS Audit Policy. Technically, the IRS, on
audit of an open year for which any previ-
ously-filed return by a married, same-sex
partner used unmarried, single-filer status,
may be able to require that tax be recom-
puted based on either a joint return, or mar-
ried filing separately status return. However,
since audits are under IRS’s discretionary
powers, the consensus among at least some
practitioners, is that IRS National Office
may —and more likely will— direct agents
to by-pass any filing-status issues unless the
taxpayer requests a change.

2013 Tax Year. For 2013 returns that will be
filed in 2014, the Supreme Court’s Windsor
decision presumably relates back to the entire
2013 tax year in determining filing status.

COMMENT. Married partners do not have
the option to file short-year returns as un-
married for the January I — June 26, 2013
period, they must file jointly or married fil-
ing separately for the entire 2013 tax year.

2012 Tax Year. Taxpayers who are on exten-
sion until October 15, 2013 for filing their
2012 tax year returns appear to be required
to file those returns either jointly or married
filing separately. Taxpayers who filed their
2012 tax year returns before June 26, 2013,
as separate, unmarried individuals, however,
may not need to change their filing status to
married filing joint if it would be less favor-
able to their overall tax liability. The IRS

may issue guidance on this issue.

started the conversation, ‘““How was the ranch with the Prince?” It was a

both of them I started to unpack the counter where I had been eating, “I
think he had a really good time, he seemed relaxed during the trip and
when we said good-bye to each other he gave me a kiss.” I went on to tell
them what we did together “I took him horseback riding, nowhere to far
just around the property, um... we went swimming in the pool, and of
course I gave him plenty of massages. He had a massage at least couple
times each day really seeming to enjoy his time there.” It’s what they
wanted to hear, not the truth of how disgusting I had felt over the whole
thing but they already knew the truth anyways, it’s what they had trained
me for in the first place.

Like two proud parents they both looked over me with such content.
“Good, you did really well” Jeffrey complimented me. Turning around to

shopping therapy. I loved the eccentric parts of the city. Every street was
different but the same energetic vibe filled all of them, animated with all
different walks of life. Hanging out at coffee shops reading the newspaper
or a good book was a favorite pastime while in the big apple. Being close
enough to get back to Jeffrey for when he needed me but also far enough
to get away from all of it. Most of the day slipped by without being
missed and [ made my way back to Jeffrey’s.

Making one last pit stop, I walked into an old bookshop to browse at
their assortment of old titles. | wasn’t in any hurry so I took my time

reading the backs of interesting looking books. I bumped into a girl
looking down the same aisle I was down. “Sorry, I’m so clumsy” she was
apologizing for my mistake. “No, no, it was.my fault, I wasn’t looking at
where I was going. I get so wrapped up with my nose in a book and trip
over my own two feet if I’m not careful enough.” We were both giggling
now and I further introduced myself to her. Her name was Valerie or
Vickie or something like that, anyways she was a student at a school for
hairdressing nearby. Chatting away both young and similar interests in
each other’s choice of reading we found it easy to speak with one another.
She wasn’t from around here only being in the city for the last two
months, her parents hated her being here, but were also supportive in her
big decision to move from the countryside in hopes of her accomplishing
her own dreams. Aside from not having her near them, they just wanted
her to be happy and supported in her big decision to move to the city,
helping her pay some of the way.

She was a pretty girl with cherry red hair and soft white skin. Her long
legs were emphasized by the short flowery dress that complimented her
hourglass figure. She would definitely fit the pro quo for going down in
one of Jeffrey’s little black books. Only imagining the look on his face
upon meeting her I could already see his sly grin spread from ear to ear.
Knowing exactly what he would do with her and the very thought of him
tarnishing a sweet country girl such as her just couldn’t be done. It was
the beginning of a turning point in my life that started with realizing | had
a choice at hand and the effect I could have on one person alone. “I must
be off, but it was really nice to meet you.” Bidding her goodnight and
paying for my books I turned around with one last glance over my
shoulder and said. “Good luck in the city!” Leaving that bookshop was a
small step in a growing abundance of larger strides to come. Turning the
corner onto 72 street | had an undeniable feeling in the pit of my
stomach again but this time it wasn’t the familiar hurl of anxiety I was
used too after I had done something [ had wrong that I had regretted, it
was a new feeling of pride and inner strength. I quite liked it a lot, I held
my head high and smiled on the inside when Jeffrey asked me how my
day was and what I got up to, not mentioning I had let one girl slip on
bye.

The icy winter winds faded away making way for the approaching
sunny days that blossomed the colorful shades of spring. This was my
favorite time of the year. Making the most use of his island we spent
countless days of the increasingly hot days there. A constant array of
visiting guests and plentiful young women to flock around keeping them
entertained was the typical lazy afternoon on Little St. Jeff’s. We ate,
drank, and played under the blue blanket of cloudless skies. To many this
lifestyle could seem idyllic, unless you were like me, the one on the other

inhibitors and activators like in real synapses. An individual neuron will
fire if the sum of all the connections multiplied by the weights reaches a
certain pre-determined threshold.

A neural network does not run a program in the conventional
sense, and must be trained through experience rather like a human
brain. The training process allows the weights in the network table to
be adjusted to give the correct result. But, unlike the brain, you can read
the weights and even save them to a disk. The neural network tables
start with random settings. You show the network the letter ‘A’ and
adjust the weights in the tables until it gives a positive answer: ‘It’s an
A. Repeat the process with the other letters until the network correctly
distinguishes them. As you do this a computer algorithm constantly
adjusts the weighting tables using a method called ‘back propagation.

At the end of the training process you can show the network some
new input and see how it does. For example, a letter ‘A that is in a slightly
different font to anything in the training set. Trained neural networks
can perform complex tasks such as recognizing faces or making clinical
diagnoses, and they can be allowed to modify their weighting tables as
they work so they learn from experience in a similar way to a human
brain. Strong AI proponents believe making a thinking machine is just
a matter of building a really large, fast neural network and working out
how to train it efficiently.

Quantum Brains

Conventional wisdom says each brain cell is a single processing unit
making an on-off decision — fire, or don't fire - depending on the state
of its neighbors. But, Stuart Hameroff, Professor of Anesthesiology
at the University of Arizona, thinks neurons are not the fundamental
information-processing unit in the brain. He suggests that this accolade
should go to tubulin. Tubulin is a small, versatile protein that self-
assembles into filaments rather like the way buckyballs - a magnetic
children’s toy — can be arranged. There are two types of tubulin molecule:
a and B. They slot together and wrap around to form a micro tube about
25nm in diameter.

Tubulin micro tubes do several important things in the body.
They form the skeleton of neurons and give them structure. They are
involved in guiding neurons as they grow towards each other to form
new connections, and they also operate in the nucleus of a cell to unzip

the existence of any particular responsive documents. See United States v. Doe, 465 U.S. 605,
613 n.12 (1984) (“The most plausible inference to be drawn from the broad-sweeping subpoenas
is that the Government [is] unable to prove that the subpoenaed documents exist . . . .”).

The first demand for a list of all meetings with any Russian official (or “representative of
Russian business interests”) over 18 months fails for want of specifying particular individuals,
locations, or dates. Moreover, this is not merely a demand to produce existing documents. It is
actually an interrogatory demanding that General Flynn create a new document containing
information that the Committee seeks to discover. This is a demand for direct testimony, not
merely a testimonial act of production. As in Hubbell, General Flynn’s compilation of such a list
would be akin to him “answering a series of interrogatories asking [him] to disclose the
existence and location of [meetings] fitting certain broad descriptions.” Hubbell, 530 U.S. at 41.
The Court in Hubbell held that the witness could not be compelled to prepare such a list without
violating his Fifth Amendment privilege. Finally, the nebulous term “representative of Russian
business interests” necessarily would require General Flynn, in responding to the request, to
testify as to who is or is not a “representative of Russian business interests.” This too constitutes
direct testimony that is clearly covered by the Fifth Amendment privilege.

The subpoena’s second and third demands are even broader in scope than the first, given
their request for all communication records with any Russian official. The complete lack of
specificity in the request makes clear that, unlike in Fisher, the existence of any document
responsive to the Committee’s request is far from a “foregone conclusion.” Fisher, 425 U.S. at
411. The fact that the subpoena also demands all documents in the custody, control or
possession of General Flynn’s “agents, employees, or representatives” underscores that the
Committee does not know whether responsive documents exist, who may possess them, or
where they are located. Were General Flynn to provide responsive documents, he would be
providing compelled testimony about “the documents’ existence, custody, and authenticity.”
Hubbell, 530 U.S. at 28. This is precisely the sort of testimonial information that the Fifth
Amendment privilege is designed to protect from compelled disclosure. See In re Grand Jury
Subpoena, Dated Apr. 18, 2003, 383 F.3d 905, 911 (9th Cir. 2004) (finding an act of production
to be testimonial in nature where a “subpoena seeks all documents within a category but fails to
describe those documents with any specificity . . . .”).

The Committee must demonstrate more than general knowledge that a meeting may
have occurred; the Committee must demonstrate “knowledge of the existence and possession of
the actual documents” in order to prove that the existence and location of the documents is a
“foregone conclusion.” Id. at 910 (emphasis added). The Committee simply has not met its
burden of showing its “pre-subpoena knowledge of the existence, possession, and authenticity of
the subpoenaed documents with reasonable particularity.” Ponds, 454 F.3d at 324.

Woman who sued convicted billionaire over
sex abuse levels claims at his friends

By JOSH GERSTEIN |
12/31/14 6:38 PM EST

A woman allegedly kept as a sex slave by politically-connected billionaire investor Jeffrey
Epstein, who went to jail for having sex with underaged girls, is accusing several prominent
friends of the financier of having taken part in the debauchery, according to a new court filing.

The woman—referred to in court papers as Jane Doe #3— leveled the allegations Tuesday
against Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz and Britain’s Prince Andrew, as well as
British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell and French model scout Jean Luc Brunel.

Dershowitz flatly denied the claims about him Wednesday in an interview with POLITICO.
“Tt’s totally, unequivocally and completely false,” the celebrated attorney said.

A spokesman for Prince Andrew denied the allegations Friday, while a lawyer who handled
related matters for Maxwell did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment. Representatives of
Brunel's modeling firm also did not reply to e-mail messages.

The accusations came in a long-running lawsuit charging federal prosecutors in Florida with
violating a victims-rights law by failing to consult with Epstein’s victims before signing off on a
plea deal. That pact ruled out any federal prosecution of the investor, who agreed to plead guilty
to two state prostitution-related felony charges. Lawyers for the victims have described the
arrangement as a sweetheart dea] the well-connected Epstein and his high-powered legal team
achieved by putting pressure on prosecutors.

Epstein served 13 months of an 18-month sentence on the two state charges before being
released in 2009. He's now a registered sex offender.

The new court filing, submitted by Florida lawyer Brad Edwards and former federal judge Paul
Cassell in a federal court in West Palm Beach, Fla., asked that Jane Doe #3 and another woman
be allowed to join the pending case over the victims’ rights claim.

“Epstein. ..trafficked Jane Doe #3 for sexual purposes to many other powerful men, including

numerous prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a
well-known Prime Minister, and other world leaders. Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to describe

New Tariffs — Trade War
Robert Lawrence Kuhn, September 18, 2018
HOST: China imposes another
$60 billion of tariffs on US
imports a day after President
Trump announces tariffs on $200
billion of Chinese goods. Well,
let's get more on that story now.
We're joined from Beijing by
Robert Lawrence Kuhn who
advises China's leaders and
multinational corporations. He's
also the author of How China's
Leaders Think. How do they
think about this? It's difficult to
know where this might end.
RLK: Let's look at what just
happened. China retaliated with
$60 billion worth of U.S. goods
that it was putting tariffs on, but
half of it was five percent, half
was 10 percent, which is less
than the American side, which
was 10 percent on all. And the
$60 billion is proportional in the
sense that it is about 40 percent
of the total US exports to China.
Just as the $200 billion was
about 40 percent of the little bit
more than $500 billion that
China exports to the US. So
that's the proportionality.
RLK: There's a lot of talk there
might have been more
countermeasures like selling
treasury bonds or disrupting
American companies. That hasn't
occurred yet. China is sending
signals that it's ratcheting down
the escalation, not trying to
escalate it. China has to
respond. The government of
China, the Communist Party of
China, the leading Party, the
ruling party here, has two big
facets that justifies its
legitimacy.
RLK: One is the economic
growth. This is the 40th
anniversary of reform and
opening up — China's economic
miracle. Increasing GDP per
capita is almost 50 times,
making the standards of living of
the vast majority of people quite
decent. Second area is national
rejuvenation, national pride. And
so the trade war affects both.
You have economics, and the
pride: the economics, the tariffs,
are certainly suboptimal in all
respects for all countries, but
China must respond because it
has to maintain the dignity of
the country, but it does so in a
way to signal that it wants this
to resolve.
RLK: It won't resolve soon. No
one expects it before the midterm
elections. But it's very
important to understand from
the US point of view what the
real issues are and where we
seek the solution.
HOST: What are the real issues?
RLK: There are five real issues
and I do not include the trade
deficit — because, obviously the
trade deficit is complicated. You
have components coming from
other countries that is counted
as part of the trade deficit, but
China gets no benefit from them.
An iPhone for example. Maybe,
China gets 6 or 10 percent of the
cost of roughly $350 for a $1000
retail price. China has also
service purchases that's not
included in the trade deficit,
something like $40 billion per
year — tourists, students.
RLK: But there are five big
issues that are really critical.
Opening up of China's markets
which have been closed. They're
making some progress, not
enough. Intellectual property:
this is an area that China really
has made substantial progress.
Again, not enough, need to do
more, but they've made
substantial progress. This is
affecting Chinese companies and
China knows it needs to improve
IP protection.
RLK: Third is industrial
espionage, a very sensitive area.
Cyber theft: China has decreased
it. It's a complicated area. It
needs to do more. Hard to know
what the government does and
doesn't do, but everybody knows
that's looked at.
RLK: Fourth is technology
transfer. And then government
support of new technologies.
The last is the most sensitive
one.
HOST: Robert Lawrence Kuhn,
we’re going to have to leave it
there. Lots to talk about. We do
appreciate your time.

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010962.txt,"And I repeat that most other structures are not meant to be resold. Productive plant
is customized to original owners. Tract housing is not, but becomes adapted to them.
Original plant operators and homeowners typically expect to stay put. Most do.
When they do, their own valuations are higher than would likely be realized in sale.
Owners’ valuations matter. Economics is more than prediction of sales prices. It is
prediction of behavior. It is the owner’s valuation of an asset, not a hypothetical

outside valuation, that predicts what he will do to exploit and defend it.

My depreciation theory does not jolt settled belief as forcibly as free growth theory
or the pay rule and Y rule do. It contradicts only a minor feature of the national
accounts. But it contradicts that diametrically, and adds clarity to the pay rule too. It
is also original as far as | know. Who has said such a thing before? All the more fun
and satisfaction in finding out and setting the record straight. There are giants out
there, whether I ever make it to their shoulders or not, and economic history means

identifying them.

Retirement Theory

Retirement generally means the period or first moment when people end the
careers for which their training has been specialized. The reason is typically not
diminished skills and performance just yet, as age-wage profiles show no little or no
drop in pay toward the end. I think itis more that we and our bosses see the drop

coming.

Literal pay is typically zero in retirement. Instead we earn imputed pay for taking
care of ourselves and one another, and for driving the grandkids to the zoo. These
services are tangible, not psychic, in that they save the hire of others to do the same.
The imputed pay is what the others would have charged. But it typically is not
enough to meet our consumption needs. Retirees must typically draw down savings
or depend on “social transfer payments”, meaning support from government or

family or foundations, to make ends meet.

Donald Trump And The Decline Of American Character--A Cautionary Tale

“We don’t want the noise about these drugs to be price,” says Leonard Schleifer, the chief executive and
founder of Regeneron. “We have to make sure that people get access to the drug for a fair price if they’re
insured, for free if they’re not insured, or at a discount if they’re under-insured.”

Praluent’s price is 46% higher than that forecast by Evercore ISI, an investment bank, and it is being approved
for a larger group of patients than many Wall Street analysts expected following a meeting convened by the
FDA to analyze the data on the drug. Some doctors argued its use should be restricted mainly to patients with
FH. But Mark Schoenebaum, Evercore ISI’s pharmaceutical analyst, says that investors were initially
disappointed because they had hoped the FDA would greenlight the drug for an even broader group.
Regeneron shares were down 2.5% in afternoon trading before they were halted pending news.

But doctors may prescribe the drug more widely than the label suggests. A survey of physicians published this
morning by Geoffrey Porges, an biotechnology analyst at investment bank Sanford C. Bernstein, found that
they would use the drug in 30% to 40% of patients who had already had heart attacks. He wrote that 2020
sales of Praluent could be as high as $4.8 billion.

In the survey, doctors expressed a preference for Praluent. One advantage of Regeneron’s drug is that doctors
will be able to start it at a lower, 75 milligram dose.

Schleifer, who is a medical doctor and, incidentally, a billionaire thanks to his Regeneron stake, says that the
company expects that as many as 8 million people who don’t have their cholesterol well-controlled could be
candidates for Praluent. He emphasized, though, that until larger studies prove the drug prevents heart attacks
and strokes patients should always choose statins first. It will have sales representatives a

Insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers, who help insurers and employers manage drug costs, are
going to do their best to restrict use of Praluent, though. Brennan, the CVS Caremark executive, says that he
expects patients will need to have medical records documenting that they have already taken statins. Those not
taking statins would need a blood test confirming that a statin caused elevations in muscle or liver enzymes,
not just complaints that they were achy. “We’re not trying to replace statins,” says Schliefer, the Regeneron
CEO.

Most people who have muscle problems from statins do not have those elevated muscle enzymes, says Nissen,
the Cleveland Clinic cardiologist, who is conducting a clinical trial Amgen and Pfizer, which is also
developing a similar cholesterol drug. He says he has patients who are “desperate” to take a statin but who
cannot tolerate it because of muscle pain but do not have elevated muscle enzymes.

Dehspite significant progress over the last decades, high cholesterol remains a leading concern in the U.S. and
globally, said Olivier Brandicourt, M.D., Chief Executive Officer, Sanofi. Praluent demonstrates the power
of the Sanofi and Regeneron alliance to deliver a first-in-class therapy in the U.S. for patients in need. Sanofi
has a strong cardiovascular heritage and dedication to these patients, and we look forward to working with
other regulatory authorities to make Praluent available to patients worldwide.

We are grateful to the thousands of patients and investigators worldwide who participated in the ODYSSEY
clinical trial program, said Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., Founder, President, and Chief Executive

| believe the women movement to be one of the most fascinating phenomena of
our times. The woman’s role has changed so much in modern society with more
women taking leadership positions and starting their own companies. The modern
woman is wearing more hats than ever. In the 80-s, a successful woman was
expected to pursue an education and then to get married and raise children. Right
now, women are expected to have successful careers, be equal financial
contributors to the family, and yet maintain their traditional “feminine” roles,
including taking care of the home, cooking, and raising kids.

Yet women with full-time jobs still earn only about 77 percent of their male
counterparts’ earnings. About four-in-ten employed women say they have
experienced some form of gender discrimination at work. There is also a serious
gender gap in startup rates of men and women, where there are about seven
women entrepreneurs for every ten men entrepreneurs. The statistics is pretty
gloomy in both corporate and startup world. The share of female Fortune 500
CEOs has dropped by 25% in 2018 to 5%. Female founders receive only 2% percent
of the venture capital. Nevertheless, female-founded startups generate more
revenue and do it with less funding.

| think networking a paramount to business and personal success. For ages, men
had men only clubs, including cigar clubs, university clubs, golf clubs etc. Even
nowadays, male investors and intrapreneurs would go out for drinks and talk about
business. Women are starting to do it, but just don’t do it enough. Curated
networking, right introductions, and a solid community would help narrow the
gender gap.

You were a model, then ran a nonprofit, and now you've started WE Talks.
Where did you learn to have the courage to put yourself out there and take
risks again and again?

| think risk taking is in my DNA. | grew up playing tennis competing on a Junior
Circuit and simply couldn’t envision a predictable and “normal” life in Moscow. |

information” to mean information that:

(A) is derived from the independent knowledge

or analysis of a whistleblower; (B) is not known

to the Commission from any other source, unless

the whistleblower is the original source of the

requirements and certain limitations that apply, see Section 922 of the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, available

and the final rules on eligibility, Exchange Act Rule 21F-8, 17 C.ER.§
240.2 1F-8.
3% For example, the rules: (1) make a whistleblower eligible for an award.
if the whistleblower reports original information internally, and the
company informs the SEC about the violations; (2) give whistleblowers
120 days to report information to the SEC after first reporting
internally and still be treated as if he or she had reported to the SEC

at the earlier reporting date , thus preserving their “place in line” for

a possible whistleblower award from the SEC; and (3) provide that a
whistleblower’s voluntary participation in an entity's internal compliance
and reporting systems is a factor that can increase the amount of an
award, and that a whistleblower’s interference with internal compliance
and reporting system is a factor that can decrease the amount of an award.
See Exchange Act Rule 21E, 17 C.ER. § 240.21F,

36 See Exchange Act Rule 21F-7(b), 17 C.ER. § 240.21F-7(b).

397 For example, SEC staff will not disclose a whistleblower’s identity in
response to requests under the Freedom of Information Act. However,
there are limits on SEC’s ability to shield a whistleblower’s identity,

and in certain circumstances SEC must disclose it to outside entities.
For example, in an administrative or court proceeding, SEC may be
required to produce documents or other information that would

reveal the whistleblower’s identity. In addition, as part of ongoing

SEC investigatory responsibilities, SEC staff may use information
provided by a whistleblower during the course of the investigation. In
appropriate circumstances, SEC may also provide information, subject
to confidentiality requirements, to other governmental or regulatory
entities. Exchange Act Rule 21F-7(a), 17 C.AR. 240.21F-7(a).

398 Although SEC does not have an opinion procedure release process,
it has declared its decision to follow the guidance announced through
DOJ’s FCPA Opinion Release Procedure. US. Sec. and Exchange
Comm., SEC Release No. 34-17099 (Aug. 29, 1980), available at hetp://
www.sec.gov/news/digest/1980/dig082980.pdf. SEC Release No. 34-
17099 stated that, to encourage issuers to take advantage of the DOJ’s
FCPA Review Procedure, as a matter of prosecutorial discretion, SEC
would “not take enforcement action alleging violations of Section 30A
in any case where an issuer has sought and obtained an FCPA Review
letter from the Department, prior to May 31, 1981, stating that the
Department will not take enforcement action under Section 30A with
respect to the transaction involved.” Jd. The release further noted that it
would revisit this policy once the DOJ had evaluated the results of the
FCPA Review Procedure after its first year of operation. A second release
stated that the SEC would continue to adhere to the policy announced
in Release No. 34-17099. USS. Sec. and Exchange Comm., SEC Release
No. 34-18255 (Nov. 13, 1981), available at http://www.sec.gov/news/

So despite their many faults and deplorable record on human rights,
the Assads have treated their chemical arsenal with considerable care.
But as the country potentially descends into chaos, will that hold
true?

Let's start with the possibility of civil war. According to researchers
at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, open
sources indicate that there are at least four, and potentially five,
chemical weapons production facilities in Syria. One or two are
located near Damascus, the other three situated in Hama, Latakia, and
al-Safira village, near the city of Aleppo. Hama is one of the hotbeds
of the Syrian revolt, which Assad's tanks attacked in early August and
where, more recently, fighting has severely damaged the city's
hospitals. Latakia is another center of unrest; it was shelled by the
Syrian Navy in mid-August. Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city has
also seen significant demonstrations.

If anti-Assad insurgents take up arms, the chemical sites, as symbols
of regime's authority, could become strategic targets. And, if mass
defections occur from the Syrian army, there may be no one left to
defend the sites against seizure. This could lead to disastrous
outcomes -- including confiscation of the chemical weapons by a
radical new national government, or sale of the weapons as war booty
to organized non-state actors or criminal groups.

In such chaos, no one can predict who might control the weapons or
where they might be taken. With these chemical weapons in the
hands of those engaged in a possible civil war, the risks that they
would be used would increase substantially. The problem would be
worsened further if some possessors were not fully aware of the
extent of the weapons' deadly effects.

And let's imagine that Assad is eventually removed: What leaders
would gain control of these weapons after he departed? Saudi-backed
Sunni groups? Iran-backed Shia organizations? Whoever they might

politically active academia, multiple political parties and, judging by the amount of news coverage,
probably more journalists per capita than any other country in the world — many of whom are there
expressly to cover the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Meanwhile, the Arab and Iranian regimes rule over some 350 million people, and most remain brutal,
closed and autocratic, permitting little or no internal dissent. The plight of their citizens who would most
benefit from the kind of attention a large and well-financed international human rights organization can
provide is being ignored as Human Rights Watch’s Middle East division prepares report after report on
Israel.

Human Rights Watch has lost critical perspective on a conflict in which Israel has been repeatedly
attacked by Hamas and Hezbollah, organizations that go after Israeli citizens and use their own people as
human shields. These groups are supported by the government of Iran, which has openly declared its
intention not just to destroy Israel but to murder Jews everywhere. This incitement to genocide is a
violation of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.”

Only by returning to its founding mission and the spirit of humility that animated it can Human Rights
Watch resurrect itself as a moral force in the Middle East and throughout the world. If it fails to do that,
its credibility will be seriously undermined and its important role in the world significantly diminished.

= Amnesty International, which began as an organization dedicated to the freeing of political prisoners from
repressive regimes and won the Nobel Peace Prize for its noble efforts, has now turned into a hard-left political
lobby that elevates its ideology above its commitment to neutral advocacy for the victims of repression. Consider
its 2005 report on rapes and honor killings perpetrated against Palestinian women by Palestinian men in the West
Bank and Gaza. Such violence is a serious problem, especially in the Arab and Muslim world, because so few
leaders within these groups are prepared to condemn it and so many even justify it as a necessary means of
maintaining family honor and male dominance. The AI report documented honor killings of women who had been
raped. In one such case a 17 year old girl was murdered by her own mother after she was “repeatedly raped by two
of her brothers.” In another case, a 21 year old “was forced to drink poison by her father” when she was found to
be pregnant.

The AI report places substantial blame for these and other killings on Israel! Here is AI’s conclusion, listing the
causes of the violence directed against Palestinian women, presumably in the order of their importance:
“Palestinian women in the West Bank and Gaza Strip are victims of multiple violations as a result of the escalation
of the conflict, Israel’s policies, and a system of norms, traditions and laws which treat women as unequal
members of society.” The “escalation of the conflict” (which AI blames primarily on Israel) and “Israel’s policies”
rank higher than the “norms, traditions and laws which treat women as unequal.” The report asserts that violence
against women has “increased” dramatically during the Israeli occupation and has reached “an unprecedented
level” as a result of the “increased militarization of the Israeli-Palestinian confrontation.” This is a deliberately
false conclusion. In fact the number of such killings has gone down dramatically since the Israeli occupation. But
if one were to believe the Amnesty International Report, it would be as if the West Bank and Gaza Strip had been
violence free for Palestinian women until the Israeli Occupation.

Following the publications of the Amnesty International report, I spoke with Donatella Rovera, who is AI’s
researcher on Israel and the Occupied Territories and asked her to provide the data on which she had based her
conclusion that violence against women had escalated to an “unprecedented level” during the occupation, and
especially during its most militarized phase. I also asked her whether AI had compared violence against women in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza with violence against women in unoccupied Arab-Muslim areas that have
comparable populations, such as Jordan. Rovera acknowledged that AI could provide no such comparative data
and confirmed that the report was based on anecdotal information, primarily from Palestinian NGOs. “We talk to
anyone who would talk to us,” she said. When I asked her for a list of the NGO’s that were the sources of the
information, she refused to provide them because “there are things we can simply not provide to outsiders.” I
assured her that I was not interested in names or identifying features, but only in statistical data regarding the

His expertise is knowing what other people know.
Which surely offers a unique sense of confidence that it

time of such radical flux and existential instability,
everybody wants to seek out someone who might have
some answers or at least make you feel like he does—
even, and maybe especially, the rich.

In the last days of my interviews with Epstein, he
was called by a particular world-stage individual, among
the richest and most powerful—proudly louche
himself—who, feeling out of his depth in a world of
crashing oil prices and wild currency fluctuation, had
come to believe he might benefit from some private

bowl of fresh strawberries and ice cream.”

--Ken Kesey

“T told Krassner one time that his writings made me hopeful. He found
this an odd compliment to offer a satirist. I explained that he made supposedly

s an experiment, I am going to ask a student to spend a week in
A: locked room. The room is perfectly nice; it has a bed, a light, a

desk, some reading matter, oh, and we'll give him some washing
facilities too! Every now and then I post some food under the door to
keep him going, Pop-tarts and pizza (thin-crust) work well.

On the first evening a note is pushed under his door with a symbol
on it. The student puzzles for a while, then opens the book sitting on
the desk. The book says, “If you get a piece of paper with symbols on it
look them up and follow the instructions.” He looks up the symbols and
the entry in the book says, “Go to page 44, write down the third symbol
on a piece of paper then post it back under the door.” He follows the
instruction and is rewarded with another piece of paper, this time with a
larger set of symbols on it. Again he follows the instructions in the book
and posts his answer back under the door. This goes on for several days.
He is somewhat bemused, but it passes the time, and he diligently looks
up the symbols and performs all the complicated actions as instructed.

Meanwhile, I meet our new Chinese graduate student and explain
to her she needs to interview a potential translator for the department.
He has just come in from Hong Kong and there is a health scare, so we

This decision, disallowing even the most reasonable mistakes of fact in rape cases, opens up the
possibility of some very unjust results. To illustrate this, let’s go back to the filming of the movie,
Deep Throat, discussed in an earlier chapter.

Harry Reems had sex on camera with Linda Lovelace. Anyone watching the film*' can see that
she is consenting, both verbally and by her unambiguous actions. But it now turns out, at least
according to a book she wrote, that her apparent consent wasn’t real, that she was compelled to
pretend she was consenting by her husband’s threats to kill her unless she went forward with her
starring role in the movie Deep Throat. Under the extreme view expressed by some radical
feminists and accepted by the Massachusetts Appellate Court, Reems could be guilty of rape even
though his mistake of fact about her consent was entirely reasonable.

Or consider the following case I discuss in class. Among the group of American citizens in
California who come from the Hmong tribes in the mountains of Cambodia, there is a traditional
wedding ceremony for arranged marriages. The groom is supposed to go to the home of the
bride, where the father of the bride greets him at the door. The groom pushes the father aside,
finds the bride, and carries her, screaming and yelling, from her parents’ abode. He is supposed to
act like a young warrior, and she like a young virgin who wants to retain her status. It’s all
playacting, and part of the traditional wedding ceremony. In the case I teach, the young woman
didn’t actually want to go through with the marriage, and her resistance was not playacting; it was
real. But there is no reason that the groom would know this, so he took the bride home to his
house, and over her “resistance”, which he believed was feigned, he consummated the arranged
marriage. She then ran away and reported the rape to the police, who arrested the young man. I
asked my students how a case like this should be decided.

The class is generally divided, some argue that no always means no, even in the context ofa
traditional marriage ritual in which no is supposed to mean yes. Others argue that it would be

unfair to impose our values on a minority that has its own culture and traditions.

Another case that raised similar issues arose in the context of a college friendship that turned ugly.

5! T have never seen the entire film (see pages __ supra), but during the preview of a documentary about the film, I
saw excerpts from it.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028066.txt,"Rabin’s closest aide, whom I knew well, was aware that Unit 8200 had
intercepts that laid bare the details, and left no doubt the murderers were from a
PLO group. He called and asked me to appear on a weekly television interview
program called Moked. It was hosted by Nissim Mishal: brash, incisive, and one
of Israel’s best-known broadcast journalists. I pointed out to the Rabin aide that
I’d never done anything like this before. But he insisted it would go well. He
briefed me on the questions I could expect, not just about the Achille Lauro but
the wider issue of Palestinian attacks, as well as Syrian President Hafez al-
Assad’s efforts to re-equip his air force after his losses in Lebanon. So I came to
the interview prepared. I brought audio tapes of the hijackers, and a large
photograph of the MiG-25s which the Syrians were seeking to acquire.

My appearance will not go down in the annals of great moments in
television. But at the time, very few Israelis even knew who I was, and I felt ’'d
done OK. I was surprised, however, when Rabin phoned the next day. “Ehud, I
didn’t see it. I was attending some event,” he said. But his wife, Leah, had
recorded the program. “I just watched it. I should tell you, I think it was
exceptional. You did a great job. It was highly important for us, for the army,
and, I dare say, for you.”

I was not sure what he meant by saying it might be good for me as well,
although a decade later, at the end of my army career, he would play the central
role into my entry into Israeli politics. It is true that there was also some politics
at the upper reaches of the military as well, especially around the choice of chief
of staff, and that Moshe Vechetzi’s term had only a year-and-a-half to go. But I
didn’t view myself as a serious candidate at this stage. Moshe’s own preference
seemed to be either Amir Drori, the head of the northern command during the
Lebanon War, or Amnon Lipkin, the veteran paratroop commander who’d been
with me on the Rue Verdun raid in Beirut. My own hope was that the nod
would go to any even closer friend of mine: Dan Shomron.

I had first got to know Dan well in the late sixties after Karameh, Israel’s
costly standoff with Arafat, when Fatah’s influence was in its infancy. We
exchanged impressions on what had gone wrong, and why? When I became
commander of Sayeret Matkal, we remained in touch, and he took a close
interest in all of our operations. We also crossed paths in the Sinai in the 1973,

tell it to that can’t.” In the same vein, Poitras could hardly rely on
these five confidants not to tell her secrets (and Snowden’s) to others.
Hours after he was told, Greenwald told his lover, David Miranda,
about the source in great detail. He even asked him to evaluate the
source’s bona fides for him. Gellman, for his part, raised the matter
with a former high official at the Justice Department.

Moreover, as the intelligence world knew, Poitras was herself
a veritable lightning rod for attracting ex-NSA employees who
objected to some of its surveillance programs. In 2012, her previ-
ously mentioned filming in Berlin of NSA insiders could make her
communications of interest to intelligence services that wanted to
keep tabs on possible NSA dissidents.

Nor was Snowden himself overly discreet. It will be recalled that
he had also advertised his Tor-sponsored CryptoParty activities over
the Internet and supplied Runa Sandvik, who worked with Appel-
baum, his true name and address in Hawaii. Sandvik had no reason
not to share the identity of her co-presenter with others in the Tor
movement. Snowden, of course, had his girlfriend make a video of

© his presentation as well. He also bragged about operating the largest ®
Tor outlets in Hawaii. Even if his Tor software provided him with a
measure of anonymity, it was not beyond the ability of the world-
class cyber services to crack it.

Under Putin, Russia had built one of the leading cyber-espionage
services in the world. According to a 2009 NSA analysis of Russian
capabilities, which was obtained by The New York Times in 2013,
Russia’s highly sophisticated tools for cyber espionage were superior
to those of China or any other adversary nation. For example, inves-
tigators from FireEye, a well-regarded Silicon Valley security firm,
found that in 2007 Russian hackers had developed a highly sophis-
ticated virus that could bypass the security measures of the servers
of both the U.S. government and its private contractors. According
to one computer security expert, the virus had made protected Inter-
net websites “sitting ducks” for these sophisticated Russian hackers.
The cryptographer Bruce Schneier, a leading specialist in computer
security, explained, “It is next to impossible to maintain privacy and
anonymity against a well-funded government adversary.”

Nor has the Russian cyber service made a secret out of the fact that

https://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2018/12/alex-acosta-update.php  
Alex Acosta update 
Earlier this week, pedophile Jeffrey Epstein bought his way out of a lawsuit that would have 
given some of his victims the opportunity to testify about his predatory and criminal 
conduct. Victims never got that opportunity when Epstein faced criminal charges, because 
Alex Acosta___then the lead prosecutor, now the Secretary of Labor___let Epstein off with 
a ridiculously lenient sentence. Despite having committed hideous sex offenses with dozens 
of minors, Epstein received a sentence of 13 months in jail, during which he was often free 
during the day. 
Epstein's decision to buy his out of the civil lawsuit, one that he had the nerve to initiate, 
benefits Acosta. The trial would have provided non-stop headlines, coupled with frequent 
references to the sweetheart deal Acosta gave him. As Randy Schultz puts it, the trial would 
have been the occasion for a long overdue public shaming of Acosta. Now, he avoids this 
consequence. 
But this doesn't mean Acosta is out of the woods. He faces calls for his ouster from the 
Trump cabinet. 
Some calls are from the usual suspects. Michelle Goldberg of the New York Times has 
written a piece so obnoxious that it almost makes me want to see Acosta ride out the storm. 
But some conservatives are also advocating Acosta's departure. Concerned Women for 
America is a stalwart conservative organization. It describes itself, accurately, as focus[ed] 
on seven core issues: the family, the sanctity of human life, religious liberty, education, 
sexual exploitation, national sovereignty, and support for Israel. (Emphasis added) 
> 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030983 
Its leader, Penny Nance, has called for Acosta's resignation. Noting that labor trafficking, 
which the Labor Department combats, is often conjoined with sex trafficking, Nance says 
that President Trump would not have nominated Acosta if reports fully describing Acosta's 
conduct in the Epstein case had emerged earlier. 
Sen. Ben Sasse has also weighed in. He sent a letter to the Justice Department asking it to 
investigate its treatment of Epstein, including the fact that the plea deal ensured that victims 
of the pervert would be denied the ability to comment on or object to the leniency of his 
sentence. Sasse is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Oversight, 
Agency Action, Federal Rights and Federal Courts. 
Sen. Marco Rubio, a longtime supporter of Acosta, says it would be very troubling if 
political influence led to a light sentence for Epstein. In Rubio's view, and that of every 
rational person, Epstein should have been in jail for a long time. Rubio added, however, 
that he will reserve judgment until he hears Acosta's side. 
That's fair. But so far, Acosta has provided no real defense for letting Epstein off so lightly. 
In public, at least, he is standing by his argument that the deal was a reasonable one and that 
this is old news. 
Previously, Acosta had a different defense. He cited a year-long assault on the prosecution 
and the prosecutors by an army of legal superstars who represented Epstein. This 
allegedly included defense counsel investigat[ing] individual prosecutors and their families, 
looking for personal peccadilloes that may provide a basis for disqualification. In this 
account, the deal was made to relieve the pressure, while still getting a conviction. 
Acosta could hardly assert this explanation____i.e., that he wimped out___while seeking a 
cabinet position with the expectation of being appointed to more exalted jobs in the future. 
Nor is the explanation particularly plausible. Acosta isn't the first prosecutor to face a 
scorched earth defense. Ask Ken Starr about this. 
I don't doubt that Acosta regarded escaping the wrath of the defense team as a benefit of 
reaching the plea deal. But I don't believe this was incentive enough to cause him, in effect, 
to throw the case. 
What was the true incentive? As I wrote when this story broke, I think it was the same 
incentive that explains much of his conduct in public life___Acosta's desire to accommodate 
people he thinks can help him down the road. 
Which people? Probably the lawyers at Kirkland and Ellis, where Acosta had once worked. 
Epstein enlisted Ken Starr* and Jay Lefkowitz, both of Kirkland, for his defense team. 
Acosta reportedly worked out the terms of his surrender with Lefkowitz, a former colleague, 
at a meeting in a location far away from the prosecutor's office. 
The location of the meeting is itself suspicious. Prosecutors and other law enforcement 
officials normally demand that those seeking a deal come to them. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030984 
The fact that Acosta didn't is another sign___if one were needed___that this was a 
capitulation. It also casts further doubt on the claim that Acosta was capitulating for the 
purpose of sparing the folks who worked with him in the prosecutor's office. 
The key point, though, is that Ken Starr and Jay Lefkowitz were power players in 
Washington___men who might help Acosta down the road. 
Readers will be quite familiar with Starr's background. Lefkowitz was director of cabinet 
affairs and deputy executive secretary to the domestic policy council under President George 
H.W. Bush. Under President George W. Bush, Lefkowitz served as general counsel in the 
Office of Management and Budget and later as deputy director of domestic policy at the 
White House. 
Accommodating such influential figures must have seemed like a good career move. Having 
Starr and Lefkowitz on his side might help Acosta get a judgeship, a cabinet appointment, or 
a high-paying job back at Kirkland and Ellis. 
I'm speculating, of course. But my speculation finds support in Acosta's practice of 
accommodating the powerful. 
Much of that accommodation is of Democrats. Indeed, at the time Acosta was working in 
Miami as a U.S. Attorney, he had alienated some Republicans by such accommodation  
while at the Department of Justice. Some say he was on the verge of being fired when 
Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez parachuted him to Miami. The Epstein settlement was a 
way for Acosta to shore up his standing with some influential Republicans. 
Will Acosta be able to survive the current scandal? I don't have a clear sense about this yet. 
But President Trump, who isn't bashful about sacking cabinet members, may come to 
believe (if he doesn't now) that it's disadvantageous to have a cabinet member who sold out 
teenage victims of sexual abuse, especially when the sell-out benefited an ultra-wealthy 
serial offender. 
* Some on the left are trying to make something or the fact that Starr, who had investigated 
Bill Clinton in connection with sexual misconduct, later defended Epstein, a pervert. This is 
silly. 
In both instances, Starr was doing his job as a lawyer. Perverts are entitled to a defense and 
there is nothing hypocritical about investigating Bill Clinton's misconduct when that was 
Starr's job and later joining the team that was defending Jeffrey Epstein. 
Acosta, by contrast, was on the team seeking justice for Epstein and for his victims. He gave 
up this quest for reasons that can't be defended.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014002.txt,"2. Do not e-mail first thing in the morning or last thing at night.

The former scrambles your priorities and plans for the day, and the latter just gives you insomnia. E-mail
can wait until 10 A.M., after you’ve completed at least one of your critical to-do items.

3. Do not agree to meetings or calls with no clear agenda or end time.

If the desired outcome is defined clearly with a stated objective and agenda listing topics/questions to
cover, no meeting or call should last more than 30 minutes. Request them in advance so you “can best
prepare and make good use of the time together.”

4. Do not let people ramble.

Forget “How’s it going?” when someone calls you. Stick with “What’s up?” or “I’m in the middle of
getting something out, but what’s going on?” A big part of GTD (Getting Things Done) is GTP—Getting
To the Point.

5. Do not check e-mail constantly —“‘batch” and check at set times only.

I belabor this point enough. Get off the cocaine pellet dispenser and focus on execution of your top to-
do’s instead of responding to manufactured emergencies. Set up a strategic autoresponder and check
twice or thrice daily.

6. Do not over-communicate with low- profit, high-maintenance customers.

There is no sure path to success, but the surest path to failure is trying to please everyone. Do an 80/20
analysis of your customer base in two ways—which 20% are producing 80%+ of my profit, and which
20% are consuming 80%+ of my time? Then put the loudest and least productive on autopilot by citing a
change in company policies. Send them an e-mail with new rules as bullet points: number of permissible
phone calls, e-mail response time, minimum orders, etc. Offer to point them to another provider if they
aren’t able to adopt the new policies.

7.Do not work more to fix overwhelmingness— prioritize.

If you don’t prioritize, everything seems urgent and important. If you define the single most important
task for each day, almost nothing seems urgent or important. Oftentimes, it’s just a matter of letting little
bad things happen (return a phone call late and apologize, pay a small late fee, lose an unreasonable
customer, etc.) to get the big important things done. The answer to overwhelmingness is not spinning
more plates—or doing more—it’s defining the few things that can really fundamentally change your
business and life.

8. Do not carry a cell phone or Crackberry 24/7.

Take at least one day off of digital leashes per week. Turn them off or, better still, leave them in the
garage or in the car. I do this on at least Saturday, and I recommend you leave the phone at home if you
go out for dinner. So what if you return a phone call an hour later or the next morning’? As one reader
put it to a miffed co-worker who worked 24/7 and expected the same: “J’m not the president of the U.S.
No one should need me at 8 P.M. at night. OK, you didn’t get a hold of me. But what bad happened?”
The answer? Nothing.

Dear Jeffrey,

thank you for your support and encouragement, even where I fail.

Sorry for being such an embarrassment today. I will spell out today's argument a bit better and cohesive
when I get to it. Also, I should have recognized that the main point I tried to make would trigger Noam (who
was as always very generous, patient, kind and humble on the personal level, even though he did not feel like
conceding anything on the conceptual one). Almost all of Noam's work focused on the idea that humans have
very specific circuits or modules (even when most people in his field began to have other ideas), and his
frustration is that it is so hard to find or explain them.

I found Noam's hypothesis very compelling in the past. I still think that the idea that language is somehow a
cultural or social invention of our species is wrong. But I think that there is a chance (we don't know that, but
it seems to most promising hypothesis IMHO) that the difference between humans and apes is not a very
intricate special circuit, but genetically simple developmental switches. The bootstrapping of cognition
works layer by layer during the first 20 years of our life. Each layer takes between a few months and a few
years to train in humans. While a layer is learned, there is not much going on in the higher layers yet, and
after the low level learning is finished, it does not change very much. This leads to the characteristic bursts in
child development, that have famously been described by Piaget.

The first few layers are simple perceptual stuff, the last ones learn social structure and self-in-society. The
switching works with something like a genetic clock, very slowly in humans, but much more quickly in other
apes, and very fast in small mammals. As a result, human children take nine months before their brains are
mature enough to crawl, and more than a year before they can walk. Many African populations are quite a bit
faster. In the US, black children outperform white children in motor development, even in very poor and
socially disadvantaged households, but they lag behind (and never catch up) in cognitive development even
after controlling for family income.

Gorillas can crawl after 2 months, and build their own nests after 2.5 years. They leave their mothers at 3-4
years. Human children are pretty much useless during the first 10-12 years, but during each phase, their
brains have the opportunity to encounter many times as much training data as a gorilla brain. Humans are
literally smarter on every level, and because the abilities of the higher levels depend on those of the lower
levels, they can perform abstractions that mature gorillas will never learn, no matter how much we try to
train them.

The second set of mechanisms is in the motivational system. Motivation tells the brain what to pay attention

to, by giving reward and punishment. If a brain does not get much reward for solving puzzles, the individual
will find mathematics very boring and won't learn much of it. Ifa brain gets lots of rewards for discovering

used in Hawaii to guide or assist Snowden, they would be put back
into sleeper mode. If any telltale traces had been left in chat rooms
or social media, they would be systematically deleted. Even more
important to the ultimate success of such a communications intel-
ligence coup, measures would be taken to conceal the extent of the
damage done by the “single point of failure” by not precipitously
closing down compromised sources. Snowden might believe that
the power of the information he held was so great that if disclosed
by him, all the NSA’s sources would immediately go dark in Russia
and China, but Russia might not wish to provide such clarity to its
adversaries. An intelligence service need not close down channels
it discovers are compromised by an adversary. Instead, it can elect
to continue to use them and furnish through them bits of sensitive
or misleading information to advance its own national interest. The
real danger here was not that the NSA’s “lights” would dramati-
cally be extinguished but that all the future messages illuminated by
those lights would be less reliable sources of intelligence. The game
of nations is, after all, merely a competition among adversaries to

© gain advantages by the surreptitious exchange of both twisted and ©
straight information.

To review: When the NSA asserted in the summer of 2013 that
over one million documents had been compromised, it was recog-
nizing the most massive failure in its sixty-year history. Not only
were NSA secrets taken, but secret files from the CIA, the British
GCHQ, and America’s cyber military commands had been compro-
mised. It was, as Sir David Omand, the former head of the British
GCHQ, described it, a “huge strategic setback” for the West. The
genie could not be put back into the bottle. There is not a reset but-
ton in this game. The best that the NSA could do now was damage
control while its adversaries took full advantage of the setback. Sev-
eral hundred U.S. and British intelligence officers worked around the
clock in Washington, D.C., Fort Meade, Maryland, and Cheltenham,
England, for months on end to determine which parts of the most
powerful communications intelligence system in the world could be
salvaged from what had been the Snowden breach.

Adding insult to injury, Snowden, speaking from his new perch
in Moscow, told applauding audiences that the entire purpose of

laden topics, but sanitizes them by carefully replacing the parts of content that would divide his audience
with symbolic messages that everybody can fill with their own content in a way that resonates with them.
The non-controversial parts will still be insightful. He manages to come across as very subversive, while
rarely offending anyone (except the hard scientists, that miss hard substance).

He also asks influential people and smart students or faculty to write parts of his essays and speeches for
him. This invests them in his success, especially because he is going to reward and acknowledge them. Very
few of his ideas are original, instead he is good at identifying and testing thoughts he reads or hears from
others.

I am still beset by the ruinous instinct that the goal of communication ought to be mutual understanding. Joi
is right. Public communication is about reaching one's goals.

Dear Jeffrey,

thank you for your support and encouragement, even where I fail.

Sorry for being such an embarrassment today. I will spell out today's argument a bit better and cohesive
when I get to it. Also, I should have recognized that the main point I tried to make would trigger Noam
(who was as always very generous, patient, kind and humble on the personal level, even though he did not
feel like conceding anything on the conceptual one). Almost all of Noam's work focused on the idea that
humans have very specific circuits or modules (even when most people in his field began to have other
ideas), and his frustration is that it is so hard to find or explain them.

I found Noam's hypothesis very compelling in the past. I still think that the idea that language is somehow a
cultural or social invention of our species is wrong. But I think that there is a chance (we don't know that,
but it seems to most promising hypothesis IMHO) that the difference between humans and apes is not a
very intricate special circuit, but genetically simple developmental switches. The bootstrapping of cognition
works layer by layer during the first 20 years of our life. Each layer takes between a few months and a few
years to train in humans. While a layer is learned, there is not much going on in the higher layers yet, and
after the low level learning is finished, it does not change very much. This leads to the characteristic bursts
in child development, that have famously been described by Piaget.

The first few layers are simple perceptual stuff, the last ones learn social structure and self-in-society. The
switching works with something like a genetic clock, very slowly in humans, but much more quickly in
other apes, and very fast in small mammals. As a result, human children take nine months before their
brains are mature enough to crawl, and more than a year before they can walk. Many African populations
are quite a bit faster. In the US, black children outperform white children in motor development, even in
very poor and socially disadvantaged households, but they lag behind (and never catch up) in cognitive
development even after controlling for family income.

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016248.txt,"Computer scientist Stuart Russell, along with Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking, Max
Tegmark, and numerous others, has insisted that attention be paid to the potential
dangers in creating an intelligence on the superhuman (or even the human) level—an
AGI, or artificial general intelligence, whose programmed purposes may not necessarily
align with our own.

His early work was on understanding the notion of “bounded optimality” as a
formal definition of intelligence that you can work on. He developed the technique of
rational meta-reasoning, “which is, roughly speaking, that you do the computations that
you expect to improve the quality of your ultimate decision as quickly as possible.” He
has also worked on the unification of probability theory and first-order logic—resulting
in a new and far more effective monitoring system for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test
Ban Treaty—and on the problem of decision making over long timescales (his
presentations on the latter topic are usually titled, “Life: Play and Win in 20 trillion
moves”’).

He is very concerned with the continuing development of autonomous weapons,
such as lethal micro-drones, which are potentially scalable into weapons of mass
destruction. He drafted the letter from forty of the world’s leading AI researchers to
President Obama which resulted in high-level national-security meetings.

His current work centers on the creation of what he calls “provably beneficial”
AI. He wants to ensure AI safety by “imbuing systems with explicit uncertainty” about
the objectives of their human programmers, an approach that would amount to a fairly
radical reordering of current AI research.

Stuart is also on the radar of anyone who has taken a course in computer science
in the last twenty-odd years. He is co-author of “the” definitive AI textbook, with an
estimated 5-million-plus English-language readers.

“waste” a good tea bag that has at least one more good cup init. I’m not suggesting that reusing
tea bags is in any way analogous cheating on one’s taxes or committing other financial or sexual
crimes, but I am suggesting that people who have earned their money or fame by illegally cutting
corners will sometimes continue to do so, even though there is no longer a financial or other
rational need to do so. Old habits die hard, but they can also kill or at least wound those who
can’t break the illegal ones. This is not in any way to justify such continuing misconduct. Indeed,
quite the opposite, it is to condemn it—because celebrities have few excuses for their
misconduct—while at the same time trying to explain why it persists among some celebrities.

I have thought a great deal about what motivates famous and powerful people to act so self-
destructively. The celebrities who I represented and advised have faced a wide array of problems,
ranging from criminal charges, to loss of careers, to public humiliation, to custody fights, to
defamations and to physical threats. Some of the most fascinating stories I can never tell because
I learned them in confidence and helped resolve them without their ever becoming public. Most
have become matters of public record, and I am free to write about those and to offer my insights
about the famous people I have advised over the years and the problems they faced.

The question I am asked most frequently is: does being famous help a celebrity who gets in
trouble with the law? Or does it hurt? My answer is “yes.” Sometimes it helps. Sometimes it
hurts. Always it matters. One of the most important jobs a lawyer who represents famous people
has is to figure out how to turn his or her celebrity into an advantage rather than a disadvantage,
or at the very least to neutralize it (which is a near impossibility in our celebrity-driven world.) I
recall Claus Von Bulow once telling me that in England it’s all about “class and breeding,” while
in America it’s all about “fame and celebrity.” Before he became famous for being accused of
trying to kill his wife, Von Bulow couldn’t get a good table at certain posh restaurants despite his
wealth and social status, but when his name and face began to appear in every newspaper, he got
the best table in every restaurant.*?

8 This conversation suggests an important distinction between different types of celebrities and their relationship
to the legal process.

The first type consists of individuals who were already very famous before they got into trouble or before they
needed my legal advice. Among my clients who fit this category are OJ Simpson, who was among the most
famous football players in the country before he was accused of murdering his wife and her friend; Mike Tyson,
who was even more famous around the world, because boxing is an international sport; Mia Farrow, the actress
who had been married to Frank Sinatra and Andre Previn, and was involved in a bitter custody dispute with her
long time lover Woody Allen; Marlon Brando, Robert Downey, Jr.; Ben and Casey Affleck, Brook Shields; Martha
Sterwart; David Merrick, Frank Sinatra, David Crosby, John Lennon and several other actors, athletes and
entertainers. Also included in this category would be President Bill Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, Israeli President Katzav, Senator Mike Gravell of Alaska, and Senator Alan Cranston of California.

A second category of celebrities that I have represented are those who were not well known to the public but whose
alleged crimes made them famous. Claus Von Bulow is a prime example of this phenomenon, as he made clear in
his conversation with me. Also included in that category, at least to some degree, are Michael Milken, the
financier; Conrad Black, the newspaper mogul; and Julian Assange of Wikileaks.

A third category would include people who were somewhat well known, but whose trial brought them considerably

more fame and/or infamy. Included in this category are Leona Helmsley, Abby Hoffman, Doctor Benjamin Spock,
William Kuntsler and F. Lee Bailey.

ideas through patents, copyright, and trade secret is big business and
combines to form the practice of ‘intellectual property. Societies with
the best protection of intellectual property are often the most successful.
The USA is the unassailed leader, with Asian countries rapidly catching
up. Poor old Europeans have struggled with an almost unworkable
patent system for nearly 30 years; a genuine Europe-wide patent only
came into effect in 2013.

Creativity in the economy is now extremely important, and nothing
emphasizes the point more than the job market. During the 60s finding a
job was easy. There was an almost unlimited range of mechanical jobs on
offer. In the post-industrial age, almost all the mechanical jobs have gone.
Today we need to be experts in a field, able to solve problems creatively.
You can't expect to walk into a job and be profitably productive on the
first day. Finding a job is harder and the cost of employing someone is
greater.

Why did we Evolve Creativity?
Roger Penrose wonders why mathematical creativity evolved in humans
since it only became useful in ancient Greece a few thousand years ago.
He believes it must have been useful for something before this. But what?
David Deutsch thinks creativity developed to allow one human to
understand the thoughts of a fellow human being. We can't precisely
communicate the ‘programs’ we run in our heads. We are unable to
download a detailed thought and put it on a memory stick. He thinks
our creative capacity developed to help us pass skills from one to another.
The ability to paint and sculpt is an accidental by-product of this adaption.
It's my view we evolved creativity to deal with new situations
and puzzles in our daily lives. We use creative thought processes and
ingenuity to come up with novel solutions for when we can't rely on
programming or a store of rules. Otherwise, the very first unforeseen
situation could kill us!

Computer Creativity

Humans find creativity difficult. It requires peace and quiet, detailed
study and input of caffeine. How does a computer fare? I have argued
that computers cannot be creative above the logic limit, so this does not
preclude them from creating within the narrow confines of a particular
solution space. But a human still needs to set the rules for this space. The
level of creativity we should see from computers is convincing within

the upper reaches of the military. Perhaps do something more academic, in a
university or a policy think-tank.

For the first time, politics had some appeal, too, though I didn’t say this to
him. At that point, I had no idea how, or even whether, I might get involved.
But since my appearance on Moked, others seemed to assume it might happen at
some stage. Out of nowhere, a leading political journalist, Hanan Kristal, had
written a story in 1986 purporting to predict the successors to Israel’s political
old guard: Peres and Rabin in Labor, Begin and Shamir in the Likud. It
appeared in the newspaper Hadashot. The paper ran side-by-side photos of the
ostensible future leaders, doctored to look older, who Hanan predicted would go
head-to-head in the election of 1996, a decade away. One was Israel’s
ambassador to the UN and a protégé of Misha Arens: Bibi Netanyahu. The other
was me.

Rabin listened with patience to my obviously settled intention to leave, but
remained firm that I should stay and become Dan’s deputy. In the end, I agreed
I’d think things over and that we’d talk in a week’s time. In the meantime, I
went to see two veteran generals who had found themselves in a similar
situation, mentioned as possible chiefs of staff but never chosen: Arik and Ezer
Weizman. I saw Arik on his farm in the Negev. He was obviously enjoying his
extraordinary political rehabilitation since the Lebanon war. His expanding girth
was settled into a sofa in the living room. I filled him in on my conversation
with Rabin. “I’m considering leaving,” I said. “It just seems like a long time to
wait, even if I do get the job after Dan. There’s a lot else I want to do in life.”
Arik was probably the general most experienced in being denied the chief-of-
staff's office. On at least two occasions, he might reasonably have been
considered. But in a career littered with tense encounters with his superiors, it
never happened. “You should stay on,” he said. You’re not that old. It'll
probably be good for you, and the army, to be deputy and then chief.” The only
further advice he gave me was to do all I could formally to commit Yitzhak to
making me Dan’s successor after his term ended.

I visited Ezer at his home in the seaside town of Caesarea. We sat on the
terrace, with Ezer’s gangly frame draped over one of the cane chairs. “Ehud, if
you stay, do you think you have a good chance of being the next ramatkal,” he
asked. I said that while nothing could be certain, I thought there was a good
chance. He replied without hesitation: “Then stay.” He’d come close to the top
job, he told me. On the eve of the Six-Day War, when Rabin had collapsed

Summarizing my past: The major changes in my life

The questions I am most often asked by others—and sometimes by myself—are about significant
changes in my life and why they occurred. Going back to my teen years, the question is why I
changed, within a few short months, from a C and D student in high school to an A+ student in
college and law school. The change was dramatic and sudden—literally over the summer of
1955, between high school and college. What happened in those two months to change me from
being last, or close to last in a class of 50, to being first among the men (15 women were ahead of
me)!” in a highly competitive class of 2,000, and then first in a class of 170 even more
competitive men and women (only a handful) at Yale Law School? Was it me who changed, or
was it the schools?

It was both. I think I had begun to change during my last year in high school, but my reputation
among the faculty was so firmly established and so negative, that teachers simply couldn’t see past
it. Even when I got A grades on the statewide Regents exams, the teachers gave me Cs and Ds as
semester grades. My occasionally intelligent classroom comments were taken as ‘wise ass”
remarks. And some of my teachers even thought I must have cheated whenever I got a good
grade on a test. So I doubt it was possible for me ever to shine in a high school where my
favorite teacher insisted that I was “a 75 student” and would always be “a 75 student.” (I didn’t
quite live up to his expectations, graduating with an average below 75).

Moreover, my high school was a Yeshiva—a “parochial school” and I am not a parochial person.
I did not respect most of my teachers, and the feeling was obviously mutual. Creativity was
frowned upon. Rote memorization was rewarded. And “respect” for “authority” was not only
demanded, it was actually graded. I got a “U” for unsatisfactory. When I got to Brooklyn
College, creativity was rewarded, rote memorization frowned upon, and respect was something to
be earned, not merely accorded by the title of Rabbi. The same kind of creative and challenging
answers that got me Cs and Ds in Yeshiva earned me A’s in college and law school.

But there was more at work than a change of schools. I changed over that summer as well. I
went to a new summer camp as an assistant counselor, where I excelled and received praise for
my creativity as a song writer for “color war” and for my leadership skills. I had always been a
leader, even during my darkest days in high school, but the school rejected my leadership, fearful
that other students would follow me in my heretical ways. I always had an abundance of energy,
but it was—in the views of my high school teachers—misdirected.

That summer in Camp Maple Lake, I received confirmation of my talents, and the result was
heightened self confidence.

I also met a young woman and began my first serious romantic relationship, which culminated
four years later in my first marriage. Suddenly, I was “talented,” “attractive,” and “accepted.” It
was a great send off to college.

Saudi Arabia is a regional power with vested interests in the country,
and Russia and Syria enjoy historical relations, as well as arms deals.
It is these countries that now must be on the front lines of reform,
with the US largely working behind the scenes.

For the west, the most powerful and poignant moment in recent
months came when US ambassador Robert Ford travelled to Hama,
scene of protests, to show solidarity and monitor the regime’s actions.
His quiet move warmed usually hostile Sunni communities elsewhere
in the Middle East to America, while putting fear into the heart of the
tyrant himself. Such innovative, soft power strategies will do more to
help Syrian democracy than loud statements from the White House.
The most powerful pressure on Mr Assad so far, however, has been
from Al Jazeera’s Arabic coverage, which encouraged Syrians to take
control of their own destiny. This is surely right, for any long-term
change must come from within. Sadly, in the short term and in a
highly volatile region, at present Mr Assad remains the least worst
option.

human capabilities — or enhance them via cyborg technology. Disagreements are
basically about the timescale — the rate of travel, not the direction of travel. The
cautious amongst us envisage timescales of centuries rather than decades before
humans are overtaken or transcended by electronic intelligence — far transcending the
chemical and metabolic limits of ‘wet’ organic brains. These entities will then persist,
continuing to evolve, for billions of years. Moreover, the timescales for technological
advance are but an instant compared to the slow timescales of the Darwinian
selection that led to humanity’s emergence — and (more relevantly) they are less than
a millionth of the vast expanses of cosmic time lying ahead.

But we humans shouldn’t feel too humbled. Even though we are surely not the
terminal branch of an evolutionary tree, we could be of special cosmic significance
for jump-starting the transition to inorganic (and potentially immortal) entities,
spreading their influence far beyond the Earth, and far transcending our limitations.

Moreover, a planetary environment may suit us ‘organics’ — but interplanetary and
interstellar space may be the preferred arena where robotic fabricators will have the
grandest scope for construction, and where non-biological ‘brains’ may develop
powers than humans can’t even imagine.

And they could spread through the cosmos — interstellar travel isn’t daunting to near-
immortal beings.

Is there life out there already? Or is the Galaxy waiting for our progeny? We know
there’s nowhere in our solar system that harbours advanced life. However there may
be freeze-dried bacteria on Mars.

There may be creatures swimming under the Ice on Saturn’s moon Enceladus.

But let’s widen our horizons to the realm of the stars.

The prime subject-matter of the Carl Sagan Institute would have enthralled Carl.
We've learnt that most stars in the sky are orbited by retinues of planets, like the
Sun is . But the evidence is mainly indirect; we don’t observe the planet, but detect its
influence on the motion or brightness of the star it’s orbiting

The Carl Sagan Institute is specially interested in possible 'twins' of our Earth --

planets the same size as ours, on orbits with temperatures such that water neither
boils nor stays frozen.

The 7.8% intraday peak-to-trough decline in US equities between September 21st and October 11th 
has rattled investor confidence. Numerous headlines of stock market carnage have further eroded 
their confidence. As a result, some of our clients have asked whether this drop signifies the beginning 
of the end of a nearly 10-year bull market. 
We do not think so. So far, this pullback is actually smaller than the two prior downdrafts we 
experienced in late January and in mid-March, neither of which derailed the US economy nor the bull 
market. The steady factors we highlighted in our annual Outlook—such as economic growth, benign 
inflation, robust earnings, and low probability of recession—have not dissipated. Furthermore, while 
the investor focus has shifted to the risks around the unsteady undertow, most of these factors are, 
on balance, less concerning today than they were at the beginning of 2018. 
Of course, that is not the case across all geopolitical concerns. While trade tensions with Mexico and 
Canada have abated, those with China have certainly deteriorated and will continue to do so for the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026894 
foreseeable future. But, in aggregate, there has been more improvement than deterioration, in our 
view. 
In this Sunday Night Insight, we will provide a brief update on the steady factors and unsteady 
undertow. We then conclude with our view that the steady factors will likely continue to win this tug-of-
war between the two. 
Steady Factors 
While the headlines warn of equity market carnage, the facts do not support such alarming headlines. 
The S&P 500 is still up 5.1% on a year-to-date total return basis and financial conditions remain at 
easier levels today than they did when the Federal Reserve began this tightening cycle in 2015, 
despite the recent decline in equities and 0.76 percentage point increase in 10-year Treasury yields 
year-to-date. Most importantly, as highlighted by Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell, we are 
in extraordinary times of steady growth and low inflation. 
Economic Growth 
Economic growth remains firm in the US. Both the Institute for Supply Management leading indexes 
for manufacturing and non-manufacturing remain at very strong levels. Current activity indicators of 
real GDP growth average about 3.5% for the third quarter and closer to 4% for the fourth quarter. 
Forecasts for third quarter real GDP average 3.8% and fourth quarter forecasts are about 
2.8%. While growth is slowing from the 4.2% estimate of the second quarter, it is still forecast to be 
above trend and we believe a modest slowdown is certainly preferable to continued growth at a pace 
that was likely unsustainable and possibly even inflationary. 
In aggregate, the economic data since the intraday peak of US equities on September 21st does not 
point to any worrisome slowdown in GDP growth or the pace of employment. In fact, while the recent 
134K increase in non-farm payrolls was less than expectations, revisions to earlier months offset the 
modest headline miss and the unemployment rate still fell to 3.7%. Furthermore, this 134k increase 
is above the estimated sustainable level of employment growth based on population growth and 
changes in labor force participation, which our colleagues in Goldman Investment Research estimate 
is around 96k. Importantly, a modest slowdown in the 3-month average of non-farm payrolls, which 
currently stands at a very robust 190k jobs, is more likely to keep inflation in check. 
Robust Earnings and Buybacks 
Continued above-trend economic growth is supporting solid corporate fundamentals. While many are 
quick to dismiss this strength to US tax reform, it is only half the story. Earnings before interest and 
taxes (EBIT) expanded by a very healthy 12% in the first half of this year and are expected to grow by 
double-digits again in the third quarter. This robust organic profit growth is also fueling sizable 
corporate buybacks—a key source of equity market support. Our colleagues on the corporate 
buyback desk expect the highest dollar amount for buybacks on record in 2018, with $1tn in 
authorizations and $850bn in executed buybacks. 
Even so, such robust earnings growth has begun to foster concern that we have reached a peak in 
EPS growth. While we do expect the pace of growth to slow next year, a local peak in earnings 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026895 
growth has not signified an imminent peak in the S&P 500 historically. In fact, about 3/4ths of market 
peaks occurred more than two years after the peak in the growth rate of earnings. Moreover, stock 
market returns have remained healthy during this period, with high odds of a positive outcome over 
the subsequent 6-24 months (see Exhibit 1). In short, the market ultimately follows the path of 
earnings and while their growth rate may be slowing, their absolute level is still rising. 
Source: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg. 
Inflation and Interest Rates 
Inflation data has remained at relatively low levels for all of 2018, as shown in Exhibits 2 and 3. In 
fact, some of the most recent data released in October have ticked slightly lower. Average hourly 
earnings dropped to 2.8% from the prior month's level of 2.9%. Headline CPI dropped to 2.3% from 
2.7% and Core CPI ex-food and energy remain at a low 2.2%, unchanged from the prior month. The 
Federal Reserve's preferred inflation indicator, Core PCE, also remains low at 2.0% which is in line 
with the Federal Reserve's target, and unchanged from the prior month. 
While 10-year Treasury yields have risen by 0.76% (or 76 basis points) over the course of 2018, we 
do not think the resulting 3.2% yield is enough to derail US economic growth. Keep in mind that most 
of the recent increase since late August was due to stronger real growth rather than runaway inflation 
expectations. We expect interest rates to range between 3.0% and 3.5% in 2019 with a midpoint of 
3.25%, barring any major geopolitical conflicts such as one between US and China and or escalating 
conflicts in the Middle East.

Of course, the recent backup in interest rates is providing equity investors with another source of 
angst. Yet our work suggests there are several reasons why rates could continue to rise before 
becoming a material headwind for stocks. First, the 4% trend growth rate of nominal US GDP—
reflecting 2% real growth and 2% inflation—remains comfortably above the 10-year Treasury yield of 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026897 
3.2% (i.e. the cost of borrowing). Stocks typically struggle when the cost of borrowing exceeds the 
nominal growth of the economy (see Exhibit 4). Second, the recent backup in interest rates was 
driven primarily by improving real growth expectations, not higher inflation. This distinction is critical, 
because higher rates in response to improving real growth tend to benefit earnings sufficiently to 
overcome the downward pressure they place on valuation multiples. Finally, it will take a number of 
years before higher rates meaningfully impact aggregate S&P 500 interest expense, considering 91`)/0 
of S&P 500 debt is fixed-rate and only 13% matures over the next two years.

Low Probability of Recession 
We continue to maintain a low, 10%, probability of recession driven by: 
• The positive trend of leading economic indicators 
• Low levels of inflation 
• The continued slow but steady pace of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. We believe that 
Federal Reserve Chairman Powell's recent commentary indicates that the FOMC will continue to be 
driven by data and financial market conditions. Their stated goal is to extend this expansion 
indefinitely. While the Federal Reserve dots point towards four more interest rate hikes by the end 
of 2019, we do not think that such hikes materially increase the odds of a recession in an economy 
that continues to grow at levels that are generally regarded as above trend growth in the US.

Unsteady Undertow 
As market observers attempt to explain the recent drop in US equities, the risks of geopolitical factors 
have garnered considerable attention. Potential US retaliation over the recent disappearance of a 
Saudi journalist has only added fuel to the fire of worries given the risk that oil exports could be used 
as a political weapon in a world with tighter oil supply thanks to impending US sanctions on Iran. 
As we review the geopolitical developments of 2018, it is clear that some of the risks have abated 
while others have increased. With the exception of a significant spike in oil prices due to the impact of 
sanctions on Iran or any escalation in US-Saudi tensions, we believe that the net impact of these 
shifts is not material enough to derail the US economic expansion or bull market. 
Risks that have abated  
Mexico: the election of the left-of-center populist president (Andres Manuel Lopes Obrador referred 
to as AMLO) has reduced fear of a reversal of recent reforms. While concerns about fiscal profligacy 
and reverting to a nationalist energy policy that reduces oil production may reappear, AMLO does not 
take office until the end of the year. 
Brazil: The strong showing of Jair Bolsonaro, a law-and-order former army captain, in the first round 
of elections and the latest data that points to a 75% probability of Bolsonaro becoming the next 
president of Brazil has provided a boost to the Brazilian real. His current standing has substantially 
reduced the election of another left-wing worker's party candidate who would keep the status quo in 
Brazil. 
NAFTA: The agreement on a revised NAFTA deal between the US, Canada, and Mexico on 
September 30th meaningfully reduced the risk of the US withdrawal from NAFTA. While the new 
agreement, US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), has not been ratified by the Mexican and 
Canadian national parliaments nor by the US congress, and a divided congress after the mid-term 
elections may lead to some uncertainty, we believe it is likely to be ratified. 
US-EU Trade Friction: Tension between the US and European Union eased significantly after a July 
2018 deal between European Commission President Juncker and President Trump to work together 
toward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods. The 
coast is not totally clear given the threat of auto tariffs, but we do not anticipate any significant 
increase in trade rhetoric in the near future. 
Risks that have increased  
China: The trade war with China continues to escalate and as we have stated before, we believe that 
it cannot be resolved simply by China importing more US goods. The issues range from: 
• A large and growing trade deficit with China 
• Industrial policies & unfair trade practices that reduce competition, such as subsidies and 
dumping good at below-market prices 
• Made in China 2025 policies which harm US companies 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026900 
• Uneven tariff rates and the banning of some US goods 
• Intellectual property theft 
• Forced technology transfer 
• Strategic US technology acquisitions 
• Outright cyber theft 
• Foreign ownership restrictions 
Recent headlines that the trade war may be escalating to a cold war are not without merit, as we 
believe that US-China relations are changing on a more structural basis and will have a longer-term 
impact. On a short-term basis, however, US exposure to China is limited with merchandise exports, 
corporate profits and foreign claims at about 1% of GDP. As seen in Exhibit 7, the Chinese equity 
markets have also deteriorated much more significantly than US markets in 2018. 
Of course, specific stocks with greater exposure to China through higher sales have underperformed 
the S&P 500 by about 6% since the latest tariffs were imposed on $200bn of Chinese products, as 
shown in Exhibit 8.

Italy: Concerns about Italy have risen to peak levels since the election of a populist government in 
May and credit default swaps have increased to reflect these higher risks. The government's 
expansive fiscal plan, with a proposed budget deficit of 2.4% of GDP, may be rejected by the 
European Union commission and result in rating downgrades. While the EU is likely to manage this 
situation in its usual incremental and reactive way, the possibility of new elections in late 2019 
reigniting euro viability questions will keep Italy on our radar screens. 
BREXIT: It is hard to know whether Brexit risks are unchanged, higher or lower given the minute by 
minute headlines out of the UK. Our base case remains that while the internal politics of the 
Conservative party will keep uncertainty at elevated levels and the European Union will not 
compromise on its key tenants of free movement of goods, services, and people, the two sides will 
agree to a deal that defers the difficult choices on the shape of a final agreement with the EU until late 
2020. 
The Middle East: Risks in the Middle East have not changed substantially with respect to Iraq, Syria, 
or even the impositions of sanctions on Iran. However, the disappearance of the Saudi journalist who 
entered the Saudi Embassy in Turkey on October 2nd has the potential to raise risks to global oil 
supply. While there has been a global uproar, it is not yet clear whether the US will impose serious 
sanctions or Saudi Arabia would retaliate by reducing oil exports if the US finds sufficient evidence 
regarding the alleged killing of the Saudi journalist. The recession in 1973-74 was partly due to the 
quadrupling of oil prices due to the Arab Oil Embargo. Later in that decade, the Iranian Revolution 
and the Iran-Iraq War also led to a 2.5 times spike in oil prices that, along with Federal Reserve 
tightening by then Chairman Paul Volcker, led to a US recession. While we think it is unlikely that 
Saudi Arabia would react so aggressively in the face of serious US reprisals, we note that it remains a 
real risk.

Some Notable Observations 
US Equities Have Been Shunned All Along  
In both our 2018 Outlook and mid-year update, we highlighted the surprising absence of inflows into 
US equities based on flows into mutual funds and Exchange-Traded Funds. As shown in Exhibit 9, 
flows into US equities were negative in 2018, even before the recent downdraft. In fact, US equities 
have seen outflows of $81 billion through August 2018 (based on the most recent comprehensive 
data), while non-US developed equities and emerging market equities have had inflows of $72 billion 
and $20 billion respectively. This is further evidence of our view that while sentiment and short term 
positioning among speculators and hedge fund managers shifts frequently, more stable investors 
have shunned US equities during this long bull market in favor of other developed and emerging 
market equities and global bonds. 
This steady outflow of assets from US equities has been offset by record levels of stock buybacks by 
US companies given high levels of profitability and incremental cash from repatriation of overseas 
earnings, as mentioned above. 
Note: Based on ICI weekly estimates through August 30,2018. Flows exclude reinvested dividends.

Some Headwinds Facing the FANG MAN Stocks Will Persist 
The basket of FANGMAN (i.e. Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Nvidia) 
stocks have dropped across the board from their respective peak price levels, with Facebook's 29% 
decline the largest and Apple's 4% decline the smallest among the group. Even so, each of the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026903 
stocks, with the exception of Facebook, still have positive year-to-date returns and have outperformed 
the S&P 500, as shown in Exhibit 10. 
This is not a recommendation to buy or sell individual securities but rather an assertion that these 
stocks represent a small portion of S&P 500 earnings. Anyone looking to buy or sell single name 
equities should consult Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research. 
Source: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg. 
Nevertheless, we believe that some of the headwinds that have plagued this sector will continue. 
These include: 
• Data privacy issues impacting a broad range of companies, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, 
Alipay and Tencent. 
• High likelihood of greater regulatory scrutiny in the US2 and Europe as policy makers increasingly 
believe that these companies will not address the privacy and security issues of social media 
users3 on their own. 
• Increased focus by ESG investors (Environment, Social, and Governance) that many of the 
technology and social media companies are falling short on social and governance issues. 
While this basket of stocks may or may not lead the market in the future, it is important to note that 
they represent only 10% of S&P 500 earnings. 
Investment Implications 
The recent market downdraft has understandably rekindled fears that the longest bull market in 
history is coming to an end. While there are no certainties in investing, we do not think the odds 
support that conclusion based on our read of the steady and unsteady factors discussed above. Keep 
in mind that about 75% of historical US bear markets—defined here as equity market declines of 20% 
or more—have occurred during economic recessions. In fact, US equity returns have remained 
favorable until about five to six months prior to the onset of recession, highlighting the penalty for 
prematurely exiting the market (see Exhibit 11). With only 10% odds of recession over the next year, 
we think the economic backdrop remains favorable for stocks. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026904 
Source: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg. 
Of course, none of the supportive factors discussed above precludes further bouts of equity volatility. 
As we highlighted at the beginning of the year, the historical probability of a 5% or greater correction 
from current valuation levels was 96%. Yet these statistics alone do not justify underweighting 
equities, since such pullbacks often occur after sizable equity rallies, as this year reminds us. 
Moreover, such pullbacks are quite normal historically. After all, stocks have suffered a median of two 
pullbacks of at least 5% and one of at least 10% per calendar year in the post-WWII period, leaving 
both the frequency and magnitude of this year's dips in line with past experience. Most importantly, 
years that experienced a similar number of pullbacks as 2018 nonetheless ended with a median gain 
of 6% and had 77% odds of a positive return. 
Conclusion 
Although we have painted a less alarmist view of recent market weakness, we are by no means 
Pollyannaish. While bull markets do not die of old age, they do become more susceptible to ailments 
over time. Yet as we survey the tug of war between the steady factors and the unsteady undertow, 
we do not think the balance of risks is strong enough to topple the ongoing US expansion and the 
continued growth of corporate earnings it supports. 
That said, this viewpoint does not preclude further market volatility and the market may still make new 
lows if the current downdraft persists. But history suggests the bull market is likely to continue until 
about 5-6 months prior to the end of this economic expansion. Thus, it will take a significant increase 
in the odds of an imminent recession to provide the trigger—that has been lacking thus far—to 
tactically underweight equities. In the interim, we continue to recommend that clients maintain their 
strategic allocation to US equities.

revelation aside. A practical consideration is that debates of how God is likely to be
motivated to intercede have tended to find little consensus or traction. Science gets

some.

I tipped my hand on my own views in Chapter 1. As chairman of the Leakey
Foundation for more than 40 years, | pretty clearly buy evolution theory and
unguided natural casualty as working assumptions. But I invite those who don’t to
read further before deciding that we will disagree on conclusions. If] foresaw a
conflict with the devout, which | don’t, I would feel obligated to warn them now. I'll

bring this up again as we go along.

My next few axioms, lumped together, are a mortal and reproducing population
which competes, cooperates and freelances to act on convergent predictions. It acts
to satisfy convergent tastes in a world of limited resources. I will model the
population as human, although other species would do insofar as my axioms hold
for them. “Convergent” means non-identical from individual to individual or place to
place or moment to moment, but converging to norms with increasing scale in space

and time. Predictions converge to outcomes as well as to one another.

The point is that tastes and predictions must be convergent enough for markets to
form and hold. A market, as Becker knew, is where anyone makes any choice among
alternatives. A literal market is where a choice leaves a quantitative record. Markets
cannot form and hold if we cannot predict where to find them and what they supply
and when they are open. They cannot form and hold without some consensus that
what we predict they will offer includes something we want. Clothing stores can
work because our sizes and shapes fall mostly within standard ranges. Their
business would be in trouble if we did not agree in number and rough placement of
arms and legs and head. Restaurants can work because we can find what we want
on a finite menu. Most crucially, clothing stores and restaurants cannot hold unless

there is consensus on what their wares are worth in return. All this convergence

Thanks Darren 
Good news! 
I'm under the impression that checks will be exceptional (they are more cumbersome to handle), and we will 
use mostly wires. 
Considering the time difference, my heavy travel and my own propension to do things at night and on week-
ends I would much prefer having an internet code and be able to organize everything online when I need to. 
When I use Interaudi (my US bank), they can do that, store the recurring beneficiaries, and do wires in 
multiple currencies, but I am not familiar with DB.

Of course, you could also have the same access and help me when needed. 
Also, your point about bookkeeping is mitigated by the fact that, in any case, I will also need to have someone 
keeping track of the receipts and inventory, before shipping proofs to you. In any case there will be need for 
some work on my side before final filing is done. 
On the other hand, if there is a checks and balances control issue, there could be a cap to my wiring powers 
(like the 10 K we discussed), that would be absolutely fine for me if this is the intent. 
Please do let me know. 
We can also talk about it (in Hawai now, free after 2 PM your time) 
In any case, this is good and happy news. I'll review the first list of payments over the week-end.

Hi Jeffrey 
Happy to talk to you almost anytime today until around 3PM. Just tell me what number I should reach. 
Not sure what got lost in translation here: never had the intention to go to any art fair or art show or 
anything of the kind. 
All the artists we have in mind or send to you are people we have direct connections with. Not just their 
studio, but also their home. They are people the work of whom we follow, and many of them are already 
friendly (Arianna, Cali have had dinner or stayed home). 
The idea is absolutely to have an impact on the ecosystem and to make a difference by supporting great 
artists when they need it. 
Galleries references are important, because galleries allow artist to reach a broader audience. We would go 
directly to the source. 
This is why it's important for me to go to LA or Berlin (or elsewhere) because those artists are not rich yet, 
they dont travel so much. They belong to a scene, and it does make a big difference to them if you connect in 
person. 
The spirit is to have an impact on young, talented folks, and absolutely to stay at the source. 
Once again, not sure was drifted away from this in communication

TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022405.txt,"﻿To whom it may concern:

I met Jeffrey Epstein half a dozen years ago.  We have been in regular contact since, with many long and often in-depth discussions about a very wide range of topics, including our own specialties and professional work, but a host of others where we have shared interests.  It has been a most valuable experience for me. 

In the area of his own direct engagements, I have learned a great deal from him about the intricacies of the global financial system, about complex technical issues that arise in the often arcane world of finance, and about specific cases in which I have a particular interest, such as the financial situation in Saudi Arabia and current economic planning and prospects there. Jeffrey invariably turns out to be a highly reliable source, with intimate knowledge and perceptive analysis, commonly going well beyond what I can find in the business press and professional journals.

Turning to my own special interests in linguistics, cognitive science, and philosophy of language and mind, Jeffrey constantly raises searching questions and puts forth provocative ideas, which have repeatedly led me to rethink crucial issues. 

We have also had (for me) very rewarding discussions on many other topics, for example the prospects for Artificial Intelligence, deep learning, multi-layered neural nets, automation and robotics, singularity, and related matters, exploring the claims and predictions and looking closely at the results that have been achieved, their intellectual contributions and social import.  We have also discussed many other issues, ranging from intellectual history, to world affairs and contemporary geopolitics, to foundations of mathematics, to such matters as recent discoveries about communication in the plant world.  He has also tried, so far with limited success, to carry forward my wife Valeria’s efforts to introduce me to the world of jazz and its wonders.  Whatever comes up, Jeffrey not only has a lively interest but also unconventional and challenging ideas and thoughtful suggestions.

Given the range and depth of his concerns, I suppose I should not have been surprised to discover that Jeffrey has repeatedly been able to arrange, sometimes on the spot, very productive meetings with leading figures in the sciences and mathematics, and global politics, people whose work and activities I had looked into though I had never expected to meet them.  Once, when we were discussing the Oslo agreements, Jeffrey picked up the phone and called the Norwegian diplomat who supervised them, leading to a lively interchange.  On another occasion, Jeffrey arranged a meeting with former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, whose record I had studied carefully and written about.  We have our disagreements, but had a very fruitful discussion about a number of controversial matters, including one that was of particular interest to me: the Taba negotiations of January 2001, in the framework or President Clinton’s “parameters,” events that remain obscure and controversial because the diplomatic record is still mostly secret.  Barak’s discussion of the background was illuminating, also surprising in some ways.  In very different areas, much the same was true in meetings Jeffrey arranged with evolutionary biologists, neuroscientists, mathematicians and computer scientists, several of them engaged in exciting work at the limits of understanding in their fields, sometimes with perspectives quite different from mine. More lively interchanges, in which Jeffrey was once again an active participant, often an effective gadfly.

The impact of Jeffrey’s limitless curiosity, extensive knowledge, penetrating insights, and thoughtful appraisals is only heightened by his easy informality, without a trace of pretentiousness.  He quickly became a highly valued friend and regular source of intellectual exchange and stimulation.

But it will also be very expensive, say Troy Brennan, the chief medical officer of CVS Caremark, the giant
pharmacy benefits manager.“If these drugs are used as broadly as they could be used, they are going to be by far
the most expensive drug class,” Brennan says.

Praluent, an injection, lowers low-density lipoprotein, the so-called “bad cholesterol”, by as much as 60%, far
more than the statin drugs alone. It is the first drug to work by targeting a protein called PCSK9. Mutations in
the gene that makes it can result in patients having lower cholesterol and a dramatically lower lifetime risk of
heart attacks. A rival medicine from Amgen is also expected to be approved soon. The FDA is clearing Praluent
for patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic condition that causes high cholesterol,
and for people who have heart disease, like those who’ve had heart attacks or strokes, who are already taking
the maximum dose of a statin they can tolerate.

Regeneron and its marketing partner Sanofi say Praluent will have a wholesale cost of $40 a day, or $14,600 a
year, for either of two doses, 75 milligrams or 150 mgs. It’s likely that insurance companies will get a
significant discount, because Amgen and Regeneron will compete by giving the insurers rebates.

Turkey’s model may be a slippery slope

Soner Cagaptay

April 18, 2011 -- The so-called “Turkish model,” in which an
Islamist party heads an ostensible democracy, has been touted in
recent weeks as the likely outcome in post-authoritarian Arab
countries.

Likely, maybe, but Turkey’s experience under the ruling Justice and
Development Party, or AKP, suggests that such a path may also be a
slippery slope.

The AKP does not aim to create a fundamentalist state in Turkey, but
the ruling party’s conservative policies might inadvertently lead to
precisely that. For several years the AKP has been transforming
Turkish society by making religion the moral compass of the
country’s body politic. This does not mean that the party wants to
turn Turkey into a theocracy. But once narrowly defined faith
becomes a guiding principle in formulating policy, fundamentalists
claiming ideological purity become more competitive politically.
Their demands for an even stricter implementation of religion-based
rules and values risk pushing Turkish society toward radicalization.
History teaches us that fundamentalists always defeat conservatives in
any competition for ideological purity. In the 11th century, the
religiously conservative Almoravid movement swept the Muslim
kingdom of Andalusia in reaction to its liberal ways, especially its
embrace of progressive thought and acceptance of non-Muslims.
Upon taking over Andalusia, the Almoravids enshrined their illiberal
interpretation of Islam as the moral compass of society.

But the Almoravids’ brand of conservatism was soon viewed as too
lax by Muslims who were even more fundamentalist. The Almohads

A: Correct.
Q: You didn’t want Mr. Epstein to know that you were not 18 yet, right?

A: Correct.

fF (deposition) at 36.

In fact, Ms. bold Mr. Epstein that she was 18 years old, and confirmed this fact with
Palm Beach Police. Id. at 36. Beyond that, Ms. [EE “swore on her mother’s grave” that she
and Mr. Epstein did not engage in sex of any kind. NM Tr. (deposition) at 24. She further
repeatedly explained that prior to the time she went to Mr. Epstein’s house (she went there only
once), nobody ever tried to coerce her to engage in sexual activity with Mr. Epstein. Not over the
telephone, not over the Internet, not at all. {MT r. (deposition) at 31-32. These are not facts
upon which a federal case can stand.

Ms. [BBs age was also unknown to Mr. Epstein when she went to his home. |
| | who was introduced to Mr. Epstein by Ms] testified in her federal sworn interview
that Ms Bko1d her to lie to Epstein. See: Tr. at 8 (“she just said make sure you’re 18
because Jeffrey doesn’t want any underage girls’) (emphasis added). Ms. testimony
strongly suggests that Ms. HEMMicd to Mr. Epstein about her own age as well. Ms.
also self represented that she worked at a local erotic massage parlor that presumably required a
minimum age.

The conduct of re i: likewise illustrative of “mutually corroborating” testimony

which supports the fact that this is not an appropriate federal case. In the same way that Ms.

HE as referred to Mr. Epstein and brought to his home without having been introduced or

acquainted in any manner, Ms Mil@lliwas referred by someone else, | who also told
her to lie to Mr. Epstein about her age, which she did. .. at pp. 8-9).

CEOS seeks to buttress the USAO prosecution by asserting “it is possible to satisfy that
element [proof of specific intent as to the age of the alleged victims] with proof that the defendant
was deliberately ignorant of facts which would suggest that the person was a minor.” (CEOS letter
at p. 2). Such assertion is counter to the law and to the facts. Reliance on a deliberate ignorance
standard as to any of the three statutes in issue requires the factual predicate of an intent not to learn
of an incriminating fact. This is the antithesis of the factual context of this case where there is
repeated proof that the minors believed that they had to lie because Mr. Epstein had an actual
practice of attempting to verify age, and would not let them in his house if they were under the age of
18. See United States v. Kennard, 472 F.3d 851, 857-858 (11 Cir. 2006), quoting, United States v.
Puche, 350 F.3d 1137, 1149 (11™ Cir. 2003) (An instruction on deliberate ignorance is appropriate
only if it is shown [among other things] . . . that the defendant purposely contrived to avoid learning

won. A huge bonfire blazed in front of the bakery. All around us the grown-ups
were singing and dancing in celebration.

On the Arab side, there was no rejoicing. Every one of the Arab delegations
at the UN voted against partition, rejecting a Jewish state even if it was created
along with a Palestinian Arab one. Violence erupted the next day. An attack on
a bus near Lydda, near the road up to Jerusalem, left six Jews dead. Similar
attacks occurred around the country. Shooting broke out in mixed Arab-and-
Jewish towns and cities: Jaffa on the southern edge of Tel Aviv. Safed, Tiberias
and Haifa in the north, and in Jerusalem.

I followed all this with curiosity and trepidation through my halting attempts
to read Davar le Yeladim, the weekly children’s edition of the Labour Zionist
newspaper Davar. We children felt an additional connection with what was
going on. One of our Dror housemates, a boy named Giora Ros, had left the
year before when his father took a job in Jerusalem. As the battle for the city
raged through the end of 1947 and into 1948, its besieged Jewish residents
fought for their lives. We sent our friend packages of clothing and food, which
we saved up by eating only half of an egg at breakfast and smaller portions at
dinner.

The mood darkened further at the end of January 1948, four months before the
British departed. A cluster of settlements known as Gush Etzion, south of
Jerusalem near the hills of Bethlehem, also came under siege. Around midnight
on January 15, a unit of Haganah youngsters set off on foot to try to break
through. They became known as “The 35”. Marching through the night from
Jerusalem, they had made it only within a couple of miles of Gush Etzion when
they were surrounded and attacked by local Arabs. By late afternoon, all of
them were dead. When the British authorities recovered their bodies, they found
that the enemy had not simply killed them. All of the bodies had been battered
and broken. Rumors spread that in some cases, the dead men’s genitals had
been cut off and shoved into their mouths. Since I was still a few weeks short of
my sixth birthday, I was spared that particular detail. But not the sense of horror
over what had happened, nor the central message: the lengths and depths to
which the Arabs of Palestine seemed ready to go in their fight against us.
“Hit’alelu bagufot!” was the only slightly sanitized account we children were
given. “They mutilated the corpses!”

Even after the partition vote, statehood was not a given. In the weeks before
the British left, two senior Americans —the ambassador to the UN and Secretary

What all this could also mean, however, is that the Syrian regime is
wrong in pursuing its salvation in foreign capitals. Ultimately, Assad,
his legitimacy in tatters, will have to win out against his own people.
That will not be easy, not when the president has had to order the
military occupation of several of his major cities. The regime’s
behavior is a daily insult to Syrians, one they will not readily forget.

custodian that is not a central securities depository. 
Custodians are all organizations that hold securities in safekeeping for other organizations. Most U.S.-
resident custodians also invest in foreign securities for their own account. U.S.-resident custodians 
should report both the foreign portfolio securities held in safekeeping for other U.S. residents and their 
own foreign portfolio securities. 
End-investors are U.S.-resident organizations that invest in foreign securities for their own portfolios or 
invest on behalf of others, such as investment managers/fund sponsors. This includes securities that are 
held-for-trading, available-for-sale, or held-to-maturity. U.S.-resident end-investors include, but are not 
limited to: 
• Financial and non-financial organizations 
• Managers of private and public pension funds 
• Managers/sponsors of funds, country funds, unit-investment funds, exchange-traded funds, 
collective-investment trusts, hedge funds or any other similarly pooled, commingled funds. Also 
managers/sponsors of private equity companies, venture capital companies, hedge funds and other 
private investment vehicles 
• Insurance companies 
• Foundations 
• Institutions of higher learning 
• Trusts and estates 
• Funds and similar entities that own shares or units of, or other portfolio equity interests in,

Schedule 2 and/or Schedule 3. 
Schedule 2 - Used to report detailed information on foreign securities owned by U.S.-resident 
investors (1) that the reporter safe-keeps for itself or for its U.S.-resident clients or (2) for which 
the reporter directly employs foreign-resident sub-custodians or U.S.-resident or foreign-
resident central securities depositories (CSDs) to manage the safekeeping of those securities 
(Foreign securities in safekeeping with U.S.-resident CSDs are reportable on Schedule 2.) or (3) 
that are instruments of the type that there is no U.S. custodian to manage the safekeeping of

about a conveyor belt, not a casting couch. Hundreds of girls were not only harassed but molested.” Now
The Daily Beast has learned that Epstein had made a $1 million wire transfer to Brunel’s offshore bank
account in September 2004, just as he was setting up MC2. Whether this was a gift or a loan ora
backdoor investment in the new venture is unknown. A French citizen who managed to avoid giving
evidence in the Epstein investigation, Brunel declined to comment on any of this, as does Fuller. Asked
in April of Brunel’s activities, Epstein said “I’m 100 percent convinced that he doesn’t traffic children.”
(Brunel has never been charged.)

An American fashion designer who booked her girls through MC2 says they were very young and very
beautiful; many were from Eastern Europe and spoke little English. A former bookkeeper in the agency’s
Miami office, who also arranged visas for girls traveling to the U.S., confirmed that MC2 girls became
frequent guests on Epstein’s private jets.

Pilot logs obtained in the civil suits show that some of the named plaintiffs were on the flight manifests.
Other times, the pilot would just list the other passengers plus female.”

Jeffrey Epstein, Jew Billionaire Pedophile, Child Trafficker Goes Free..WoW! 20 year old Hearsay is enough to destroy catholic priest. What happened here to

the justice system?

Conchita Sarnoff

http://www.thedailyb...hile- goes-free/

Conchita Sarnoff has developed multimedia communication programs for Fortune 500 companies and
has produced three current events debate television programs, The Americas Forum, From Beirut to
Kabul, and a segment for The Oppenheimer Report. She is writing a book about child trafficking in
America.

Hedge fund mogul and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who went free this week, lived in a depraved world
of thrice-daily massages, pornographic artwork, and hush money—that’s only now being revealed.
Conchita Sarnoff follows up on her investigation of the legal wrangling that saved him from a long
prison term and reports on the sordid details in part two of her exclusive exposé. Also:

* Palm Beach’s police chief objected to Epstein’s “special treatment” and gave The Daily Beast an
exclusive look at his nine-hour deposition about the investigation.

¢ Earlier versions of the U.S attorney’s charges, including a sealed 53-page indictment, could have landed
Epstein in prison for 20 years.

* Victims alleged that Epstein molested underage girls from South America, Europe, and the former
Soviet republics, including three 12-year-old girls brought over from France as a birthday gift.

¢ The victims also alleged trips out of state and abroad on Epstein’s private jets, which would be
evidence of sex trafficking—a much more serious federal crime than the state charges Epstein was

convicted of.

* Epstein’s attorneys investigated members of the Palm Beach Police Department, while others ordered
private investigators to follow and intimidate the victims’ families; one even posed as a police officer.

* Then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales told The Daily Beast that he “would have instructed the
Justice Department to pursue justice without making a political mess.”

airplane flights with Jeffrey Epstein. They have me
ona number of flights, none -- let me emphasize,
none within the relevant time period, none within
the relevant time period. That is, there are no
manifests that have me on Jeffrey Epstein's airplane
during the time that Virginia Roberts claims to

have -- falsely claims to have had sex with me.

So, yes, not only recall making that
statement, but | repeat it here today. And it ts
absolutely true. And it just confirms what I know,
and that is that Virginia Roberts made up the entire
story.

BY MR. SCAROLA:
Q. Your statement --

MR. SCOTT: What page are you reading

from?

MR. SCAROLA: Page 5.

Q. Your statement was that you were never on

a private airplane with this woman, which I assume
was a reference to Virginia Roberts, correct?

It is, yes.

Or any other underage girl?

. That's right.
All right. How many times --
Well, let me be very clear. [have no

190

idea who was in the front cabin of the airplane with
the pilots. Obviously what | intended to say and
what I say here now is I never saw an underaged
person on an airplane.

Now, when | -- when I flew with Jeffrey
Epstein to the launch, my recollection is that there

may have been a couple on the plane with their child

who was going to see the launch. But that was
certainly not the context in which | made the
statement.

I never saw any underage, young person who
would be the subject or object of any improper
sexual activities. Had I seen Jeffrey Epstein ever
in the presence of an underage woman in a context
that suggested sexuality, | would have, A, left the
scene; B, reported it; and, C, never had any further
contact with Jeffrey Epstein.

Q. You have also made the statement that you
were never on a private airplane with any underage
women or any young women, correct?

A. The context was underage women in a sexual
context. If it was a -- you know, a four-year-old
child being carried by her mother, that would not be
included in what | intended to say.

Q. Your sworn testimony yesterday, according

ow AO he WN

Ro
RF Oo oO

4,971.

to the transcription, the official transcription of
that testimony, was that, quote:

Let me emphasize that the manifests that
do exculpate me do not shew me flying with Virginia
Roberts, they do not show me flying with any young
women.

‘That was the testimony you gave under
oath. Do you stand by that testimony today?

A. The manifests that | saw corroborate my
own memory -- my own memory is as clear as could
be -- that I never saw any inappropriately aged,
underaged women on any airplane to my knowledge that
were visible to me at any time that I flew. That is
my testimony, yes.

Q. Well, that's not a response to the
question that J asked. Is it your testimony today
that you never flew on a private airplane with,
quote, “any young women?

MR. SCOTT: Objection, form.

A. By young women, I obviously meant in that
context underage women. And underage women in the
context of sexuality. And, yes, I -- I stand by
that statement.

BY MR. SCAROLA:
Q. Allright. So your -- your clarification

wow oy DA WH & WY

NNN NN KD HPP PB Be oP ee oe OE
Oe WNP OM OY HD GH WN FO

192

of your earlier testimony is that you never saw any
young women in a sexual context?

A. That's not clarification. I think that's
what | initially said. That's what | initially
intended. And that's the way any reasonable -- any
reasonable person would interpret what my original
testimony was. So | don't believe my original
testimony required any clarification.

Q. So what you meant to convey by the
statement that you made when you said you never flew
with any underage girl or any young women was you
never fiew with any underage girl or young women in
a sexual context?

MR. SCOTT: Objection, form.
BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. Is that correct?

A. Let me simply repeat the fact and that is,
to my knowledge, | never flew on an airplane or was
ever in the presence on an airplane with any
underage woman who would be somebody who might be in
a sexual context. | say that only to eliminate the
possibility that some four-year-old was on the lap
ofa mother or somebody was on the airplane with
family members.

But, no, | do not recail -- and I'm very

limits of autonomous decision-making —then stop, for the sanity of everyone involved.

3. Handling problems your outsourcers or co-workers can handle

4. Helping outsourcers or co-workers with the same problem more than once, or with noncrisis
problems Give them if-then rules for solving all but the largest problems. Give them the freedom to act
without your input, set the limits in writing, and then emphasize in writing that you will not respond to
help with problems that are covered by these rules. In my particular case, all outsourcers have at their
discretion the ability to fix any problem that will cost less than $400. At the end of each month or
quarter, depending on the outsourcer, I review how their decisions have affected profit and adjust the
rules accordingly, often adding new rules based on their good decisions and creative solutions.

5. Chasing customers, particularly unqualified or international prospects, when you have sufficient
cash flow to finance your nonfinancial pursuits

6. Answering e-mail that will not result in a sale or that can be answered by a FAQ or auto-
responder For a good example of an auto-responder that directs people to the appropriate information
and outsourcers, e-mailinfo@fourhourworkweek.com.

7. Working where you live, sleep, or should relax Separate your environments—designate a single

space for work and solely work—or you will never be able to escape it 84

8. Not performing a thorough 80/20 analysis every two to four weeks for your business and
personal life

9. Striving for endless perfection rather than great or simply good enough, whether in your
personal or professional life Recognize that this is often just another W4W excuse. Most endeavors are
like learning to speak a foreign language: to be correct 95% of the time requires six months of
concentrated effort, whereas to be correct 98% of the time requires 20-30 years. Focus on great for a few
things and good enough for the rest. Perfection is a good ideal and direction to have, but recognize it for
what it is: an impossible destination.

10. Blowing minutiae and small problems out of proportion as an excuse to work

11. Making non-time-sensitive issues urgent in order to justify work How many times do I have to
say it? Focus on life outside of your bank accounts, as scary as that void can be in the initial stages. If
you cannot find meaning in your life, it is your responsibility as a human being to create it, whether that
is fulfilling dreams or finding work that gives you purpose and self-worth—ideally a combination of
both.

12. Viewing one product, job, or project as the end-all and be-all of your existence Life is too short
to waste, but it is also too long to be a pessimist or nihilist. Whatever you’re doing now is just a
stepping-stone to the next project or adventure. Any rut you get into is one you can get yourself out of.
Doubts are no more than a signal for action of some type. When in doubt or overwhelmed, take a break
and 80/20 both business and personal activities and relationships.

13. Ignoring the social rewards of life Surround yourself with smiling, positive people who have
absolutely nothing to do with work. Create your muses alone if you must, but do not live your life alone.
Happiness shared in the form of friendships and love is happiness multiplied.

84. To avoid the living room and coffee shop as offices, consider using a social “co-working” space
on occasion: http://coworking .pbwiki.com.

be complicated enough to behave intelligently, while any system complicated enough to

The Third Law offers comfort to those who believe that until we understand
intelligence, we need not worry about superhuman intelligence arising among machines.
But there is a loophole in the Third Law. It is entirely possible to build something
without understanding it. You don’t need to fully understand how a brain works in order
to build one that works. This is a loophole that no amount of supervision over algorithms
by programmers and their ethical advisors can ever close. Provably “good” AI is a myth.
Our relationship with true AI will always be a matter of faith, not proof.

We worry too much about machine intelligence and not enough about self-
reproduction, communication, and control. The next revolution in computing will be
signaled by the rise of analog systems over which digital programming no longer has
control. Nature’s response to those who believe they can build machines to control
everything will be to allow them to build a machine that controls them instead.

H6fdi House in Reykjavik. For five days, the leaders talked alone
except for interpreters. Reagan badly wanted to develop the Strategic
Defense Initiative; known by its nickname, ‘Star Wars. The idea was to
put smart weaponry in space that could destroy ballistic missiles before
they reentered the atmosphere. Reagan believed this would remove the
threat of imminent destruction that had hung over the world since 1945.
Gorbachev, on the other hand, felt this was just another escalation in
the Cold War, and the Soviet Union would be forced to build yet more
weapons to overcome the American defenses. He wanted Reagan's plans
shelved, arguing that it broke the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. He was
probably right. The leaders talked back and forth, unable to overcome
the impasse. At the end of the summit there was a mad scramble to
announce some sort of deal, but this proved difficult. In the last moments
before they had to conclude a communiqué, Reagan suggested they
abolish ai/ nuclear weapons. Reagan's negotiating team was horrified and
shut the door.

For decades, the American strategy had been to use nuclear
weapons as a deterrent against the apparent numerical advantage of the
Soviets. In all the potential scenarios analyzed by the Pentagon, Russian
forces ended up overrunning American forward positions — otherwise
known as Western Europe! The only way to stop them was through a
release of nuclear weapons, which, inevitably escalated to all-out nuclear

We were unaware of the pervasive poverty and deprivations — educational, economic, medical,
nutritional — that would make real equality impossible, at least in the near term, for so many black
people, even if legal inequalities were eliminated.

I should have known better even back then, especially after I twice travelled to the Deep South
occasions during the turbulent years of the civil rights movement. My first trip was in the early
1960s as part of a student group that was trained at the Howard Law School to be “observers.”
During that short visit I had little direct contact with local Black residents of the South. I did
meet several Black lawyers and civil rights workers, but they were generally from similar
backgrounds to my own. My second trip was by myself in the early summer of 1965, when the
Harvard Law School sent me to several historically black colleges in an effort to recruit students
for a special program we had instituted to help prepare minority students for law school. I
traveled to several Southern states and lived on the campuses of predominantly Black colleges for
several days. There too I met college students and professors, many of whom came from middle
class homes. I almost certainly met some students from deprived backgrounds, but they
appeared, in the context of a campus setting, no different from students with middle class
upbringings.

I also spent time at several southwestern colleges with Native American and Hispanic students. I
had insisted that our recruitment efforts not be limited to African American students and that they
should include other minorities and disadvantaged groups that sent few if any students to elite law
schools. Even back then, I felt uncomfortable having any decisions, even affirmative ones, based
on race alone. I believed then, and I believe now, that the ideal goal of affirmative action is to
level the playing field by providing a current advantage to individuals who were subject to past
disadvantages, in order to assure future equal opportunities to compete on the merits with
advantaged individuals. That is the theoretical ideal — individual justice to assure that each person
is judged by the quality of their character and other meritocratic criteria — but I soon learned that
in practice group factors inevitably come into play. The real issue is how to strike the appropriate
balance between the theoretical ideal and the practical necessities.

This issue came to the fore in a series of controversial Supreme Court decisions, in which I played
different roles. The first was the case of DeFunis in 1974.*’ The second was the case of Bakke in
1997,

The DeFunis case was brought by a white applicant to the law school of the University of
Washington, a state school, who had been rejected. He claimed that if he had been Black, he
would have been admitted under the school’s affirmative action program. The school did not
dispute this claim, but argued that it had the right to try to achieve “a reasonably representation”
of minority students.

The lower court ruled in favor of Marco DeFunis and ordered his admission. By the time the case
reached the Supreme Court, he had nearly graduated and the school told the justices that he
would be allowed to graduate even if the Supreme Court ruled against him. For that reason, the
High Court dismissed the case as moot, thus postponing the decision as to whether it would
uphold race-specific affirmative action programs. But Justice William O. Douglas, probably the

57 DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U.S. 312 (1974).

It matters why yields are rising — higher inflation breakevens key for stocks.
Digging a little deeper shows that the underlying dynamics in the bond market matter.
Essentially rising inflation breakevens is the key driver for equities. Even when real
yields are rising it is the change in implied inflation that has correlated most strongly
with equity returns in recent years. Looking at 4-week rolling returns since 2009, in the
periods that real yields rose Stoxx 600 returns were a median +1.7% if breakevens were
also higher at the same time. In contrast a combination of higher real yields and lower
inflation breakevens led to a median -0.7% return.

Death and tax reform
Quantitative Analysis
29 January 2017 Corrected
Unauthorized redistribution of this report is prohibited. This report is intended for amanda.ens@baml.com
Deep dive on corporate tax reform
OK, maybe it’s not as inevitable as death and taxes, but some form of corporate tax
reform seems likely. It is a stated priority of President Trump and has widespread
Congressional support. We here focus on four components that could have big equity
implications. We assess the impacts at a market, sector, and industry level, and plan to
update and augment this work as more details come to light.
Potential near-term boost to EPS, long-term impact varies
Our 2018 S&P 500 EPS estimate of $137 already implies healthy two-year growth of +16%.
Tax reform in its entirety could add as much as $5-6 to near-term EPS, as benefits are frontloaded.
The sustained impact depends: under a 20% tax rate, the Blueprint would be
modestly accretive; under a 15% rate, this annual benefit could triple; but a 25% tax rate that
would appease the deficit hawks could shave $3.50 off of earnings each year. We also
estimate a one-time $8-9 charge to GAAP EPS associated with the repatriation tax (Table 1).
Cutting corporate tax rate could add $8 to EPS
Our starting point is the US statutory corporate tax rate. If it were lowered from 35% to
20% and the US moved to a territorial tax system (no longer taxing foreign profits), it
would boost S&P 500 EPS by an estimated 12% ($17 to 2018 EPS). We assume
companies would be able to retain half of the benefit ($8) and the remainder would be
passed on to customers or competed away. For instance, a lasting impact to Utilities'
profits is unlikely, as the benefit would be passed on via regulated pricing.
Repatriation: Buybacks could boost EPS by 3%
Both Trump and the Blueprint support a mandatory (as opposed to 2004's optional) tax
of overseas earnings of US firms’ subsidiaries at reduced rates. Non-Financials in the S&P
hold at least $1.2tn in overseas cash (mostly Tech and Health Care). If half was used for
buybacks, this could add 3% ($4) to S&P 500 EPS. A redux of 2004 where companies
used 80% of cash for buybacks may be less likely, in our view. For if repatriation is
accompanied by an end to interest expense deductions, companies may choose to pay
down debt over buybacks.
Border adjustment tax (BAT) hits EPS by $5-6
While Trump has described the BAT as being “too complicated,” White House press
secretary Spicer’s recent comments call into question his stance. This is a key
component of the Blueprint and would generate significant revenue. First-order impacts
could be significant, with border adjustments detracting $5-6 from 2018 EPS — nearly
80% of the drag comes from the consumer sectors. The second order impacts — product
pricing, pricing within the supply chain, exchange rates, foreign policy reactions, etc. —
while harder to quantify, are important to consider.
End to interest deductibility could detract 4% from EPS
We estimate that over time, the removal of the interest expense deduction would
detract about 4% from S&P 500 EPS. An increase in the cost of debt by an incremental
25% could have longer term ramifications for capital structures and funding..
Tax reform winners and losers
We include stock screens for potential beneficiaries and victims of tax cuts, repatriation
and interest deductibility changes, as well as industries most helped/hurt most by a BAT.
Note that the very fact that there are companies and industries that have the potential
to be very negatively impacted could call into question the likelihood of passage.

2 Equity Strategy Focus Point | 29 January 2017
The costs and benefits of tax reform
2017 could be a watershed year from a tax reform perspective. Trump has continuously
stated that tax reform is a priority, and there is evidence of widespread support in
Congress. Tax reform could be enacted through reconciliation without the risk of being
filibustered, suggesting the timing could be imminent. Corporate tax reform could have
a significant impact on S&P 500 earnings, corporate behavior and capital markets. Much
has been written on the timing, funding and process by which corporate tax reform
could be enacted. In this report, we use House Speaker Paul Ryan’s Blueprint proposal as
a starting point in quantifying the impact of corporate tax reform on the S&P 500, with
some scenario analysis to account for differences included in the final bill (such as
Trump’s proposals). Our analysis is focused specifically on the impact of corporate tax
reform, however we recognize that there are many other factors that can impact the
sensitivity analysis (e.g. changes to household income tax rates, infrastructure spending,
etc.).
We estimate that the Blueprint proposal would initially boost S&P 500 EPS by $5-6,
assuming the end of interest expense deductions only applies to new debt, or is phased
in over time. But the devil is in the details. Over time, the loss of the interest tax shield
would be a significant drag on earnings as existing debt is refinanced. Additionally, the
corporate tax rate is critical in determining whether or not the tax reform policies end
up being accretive to earnings on a sustained basis. We estimate that at the 20% tax
rate, the Blueprint would be modestly accretive, the benefit would triple under Trump’s
proposed 15% tax rate, but at a higher 25% tax rate that would appease the deficit
hawks in Congress, the benefit would turn to a negative over time (Table 2). We also
estimate a one-time $8-9 charge to GAAP EPS that would be associated with the
discounted repatriation tax.

In the following pages, we focus on the following topics that have large implications for
US equity investors, but it is important to consider corporate tax reform holistically
rather than drawing major implications from each measure in isolation:
• Reducing the US corporate tax rate
• Repatriation - mandatory tax on overseas profits
• Border adjustment tax
• Removal of interest expense deduction
The government revenue associated with each of these is included in the table below.

Cutting the corporate tax rate
The best starting point for analyzing corporate tax reform is the US statutory corporate
tax rate, as this rate is critical in determining the impact of other proposed changes
(border adjustments, interest deductibility, etc.). If the tax rate were lowered from 35%
to 20% and the US moved to a territorial tax system (no longer taxing foreign profits),
all else equal, we estimate an initial boost to S&P 500 EPS of 12% ($17 to 2018 EPS).
However, over time, some of this benefit could be passed on to customers via lower
prices — for instance, it is unlikely that there will be any major long-lasting impact from
tax reform for Utilities sector profits, as any benefit/cost would likely be passed through
to customers when incorporated into each company's regulated pricing. The benefit
would also be offset by some of the other changes discussed in subsequent sections.
We assume that S&P 500 companies would be able to retain half of the benefit, or
roughly $8 of 2018E EPS. Below, we show the estimated EPS impacts on each sector
based on a tax rate of 20%.

While the effective tax rate of the S&P 500 is generally about 28% (currently closer to
25% due to the recent commodity recession), we estimate that the tax rate for the S&P
500’s domestic operations is much higher at roughly 33% — although this includes
state and local taxes. If all companies with tax rates above the proposed new tax rate of
20% were to drop to 20%, and no companies provisioned for US taxes on foreign
profits, we estimate the domestic effective tax rate for the S&P 500 would fall in line
with its foreign tax rate of roughly 19%. This would represent a 9ppt decrease in the
current S&P 500 tax rate and a 12% increase in EPS. We show the sensitivity to S&P
500 EPS to different assumed tax rates in the chart below, but we reiterate that these
estimates exaggerate the actual impact on profits, as a significant portion of these
benefits would likely be passed on to consumers via lower prices. We assume that in
aggregate, roughly half of the gains from the lower tax rate would be retained (i.e. half
of the amounts shown in the sensitivity analysis in Chart 2).

Note: Our base case assumes that half of the benefit would be passed on to customers, competed
away or offset by other changes to the tax code. Thus, we would expect the uplift to our EPS forecast
to be roughly half the calculated benefit from simply lowering the corporate tax rate.
The market is beginning to price in the benefits of tax cuts , but we may still be in the
early days – note that potential beneficiaries of fiscal stimulus (i.e. infrastructure
spending) have seen an 18% multiple re-rating but de minimis fundamental support,
whereas potential beneficiaries of lower corporate tax rates have seen performance
driven nearly equivalently by multiples and earnings.

Repatriation
Repatriation likely under both Blueprint and Trump plans
Mandatory tax on overseas profits of 8.75% under Blueprint, 10% under Trump
The US currently operates under a tax system in which the domestic earnings of US
corporates are taxed at the federal US corporate rate (35%) and any overseas earnings
that are repatriated are taxed at this rate less a credit for foreign taxes paid on those
same earnings. Many multinationals’ foreign earnings thus remain parked offshore,
allowing corporations to avoid the tax hit associated with bringing them back to the US.
Both Trump and the House (under Ryan) have proposed a mandatory tax of overseas
earnings of US firms’ foreign subsidiaries at reduced rates, such that this cash can be
brought back and put to work in the US. This differs from the 2004 repatriation tax
holiday, which was optional.
Under the Blueprint, accumulated overseas earnings will be subject to a transition tax of
8.75% 1 (for those held in cash/cash equivalents) or 3.5% (for all other holdings), with
companies able to pay the tax liability over an eight-year period. This would be part of
broader tax reform, where a proposed territorial tax system would exempt companies’
foreign income from US taxes and prevent future buildup of overseas profits as
companies would be free to bring them home. Trump’s plan calls for a one-time deemed
repatriation of overseas corporate profits at a 10% tax rate.

The Tax Policy Center estimates that a repatriation tax holiday would generate
approximately $150bn in tax receipts under Trump’s plan (over 10 years) and $140bn
1
Note: The effective tax rates of 8.75% and 3.5% under the Blueprint are based on an allowable deduction of 75% (for
deferred earnings held in cash/liquid assets) or 90% (for the non-cash portion), with the remainder taxed at the US
corporate tax rate, i.e. 35%(1-75%) = 8.75% and 35%(1-90%) = 3.5%. This methodology was proposed by Dave Camp’s
(former chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means) Tax Reform Act of 2014.

under the Blueprint (over eight years). The Tax Foundation similarly estimates that a
repatriation act could drive spending amounting to $185-200bn in revenues through
2025, which could help fund infrastructure/defense spending.
S&P 500 companies could bring back over $1tn – mostly in Tech & Health Care
Our FX team has written that US corporates in aggregate (including Financials) hold
~$2tn in cash overseas, and their work suggests that nearly half is concentrated within
20 companies. Similarly, as we discuss below, half of the repatriated cash following the
2004 Homeland Investment Act came from just 15 companies, predominantly in Pharma
and Tech. Our own analysis of the S&P 500 (based on filings and estimates from our
analysts) suggests that non-Financials in the S&P hold approximately $1.2tn overseas,
nearly three-quarters of which is in Tech and Health Care (Chart 4).

Repatriation in context: a look back at 2004
The last repatriation holiday in the US was the Homeland Investment Act (HIA) of 2004
(part of the American Jobs Creation Act), which allowed for a one-time repatriation of
foreign earnings by US multinationals at a reduced effective tax rate of 5.25% (vs. the
statutory 35% rate), based on an allowable exemption of 85% of foreign earnings from
US taxes (35% x [1-85%] = 5.25%). This deduction could be claimed in the tax year
beginning before or after the passage date in Oct. 2004. Approximately $300bn was
repatriated, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)’s U.S. International
Transactions Accounts Data, vs. an average of $60bn over the prior five years. The IRS
estimates 2 that 843 US companies took advantage of the act.
Despite HIA’s intent; most repatriated cash was spent on buybacks/dividends
Despite the U.S. Treasury Department’s guidelines that repatriated earnings should be
spent on capital investment, R&D, M&A, and other pro-growth uses such as hiring, this
was not ultimately the result: the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)
estimates 3 that $0.92 of every $1.00 brought back was used to return cash to
shareholders ($0.79 for buybacks and $0.15 for dividends) 4 , and that repatriation
ultimately did not lead to a pick-up in capex, employment or R&D. In fact, a 2011 report
by US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations 5 found that the top 15

repatriating companies—which accounted for 52% of the total repatriated amount—
actually reduced their US workforce and decreased their R&D spending following the
repatriation act. The authors of the NBER study point out that cash is fungible, and
firms were able to bypass the guidelines on how repatriated cash should be used.

No alpha from repatriation and multiples actually compressed
Our analysis of the top 15 repatriating companies (from Table 7) suggests that while
these companies initially outperformed both the S&P 500 and equal-weighted S&P 500
from November 2004-April 2005 (by 6ppt and 5ppt, respectively), they subsequently
underperformed during the remainder of 2005 and early 2006 (Chart 6). From the end of
September 2004 through year-end 2006, these stocks were up 27% on average, in-line
with the overall S&P 500, and below the equal-weighted benchmark’s 36% return. And
multiples for these stocks compressed over the majority of this period, both on an
absolute basis and relative to the benchmark (Chart 7).

Post-repatriation cash use: will this time be different?
Valuations, investor preference, growth & leverage ratios suggest less buybacks
While any potential restrictions on the use of repatriated earnings are still unknown, we
suspect that a pick-up in buybacks is likely, but that a lower proportion will be used for
buybacks today than during the last repatriation holiday. Valuations were generally more
attractive in 2004-2005 on most metrics (Table 9), and we’ve found that buybacks tend
to be more rewarded when stocks are cheap (Chart 8). Additionally, the largest buybacks
have not generated alpha for the last several years, as investors have increasingly
agitated for companies to use their excess cash on pro-growth investments (namely
capex.) According to BofAML’s latest Global Fund Manager Survey, 60% of investors
want companies to increase capex spending, vs. 17% who want companies to return
cash to shareholders (Exhibit 1). This compares to a majority of investors desiring
companies to return cash to shareholders when the HIA was passed in late 2004.
Companies may also feel less pressure to bolster per share metrics by reducing share
count if top line is recovering and organic growth is finally materializing. And from a
capital structure perspective, if leverage loses its tax benefit, given that leverage ratios
are already high (see below) companies may be less likely to reduce their equity capital
base, as that would marginally increase their weighted average cost of capital.
Special dividends, pay-down of debt may be other likely uses
Companies may also return the cash to shareholders by issuing a one-time special
dividend: income remains in-demand, given that both interest rates and dividend payout
ratios remain historically low. And if a repatriation tax holiday comes within the context
of broader tax reform that includes an end to the deductibility of interest expense,
companies may choose to pay down debt over other uses of cash, in an attempt to skew
their balance sheets less toward debt and more toward equity (see the section on no
Equity Strategy Focus Point | 29 January 2017 9
interest tax shield later in this report). Deleveraging balance sheets may also be spurred
by a continued environmwnt of rising interest. Leverage for S&P non-Financials has
steadily been ticking up over the last few years, and, if we exclude the cash-rich
Technology sector, leverage is approaching all-time highs (Chart 9).

Potential EPS impacts
$8-9 (6-7%) hit to GAAP EPS from the mandatory tax on accumulated overseas
profit
We estimate that a tax of accumulated overseas profits of $1.2tn would result in a cash
tax impact of $100-120bn (which may be allowed to be paid over 8-10 years), and a
one-time hit to GAAP EPS of $8-9 (a lower $65-80bn, given that a several large
multinationals such as AAPL already provision for US taxes on a portion of their
overseas profit, resulting in effective US tax rates well above the US statutory rate). Our
analysis assumes Trump’s/the Blueprint’s proposed rates of 8.75%/10%, and that all
overseas profits are hit with this one-time tax, as suggested by their plans. See Table
10.
Note that our estimate of ~$1.2tn of cumulative profits overseas is based on estimates
from us, our fundamental analysts, and company filings, where in many cases only
overseas cash but not other indefinitely invested earnings are disclosed/estimated.
Thus, the tax on these earnings could be slightly higher, though the Blueprint would tax
earnings not held in cash at a lower 3.5% rate. (We conservatively assume our estimated
$1.2tn is all cash and use the higher 8.75% rate under the Blueprint and 10% under
Trump’s plan in our below analysis).

We estimate share buybacks add $4 (or as high as $6) to EPS (GAAP & non-GAAP)
If the full $1.2tn that we estimate for overseas cash for the S&P 500 ex. Financials &
Real Estate is brought back (given the tax is mandatory and will be paid either way) and
50% is used on buybacks (~3% of S&P 500 market cap), this could add ~$4 to S&P 500
EPS. And if 80% (~4% of market cap) were used on buybacks, similar to NBER’s
estimate of what occurred following the 2004 tax holiday, this could add $6 to EPS.
(The difference between the Trump and Blueprint tax rates is small, leading to only
cents in index EPS.) If one assumed companies only brought half of their offshore cash
home immediately, even though the full amount was taxed, these benefits would be cut
in half.
Note that buyback programs may span several years, which could spread out some of
the EPS benefit below. But if one assumes a buyback is fully executed in Year 1, this
provides a one-time boost to EPS growth and a recurring benefit to future EPS given a
permanently lower share count.

Cross-asset implications of repatriation
Repatriation should spur USD-buying – up to 40% may be non-USD denominated
While few companies disclose the currency composition of their offshore cash, our FX
team estimates that 60-75% is already in USD while 25-40% is non-dollar-denominated.
(If we extrapolate based on the S&P 500’s geographic revenue exposure, the largest
proportion could be in Europe, followed by emerging Asia.) This may result in upward
pressure on the USD (which they estimate could amount to $250-$400bn if half of all
offshore cash, which they estimate at ~$2tn, was repatriated). Their analysis of the
EUR-USD during the last repatriation holiday suggests an “announcement effect” is
likely, as the dollar strengthened ahead of the bulk of the actual repatriation flows.
Repatriation could put upward pressure on bank funding costs

suggests ~70% of cash is invested in securities with maturities greater than one year,
with the remaining 30% having shorter maturities. See table below. They believe
repatriation could put upward pressure on bank funding costs as firms reduce their
holdings in these short-term investments. According to Crane Data on offshore money
fund holdings, our rates team cites that $161bn of offshore funds are held in commercial
paper and CDs, of which the majority are from financial institutions with Japan, France and
Canada the largest issuers.

Border adjustment tax analysis
A new tax policy outlined in the Blueprint proposal that has been getting a lot of
attention recently is the border adjustment tax, or the application of border adjustments
to a company’s imports and exports. While Trump has described the proposal as being
“too complicated,” it is a key component of the Blueprint plan and should not be
ignored. Additionally, White House press secretary Sean Spicer’s recent reference to
“…the plan taking shape right now, using comprehensive tax reform as a means to tax
imports from countries…” could be a sign that Trump is not as against the proposal his
other comments would indicate.

This policy would effectively result in the tax authorities recognizing all sales that take
place in the US (regardless of where they are produced) and all the domestic costs
incurred to produce goods and services for customers (regardless of where the sale
takes place). As a result, net importers (such as many retailers) would suffer, as they
would have to pay taxes on their domestic sales without being able to deduct a
significant portion of their costs of production. Conversely, net exporters (companies
with much of their production in the US but sales outside of the US) would stand to
benefit from not having to pay taxes on their foreign sales while being able to deduct a
significant proportion of production costs (Exhibit 3). Purely domestic companies would
be unaffected.

Even if border adjustments are enacted, there is significant uncertainty around
implementation details. For this analysis, we focus on the first order impact of border
adjustments, but we recognize there would be significant second order impacts on the
pricing of products, pricing within the supply chain, foreign exchange rates as well as
foreign policy reactions. (We discuss many of these second order impacts later in this
report.) For the current exercise, we also ignored the cost of services as the
implementation of these rules would be more complicated. See the Methodology
section for more details.
We estimate that at a 20% tax rate, border adjustments would detract $5-6 from 2018
EPS, with nearly 80% of the drag coming from the Consumer Discretionary and
Consumer Staples sectors (roughly evenly split). This impact includes a 50% haircut to
account for offsets from alternate sourcing, currency rates and pricing power. On one
hand, we may be drastically underestimating the impact because we have not included
the second order impacts on the supply chain. For example, many retailers source the
bulk of their goods from domestic suppliers, who source their goods from overseas
suppliers. So while the original retailer may not feel the direct tax hit from importing
goods, the supplier that took the tax hit would likely pass along a significant portion of
this via a higher cost. On the other hand, the supplier or the retailer could look for
alternate domestic sources for those products, but it would largely depend on whether
the cost differential of production between the US and overseas exceeded the border
adjustment tax. Some key components in determining the cost differential are the
foreign exchange rates (more on this below) and labor costs. In the end, the net impact
of the border adjustment taxes will be driven by a complex interplay between corporate
tax rates, pricing power, foreign exchange moves, foreign versus domestic availability
and cost differentials.

Offsetting BAT with a little math and some price increases
A company could fully offset the border adjustment tax by raising prices such that the
after-tax increase in sales would exceed the drag from the lost deduction of costs. All
else equal, the break-even price increase would be equivalent to the cost of goods sold
as a % of sales multiplied by net % imported and the tax to after-tax ratio, which at a
20% rate is 0.25 (20%/80%).
As an example, a company with a 25% gross margin that imports 30% of its goods
would need to increase its prices by of 5-6% to offset the border adjustment tax, all
else equal.
Offsetting BAT with FX
Some of the increase in the after-tax cost of imported goods can also be offset by a
strengthening dollar. For example, companies producing goods in Mexico, which stand to
see a 25% increase in the cost of imported goods, should see the cost increase partially
offset by the 13% devaluation of the Mexican Peso against the US dollar since the
election. The net cost increase is a more digestible 9%, especially when you also
consider that the Peso has devalued nearly 30% since its 2013 peak. While it may offer
little consolation to corporates, the US Dollar Index is up over 25% since mid-2014, so
the border adjustment tax would presumably act as a reversal of the lowered cost of
overseas production over that period.
Border adjustment sensitivity analysis
The table below illustrates how the change in the tax rate and the application of the
border adjustment tax would impact the domestic earnings of a hypothetical company
with sensitivity to different tax rates and net export assumptions. We assumed the
company has a 40% gross margin, operating expenses are 20% of sales and an initial
tax rate of 35%. As you would expect, the biggest benefit would accrue to companies
with significant net exports at a high domestic tax rate (bigger tax shield) and the most
negative impact to significant net imports at a high domestic tax rate (higher taxes on
higher taxable income).

Closing loopholes
Both Trump and the Blueprint proposal suggest getting rid of special-interest
deductions and credits that distort capital allocation decisions. The table below lists the
25 biggest US corporate tax breaks. The #1 and #3 “tax breaks” are the deferral of
foreign income and certain foreign financial income, but these would become irrelevant
if the US moves to a territorial tax system, as is being proposed by the Blueprint plan.
Exempting corporations from paying US taxes on foreign income would put the US in
Equity Strategy Focus Point | 29 January 2017 15
line with the rest of the world on this issue. Similarly, the accelerated depreciation of
machinery & equipment would become irrelevant due to the move toward taxation
based on business cash flow and the immediate write-off of capital expenditures. Once
the depreciation from legacy investments has run off, then depreciation should become
irrelevant for tax purposes. We also highlight the deduction for US production activities
(section 199) due to it being specifically highlighted by the Blueprint proposal as no
longer being necessary under the new tax policies. Both the Blueprint and Trump have
noted that they would likely maintain the Research & Development related tax credits.

Immediate capex expensing should provide some initial cash tax benefits
The shift to the immediate expensing of capital expenditures should provide a
significant near-term reduction in cash taxes as companies benefit from the ongoing
reduction of taxable income from the depreciation of legacy assets combined with the
full expensing of new investments. As the depreciation of legacy assets rolls off, the tax
benefit would become more modest. Keep in mind that, for tax reporting, many
companies already take advantage of the accelerated depreciation schedules discussed
above. The ongoing benefit of capex expensing derives from the deferral in the timing
of tax payments.

No interest tax shield
Another key offset to the lower corporate tax rate is the proposed ending of the
deduction of net interest expense. We assume that this rule would apply to new debt
and that existing debt would be grandfathered. This tax shield removal would increase
the cost of debt by an incremental 25% (not to mention the 100bp+ rise in long-term
interest rates seen since the summer of 2016). In the table below, we illustrate the
impact on S&P 500 corporate profits. We estimate that over time, the removal of the
interest rate deduction would detract about 4%, or $4-5 from S&P 500 2018 EPS,
although the initial impact would be less significant given 70-90% of the debt is long
term.

Many investors assume that interest deductions would likely apply only to new debt, and
if this were the case, the drag would be gradual for the overall S&P 500 as debt matures
and is refinanced. Companies have shifted the composition of their debt toward longer
maturities and fixed rates. We estimate an average S&P 500 debt maturity of over eight
years, with just one-third maturing within the next three years. The grandfathering of
existing debt is a reasonable assumption, but not a sure thing, in our view. There is a
possibility that legislators apply it to all debt on the grounds that most companies are
expected to be net beneficiaries of comprehensive tax reform.
There is also a possibility that this policy is phased in over a number of years, with
certain portions of the existing debt losing their interest deductibility over time.

The most negatively impacted companies would clearly be the ones with the most

While the Utilities sector has a lot of leverage, there would likely be a pass through to
customers in determining their allowed rate increase.

How will levered companies react?
Companies will likely grow comfortable with a smaller amount of debt, retain more
earnings, use less cash for dividends and share buybacks, and potentially draw down
cash if they have it. If a tax holiday is also granted, that might offset the loss of benefit.
Companies that regularly issue long-term debt may choose to reduce that burden to
offset the tax change, and find those funds elsewhere. We find it unlikely that the
change would result in a surge in equity issuance, unless the change applies to existing
debt, which is unlikely in our view. While this change should be taken as a line item in a
wholistic bill, there are victims and beneficiaries here. Corporations that have high
leverage ratios, low retained earnings, high interest expense to earnings ratios, no cash
overseas offset from repatriation, and those that have recurring long-term debt needs
may be most at risk.
Other implications
While some argue that companies will try to raise outsized amounts of investment grade
capital ahead of the deadline to lock in funding with the tax benefit before the loophole
is closed, there is a reasonable chance that a provision is included in the legislation that
would treat such debt as new debt. In our Investment Grade Strategist Hans Mikkelsen’s
view, demand for IG credit could be materially reduced over time. The tax change could
also dampen Leverage Buyout (LBO) activity, according to our High Yield strategist
Michael Contopoulos, where these funds are already struggling to generate high returns
– note that LBO funds are currently sitting on close to $1tn in cash looking for a home,
according to Preqin’s third quarter update.
Who could be hurt: See Table 21 for a screen of stocks with high net interest
expense as a percentage of net income which could potentially be hurt most by an
end to the deductibility of interest expense.

Methodology
Repatriation impact
We estimated cumulative overseas profits for the S&P 500 excluding Financials and
Real Estate via three sources: 1) Bloomberg data on cash held overseas (if
disclosed/available), 2) BofAML analyst estimates on cumulative overseas profits or
cash, and 3) our own estimate if neither (1) or (2) are available, based on (Total cash x
[% of foreign sales +10%]) for companies with at least 5% foreign sales.
We apply the effective tax rates proposed by Trump (10%) and the Blueprint (8.75%) to
our estimated $1.2tn in overseas cash to determine taxes due for the S&P 500 ex.
Financials & Real Estate. We estimate that 100% is brought back given that the tax is
mandatory. To compute the one-time tax impact to GAAP EPS, we divide the cumulative
tax impact by the S&P 500 divisor, after first excluding the impact from several large
multinationals (e.g. AAPL) which already provision a portion of their overseas profits for
US taxes and have effective US tax rates well above 35%.
Note that for companies for which our analysts provided estimates, we asked them to
provide cumulative overseas profits if possible, but in most cases this number reflects
overseas cash. Thus, taxes paid could be slightly higher than we estimate given that
both the Blueprint and Trump’s plans suggest a mandatory tax on all accumulated
overseas profits, some of which may be permanently reinvested; here, the Blueprint
suggests a lower 3.5% tax for retained earnings not held in cash/equivalents, suggesting
that any additional taxes payable that we are not capturing are likely to be small.
To calculate the % EPS impact from buybacks, we subtract the amount of taxes payable
from total cash brought back for the S&P 500 ex. Financials & Real Estate (and for each
sector) and divide this by the market cap for the S&P 500 (and for each sector.) We
multiply this % impact for the overall index by our 2018E EPS of $137 to determine the
potential EPS impact, applying various buyback scenarios (10-100%). We use 50% as a
base case scenario, which is lower than the 80% brought back during the 2004 tax
holiday, to be conservative.
Border adjustments impact on EPS
We estimate the costs of goods imported and exported for each company using the
latest company filings, conversations with analysts, industry research, management
commentary and the Input-Output accounts data published by the U.S. Department of
Commerce. For more information about the Input-Output accounts data, please refer to
the Bureau of Economic Analysis website at http://www.bea.gov/industry/io_annual.htm.
When using the estimates based on Input-Output accounts, we adjust them to account
for the varying foreign exposures of different S&P 500 industries. For companies that
source products through importers (e.g. retailers), we only included the costs of goods
estimated to be directly imported by each company, as taxes pertaining to those
imported goods should be paid by the importers themselves.
We estimate the earnings impact of border adjustments based on the additional taxes
that companies would pay on the costs of imported goods sold in the US (nondeductible)
and any reduction in taxes related to the production costs for exported
goods (deductible). To calculate this, we multiple the net value of imported COGS by the
assumed tax rate. Note that the net impact can be either positive or negative depending
on whether the company is a net importer or exporter. We assume a 50% haircut to the
impact to account for from alternate sourcing, currency rates and pricing power.
Lower corporate tax rate impact on EPS
We estimate the normalized effective domestic tax rate of a company based on
conversations with the analysts or the median 5-year domestic income tax rate. If a
company had a negative tax rate for a particular year, we exclude the tax rate of that
24 Equity Strategy Focus Point | 29 January 2017
year from the median calculation. For companies with normalized tax rates of more than
75%, we assume 35%.
The impact of a lower corporate tax rate on company earnings is directly proportional to
the difference between the current domestic tax rate and the proposed tax rate. The
impact is calculated by taking the difference between the current tax rate and the
proposed tax rate, and dividing it by (1-current tax rate).
To calculate the impact of a lower corporate tax rate on the S&P 500 earnings, we can
divide the change in the effective tax rate by (1 – the current effective tax rate).
Interest deductibility impact
We estimate the cost associated with the removal of the net interest expense deduction
from taxable income by multiplying the net interest expense by the tax rate.

should make clear that the 2014 tax year that will close Oct 2015 is not covered by our past

right out of the box. you said you preferred not. As you said ,I have produced results to date, far in
excess of even my own exalted opinion of my projections. I have devoted a monumental amount of my
limited amount of time-- way, way in excess of our agreement. I will be fair, I am willing to roll in
the amount still outstanding from last year if that helps .. However, As my best student , and my only

resulting “arrow of time”) is developed in Mackey (1992).

As noted, the skeleton which configures attractors is composed of unstable,
“saddle” fixed points, each of which attract (iron down) the trajectory along one
dimension and repel or spread it out along another. Systems fulfilling the criteria for
a chaotic dynamical system have the property of a countably infinite number of
unstable periodic orbits composed of these unstable fixed points. Depending upon
parameters, the orbital points can pull up their tails to be discrete with respect to
each other or spread along the unstable direction to connect smoothly with others
along a curve such as a saddle cycle. Parametric control of the strengths and
structures of the saddle point skeleton of typical attractors can be used to change
both the rate of generation of novel symbols as well as recurrances to old ones in
the symbolic dynamics generating a brain dynamical system’s lexagraphic products
(Bowen, 1978; Alexeev and Jacobson, 1981)).

Using a variety of techniques to algorithmically register “return times,”
experimental condition-sensitive “saddle orbits” composing unstable periodic orbits
have been demonstrated in geometric reconstructions of real data series generated
by a 40+ component chemical reaction (Lathrop and Kostelich, 1989), in response
to natural stimuli in the time dependent behavior of the crayfish caudal
photoreceptor (Pei and Moss, 1996) and in the interburst interval sequences
recorded in hippocampal slices of the rat (So et al, 1997; So et al, 1998). If the
reader uses the software listed above to simulate the time evolution of one of these
attractors of abstract or real systems , she will learn that a remarkably small number
of points, a very short time sample, will outline, “shadow” (Bowen, 1978), the
complete array of unstable fixed points before filling in the attractor. It is tempting to
speculate about the potential nervous system relevance of this dynamical
anticipation of the attractor’s recognizable geometry, as well as a precis of what the
symbolic dynamics are going to say occurs many time steps before filling in the

attractor and its asymptotic message. Values of the measures made on the early

unstable periodic orbit arrays such ht, hu and 4(+), resemble very closely those

The Russians Are Coming

The collapse of the Soviet Union was a major geopolitical disaster
of the century.

—VLADIMIR PUTIN

I THE FIRST INVASION of a European country since the end of
the Cold War, Russian military forces moved into the Crimea and
other parts of eastern Ukraine in February and March 2014. Unlike
with previous Russian troop movements, such as those into Poland,
Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany during the Cold War,
the weeklong massing of Russian elite troops and sophisticated
equipment for the move into Ukraine almost totally evaded detection
by the NSA’s surveillance. Never before had the NSA’s multibillion-
dollar armada of sensors and other apparatus for intercepting signals
missed such a massive military operation. According to a report in
The Wall Street Journal that cited Pentagon sources, Russian units
had managed to hide all electronic traces of their elaborate prepara-
tions. If so, after more than half a century of attempted penetrations,
Russia had apparently found a means of stymieing the interception
capabilities of the NSA.

Putin had firm ideas about restoring Russia’s power in the post—

down-loading documents for some 10 months before he copied these documents. When I
discussed the chronology of the copied documents with a former government official briefed on
the investigation, he suggested that Snowden’s purpose may have changed between 2012 and
2013. When I asked him what might have induced the change, he replied “That is one of the
unanswered questions.” That Snowden only took these two whistle-blowing documents at the
tail-end of his 9-month operation, and after he had contacted Poitras and Greenwald, suggests he
may have had another motive prior to contacting journalists. In light of this chronology, the
investigation had to consider the possibility that his whistle-blowing was, partly if not wholly, a
cover for another enterprise.

The investigation soon ran into another serious issue: his access. Snowden had described to
journalists a situation in which he had access to“ millions of records that [he] could walk out the
door with at any time with no accountability, no oversight, no auditing, the government didn’t
even know they were gone,” but, as it turned out, he was not among the limited number of
individuals at the Center who had access to these documents, The NSA’s and Booz Allen’s
employment records showed that Snowden had not yet completed his requisite on-the- job
training at the National Threat Operations Center in Hawaii when he carried out the theft.
Consequently, he had not yet been provided with the passwords he needed to get the documents.
A former NSA official bluntly told me that Snowden, at least during the period of the thefts in
April and May 2013, had no more legitimate access to the compartments than the cleaning
personnel at the Center. Somehow he converted his proximity to access.

This lack of access could not be ignored in any law-enforcement investigation. Consider if a

hundred top-quality D-flawless diamonds were stolen from locked vaults at Tiffany’s by a recently-
hired trainee who, it turned out, did not have either the combination to open these vaults. One
possibility that the police would be expected to consider was that the trainee might have had help
from a current or former insider at the company who knew the combinations. Snowden had
accomplished a similar inexplicable feat as the hypothetical jewel thief.

In Snowden’s case, the FBI had to consider two very different possibilities that could explain
how he could have acquired the password. He said in his video confession that he was solely
responsible but there was another possibility. He had help, unwitting or witting, from others and
he was trying to protect away from them.

The FBI faced a dilemma. It could either assume that the NSA’s security regime was so badly
flawed that Snowden could trick his fellow workers into providing him with access or that there
was another individual at the Center who might have assisted or directed Snowden. If it pursued
the former hypothesis, it could close the case as far as the sitting Grand Jury was concerned.
After all, Snowden had admitted he was the perpetrator and, if further evidence was needed, he
could be seen showing stolen documents to Greenwald on the video. And Greenwald later used
these documents. For the Grand Jury, it was, as one former federal prosecutor put it, “a slam
dunk.” Not even Snowden denied the charge that he gave secret documents to individuals that

to monetize those inferences without the knowing permission of the person generating the

Wiener, Turing, and von Neumann could not foresee the complexity of those

computation platforms have become a shield behind which some companies hide in order
to inhumanly exploit others. In certain other countries, the governments carry out these
manipulations, and there the goal 1s not profits but the suppression of dissent.

Humankind has gotten itself into a fine pickle: We are being exploited by

Importance: High 
Funny article 
Bill Clinton reportedly had an intriguing 
phone call with Donald Trump weeks 
before his campaign launch 
Rudolph W. Giuliani, Donald Trump, and Bill Clinton attend the 2008 Joe Torre Safe 
at Home Foundation Golf Classic at Trump National Golf Club on July 14, 2008, in 
Briarcliff Manor, New York. 
Former President Bill Clinton and real-estate magnate Donald Trump reportedly 
had a phone conversation in May, only weeks before Trump launched his campaign. 
According to a new report from The Washington Post, Clinton called Trump in May 
and encouraged Trump's efforts to become more influential within the GOP, 
according to four Trump allies and one Clinton associate familiar with the 
exchange. 
From The Washington Post's Robert Costa and Anne Gearan: 
Four Trump allies and one Clinton associate familiar with the exchange said that 
Clinton encouraged Trump's efforts to play a larger role in the Republican Party and 
offered his own views of the political landscape. 
The tone of the call was informal and Clinton never urged Trump to run, the four 
people said. Rather, they said, Clinton sounded curious about Trump's moves 
toward a presidential bid and told Trump that he was striking a chord with 
frustrated conservatives and was a rising force on the right. 
Hillary Clinton, Bill's wife, is the front-runner for the Democratic nomination for 
president in 2016. 
The Clintons have long had ties with the real-estate magnate. As The Post notes, 
Hillary Clinton attended Trump's wedding in 2005, and the reality-television 
personality donated money to her past Senate campaigns, though he has also 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030015 
donated to several of his own Republican presidential rivals. He has said 
those donations were transactional. 
The former president has spoken positively of Trump in the past. 
In a 2012 interview with CNN, Clinton said he liked Trump, despite the real-estate 
mogul's controversial campaign to get President Barack Obama to release his birth 
certificate. 
Donald Trump has been uncommonly nice to Hillary and me. We're all New 
Yorkers, Clinton said. I like him. And I love playing golf with him. 
Aides to both Bill Clinton and Trump did not comment on record to The Post. 
Hillary Clinton's campaign also didn't respond to a request for comment. 
Bill Clinton has occasionally doled out advice to Republican presidential candidates. 
In 2012, Clinton reportedly gave former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney (R) some 
tips before his successful debate with President Barack Obama, telling the governor 
how to appear in command onstage.

Subject: writing up proposal 
Importance: High 
Dear Jeffrey, 
Larry has told me that you and a friend would like to contribute to my project (hallelujah and thank you a 
million times, Jeffrey) and that I ought to write up a proposal asking for 500,000. This is wonderful. If this 
comes to pass, the best way for that money to come, I think, is as a gift to Poetry in America, an initiative at 
EdLabs at Harvard University. This will give me discretion over its disbursement to HarvardX and WGBH, but 
this will be absolutely be a Harvard gift that will count as Campaign success and from which Harvard will take 
some (but not as much)overhead. . So far the best finance people I've met are at EdLabs and they are happy to 
manage these funds for me. There are other ways to give me this money that leave Harvard out, but my 
understanding is that your friend would like this to be a Harvard gift. 
Here's a draft of what I'd like to do with that money. 
I'd like 500,000 to do post-production and distribution of a whole historical period of American poetry (1914-
1945 is what I'm thinking—Modernism) and including three episodes of tv. 
The raw materials for that period include interviews with Bill Clinton (including footage not yet used by 
WGBH), Peter Gallison, Walter Isaacson, Lena Dunham, Woody Allen (whose lawyers didn't like our release a 
while ago, but we're hoping will soften over time), Harrison Ford (still a maybe), Robert Polito, Sarah Kay, Al 
Filreis, Rafael Campo, Susan Howe, kids from Nantucket High School, kids from Brookline High 
School, Alfre Woodard, Jane Pickering, Jay Parini, Ray Dalio, Leon Wieseltier, Richard Dawkins and others; 
and footage shot in Harlem, Greenwich Village, midtown, Chicago, London (if I have the money to hire a crew 
there; don't now ), at museums including the Fogg, Harvard Museum of Natural History, Frost's house in Ripton 
Vermont and more. 
This allows the donor to give to a big Harvard Campaign priority, Teaching and Learning , by supporting Poetry 
in America, allowing me to produce the crucial segment of the online course with the highest (TV quality) 
production values and so also supplying higher quality video to WGBH as a way also to cut their costs. 
Currently, HarvardX skimps (on lighting, for instance--see the Bill Clinton interview) and while WGBH ladles 
money raised by others into everything. I have been pounding away at my friends at WGBH and I know that 
WGBH producer will work with HarvardX if they can give him footage of the right quality. . That is, we'll use 
HarvardX as the backlot for WGBH so as to squeeze three episodes out for 250. 
This proposal does not include experiments in schools or the curricular development into courses for teachers 
that you've seen in other (million dollar ) proposals. But the courses for teachers can't happen before the 
footage is developed, and these courses will have as their centerpiece the WGBH episodes, and so this funding 
will make all the rest possible. 
I can polish this narrative and or edit it, if there are things you think I have wrong. 
And I can attach a draft budget based on real Harvard numbers (what my Harvard video editor, producer, media 
manager cost) as well as a draft WGBH budget I'll now go an negotiate with them. Or we can do that at a

A Brief Overview of CogPrime

6.1 Introduction

Just as there are many different approaches to human flight — airplanes, helicopters, balloons,
spacecraft, and doubtless many methods no person has thought of yet — similarly, there are likely
many different approaches to advanced artificial general intelligence. All the different approaches
to flight exploit the same core principles of aerodynamics in different ways; and similarly, the
various different approaches to AGI will exploit the same core principles of general intelligence
in different ways.

In the chapters leading up to this one, we have taken a fairly broad view of the project
of engineering AGI. We have presented a conception and formal model of intelligence, and
described environments, teaching methodologies and cognitive and developmental pathways
that we believe are collectively appropriate for the creation of AGI at the human level and
ultimately beyond, and with a roughly human-like bias to its intelligence. These ideas stand
alone and may be compatible with a variety of approaches to engineering AGI systems. However,
they also set the stage for the presentation of CogPrime, the particular AGI design on which
we are currently working.

The thorough presentation of the CogPrime design is the job of Part 2 of this book — where,
not only are the algorithms and structures involved in CogPrime reviewed in more detailed,
but their relationship to the theoretical ideas underlying CogPrime is pursued more deeply.
The job of this chapter is a smaller one: to give a high-level overview of some key aspects the
CogPrime architecture at a mostly nontechnical level, so as to enable you to approach Part
2 with a little more idea of what to expect. The remainder of Part 1, following this chapter,
will present various theoretical notions enabling the particulars, intent and consequences of the
CogPrime design to be more thoroughly understood.

6.2 High-Level Architecture of CogPrime

Figures 6.1, 6.2 , 6.4 and 6.5 depict the high-level architecture of CogPrime, which involves
the use of multiple cognitive processes associated with multiple types of memory to enable
an intelligent agent to execute the procedures that it believes have the best probability of
working toward its goals in its current context. In a robot preschool context, for example, the

Q. Mr. Dershowitz, do you agree with the
basic concept that one is presumed to be innocent
until proven guilty?

A. Yes.

Q. Has Virginia Roberts ever been proven to
be guilty of any crime at any time, anywhere, at any
age?

A. I don't know the answer to that question,
but I do know that she was brought into the legal
system for stealing money from her employer and |
think it's fair to characterize that as her having a
criminal record, yeah.

Q. Te the extent that anyone might interpret
your comment that Virginia Roberts was ever
convicted of a crime, they would be drawing a false
conclusion as far as you know, correct?

A. As far as } know, I don’t know of her
having convicted of any crime. But I do know that

she was proceeded against for having stolen money.
And | don't think she contested that. I don’t think
there's any dispute about the fact that she stole

money and engaged in other crimes as well.

Q. When did you find out about this alleged
crime?

A. As soon as the false allegation against me
was made public, | got call after call after call
from people telling me about Virginia Roberts, about
your 22 clients. The calls just kept coming in
because there was such outrage at this false
allegation being directed against me.

MR. SCAROLA: Move to strike the
unresponsive portion of the answer.
BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. You found out as soon as the CVRA
complaint was -- the CVRA allegations referencing
you were filed; is that correct?

A. I didn't say that. I said as soon as they
were made public and as soon as the newspapers

MR. SCAROLA: Not yet.
MR. SCOTT: Okay.
BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. Having reviewed the available airplane
flight logs, you are aware that Bill Clinton flew on
at least 15 occasions with Jeffrey Epstein on his
private plane, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Have you ever attempted to get flight log
information with regard to Former President
Clinton's other private airplane travel?

A. No.

Q. Never made a public records request —-

A. Yes.

Q. -- under the Freedom of Information Act
with regard to those records?

A. Well, we have made a Freedom of
Information request. My -- my attorney in New York,
Louis Freeh, the former head of the FBI, has made a

A. No, no, no.

Q. Oh, you got them?

MR. SCOTT: Well, wait a minute. Let's
take it slow. Ask a question.

A. Asany lawyer knows, FOIA requests take a

7 The FCPA does not explicitly define “corruptly, but in drafting the
statute Congress adopted the meaning ascribed to the same term in the
domestic bribery statute, 18 U.S.C. § 201(b). See H.R. Rep. No. 95-640,

5 The House Report states in full:

‘The word “corruptly” is used in order to make

clear that the offer, payment, promise, or gift, must

be intended to induce the recipient to misuse

his official position; for example, wrongfully to

direct business to the payor or his client, to obtain

preferential legislation or regulations, or to induce a

foreign official to fail to perform an official function.

‘The word “corruptly” connotes an evil motive or

purpose such as that required under 18 US.C.

201(b) which prohibits domestic bribery. As in

18 US.C. 201(b), the word “corruptly” indicates

an intent or desire wrongfully to influence the

recipient. It does not require that the act [be] fully

consummated or succeed in producing the desired

access optionality

This year, sovereigns cited a range of reasons for
increasing target real estate allocations, including
the scope to capture liquidity alpha, the potential

to generate income matching mid- to long-term
liabilities and the potential for internalisation and
control. With lower interest rates, lower funding
commitments to sovereigns and a lack of appetite
to vary asset allocations, the potential for leveraged
participation in real estate (equity and debt) appeals
to sovereigns seeking alternative means of scaling
‘frozen’ asset allocation to match liabilities.

In addition, while there are few alternatives to
third-party management and fee structures across
infrastructure and private equity (with co-investment
in many cases challenged by fund governance and
risk appetite), sovereigns have a broad range of
options to participate in the development, acquisition
and management of real estate. Indeed, there was
no consensus among sovereigns on the best placed
real estate manager, with internal and external
managers, developers and operators cited as
preferred real estate partners in figure 16. Sovereigns
are also attracted to the flexibility of real estate value
chain participation as it reduces upfront funding
commitments and allows for a gradual internalisation
of expertise and resource.

them you’re 18 because if you’re not, he won’t let you in his house.” ME. 2: 3-39.
Second, Mr. Epstein himself did not schedule such appointments. Third, Mr. Epstein would not
know who would be providing a massage at any particular time. Fourth, and importantly, Mr.
Epstein’s assistants were not directed to contact underage women, and were not aware of the true
ages of the women they contacted. In fact, more often than not, the masseuses themselves, or the
individuals who introduced the masseuses, made the initial contact. As a result, Mr. Epstein and his
assistants were routinely unaware of the identities of many of these young women before they
arrived.

The allegations further include the assertion that Mr. Epstein engaged in unlawful sexual
conduct with certain underage women who arrived at his house to provide a massage. At times,
during these massages, Mr. Epstein masturbated, engaged in some sexual touching, and a small
number of alleged acts of penetration. However, most of the women who performed massages on
Mr. Epstein were over the age of 18. Many of the young women have sworn under oath that they, in
fact, told Mr. Epstein that they were 18 or older, and that they did so because they knew that if they
were not 18 years old, they would not be allowed into Mr. Epstein’s home. In fact, Mr. Epstein has
passed a polygraph examination to this effect relative to the government’s primary, and youngest,
alleged victim, Indeed, many of the women also worked at local massage parlors,
which presumably had a requirement that the masseuse have reached the age of majority. To the
extent there are allegations that Mr. Epstein should have been alerted to certain underage women
based on conversations he allegedly had with them, those conversations would have taken place in
person and at his home, thereby precluding any prior scheduling with knowledge of their true ages.
As explained below, any factual allegations of repeat massages with such persons would lack
necessary elements required for a federal nexus to such conduct.

All of the alleged activity occurred in Mr. Epstein’s home in Palm Beach, Florida. Many of
the massages allegedly involved conduct which, even if engaged in, is not proscribed by federal law,
either because the masseuses were of age, or because conduct with underage masseuses only
involved topless massages, massages in undergarments or naked massages. To the extent prohibited
sexual activity occurred, any inducement, enticement, and/or persuasion used would have taken
place during a face-to-face encounter—thus eliminating the possibility for the commission of a
federal crime, which requires the existence of a communication through a facility of interstate
commerce in which the defendant persuades or entices the minor to engage in illegal sexual activity.
Furthermore, any prohibited sexual activity that did occur based on the facts on the record is best left
to the state to address because the facts of this case do not fall comfortably within the federal
domain.

This is a case about purely local activity, involving local actors, and affecting local
interests and thus, should be handled by local authorities. Nonetheless, the USAO has indicated
its intent to prosecute Mr. Epstein for purported violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422, 2423, and
1591. However, as set forth in detail in prior submissions, the facts of this case fall squarely
outside the heartland of those statutes — in fact, in law, and in congressional intent. As their plain

annoyances, like ants at a picnic, but hybrid superintelligences—like corporations,
organized religions, and nation states—could be existential threats. Like hybrid
superintelligences, Als might see humans mostly as useful tools to accomplish their
goals, as pawns in their competition with the other superintelligences. Or we might
simply be irrelevant. It is not impossible that a machine intelligence has already emerged
and we simply do not recognize it as such. It may not wish to be noticed, or it may be so
alien to us that we are incapable of perceiving it. This makes the self-interested AI
scenario the most difficult to imagine. I believe the easy-to-imagine versions, like the
humanoid intelligent robots of science fiction, are the least likely. Our most complex
machines, like the Internet, have already grown beyond the detailed understanding of a
single human, and their emergent behaviors may be well beyond our ken.

The final scenario is that machine intelligences will not be allied with one another
but instead will work to further the goals of humanity as a whole. In this optimistic
scenario, AI could help us restore the balance of power between the individual and the
corporation, between the citizen and the state. It could help us solve the problems that
have been created by hybrid superintelligences that subvert the goals of humans. In this
scenario, AIs will empower us by giving us access to processing capacity and knowledge
currently available only to corporations and states. In effect, they could become
extensions of our own individual intelligences, in furtherance of our human goals. They
could make our weak individual intelligences strong. This prospect is both exciting and
plausible. It is plausible because we have some choice in what we build, and we have a
history of using technology to expand and augment our human capacities. As airplanes
have given us wings and engines have given us muscles to move mountains, so our
network of computers may amplify and extend our minds. We may not fully understand
or control our destiny, but we have a chance to bend it in the direction of our values. The
future is not something that will happen to us; it is something that we will build.

Why Wiener Saw What Others Missed

There is in electrical engineering a split which 1s known in Germany as the split between
the technique of strong currents and the technique of weak currents, and which we know
as the distinction between power and communication engineering. It is this split which
separates the age just past from that in which we are now living.
—Norbert Wiener, Cybernetics, or Control and
Communication in the Animal and the Machine

Cybernetics is the study of the how the weak can control the strong. Consider the
defining metaphor of the field: the helmsman guiding a ship with a tiller. The
helmsman’s goal is to control the heading of the ship, to keep it on the right course. The
information, the message that is sent to the helmsman, comes from the compass or the
stars, and the helmsman closes the feedback loop by sending the steering messages
through the gentle force of his hand on the tiller. In this picture, we see the ship tossing
in powerful wind and waves in the real world, controlled by the communication system
of messages in the world of information.

Yet the distinction between “real” and “information” is mostly a difference in
perspective. The signals that carry messages, like the light of the stars and pressure of the

Two questions.

[Strictly confidential] 
2—what do you think of the attached (N=1)? You do not drink or smoke, probably do not inject etc. you swim 
or exercise every day, so your heartbeat is expected to be low and less variable than average. Is your ability to 
predict heart rate accurately—without holding your neck or wrist—positively related to your ability to succeed 
in the financial world—as the attached strongly suggests. Just give me and N=1. 
Remember you asked me, what does self-knowledge have to do with anything—and here is a most intriguing 
example. 
I will send you a joke shortly

Q. Are you aware that years before December 11:36:48
of 2014, when the CVRA pleading was filed, that your
name had come up repeatedly in connection with
Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minors, correct?
MR. SCOTT: Objection, form, overly broad. 11:37:16
A. Let me answer that question. I am aware T1237:17
that never before 2014, end of December, was it
ever, ever alleged that I had acted in any way
inappropriately with regard to Virginia Roberts,
that I ever touched her, that I ever met her, that I
had ever been with her. I was completely aware of
that. There had never been any allegation.
She claims under oath that she told you 11:37:48
that secretly in 2011, but you have produced no
notes of any such conversation. You, of course, are
a witness to this allegation and will be deposed as
a witness to this allegation. I believe it is an
entirely false allegation that she told you in 2011
that she had had any sexual contact with me. I
think she's lying through her teeth when she says
that. And I doubt that your notes will reveal any
such information.

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028630.txt,"As | wrote in mid-July: “Microsoft had a bad fourth quarter, mostly because many people are not using PCs any more. In
addition, the tech giant took a $900 million charge related to having to cut the price of its Surface RT tablet, which had — as
you might imagine — an impact on results. Missed profit expectations, missed revenue, missed all over the ying-yang.”

With the prospect that the next quarter could be weaker still and with numerous reports of late that there has been slowing of
adoption from its new flagship Windows 8 offering, Ballmer and the board finally aligned to move his departure date sooner.

Most critical to that decision, source said, were increased board worries that recent pressure from activist investor ValueAct
— which has a large stake in the company — had a good chance of succeeding in its efforts to obtain a seat on the board of
Microsoft, especially if Ballmer stayed in place.

And even if the software giant was able to thwart that from happening, said several sources, such a public fight is untenable
for the company, since it was likely to attract even more scrutiny to Ballmer’s performance and perhaps even more investor
action.

ValueAct has until August 30 to notify Microsoft if it plans a proxy battle, and sources said it still wants more that Ballmer’s
retirement. In talks, said sources, it has asked for an aggressive stock buyback and also a dividend increase, which might
assuage its efforts to garner a board seat.

Ballmer denied any pressure from ValueAct specifically in his decision in an interview with the Seattle Times, though
sources said that was simply bluster.

And, even with mounting pressure on him, Ballmer definitely portrayed the change as his decision in an interview he gave to
ZDNet’s Mary Jo Foley last week, after his retirement announcement.

“| would say for me, yeah, I’ve thought about it for a long time, but the timing became more clear to me over the course of the
last few months,” he insisted.

When asked if Gates asked him to stay or go, he said no, apparently to both. “Bill respects my decision. | mean, it’s one of
these things when if it’s — you know, ultimately these kinds of things have to be one’s own personal decision.”

That statement also struck many inside the company as a quick shift. Ballmer, said sources, had been jumping
enthusiastically into business review meetings, as part of the new structure, over the last month. In addition, he had
expressed to many employees his excitement at being part of the changes he had initiated.

But, in meetings after the announcement, numerous sources inside the company said Ballmer seemed uncharacteristically
chastened and quiet, in contrast to his usual confident and forceful manner.

“He was definitely not leaving and then he suddenly was,” said one source. “Even if today’s Steve made the choice, itwas a
choice yesterday’s Steve did not want to.”

Another source, close to the board, perhaps explained it best: “If ValueAct got on the board, | think Ballmer finally realized
that meant it was going to be the hard way from then on out until he left and he did not want that for a company he clearly
loves and has been his life.”

Now, those inside the company are turning to what comes next. While not everyone on the board thought that Ballmer
should step down without a new CEO in place, it’s moot now as Microsoft turbocharges the process — in place for several
years now — to select its next leader.

But, though the committee is headed up by John Thompson, CEO of Virtual Instruments and the former CEO of security
software giant Symantec, most expect Gates — as usual — to be the key decision maker on that choice, too.

A Microsoft spokesman declined comment.

Envisioning and Addressing Adverse Outcomes

In early prototypes, information was provided visually to the healthcare provider. However, it was
quickly discovered that if audible feedback was provided — as if the Al device was a consultant working
with the healthcare provider and the patient — the consultations were more efficient; patient
satisfaction levels were higher; and outcomes were more positive.

A large segment of health insurance sector sees early wins in supporting the technology, through the
ability to decrease insurance claims through efficient and preventative interventions, while maintaining
high premiums. As such, they push for early and widespread adoption of the technology. This is further
supported by the Department of Health and Human Services as it hits a number of goals, including
increasing health and well-being while reducing healthcare costs.

With the success of early implementations, new Al-based technologies are rapidly implemented into
subsequent generations of Al-consult. However, the commercial sector developing and using Al-
consult has shifted dramatically from the technology’s initial beginnings.

As the technology began to mature and lead to substantial savings in healthcare costs traditional
healthcare providers and health insurance companies begin to suffer. They resist the use of Al-consult
through a combination of lobbying for new policies and regulations limiting use, to marketing
campaigns persuading people of the critical importance of human interaction in healthcare. They forge
links with a number of advocacy groups opposed to widespread automation in society, and promote
the idea of Al-consult undermining human dignity and jobs creation. However, the health benefits and
cost savings of Al-consult are so compelling that these campaigns gain little traction. As a result,
companies that can not adapt, loose market share, and in some cases collapse.

In contrast, a number of healthcare companies, and a growing number of tech companies, take
advantage of the rapidly changing healthcare environment to promote preventative care using Al-
consult, and to take advantage of cost-effective healthcare approaches that lead to demonstrably
better outcomes than non Al-consult based approaches. As a result, by 2030, the healthcare provider
and insurance sector has undergone a disruptive transformation. What is especially notable is the
number of technology companies expanding into the healthcare business, and either partnering with
well-established healthcare providers, or forcing them out of the market. This shift in key players leads
to a marked change in approaches and attitudes toward healthcare provision.

By 2030 Al-consult systems have the ability to monitor their environment visually as well as audibly,
accurately picking up on and interpreting body language and micro-expressions. They have access to
rapidly growing databases of genetic profiles; proteome, microbiome and other ohmic profiles;
purchasing, eating and lifestyle habits; medical, insurance, financial and legal histories; social media;

arrival in Hong Kong in 2013.. He proposed we meet at the Foreign Correspondent’s Club on
top of Ice House Street in central Hong Kong, a venue, I recalled, reminiscent of where John
LeCarre had set the opening chapter of his spy novel The Honourable Schoolboy. When we spoke
later, Bradsher told me that he knew Albert Ho, who had been retained as Snowden’s lawyer, for more
than a decade, and interviewed him many times as he was a leader of a political movement in
Hong Kong. Bradsher said that a few days after Snowden had revealed himself on June 9, 2013,
he met with Ho and questioned him on the very question that intrigued me about Snowden’s
unknown whereabouts. Ho told Bradsher that all of Snowden’s logistics had been arranged for
him by an intermediary, who Ho called a “carer.” Ho further said that Snowden had been in
contact with the “carer” prior to his arrival in Hong Kong on May 20th. According to Ho, it was
this person who had arranged accommodations for Snowden on his arrival—and afterwards. If
so, It seemed plausible to me that this person might be able to shed light on whom, if anyone,
Snowden saw in his first ii days in Hong Kong. Of course, this person may have been unaware of
the reasons for Snowden’s escape to Hong Kong when he made the arrangements for him but he
was the best lead I had to learning why Snowden had come to Hong Kong. But who was the
“carer?” Bradsher told me that he pressed Ho for details about this mystery person over the
course of several meeting but Ho would not identify him beyond saying, that he was a “well-
connected “resident” of Hong Kong.

I next called Ho’s law office in Hong Kong. But Ho politely declined to be interviewed by me,
saying he had said all he was going to say about the Snowden case. I next made an appointment
with Robert Tibbo, a Canadian-born barrister, specializing in civil liberties cases, who had worked
closely with Ho on the Snowden case. He immediately agreed to see me.

I met Tibbo in the tea room at the Mandarin Oriental hotel on Hong Kong Island, where I
moved to from the Mira hotel. The Mandarin was also convenient to Tibbo’s office at the court.

Tibbo was a tall, round-faced man, with thinning hair, in his early fifties. He talked freely
about his remarkable career. After earning a degree in chemical engineering from McGill
University, and working in Asia as an engineer for a decade, he went to law school in New
Zealand, and then became a barrister in Hong Kong specializing in cases involving the legal status
of refugees. Over a leisurely tea, Tibbo made it clear to me that he had played a far more active
role than Ho in the Snowden case, even personally escorting Snowden from the Mira Hotel on
June 10 to a safe house. He did not dispute what Ho had told Bradsher, but said that he was
himself bound by lawyer-client privilege which prevented him from providing me with any details
that might reveal the identity of the person who had made arrangements for Snowden. When I
asked the date that he was officially retained by Snowden, he said that Snowden had signed an
agreement hiring Ho’s law firm as his legal adviser on June 10, 2013 (which was a matter of
public record.) “I understand that,” I said, “but I am inquiring about something that had
happened before you became his legal adviser.” He shook his head, as if getting rid of a pesky fly,
and said that his oath precluded him saying anything at all that might do damage to the credibility

Ideas Festival, and The Big Think, and, of course, HarvardX, Harvard’s provider of free open
online courses, we are continuing to create rich educational media on poetry for adult
learners and lifelong learners. These materials include short form videos such as this one on

Robert Pinsky’s “Shirt” (as featured in The New Yorker), and, this spring, the sixth module of the
free seven-part Poetry in America MOOC, which has registrants in over 150 countries.

Growing rapidly, and outpacing our current staff and infrastructure, Poetry in America has a
fundraising goal this year of 2.5 million dollars to fund its expanding group of projects. We’ve
taken a big step, hiring the design agency Threespot to help us develop our web presence. Our
website— to launch early 2016— will eventually serve as an online hub for our TV show and
educational projects. We hope you'll join us then for a virtual launch!

Finally, Jeffrey, you have been such a wonderful supporter of my Poetry in America project. The
Leon Black gift changed everything for me last year. It paid salaries for staff | desperately needed
to complete projects (detail below), but first and foremost, it gave me leverage, enabling me to set
down a Solid Harvard base for my activities by giving the school something to point to: this public
humanities project among the list of projects the Dean supports. The money did it: as soon as
they heard about the gift, they took my project more seriously. Because of that gift, the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences, which is space-stingy, found and rewired a studio space for me to house my
video production operation and team. That gift woke up the Deans to the importance of Harvard's
role in producing the highest quality humanities content for the WORLD, and not just for Harvard
students. My main employee has half of her salary paid with these funds, and the foundation of
our collection for PBS LearningMedia is being made with this support. This gift represented one of
the most consequential shifts of the last year, allowing me create content and launch projects this
year that make future projects that much more likely. If | can keep this base sturdy at Harvard,
refilling these coffers, | will be that much more able to keep working.

| am also so grateful for the help you gave me in defining my project for Templeton, and, what
help you have offered to give in bringing them around. | have, since Templeton turned me down,
gotten funding to produce video on two of the poems I'd proposed to Templeton and to create,
and test, that video in schools as | proposed. One of my partners in that project is Success
Academy, where | could also expand my work with Templeton. And there are still other poems
that may satisfy their character criteria more fully, including the third of the poems Id originally
proposed and that Joe Biden had agreed to discuss with me (on parenthood and humility). At this
point, I’m gaining the platform and the name recognition to be an effective spokesperson for the
foundation on building literacy and character in the schools.

It really means a lot to me, ail financial help aside, Jeffrey, that you are rooting for me and thinking
about me. You push back a lot (as Larry does), and it’s always annoying but | always learn.

With abundant gratitude,
Lisa

Given all of the above, we reiterate our preference for avoiding sectors with a high
proportion of domestic UK companies. To our mind, these companies face a lose-lose
trade-off of maintaining margins by passing on higher costs at the expense of volumes,
or face margin pressure by absorbing these costs in order to sustain current volumes in
our view. This could be further compounded if our Oil Strategists’ forecasts are right
and Brent averages ~S60/bb following an OPEC cut.
But how much fs in the price?
The pushback to our view is that the forecasted deterioration in growth hasn't really
materialised and investors are already pricing it in a lot of bad news. For instance,
Easyjet is down nearly 35% and investors are still underweight the UK in the FMS. While
this is the case for certain stocks, at a sector level investors appear to have squared off
their underweights in Retail/ Travel according to the FMS. Both sectors also back near
pre-Brexit levels relative to the market (albeit Travel reflects the recent oil price
weakness).

second later, and so on down to your feet. What you see at any one time
is a slice through a specific section of the body. You can then build up 3D
images from these slices and look at the soft watery tissue rather than the
hard bone you can see with an X-ray.

MRI scans give detailed images but today there are many more
imaging tricks you can play. Give the patient gadolinium to eat — a type
of paramagnetic material — and this contrast agent will highlight active
parts of the brain. You can ‘see’ which parts are active: the location of
emotions such as love, joy and even the effect of smells as the brain
experiences things. This is still coarse grained information; it shows only
the general area of excitation and it does not tell us what is going on at
the nerve level, but the images are fascinating.

Another recent development in imaging is the diffusion MRI. If you
remember your school physics, molecules travel with a random walk:
they diffuse along pathways just as people wander along a corridor. If the
corridor is full of people, they are jostled around and make little progress.
If the corridor is empty, they move in straight lines. This difference in
jostling affects the reading in an MRI and allows you to color code the
image according to the rate of motion of water along the pathways. You
can therefore ‘see’ the rate at which signals flow in the brain and not only
locate thoughts, but also see the links between them.

Chapter 17 The crumbling wall between church and state: from separation to christianization

The “equal protection clause” of our Constitution is not the sole mechanism for security equality.
The clauses that require separation of church and state were designed, at least in part, to assure
religious equality.

My first memory of being aware of the separation of church and state goes back to the 1950s,
when the words “under God” were being added to the pledge of allegiance. The Yeshivas I went
to as a kid were very patriotic. We recited the pledge at assemblies, and some teachers made us
say it every day in class.

Most kids hate change, so when the two words were added, there was some grumbling, not
because of the content of the words, but just because it was different from the way we always had
done it.

I remember thinking about the meaning of the two new words. Under which God? Under whose
God? Is there only one God that all American can pledge allegiance to or are there different gods
that different religions worship? What about the Trinity? Is Jesus God? And what is that thing
the Catholic kids call “the Holy Ghost?” Scary! But is it God too? Are Jews even supposed to
say the word God (we were always taught to spell it, G-d)? Is Allah the same god as Elohim?
What about Jehovah—the name we were absolutely prohibited from pronouncing?

These were precisely the sort of theological questions we were not supposed to be thinking about.
We were supposed to do and not do—go to shul, don’t eat shrimp—and to ask our Rabbi what to
think about such esoteric issues. They know the religiously correct answer. Yet the addition of
the two words to the pledge forced me not only to think about them but to try to place them in
the context of my own role as a young Orthodox Jewish skeptic in a largely Christian America.
Our school taught us that even though America was a majority Christian country, George
Washington, in his famous letter to the congregants of the Truro Synagogue in Newport, had
assured Jewish Americans that in this New Republic “It is now no more that toleration is spoken
of, as if it was by the indulgence of one class of people that another enjoyed the exercise of their
inherent natural rights.” Here, all Americans “possess alike liberty of conscience and immunity of
citizenship” because our government “gives to bigotry no sanction [and] to persecution no
assistance.”

These powerful words written by the father of our country were displayed on the bulletin board of
our Yeshiva as if they constituted the Magna Carta for American Jews.*

Yet we saw bigotry all around us. We knew that no Jew had ever been elected president. No
Jew had ever been the head of a major corporation or university. We knew that there were
quotas limiting the number of Jews at most Ivy League colleges. Still, we believed that this was a
land of opportunity and that we could do anything, within certain limits, and that even these limits
were narrowing, though not yet disappearing.

°° Most of the words were borrowed by Washington from the letter written to him by the Rabbi of the Truro
Synagogue.

Jeffrey Epstein: Educational Programs



Cuts to public funding for education means that many programs need to find support and funding from private donors. The Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation is proud to provide needed funding to worthy educational programs and schools across the country. While the initial focus of the Foundation was originally science education programs, it has since widened its scope and now provides funding to a wide range of educational programs in other fields.



Bard Early College Program



The Bard High School Early College program consists of three public high schools, one in Manhattan, one in Queens and one in Newark, NJ. The schools have been cited by President Obama as model schools for the country. They've also recently received funding from Epstein. Although the schools are not charter schools, they are run with the efficiency expected of a charter school.



Bard High School Early College schools have a considerably smaller number of students than most high schools. Only 600 students attend each school. The student to teacher ratio is also surprisingly low for a public school, 20 to 1. Although the schools must meet Regent exam requirements the same as other public schools, they are given more autonomy and freedom when it comes to planning their curricula. 



What also sets the Bard Schools apart, is that the students graduate not only with a high school diploma, but also with 60 college credits and an associates degree in the liberal arts and sciences from Bard College. 



Admission to Bard High the Sschool is based on a student's writing ability and grades. It's a competitive program and fewer than 10 percent of students who apply are accepted each year.



In 2012, Epstein also provided substantial funding to the Maya Angelou charter schools in Washington, DC. The charter schools were started in 1997 for teenagers who were in the juvenile justice system. Since then, the charter schools have grown and now include four schools, including a program for older students. Currently, over 600 students attend the four schools. The graduation and college acceptance rate for the Maya Angelou Charter schools is considerably higher than for regular schools in the DC area.



Jeffrey Epstein notes that 73 percent of the school's graduates attend college and 60 percent go on to earn a college degree. The Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation is proud to have been able to support such a worthy school.

The addition of contextual cues allows you to form a mental picture.
By withholding some information at the end I have used a dramatic trick
to cause your brain to free wheel and imagine what happens next. You
are involved in the story. Notice the /Jonger story, with more data in it, is
paradoxically more comprehensible and memorable.

Ed Tufte makes the point about our ability to process information
very forcefully. He believes presentation experts are wrong when they
recommend you keep your slides to a few words! He points out the
common advice to use only six bullets per slide and six words per bullet
comes from a misconception that has blighted a generation of presenters.
Studies performed on memory in the 1960s measured unrelated word
recall. Six words are all you can remember if the words are meaningless.
But if the words have meaning we can comprehend and absorb many
pages of data. Hundreds of millions of people throughout the world read
a newspaper every morning and can recall the stories throughout the
day; the poems, songs and plays we memorize when young are usually
long, comprising thousands of words, yet we are able to remember them
verbatim for the rest of our lives.

When we tell a story, we are trying to draw the reader in so they
can to experience our imaginary world and be ‘ir’ the story. When I read
a story — perhaps Harry Potter — 1 don't think about the grammar and
punctuation, or even the accuracy of character portrayal. I’m transported
to a different place. I experience a piece of the reality or ‘imaginality’
the storyteller has created. I can describe the characters, the scene, the
sounds and the smells. A good author forms a complete world in our
heads corresponding with the world they have in their heads. With more
abstract information, comprehension and retention is harder. Often if
the information does not hang together in a linear narrative it can be
impossible to take in at a single sitting. However, if it forms a story and
is well told so you ‘get it, you do not need it repeated. We experience
something of this effect when we watch a good movie. “I’ve already seen
that one,’ means you have absorbed the whole story in a single sitting.
You don’t need to watch it over again to comprehend it.

Comedy

Finally, when you mix all the elements up, emotional understanding,
body language, in-person communication and empathy; you get comedy.
Humans ‘do’ comedy from a very young age and it’s vitally important to
the fabric of our lives. What purpose comedy serves in communication

Is this an irony, or is there a causal connection between our constitutional separation of church
and state and the high level of religiosity among our people? I believe the latter is the case.

The original theory behind the metaphor of “the wall of separation” was to protect the holiness of
the church from the corrupting influences of the secular state. Roger Williams, who is credited
with coining the metaphor, was a 17 Century Baptist minister in Providence, Rhode Island. He
insisted that a “hedge or wall of separation between the garden of the church and the wilderness
of the world” was necessary to protect religion, as well as to assure freedom of conscience. And
this wall has worked wonderfully to do both.”

Churches are thriving in America, unlike in most European countries that have long traditions of
established churches. When the state supports churches, resentment against government, which is
inevitable, spills over to religion. Consider Israel, whose citizens are far more secular on average
than Americans. Many Israeli Jews resent religion because the Rabbis have too much influence
over marriage, divorce and other aspects of daily life. This turns people against religion. Israel
does not have an established religion, despite its being a “Jewish state.” Muslim and Christian
Israelis, who comprise nearly a quarter of the population, have equal status and equal rights, or at
least as a matter of law, but Conservative and Reform Jews do not. Within the Jewish religion,
Orthodoxy is the established branch. This has caused enormous resentment—against both the
state and the synagogue—by reform, conservative and secular Jews and have driven many of them
away from religion. In the U.S., on the other hand, resentment against the government
(Congress’ approval rating is always quite low) does not translate into resentment against the
churches. To the contrary, cynicism about politics, may well drive some people toward greater
commitment to their churches.

I believe, therefore, that perhaps the single most important guarantee in our Constitution is one
that is not explicitly enumerated: the separation of church and state. Although those words do
not appear in either the body of the Constitution or in the First Amendment, there can be no
doubt that the founding fathers constructed a system of checks and balances that required such
separation. Without it, the church (representing organized religion) could not serve as an
effective check on the secular excesses of the state; nor could the state serve as an effective check
on the excessive involvement of the church in the business of governance and on the rights of
religious and non-religious dissenters. The marvel of our unique system of checks and balances, is
that is does not simply involve each branch of government—executive, legislative and
judicial—checking on the others; it also encourages—through the freedoms guaranteed by the
First Amendment—other institutions to serve as checks on the government. In addition to the
churches (broadly defined to include all religious institutions), these include the media, the
academy, the business community, and especially the “people” who have the right to vote, to
assemble and to petition for a redress of grievances.

Just before the 50 Anniversary of the Declaration of Independence—the day on which two of its
primary authors, Jefferson and Adams, both died—Jefferson wrote the following about the
purpose of Declaration:

*! The irony is that the wall was essentially a contribution made by Baptists to America, is now being attacked by
many Baptists.

She was most afraid in Singapore, and in retrospect, it was where she had the least reason to be
worried (she took her kids to South Africa, among other places). She was scared because it was the first
stop and she was unaccustomed to traveling with her kids. It was perception, not reality.

Robin Malinsky-Rummell, who spent a year traveling through South America with her husband and
seven-year-old son, was warned by friends and family not to visit Argentina after their devaluation riots
in 2001. She did her homework, decided that the fear was unfounded, and proceeded to have the time of
her life in Patagonia. When she told locals that she was originally from New York, their eyes widened
and jaws dropped: “I saw those buildings blow up on TV! I would never go to such a dangerous place!”
Don’t assume that places abroad are more dangerous than your hometown. Most aren’t.

Robin is convinced, as are other NR parents, that people use children as an excuse to stay in their
comfort zones. It’s an easy excuse not to do something adventurous. How to overcome the fear? Robin
recommends two things:

1. Before embarking on a long international trip with your children for the first time, take a trial run
for a few weeks.

2. For each stop, arrange a week of language classes that begin upon arrival and take advantage of
transportation from the airport if available. The school staff will often handle apartment rentals for
you, and you will be able to make friends and learn the area before setting off on your own.

But what if your concern isn’t so much losing your children but losing your mind because of your
children?

Several families interviewed for this book recommended the oldest persuasive tool known to man:
bribery. Each child is given some amount of virtual cash, 25-50 cents, for each hour of good behavior.
The same amount is subtracted from their accounts for breaking the rules. All purchases for fun—
whether souvenirs, ice cream, or otherwise—come out of their own individual accounts. No balance, no
goodies. This often requires more self-control on the part of the parents than the children.

How to Get Airfare at 50-80% Off

This is not a book on budget travel. Most of the cost-cutting recommendations found in such guides

are designed with the binge traveler in mind. For someone embarking on a mini-retirement, an extra $150
for hassle-free airfare amortized over two months is a better deal than 20 hours of manipulating frequent-
flier points on an unknown airline or chasing questionable deals.

Following two weeks of research, I once bought a one-way standby ticket to Europe for $120. I
arrived at JFK brimming with enthusiasm and confidence—look at all these schmucks paying retail! —
and 90% of the “participating” airlines refused my ticket. Those that didn’t were booked for weeks solid.
I ended up staying in a hotel for two nights for a $300 tab, filing a complaint with AMEX, and
eventually calling 1-800-FLY-EUROPE from the JFK terminal in frustration. I bought a round-trip
ticket to London on Virgin Atlantic for $300 and left an hour later. The same ticket cost more than $700
a week earlier.

After 25 countries, I’ve found a few simple strategies that get you 90% of the possible savings without
wasting time or producing migraines.

1. Use credit cards with reward points for large muse-related advertising and manufacturing
expenses.

because we can't ask about the issues that we need to ask about

prejudicial to have him as a witness at trial when, again, our

claims are not against him, and we have those issues.

Now, you did have -- in your February 2nd order, you

also precluded us from asking questions that we contended wer

non-Fifth Amendment questions of Jeffrey Epstein about
Dershowitz, holding that those were not relevant. So we're in
a Situation where we have another witness that we are not able

to elicit all of the information we need to be able to prove

the truth or falsity of that, and again, it would be subject to

a number of mini trials on that issue of Mr. Dershowitz.

So with respect to those thr categories and it

also allows them to use the attorney/client privilege as a

sword and a shield in the midst of a trial, which is inherently
unfair to my client, as well.
So in our view, it's highly prejudicial under 403.

Those groupings should not come in. It should not be about,

for example, Clinton and whether or not he was on an island, or

Mr. Dershowitz or these other world leaders, it should be about

the defendant and her statements that my client was lying when

she claimed to be abused and trafficked in those statements.

had been collected by Verizon. While this revelation may have shocked the American public, the
NSA had not acted on its own. It had obtained a warrant issued by a secret court established by
Congress in 1978 as part of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) for each request for
records. Congress empowered the FISA court to hear cases and authorize search warrants in
secret in cases involving national security. As its name implies, the FISA court was meant to deal
with matters bearing on foreign intelligence activities in the United States. That restriction
changed after the devastating terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. A month after the attack,
Congress expanded the purview of the FISA court by passing the USA Patriot Act (an acronym
which stands for “Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required
to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism”). Part of the Act, Section 215, euphemistically referred to
as the library records provision, permitted the FISA court to issue warrants authorizing searches
of records by the NSA and other federal agencies to investigate international terrorism or
clandestine intelligence activities Through these FISA authorizations, the NSA could obtain
tangible things such as books, records, papers, documents, and other items. Under the
interpretation of this section of the law by both the Bush and Obama administrations, the FISA
court was enabled by Congress to issue warrants to telephone companies demanding that they
turn over to the NSA the bulk billing records of all calls made in America.. The FISA court need
only deem these records to be “relevant: to the FBI’s investigations of terrorists and spies.
Essentially, this controversial interpretation of the word “relevant” in Section 215 by the FISA
court was used by the NSA to create a searchable database of telephone billing records. Sucha
“haystack,” as the NSA called the national collection of billing records, could allow the FBI to
instantly find missing “needles,” even if the connections were made years earlier. For example, if
the FBI had a lead on a foreign suspect, it could search the data base for any telephone calls made
by the foreign suspect to telephone numbers in America, and then who those people called. The
FBI always had this power, if it obtained a warrant, but it did not have the records previously in a
single data base. General Alexander believed such a “Haystack” database made sense. His
approach was, ‘Let’s collect the whole haystack,’” according to one former senior U.S.
intelligence official quoted by the Washington Post. According to its critics, including the
ACLU, the results provided by this vast database did not justify its immense potential for abuse.
In early May 2015, just three weeks before this part of the Patriot Act was set to expire, a three-
judge panel of the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York, agreed with the ACLU
position, overturning a lower court decision that it was legal. The panel found that the word
“relevant” in the Act was not intended by Congress to justify the acquisition and storing of the
bulk records of telephone companies. It declared that the government’s interpretation of Section
215 of The Patriot Act was incorrect. Soon afterwards Congress replaced the Patriot Act with
the USA Freedom Act, which effectively transferred bulk storage of billing records from the NSA
to the phone companies themselves. Despite the change in venue, the records of individuals were
still not completely private. The databases held by phone companies could still be searched under
the new law via a FISA warrant by the FBI.

The core of Snowden’s charge in the media was that the FISA court overreached its authority
by issuing sweeping warrants that allowed the NSA to obtain data collected by private phone and
Internet companies. It the initial story published in the Guardian on June 5, 2013, Snowden

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011473.txt,"In choosing to return, now, to Camp David for two weeks of summit talks, I
knew the risks. Of all the moments of truth in my life — and in the life of my
country — few, if any, would carry higher stakes. Success would mean not just
one more stutter-step away from our century-long conflict with the Palestinians.
It would signal a real, final peace: in treaty-speak, end of conflict. Whatever the
complexities of putting an agreement into practice, given all the suffering and
bloodshed endured by both sides, we would have crossed a point of no return.

There would be two states, for two peoples.

And if we failed? I knew, if only from months of increasingly stark
intelligence reports, that an explosion of Palestinian violence — not just with
stones or bottles this time, but with guns and explosives — would be only a
matter of time.

I knew something else as well. This would be a moment of truth not just for
me. Or for Bill Clinton, a man who understood our conflict more deeply, and
was more determined to help us end it, than any other president before him. It
was a moment of truth for the leader of the Palestinians, Yasir Arafat.

The Oslo Accords of 1993, groundbreaking though they were, had created a
peace process, not peace. Over the past few years, that process had been
lurching from crisis to crisis. Political support for negotiations was fraying. And
yet the core issues of our conflict had not been resolved. In fact, they had hardly
been talked about. The reason for this was no secret. For both sides, these
questions lay at the heart of everything we’d been saying for years, to the world
and to ourselves, about the roots of the conflict and the minimum terms we
could accept in order to end it. At issue were rival claims on security, final
borders, Israeli settlements, Palestinian refugees, and the future of ancient city
of Jerusalem. None of these could be resolved without painful, and politically
perilous, compromises.

Entering the summit, despite the pressures ahead, I was confident that I, with
my team of aides and negotiators, would do our part to make such a final peace
agreement possible. Nor did I doubt that President Clinton, whom I had come to
view not just as a diplomatic partner but a friend, would rise to the occasion.

But as for Arafat? There was simply no way of knowing.

That was why I had pressed President Clinton so hard to convene the
summit. That was why, despite the misgivings of some of his closest advisers,
he had taken the plunge. We both knew that the so-called “final-status issues” —

Experts have said they suspect that more contaminated water is seeping out from under the melted-down reactors into the
groundwater and the Pacific. Elevated levels of radioactive cesium in surrounding waters seem to confirm those suspicions.

Tepco has said those leaks are not directly from beneath the reactors, but from maintenance tunnels that run along the coast
and remain contaminated from the early days of the disaster.

But it also acknowledges that the water beneath the reactors is extremely contaminated, and experts say that if it does get
into the ocean, it will surpass even the leaks that occurred in the disaster’s early days.

The New Nuclear Craze
Mark Bittman - New York Times

There is a new discussion about nuclear energy, prompted by well-founded concerns about carbon emissions and fueled by
a pro-nuclear documentary called “Pandora’s Promise.” Add a statement by James E. Hansen — who famously sounded
the alarm on climate change — and, of course, industry propaganda, and presto: We Love Nukes.

Before we all become pro-nuclear greens, however, you’ve got to ask three questions: Is nuclear power safe and clean? Is it
economical? And are there better alternatives?

No, noand yes. So let’s not swap the pending environmental disaster of climate change for another that may be equally
risky.

Despite all-out efforts and international cooperation, Fukushima, which scared Germany right out of the nuclear power
business, still isn’t under control. Proponents of nuclear power promise new and safer technology, but these discussions
are filled with “coulds”; no such plants exist. Nor would they reduce the risks of proliferation. (Oh, that little thing.)

Nor would they do much to mitigate the all-too-infrequently discussed dangers of uranium mining, which uses vast amounts
of water in the West — an area that can ill afford it— and is barely regulated or even studied. Thousands of uranium mines
have been abandoned, and no one seems to know how many remain to be cleaned up. The cost of that cleanup, of course,
will be borne by taxpayers, not industry.

Then there’s disposal of spent fuel, which is not contained at the same safety level as active fuel, itself a scary thought.
Decades into the nuclear age there remains, incredibly, no real plan for this; a patchwork scheme by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, which appears to be even more industry-friendly than most federal agencies, was rejected by an appeals court
last year, and the Obama administration is standing by its campaign promise (shocking, | know) to abandon the nuclear
repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.

The economic viability of nuclear power is no more encouraging. Plants continue to close and generation rates continue to
drop. Operators may indeed continue to make money on reactors, but that’s only because federal subsidies are enormous.
Insurance costs are limited. Loans are guaranteed (the Solyndra loan guarantee was half a billion dollars; in contrast, loan
guarantees for new nuclear plants may run $8 billion); cost recovery and return on investment are also assured for decades,
and some operators are able to collect costs from ratepayers (and pay dividends to shareholders) years before plants come
online — even if they never come online.

So they’re economical as long as you’re the owner, because historically, subsidies for nuclear power have been more than
double the expense of power generation itself. While estimates of the costs of power generation vary wildly — allowing both

even further. We have been giving away valuable data for the sake of freebies like Gmail
and Facebook, but as the journalist and author John Lanchester has pointed out in the
London Review of Books, if it is free, then you are the product. Their real customers are
the ones who pay them for access to knowledge about us, so that they can persuade us to
buy their products or otherwise influence us. One way around the monopolistic control
of data is to split the ownership of data away from firms that use them. Individuals
would instead own and control access to their personal data (a model that would
encourage competition, since people would be free to move their data to a company that
offered better services). Finally, abuse of data is not limited to corporations: In
totalitarian states, or even nominally democratic ones, governments know things about
their citizens that Orwell could not have imagined. The use they make of this
information may not always be transparent or possible to counter.

The prospect of AI for military purposes is frightening. One can imagine
intelligent systems being designed to act autonomously based on real-time data and able
to act faster than the enemy, starting catastrophic wars. Such wars may not necessarily
be conventional or even nuclear wars. Given how essential computer networks are to
modern society, it is much more likely that AI wars will be fought in cyberspace. The
consequences could be just as dire.

Despite this loss of control, we continue to march inexorably into a world in which AI
will be everywhere: Individuals won’t be able to resist its convenience and power, and
corporations and governments won’t be able to resist its competitive advantages. But
important questions arise about the future of work. Computers have been responsible for
considerable losses in blue-collar jobs in the last few decades, but until recently many
white-collar jobs—jobs that “only humans can do”—were thought to be safe. Suddenly
that no longer appears to be true. Accountants, many legal and medical professionals,
financial analysts and stockbrokers, travel agents—in fact, a large fraction of white-collar
jobs—will disappear as a result of sophisticated machine-learning programs. We face a
future in which factories churn out goods with very few employees and the movement of
goods is largely automated, as are many services. What’s left for humans to do?

In 1930—long before the advent of computers, let alone AI—John Maynard
Keynes wrote, in an essay called “Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren,” that as
a result of improvements in productivity, society could produce all its needs with a
fifteen-hour work week. He also predicted, along with the growth of creative leisure, the
end of money and wealth as a goal:

We shall be able to afford to dare to assess the money-motive at its true value.
The love of money as a possession—as distinguished from the love of money as
a means to the enjoyments and realities of life—will be recognised for what it is,
a somewhat disgusting morbidity, one of those semi-criminal, semi-pathological
propensities which one hands over with a shudder to the specialists in mental
disease.

UCCEISS

rom OGIS’s start, the Office has faced enormous challenges in measuring
k its success. While litigation typically results in judgment for one party
or the other, the success of mediation services depends on compromise by
the parties, whose participation is voluntary. Experience has taught us that
OGIS’s success may not rest in the outcome of mediation services, but in the
process of providing mediation services.
Mediation is a voluntary alternative dispute resolution process in which a
neutral third party, a mediator, assists disputing parties in reaching a mutually
agreeable resolution. Mediators do not direct outcomes or resolutions to

a dispute; the outcome of mediation depends on the extent to which the

parties choose to engage in the process and themselves agree to an outcome. [>
There may not necessarily be a “correct” answer; rather, the disputing parties
may choose to agree to a compromise that both parties can accept, or they
may choose to not compromise at all. As such, the outcome of mediation is
not an effective way to determine the success of OGIS’s mediation services

because OGIS does not determine the outcome. However, OGIS does control

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029512.txt,"then what happened is the medical school is very busy. You have to study, pass exams, this,
that. And I put that aside, that experience side.

Then at the age of 22, I came to the United States, and I had to do a lot of hardship to get
here. My father wanted me to follow in his footsteps and be an academic. He was a
professor, too, of cardiology. So I worked hard. India wasn’t encouraging people to leave. I
had to go to Sri Lanka to pass my exams, I had to borrow money to get a flight to the United
States, I passed all that, I had to spend a year in New Jersey at a very ordinary community
hospital, hard-working, and I got a residency in Boston with various hospitals with
academics. So, Harvard, Tufts, BU, internal medicine, hard work, no thinking about
consciousness whatsoever. Just passing one exam after another, getting one fellowship after
another.

And then I came here in 1970, July 1, basically as an intern in a hospital that no longer exists
in New Jersey, MuhlenbergHospital, but then in the next year I got into all these academic
institutions in Boston and went from one to another. I trained in internal medicine. And then
I had heard vaguely of a discipline called neuroendocrinology, and I had also heard vaguely
of this new revolution in medicine at that time, which was looking at peptides in the
circulation. And the peptide that was very popular at that time was something called opiates,
which are now popular again, and the opioid receptor, with somebody called George
Solomon in Washington, who was an expert in that, but I discovered that the number one
guy in the world in neuroendocrinology at that time was a professor at Tufts New England
Medical Center, and his name was Seymour Reichlin and he was a legend. Okay, so, if you
found a snake in his garden he would dissect it and look at the hypothalamus and identify
receptors for opioids, serotonin, this and that. P’Il show you his photo recently. I just met him
the other day at the consciousness conference, which is bizarre because I hadn’t met him in
all these years. He’s 94, and he was giving a lecture on serotonin and mystical experiences,
at the age of 94, and he came to my lecture, and he was one of the most amazing guys in the
world, actually. It was a real joy to meet him. This is him, let me show you. Anyway I'll
show you his photo in a second. He’s 94, he gives talks on serotonin, but he was a legend.

I got a fellowship with him, and through him I met somebody who is no longer alive,
Candace Pert, who had actually discovered the opioid receptor, and she and I met at a
conference. She later became the chief of brain chemistry at the NIH. And she told me these
molecules that we’re talking about, serotonin, opiates, oxytocin, dopamine they are the
molecules of emotion. So that’s the first time I’ve heard that expression. I said, You should
write a book about it. She did. I wrote the foreword and it was for me one of the milestones
of my life. And so I applied to Reichlin’s fellowship and I got it, and it was like the most
prestigious thing you could get.

But then I had my own issues with medicine. Is this interesting to you? So I had my own
issues, including the fact that I was seeing patients and I can see that the response was not

Federal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations

Another comment argues that the
illegal union conduct portion of the
notice fails to fully inform employees of
their rights as union members.1°9 In
contrast, another comment states a
different position—that the list of illegal
union conduct ‘ostensibly relates only
to restraint or coercion by a union in a
unionized environment.’ 11° The
comment further states that the Board
should have included examples of
“union restraint or coercion in an
organizing setting” but gives no specific
examples.

ALFA suggests three changes to the
unlawful union activity section. First,
rather than say that the union may not
“threaten you that you will lose your
job,” a more comprehensive statement
would be “threaten, harass, or coerce
you in order to gain your support for the
union.’ The Board agrees, except as
regards “‘harass,” which is sometimes
used to characterize almost any sort of
union solicitation. Accordingly, the
statement will be modified to read
“threaten or coerce you in order to gain
your support for the union.”’ Second,
the comment suggests changing “‘cause
or attempt to cause an employer to
discriminate against you” to
“discriminate or attempt to discriminate
against you because you don’t support
a union.” The Board disagrees, because
the suggested change would shift the
focus of the provision away from the
sort of conduct contemplated in the
tule. See NLRA Section 8(b)(2), 29
U.S.C. 158(b)(2). Third, the comment
suggests changing “‘take other adverse
action against you based on whether
you have joined or support the union”
to “take adverse action against you
because you have not joined or do not
support the union.’ The Board agrees
and will modify this provision of the
notice accordingly.

Baker & McKenzie urges that a variety
of other examples of unlawful union
conduct be added to the notice,
including requiring nonmembers to pay
a fee to receive contract benefits,
disciplining members for engaging in
activity adverse to a union-represented
grievant, disciplining members for
refusing to engage in unprotected
activity, engaging in careless grievance
handling, failing to notify employees of
their Beck rights, requiring employees to
agree to dues checkoff instead of direct
payment, discriminatorily applying
hiring hall rules, and conditioning
continued employment on the payment
of a fine or dues in “‘right-to-work’”’
states.

109 See comment of National Association of
Manufacturers.
110 See comment of ALFA.

As with the examples of unlawful
employer activity, the Board concludes
that the provisions concerning unlawful
union activity, as proposed, are accurate
and informative, and, as with the notice
as a whole, strike an appropriate
balance between being simultaneously
instructive and succinct. Moreover, the
Board finds it unnecessary to include
additional examples of unlawful
conduct so that the lists of employer
and union activity are the same length
because the notice describes the central
forms of unlawful conduct engaged in
by each type of entity. Still less is it
necessary to add a host of additional
examples of unlawful union conduct,
with the result that the list of such
conduct would be much longer than the
list of unlawful employer conduct. In
the Board’s view, the list of unlawful
union conduct in the proposed notice
fairly informs employees of the types of
conduct that a union is prohibited from
engaging in without providing
unnecessary or confusing examples.
Employees may contact the NLRB if
they believe a union has violated the
NLRA.

e. Collective-Bargaining Provision

The collective-bargaining provision of
the NPRM states that “if you and your
co-workers select a union to act as your
collective bargaining representatives,
your employer and the union are
required to bargain in good faith and in
a genuine effort to reach a written,
binding agreement setting your terms
and conditions of employment. The
union is required to fairly represent you
in bargaining and enforcing the
agreement.” 75 FR 80419.

The Board received only a few
comments on this provision of the
notice. Notably, COLLE requests the
inclusion of a limitation on the
provision that employees have the right
to bargain collectively, in order to
clarify that the employer’s obligation is
only to bargain in good faith and not
necessarily to reach an agreement. A
second comment suggests that the
notice inform employees that they have
the right to “sue a union for unfairly
representing the employee in
bargaining, contract administration, or a
discrimination matter.”

The Board has decided that no
changes are necessary to the duty to
bargain paragraph. The Board is
satisfied that the proposed collective-
bargaining provision provides sufficient
guidance to employees about the
exercise of these rights while still
staying within the constraints set by a
necessarily brief employee notice. As to
the first comment, the notice states that
an employer and union have a duty to

“bargain in good faith and in a genuine
effort to reach a written, binding
agreement.” As discussed above, by
referring to a “genuine effort’ to reach
agreement, the notice necessarily
implies that the parties are not obliged
to actually reach one. The duty to
bargain in good faith has many
components. See NLRB v. Katz, 369 U.S.
736 (1962). And the suggestion that
employers do not have to agree to
certain proposals, although correct, does
not account for the line of cases that
suggest that an important ingredient in
good faith bargaining is a willingness to
compromise. See Phelps Dodge, 337
NLRB 455 (2002).

Turning to the suggestion that the
notice include language informing
employees of their right to “sue” the
union if it fails to represent them fairly,
the Board has concluded that the notice
sufficiently apprises employees of their
right to fair representation and of their
right to file unfair labor practice charges
with the Board should a union fail to
fulfill that duty. The rights that
employees have to sue unions directly
in court without coming to the Board
are beyond the scope of this rulemaking.

f. Coverage Provision

In regard to coverage under the NLRA,
the proposed notice states:

The National Labor Relations Act covers
most private-sector employers. Excluded
from coverage under the NLRA are public-
sector employees, agricultural and domestic
workers, independent contractors, workers
employed by a parent or spouse, employees
of air and rail carriers covered by the Railway
Labor Act, and supervisors (although
supervisors that have been discriminated
against for refusing to violate the NLRA may
be covered). 75 FR 80419.

A comment from the National
Immigration Law Center suggests adding
the following language: ““The NLRA
protects the above-enumerated rights of
all employees, irrespective of their
immigration status. That protection
extends to employees without work
authorization, though certain remedies
in those circumstances may be limited.
Employers cannot threaten you or
intimidate you on the basis of you
immigration status to prevent you from
joining or supporting a union, or
engaging in concerted activity for
mutual aid and protection.”

The Board has decided not to amend
the coverage provision in the final
notice. Although the Board understands
that many immigrant employees may be
unsure whether they are covered by the
NLRA, the notice does not include a list
of covered employees. Including
specific coverage of immigrants, but not
other classes of employees, may cause

that evidence will show that former president Clinton, former vice president Al Gore, and Tipper
Gore never set foot on Epstein’s private island, and that in all events Jane Doe #3’s detailed
accounts are not merely preposterous on their face but in fact entirely false and her sworn
statement to this court is perjurious.

Indeed, while the points raised above show a complete lack of investigation into the
credibility of the woman making these scurrilous allegations®, what is most remarkable about
Jane Doe #3’s Response is what it omits. Approximately six years ago, Jane Doe #3 took
advantage of the NPA’s provisions, sued Mr. Epstein and received a monetary settlement.
Ironically, Jane Doe #3 now seeks to overturn the very NPA which required Epstein to waive his
right to contest liability by moving to join the instant action which seeks to rescind that very
agreement.

Yet, she apparently never once mentioned Prof. Dershowitz’s now supposedly systematic
sexual abuse of her to the prosecutors or to her own lawyer. No explanation is given for this
monumental inconsistency. Nor, despite his supposed status as a co-conspirator in a scheme to
cover up an underage sex abuse ring, is there any explanation given for the fact that Prof.
Dershowitz was never even investigated—or even mentioned—as a potential suspect.
Meanwhile the present case has been proceeding for the last six and a half years, but no
explanation has been given for the timing of Jane Doe #3’s effort to join this case only last

month.

with information which he is in the process of confirming presently.

Of course, if there is a swift and successful conclusion to the Libyan
intervention — Col Gaddafi deposed, cheering crowds in Tripoli —
then liberal interventionism will get a boost. But success could be
just as much of a snare as failure. Each successful intervention will
prompt demand for the next one — and there will be no shortage of
possible candidates. Indeed that question 1s already being raised by
the sight of the Syrian government shooting its own citizens. Yet, the
more demands that are placed on the western powers, the more it will
be evident that there is a growing mismatch between ambition and
resources. That gap could, one day, be filled if the Brics and other
rising powers change their attitudes to liberal interventionism. But
there is very little sign of that happening. The Chinese government,
with memories of Tiananmen Square in 1989, is deeply wary of the
idea that foreigners have the right to intervene to prevent human
rights abuses in a sovereign nation. The same goes for the Russians,
with their record in Chechnya. India, Brazil and South Africa are
democratic countries with no need for a contingency plan to shoot
their own citizens. But their colonial histories incline them to take a
sceptical view of the motives of western powers that seek to use
military power around the world. They are also all emerging powers
that are not yet used to thinking globally. By contrast, Britain and
France have maintained the instinct to think globally, without the
resources to back it up. Even the US, by far the world’s pre-eminent
military power, is signalling strongly that it is losing the will to be the
world’s policeman. In the Victorian age, the British once sang —
“We don’t want to fight, but by Jingo if we do/ We’ve got the ships,
we've got the men, we’ve got the money too.” The Libyan
intervention feels like a last reprise of that old tune, rather than a bold
statement for a new age.

18 U.S.C. § 1591, a sex trafficking statute, provides up to 40 years’ imprisonment for
anyone (1) who recruits or obtains by any means a person in interstate commerce (ii) knowing
that the person is under 18 and (iii) knowing that the person will be caused to engage in a
commercial sex: act. The most heinous of crimes, described on the CEOS website, fall within
this statute and include the buying and selling of children and the forced servitude of third-world
immigrants brought to this country to be enslaved. Mr. Epstein’s behavior is nowhere near the
heartland of this statute. This statute has also been previously reserved for prostitution rings
involving violence, drugs and force. In stark contrast, there is no jurisdictional hook that brings
Mr. Epstein’s conduct within the ambit of the statute, and securing a prosecution on these facts
would require a court to set aside both reason and precedent to convict a local ‘John’ with a sex-
slavery crime. It can not be said that Mr. Epstein engaged in trafficking and slavery nor did he
knowingly recruit or obtain underage women with knowledge that they would be caused to
engage in a commercial sex act. Thus, prosecuting him under this statute would expand the law
far beyond its scope.

To the extent there are cases where prosecutors think that Mr. Epstein should have known
that certain women were underage, there is no evidence that Mr. Epstein “caused [them] to
engage in a commercial sex act.” The term “cause” naturally implies the application of some
sort of force, coercion, or undue pressure, but there is no evidence that Mr. Epstein’s interactions
with the women were anything but consensual. Again, many of the women phoned Mr.
Epstein’s assistant themselves in order to determine whether he wanted a massage. Nor can the
cause requirement be proved simply by the fact that Mr. Epstein compensated the women. After
all, the statute elsewhere requires that the women “engage in a commercial sex act,” which by
definition means that they would have received something of value in exchange for sexual
services. Interpreting the statute to authorize prosecution whenever a commercial sex act results
from solicitation thus would render the term “caused” superfluous, and would make every ‘John’
who interacts with an underage prostitute guilty of a federal crime—even where the transaction
is entirely local. Read in context, then, there is no doubt that the statute targets pimps and sex-
traffickers who knowingly obtain underage girls and direct them to engage in prostitution. There
is not a shred of evidence that Mr. Epstein (or his assistants) did any such thing, and he cannot be
prosecuted under this statute.

The Cuellar and Santos decisions also foreclose a prosecution under § 1591. Just as the
federal money laundering statute did not come down to a proscription against transportation of
criminal proceeds that are hidden, the sex trafficking of children statute cannot be boiled down

and expanded to a federal proscription of commercial sexual activity with persons who turn out
to be below the age of 18.

national leaders of tomorrow. For China, all exchanges have a political character and

hopefully a political harvest.

Third, it is important for local officials to understand that local American “exchange”
companies that bring Chinese delegations to the United States and promote
professional interactions between the United States and China all depend on official
PRC sanction and have received approval to receive Chinese delegations. The business
model of such companies is, of necessity, as much political as financial. Even if they
conduct high-quality programs, they should not be viewed as disinterested actors.
They, too, are subject to rules made by the Chinese Communist Party, its united front

bureaucracy, and united front strategic imperatives.

Finally, American citizens of PRC origin have played a key role in promoting mutually
beneficial engagement over the past forty years. As US-China relations grow more
contentious, however, and as Beijing calls more aggressively for diaspora Chinese to
serve the “motherland,” it will be necessary for citizen diplomats (including those who
are not of PRC origin) to better educate themselves about American national interests
in the US-China competition and the areas in which the nation’s values, institutional
practices, and strategic goals are incompatible. Such awareness is even more vital for
Chinese Americans who seek political office and whose abilities to navigate these

shoals will depend on their knowledge of this complex system of interaction.

American Communities as Engines of Engagement

The American federal system allows sub-national governments considerable leeway

to pursue local interests generally regardless of Washington’s security concerns. Free
from geostrategic worries, state, county, and municipal leaders who have formed
commercial and people-to-people relationships with the PRC have been a bulwark

of better US-China relations since the early 1970s, and their efforts to build mutual
understanding and solve joint problems formed the bedrock of bilateral relations over
four decades. However, as China becomes more reliant on its old Leninist system and
“united front” tactics (48% skBs), Sino-US relations become more contentious, and

the CCP seeks to more forcefully build influence in American communities through
channels detailed in this study, local leaders will be called upon to give greater
weight to national interests when forming exchange relationships with PRC actors.
Conversely, as Beijing’s relations with Washington worsen, China will likely seek to
use tried-and-true “divide and conquer” tactics by cultivating new relations with more

state and local-level officials.

Roger Penrose is fascinated by such counterfactual experiments
and is inspired to think such effects might have a role in non-computable
thought. It is his ‘machines’ we will look at next.

Penrose-Hameroff Machines, aka Brains

Roger Penrose of Oxford University and Stuart Hameroff of the
University of Arizona have proposed a very different way to understand
the workings of the brain. They focus on the much smaller scale structures
within neurons called tubulin microtubules. If you watch a brain form,
the dendrites grow towards each other, twisting and turning rather like
the growth of a plant as viewed in a slow motion nature film. This motion
is controlled by micro-tubular structures formed of a protein called
tubulin. Tubulin is made from peanut-shaped polar molecules that self-
assemble into helical tubes with a radius of just seven molecules. The
tubes bundle together to form the backbone of neurons. The peanut-
shaped molecules are bipolar switches and can flip between two states.
This allows them to bend into different shapes and, in the most extreme
example, to flap fast enough to propel small organisms such as paramecia.
It is also, interestingly, the protein that unzips the double helix when a
cell divides, and so plays a fundamental role in our evolution.

Penrose and Hameroff suggest these tubes form the true processing
element in our brains. The walls of the tubes are formed of successive
alpha and beta tubulin molecules. Each of the tubulin molecules can
flip between two states, propagating a ripple along the tube wall. The
scale is small enough for quantum effects to matter, and Hameroff
suggests quantum error correction keeps the ripples from decohering
too fast. Because the processing is happening at a molecular level
rather than at the scale of a neuron, the brain would be considerably
more powerful than a count of its neurons would suggest. They propose
increased computing power would stem from three sources: There are
many more tubulin molecules than neurons; the micro-tubes could
perform quantum computation, and the micro-tubes are capable of non-
computable, conscious, thought.

Measurement of a quantum process is the only candidate we
have for a non-deterministic physical process today; all other physical
processes are deterministic. Penrose argues that quantum processing
in the brain spontaneously collapses in decision making because of
the interaction between quantum superposition and gravity. The
arguments are put forward in two books: The Emperor’s New Mind and
Shadows of the Mind. This theory remains controversial for two main

further. He called the attacks “an act of war’ and said we should “respond in
kind.” We did move troops and tanks to the border. But my view, which Rabin
shared, was that a major ground operation would risk miring ourselves more
deeply without fundamentally improving the situation. Hizbollah was the kind
of nonconventional enemy | had in mind when Id taken stock of Israel’s
changing security imperatives on becoming chief of staff. It was a small force,
entrenched and well armed, increasingly supported by Iran and Syria. Its tactics
rested on quick-hit attacks on our soldiers in south Lebanon. Far from fearing
military retaliation, Hizbollah knew that short of a 1982-scale war — and maybe
even then — it would survive. It also didn’t care whether Lebanese civilians died
in the crossfire. In fact, like the PLO fighters who had controlled the area before
1982, Hizbollah deliberately fired into Israel from civilian areas.

Neither Rabin nor I had abandoned the idea of a large-scale military
operation at some point, particularly if the cross-border rocket fire didn’t
subside, which for a while it did. But we were determined that, if and when we
did decide to strike, we would avoid anything on the scale of the 1982 war. It
would have to be with a clear, finite and achievable goal.

That point finally arrived in the summer of 1993. In addition to renewed
Katyusha strikes, there was a series of deadly Hizbollah attacks in the first two
weeks of July inside the security zone. Each used what was becoming the tactic
of choice: a remotely detonated bomb by the side of the road on which our
military vehicles were travelling, followed by an ambush of soldiers who
survived the blast. Six Israelis had been killed in all, making it the largest
monthly toll in three years. When I went to see Rabin with our plan for a
military response, I recognized the risks. It would be the largest military
operation in Lebanon since the war. But I believed we could limit civilian
casualties, and that it was the only approach that might lead to a significant
reduction in the missile attacks on northern Israel. I began with the assumption
that, left to its own devices, Hizbollah would have no incentive to stop firing.
Since the two Arab governments with the potential to rein in the attacks —
Lebanon’s and above all Syria’s — were showing no interest in doing so, we had
to find a way to hold them to account.

The operation I proposed was intended to send a message to Beirut and
Damascus. It would not be a ground invasion as in 1982. Most of the attacks
would be from the air, in two stages. The first would target Hizbollah, both in
southern Lebanon and in the Bekaa Valley further north, near the border with

But when he was the federal prosecutor in New Jersey, Christie had sent Jared’s father,
Charles Kushner, to jail in 2005. Charlie Kushner, pursued by the feds for an income tax
cheat, set up a scheme with a prostitute to blackmail his brother-in-law, who was planning
to testify against him.

Various accounts, mostly offered by Christie himself, make Jared the vengeful hatchet
man in Christie’s aborted Trump administration career. It was a kind of perfect sweet-
revenge story: the son of the wronged man (or, in this case—there’s little dispute—the
guilty-as-charged man) uses his power over the man who wronged his family. But other
accounts offer a subtler and in a way darker picture. Jared Kushner, like sons-in-law
everywhere, tiptoes around his father-in-law, carefully displacing as little air as possible:
the massive and domineering older man, the reedy and pliant younger one. In the revised
death-of-Chris-Christie story, it is not the deferential Jared who strikes back, but—in some
sense even more satisfying for the revenge fantasy—Charlie Kushner himself who harshly
demands his due. It was his daughter-in-law who held the real influence in the Trump
circle, who delivered the blow. Ivanka told her father that Christie’s appointment as chief
of staff or to any other high position would be extremely difficult for her and her family,
and it would be best that Christie be removed from the Trump orbit altogether.

7 OK Ok

Bannon was the heavy of the organization. Trump, who seemed awestruck by Bannon’s
conversation—a mix of insults, historical riffs, media insights, right-wing bons mots, and
motivational truisms—now began suggesting Bannon to his circle of billionaires as chief
of staff, only to have this notion soundly ridiculed and denounced. But Trump pronounced
many people in favor of it anyway.

In the weeks leading up to the election, Trump had labeled Bannon a flatterer for his
certainty that Trump would win. But now he had come to credit Bannon with something
like mystical powers. And in fact Bannon, with no prior political experience, was the only
Trump insider able to offer a coherent vision of Trump’s populism—aka Trumpism.

The anti-Bannon forces—which included almost every non-Tea Party Republican—
were quick to react. Murdoch, a growing Bannon nemesis, told Trump that Bannon would
be a dangerous choice. Joe Scarborough, the former congressman and cohost of MSNBC’s
Morning Joe, a favorite Trump show, privately told Trump “Washington will go up in
flames” if Bannon became chief of staff, and, beginning a running theme, publicly
denigrated Bannon on the show.

In fact, Bannon presented even bigger problems than his politics: he was profoundly
disorganized, seemingly on the spectrum given what captured his single-minded focus to
the disregard of everything else. Might he be the worst manager who ever lived? He
might. He seemed incapable of returning a phone call. He answered emails in one word—

Then the incredulity:

“IT was in Russia years ago with the Ms. Universe contest—did very very well—I tell
everyone be careful, because you don’t want to see yourself on television—cameras all
over the place. And again, not just Russia, all over. So would anyone really believe that
story? I’m also very much of a germaphobe, by the way. Believe me.”

Then the denial:

“IT have no deals in Russia, I have no deal that could happen in Russia because we’ve
stayed away, and I have no loans with Russia. I have to say one thing ... Over the
weekend I was offered two billion dollars to do a deal in Dubai and I turned it down. I
didn’t have to turn it down, because as you know I have a no-conflict situation as
president. I didn’t know about that until three months ago but it’s a nice thing to have. But
I didn’t want to take advantage of something. I have a no-conflict-of-interest provision as
president. I could actually run my business, run my business and run government at the
same time. I don’t like the way that looks but I would be able to do that if I wanted to. I
could run the Trump organization, a great, great company, and I could run the country, but
I don’t want to do that.”

Then the direct attack on CNN, his nemesis:

“Your organization is terrible. Your organization is terrible... . Quiet ... quiet ... don’t
be rude ... Don’t be... . No, ’'m not going to give you a question ... I’m not going to give
you a question... . You are fake news... .”

And in summation:

“That report first of all should never have been printed because it’s not worth the paper
it’s printed on. I will tell you that should never ever happen. Twenty-two million accounts
were hacked by China. That’s because we have no defense, because we’re run by people
who don’t know what they’re doing. Russia will have far greater respect for our country
when I’m leading it. And not just Russia, China, which has taken total advantage of us.
Russia, China, Japan, Mexico, all countries will respect us far more, far more than they do
under past administrations... .”

Not only did the president-elect wear his deep and bitter grievances on his sleeve, but it
was now clear that the fact of having been elected president would not change his
unfiltered, apparently uncontrollable, utterly shoot-from-the-hip display of wounds,
resentments, and ire.

Turning next to plaintiff's motion in limine number
11. This is a related issue. We ask that the Court exclude
characterizations of Ms. Giuffre's bad behavior during her

childhood, including characterizations of her as a bad child or

a runaway. Defendant's response to this tries to conflate two
separate things; prior bad acts, an assault on her character on
one hand, with a reputation for truthfulness of another.

Prior bad acts she may have committed as a child, like

running away, is inadmissible and a defamation action where the

damages relate to her reputation. That she ran away from home
or was an ill-behaved child does not go to truthfulness.

These events also do not go to her reputation. Her
reputation for truthfulness as an adult prior to the defamation

is the only reputation that's at issue in this case.

Defendant's defamatory statements damaged Ms. Giuffre's

reputation when she was in her 30s. This does not open the

door into evidence of Ms. Giuffre's generalized character,

particularly one from a troubled childhood. Occurrences, such

as running away from her home when she was a child, are simply

prior bad acts under Rule 404 that should be excluded. They

should also b xcluded under Rule 405 because this is

introduction of evidence to try to show her character. And
Rule 608(a) also limits evidence and testimony about a witness'
reputation for having a character for truthfulness or

untruthfulness, it doesn't come in under that rule.

assumes each could be correct and travels down both. Solving a problem
using a machine like this can be fast. The problem is this machine has
no greater power than a regular Turing machine. Let me show you why.

A non-deterministic machine is essentially the same as a single
Turing machine; each time there is a branch in the program you would
start running two processes. The first process works on every even tick
of the computer clock and the other on every odd tick. Now we have a
single machine running two branches at the same time. Using this trick
over and over again, a single machine can run a program exploring every
possible branch. Although it generates an enormous number of branches
and takes a huge time to run, it is still a single machine and we have an
infinity of time on our hands. Therefore, the machine is limited as before.

We are not doing well so far and we have already exhausted an
infinite number of options! Let’s try a different tack. We know true
randomness is non-computable, the sort of randomness generated by
the Lavarand we examined earlier in the book. Might this help? Truly
random processes can’t be simulated by a computer. If we throw this into
the pot might it let us compute something a Turing machine cannot?

Again, no.

This idea still only generates a machine as powerful as the non-
deterministic machine above. A non-deterministic Turing machine runs
every possible program. All a random one does is choose some of the
same paths at random. It, therefore, can’t be any more powerful. The one
difference is that it can generate non-computable numbers. However, the
only interesting characteristic of these numbers is they are truly random
and this randomness was an input. Their presence does not make the
machine any more powerful.

There are quite a few proposals for hyper-computers that are just
cleverly dressed up versions of the machines we have already met and
dismissed. For example, it has been proposed the Internet could form
a super-Turing machine. This is known as a site machine because the
processing is distributed across many sites linked together through the
Internet. It is proposed each site could act as an oracle to the others. This
is quite an elegant idea, and some proofs have been offered that show
such a machine is capable of generating non-computable functions. The
problem with this idea is that you can simply draw an imaginary line
around the whole site machine and it looks exactly like a big Turing
machine. There is no conceptual difference between such a machine
and a regular computer with subroutines. After all, that’s in Turing’s

Congress to speak more clearly and keeps courts from making criminal law in Congress’s stead.”
Slip op. at 6.

In Cuellar, the Court examined the link between the money-laundering statute’s mens rea
requirement and the underlying elements of the offense. After a careful textual analysis of the
statute and its structure, the Court ruled that the defendant’s conviction could be sustained only if
he knew that the transportation of funds to Mexico was designed to conceal their nature,
location, source, ownership or control—not merely that the defendant knew that the Funds had
been hidden during their transportation to Mexico. Slip op. at 10-17.

Both decisions relied on the ordinary meaning of the statutory terms Congress chose.
And both rejected attempts to broaden those words to cover conduct not clearly targeted by
Congress. Taken together, these decisions reject the notion that prosecutors can take language
from a narrowly drawn federal statute—especially one that itself federalizes the prosecution of
conduct traditionally within the heartland of State police powers—and convert it into a license to
reach additional conduct by ignoring, rewriting or expansively interpreting the law. Both cases
additionally rejected the notion that statutes should be broadly construed in order to facilitate
prosecutions or to in anyway diminish the burden on prosecutors to prove each essential element
of a federal charge in conformity with Congress’s determinations as to what is within the federal
criminal law and what is not. The conflict between the Santos and Cuellar decisions and
CEOS’s grant of effectively unlimited discretionary authority to the USAO to take federal law to
“novel” places where they have never reached before could not be starker.

These lessons have no less force in the context of Executive Branch decision-making
than they do in the context of Judicial interpretation. As you are aware, when federal prosecutors
exercise their discretion, they bear an independent constitutional obligation to faithfully interpret
the law as written—not to broaden its scope beyond the limits endorsed by both Congress and
the President. There is no support for CEOS’s view that the courts or a jury should ultimately
decide whether a “novel” construction of the law is correct. Instead, the Executive Branch itself
has a non-delegable obligation not to exceed its authority; the power of other branches to check
or remedy such usurpation does not legitimize executive action that exceeds its bounds. See Tab

Hon. Abner J. Mikva, Counsel To The President, on Presidential Authority To Decline To

firm did not charge her legal fees.

The letter was prompted by a Nov. 9 Times op-ed by Stanford University law professor Deborah Rhode,
titled “David Boies’s Egregious Involvement With Harvey Weinstein.” Written in the wake of

revelations in The New Yorker that Boies had engaged private investigators to kill an investigation by

Times reporters into Weinstein’s alleged sexual predations, the op-ed suggested that Boies’ work for
Weinstein was unethical, partly because the Times’ was a Boies Schiller client.

Two days earlier, on Nov. 7, following publication of The New Yorker article, Boies had issued a
statement addressed to his firm, stating that Weinstein was no longer a client and stressing that he

“would never knowingly participate in an effort to intimidate or silence women or anyone else.”

In a Nov. 21 brief in the Epstein litigation, defense lawyer Michael Miller of Steptoe & Johnson LLP argued
that Ransome had never satisfied requirements to file anonymously and had publicly identified herself with
her letter to the Times, so she should be required to add her name to the case caption.

Sigrid McCawley, a Boies Schiller partner in the firm’s Fort Lauderdale office who represents Ransome
along with Boies and others, said her client ultimately chose to go public with her name “in the hopes that
her courage will inspire other Epstein victims to speak their truth.”

In 2008, Epstein entered a guilty plea in Florida for soliciting an underage prostitute, which led to an 18-
month jail term and placement on the national sex offender registry. Since then, multiple plaintiffs have
filed related complaints against him, including one that includes allegations that President Donald

Trump's winter White House, Mar-a-Lago, was the location of events that led to sex trafficking.

Epstein has argued that the court should dismiss the case because Ransome failed to state a
substantiated claim and because the claims she makes are barred by the statute of limitations.

Steptoe’s Miller had no immediate comment for this report.

and dominated by the Chinese Communist Party. Members are expected to adhere to the
disciplines and goals of the Party and work to strengthen China and the Party’s rule of
China. Members of the CPPCC are expected to write reports about how their activities have
aligned with China’s interests and to detail their work on China’s behalf.”* The potential
exploitation of Chinese American members in this body by the Chinese government not
only risks harming the interests of the United States but also has the potential to harm the
security, reputation, and welfare of these Chinese Americans.

A similar quandary could present itself to those Chinese Americans who have chosen

to accept positions as consultants for another united front organization, the All-China
Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, which also serves the Party’s interests. In 2018,
twelve representatives from the United States, including wealthy businessmen and civic
leaders, were listed as advisors of the Federation’s 10 congress. The Chinese government
picked them in recognition of their prominence and efforts in advocating positions friendly
to Beijing.”

To engender a sense of close support, state-owned Chinese media outlets routinely report
about such contacts made between prominent Chinese Americans and senior Chinese
officials. There are literally hundreds of such reports in the Chinese-language press
about prominent Chinese Americans escorting leading figures from China’s united front
bureaucracy in the United States or being hosted by them in China.*° In May 2017, Li
Kexin, the deputy chief of mission at the Chinese embassy in Washington, praised the
Peaceful Reunification Council's DC chapter for holding a “peaceful reunification forum”
in Washington and for opposing Taiwan’s independence.”’ Officials from China have also
traveled freely to the United States to take part in conferences and activities designed
to further China’s influence operations in the United States. For example, United Front
officials traveled to the United States in November 2016 for the council’s annual executive
meeting, during which the council pledged to renew its efforts to “oppose Taiwan’s
independence.””8

Conclusion and Recommendations

As US citizens, Chinese Americans enjoy the same constitutional rights of freedom of speech,
association, and political participation as everyone else, and their exercise of these rights is
fully legitimate and protected by the Constitution and law. What’s more, it is incumbent

on the United States government and American society as a whole not to demonize
Chinese Americans for their feelings for and pride in China. However, it is also important
that all American citizens be aware that such feelings can sometimes be exploited by an
authoritarian regime to advance its goals and interests. Here it is not Chinese Americans who
are at fault for having an attachment to their “motherland,” but it is the Chinese Communist
Party for cynically attempting to use Chinese Americans to further its own interests in the
process making overseas Chinese communities vulnerable to distrust.

“The most charitable way of explaining the election results of 2012 is that Americans voted
for the status quo - for the incumbent President and for a divided Congress. They must enjoy
gridlock, partisanship, incompetence, economic stagnation and avoidance of responsibility.
And fewer people voted.

But as we awake from the nightmare, it is important to eschew the facile explanations for the
Romney defeat that will prevail among the chattering classes. Romney did not lose because
of the effects of Hurricane Sandy that devastated this area, nor did he lose because he ran a
poor campaign, nor did he lose because the Republicans could have chosen better
candidates, nor did he lose because Obama benefited from a slight uptick in the economy
due to the business cycle.

Romney lost because he didn't get enough votes to win.

That might seem obvious, but not for the obvious reasons. Romney lost because the
conservative virtues - the traditional American virtues — of liberty, hard work, free enterprise,
private initiative and aspirations to moral greatness - no longer inspire or animate a majority
of the electorate.

The simplest reason why Romney lost was because it is impossible to compete against free
stuff.

remarkably inspiring. But with Qadhafi, again, it's always the me,
and that goes back to your narcissism. He has a very difficult time, as
most narcissists do, empathizing with the pain and suffering of
others. Everything is about him.

So how do you see this playing out for Libya?

Well, it's quite clear that the rebels are in control, but things will not
really be fully clarified until Qadhafi is either killed, forced to
surrender when there's no one left around him or goes down in a
blaze of bullets. I gather there has been some talk about him going
into exile in Tunisia. That's not totally out of the question, but if he
does so, that's not with the idea of giving up so much as temporarily
taking refuge there in order to continue on as the leader of Libya.

So I think that there's every reason to believe that what we are seeing
is the last act, but it could be prolonged until they actually succeed in
capturing him. Of course part of what makes it so difficult for him to
leave is the indictment by the International Criminal Court in the
Hague. His son Saif al-Islam is also indicted for crimes against
humanity. So there really is no way out for him. I think it's important
to note that his most important audience is the mirror. And when he
says these things he really does believe them. It's sounds crazy, but
it's kind of like, Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who's the most
important Muslim Arab Third World leader of them all? And the
answer is, You, Muammar. He is really going have a very difficult
time seeing people celebrating his going down, in terms of trying to
sustain that heroic inner image.

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029506.txt,"Nader’s story is yet another example of the sleaze, greed, and influence-peddling that has
come to seem ordinary in Trump-era Washington. But it also offers a view into a more
extraordinary and unprecedented problem: a decision by some of America’s closest allies in
the Middle East to leverage their financial resources in common cause with a bunch

of gane/s to influence U.S. foreign policy. It is a problem that can be traced back, in ways
that haven’t generally been understood, to Trump’s son-in-law and senior advisor Jared
Kushner and his mobile phone.

From the perspective of the leaders of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Israel (there
is an Israeli angle to the George Nader story, but it isn’t yet entirely clear), and Egypt, there
was an entirely rational reason to support Trump’s presidential bid and try to influence his
approach to the Middle East: They did not like former President Barack Obama’s Middle
East policy. And while they likely understood that presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was
more hawkish that the president she served as secretary of state, the Saudis, Emiratis, and
Israelis were concerned that she would be tethered to the Iran nuclear deal and thus Obama’s
Iran policy.

They also believed that Clinton would be soft on Islamists. It is an article of faith in Egypt
that she enabled the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood and Mohamed Morsi in 2011 and 2012.
For countries in the Persian Gulf, Egypt provides strategic depth, and “losing” it to the
Muslim Brotherhood was a major geopolitical blow. The Israelis, for obvious reasons, were
deeply concerned about the accumulation of Islamist political power next door and blamed
the Obama administration for abandoning Hosni Mubarak, thereby placing Israel’s security
in jeopardy.

With Trump, Washington’s allies got a candidate and president who referred to the Iran
nuclear agreement as the “worst deal ever,” surrounded himself with people who either
make no distinction between al Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood or are simply outright
Islamophobes, and has forthrightly declared that the United States supports its friends in the
fight against terrorism. Full stop. No caveats, buts, or howevers concerning human rights
and the need for political reform. To them, this seemed a lot better than the appreciation of
nuance and complexity that was a hallmark of the Obama administration.

Of course, even if an American president shares a given ally’s view of the world, diplomacy
does not stop. The job of ambassadors, foreign ministers, and other representatives of
foreign governments is to keep the United States on their side. Traditionally, this is done
through formal discussions with U.S. officials at the State Department, National Security
Council, and Department of Defense; meetings with members of Congress; writing op-eds in
influential media outlets; and informal channels of influence, notably the Washington social
circuit of dinners, embassy garden parties, national day events and the like. No doubt there
was a lot of this going on through the first year and half of the Trump administration. But as

Federal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations

that precedent in Nash-Finch Co., the
Supreme Court concluded that the
Board also had implied authority ‘‘to
enjoin state action where [the Board’s]
federal power preempts the field.’ 404
U.S. at 144. Like these judicially
recognized powers, the notice-posting
requirement that is the subject of this
rulemaking has not been specifically
provided for by Congress. But the cited
cases demonstrate that Congress need
not expressly list a power for the Board
to legitimately exercise it. Indeed, the
notice-posting requirement is not even
an implied power of the Board in the
same sense as those previously
mentioned. Rather, it is the product of
the Board’s exercise of express
rulemaking authority and inherent gap-
filling authority, both of which have
been delegated to the Board by
Congress.

2. The First Amendment and Section
8(c) of the NLRA

A handful of commenters argue that
the notice-posting requirement violates
the First Amendment to the
Constitution, Section 8(c) of the NLRA,
or both. For example, the Center on
National Labor Policy, Inc. maintains
that “compelling an employer to post its
property with a Notice that asserts the
statutory ‘rights’ and employer
obligations, runs counter to
constitutional views long protected by
the Supreme Court.”’ The Center also
argues that the “proposed poster would
impede the employer’s statutory right to
express itself on its own property.”
Along these same lines, the National
Right to Work Legal Defense
Foundation, Inc. and others on whose
behalf it writes contend that ‘‘the
Board’s proposal for forced speech
favoring unionization directly conflicts
with the First Amendment and
longstanding federal labor policy under
Section 8(c) that employers and unions
should be able to choose themselves
what to say about unionization.” These
concerns were echoed by the National
Association of Wholesaler-Distributors.
In addition, two attorneys affiliated with
Pilchak Cohen & Tice, P.C., which they
describe as “a management-side labor
and employment law firm,” argue that
the notice-posting requirement
“tramples upon employers’ Free Speech
rights by regulating the content of
information that employers are required
to tell employees and by compelling
them to post the Notice containing pro-
union NLRA rights, when it is almost
assuredly not the employers’ prerogative
to do so.”’ The Independent Association
of Bakers goes further and characterizes
the regulation as an unconstitutional
“eae order’ that “prohibits the

employer from telling the truth about
the impact a union might pose to his
business.” The Board rejects these
arguments.

As an initial matter, requiring a notice
of employee rights to be posted does not
violate the First Amendment, which
protects the freedom of speech. Indeed,
this rule does not involve employer
speech at all. The government, not the
employer, will produce and supply
posters informing employees of their
legal rights. The government has sole
responsibility for the content of those
posters, and the poster explicitly states
that it is an “official Government
Notice’; nothing in the poster is
attributed to the employer. In fact, an
employer has no obligation beyond
putting up this government poster.
These same considerations were present
in Lake Butler Apparel Co. v. Secretary
of Labor, 519 F.2d 84, 89 (5th Cir. 1975),
where the Fifth Circuit rejected as
“nonsensical” an employer’s First
Amendment challenge to the
Occupational Safety and Health Act
requirement that it post an ‘‘information
sign’’ similar to the one at issue here. As
in Lake Butler, an employer subject to
the Board’s rule retains the right to
“differ with the wisdom of * * * this
requirement even to the point * * * of
challenging its validity. * * * But the
First Amendment which gives him the
full right to contest validity to the bitter
end cannot justify his refusal to post a
notice * * * thought to be essential.”
Id.; see also Stockwell Mfg. Co. v. Usery,
536 F.2d 1306, 1309-10 (10th Cir. 1976)
(dicta) (rejecting a constitutional
challenge to a requirement that an
employer post a copy of an OSHA
citation).

But even if the Board’s notice-posting
requirement is construed to compel
employer speech, the Supreme Court
has recognized that governments have
“substantial leeway in determining
appropriate information disclosure
requirements for business
corporations.” Pac. Gas & Elec. Co. v.
Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 475 U.S. 1, 15 n.12
(1985). This discretion is particularly
wide when the government requires
information disclosures relevant to the
employment relationship. Thus, as the
D.C. Circuit has observed, ‘‘an
employer’s right to silence is sharply
constrained in the labor context, and
leaves it subject to a variety of burdens
to post notices of rights and risks.”
UAW-Labor Employment & Training
Corp. v. Chao, 325 F.3d 360, 365 (D.C.
Cir. 2003) (UAW v. Chao) (citing Lake
Butler, 519 F.2d at 89). Accordingly, the
Board’s notice-posting requirement is

not susceptible to a First Amendment
challenge.*4

The Board is equally satisfied that the
rule does not violate NLRA Section 8(c),
29 U.S.C. 158(c), which creates a safe
harbor for noncoercive speech in the
unfair labor practice area. Specifically,
Section 8(c) shields from unfair labor
practice liability “‘[t]he expressing of
any views, argument or opinion,”
provided that “such expression contains
no threat of reprisal or force or promise
of benefit.” Id. (emphasis added). A
government poster containing accurate,
factual information about employees’
legal rights “merely states what the law
requires.” Lake Butler, 519 F.2d at 89.
For that reason, “[t]he posting of the
notice does not by any stretch of the
imagination reflect one way or the other
on the views of the employer.” Id.4°

44 The decision of the intermediate state court in
Smith v. Fair Employment & Housing Commission,
30 Cal. Rptr. 2d 395 (Cal. Ct. App. 1994), rev’d on
other grounds, 913 P.2d 909 (Cal. 1996), lends no
support to arguments challenging these regulations
on First Amendment grounds. There, the California
Court of Appeal held that a landlord’s right to
freedom of speech was “‘implicate[d],” id. at 401—
02, by a state fair housing agency’s remedial order
requiring her to sign, post, and distribute notices
“setting out the provisions of [the fair housing
statute], the outcome of th[e] case, and the
statement that [she] practices equal housing
opportunity.” 913 P.2d at 914. The Smith case is
not persuasive here because the notice at issue in
Smith would not merely have set forth the rights
of prospective buyers or renters but also would
have contained a signed statement from the
landlord which would have given the false
appearance that she agreed with the state’s fair
housing “concepts and rules,” despite her religious
beliefs to the contrary. 30 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 401. That
feature of the case has no parallel here. Here, by
contrast, employers are not required to sign the
informational notice, and as noted, nothing in the
poster is attributed to them. The Board further notes
that the Smith decision is not authoritative because
it was superseded by the California Supreme
Court’s grant of review in that case. See 913 P.2d
at 916 n.*.

45 The Employers Association of New Jersey is
therefore off the mark when it argues that the
notice-posting requirement is preempted under the
principles of Lodge 76, International Ass’n of
Machinists & Aerospace Workers v. Wisconsin
Employment Relations Commission, 427 U.S. 132
(1976), as an attempt to regulate employer speech
“about unionization and collective bargaining.” As
explained above, the employer’s choice whether to
express its own views, arguments, or opinions is
wholly unaffected by a requirement to post a
government-provided notice summarizing what the
law requires. Indeed, consistent with both
Machinists and the policy of Section 8(c) “‘to
encourage free debate on issues dividing labor and
management,’ Brown, 554 U.S. at 67 (quoting Linn
v. United Plant Guard Workers, Local 114, 383 U.S.
53, 62 (1966)), employers remain free under this
rule—as they have in the past—to express
noncoercive views regarding the exercise of these
rights as well as others. See, e.g., United Techs.
Corp., 274 N.L.R.B. 609, 609, 618-20, 624-26
(1985), enforced sub nom. NLRB v. Pratt & Whitney
Air Craft Div.v., United Techs. Corp., 789 F.2d 121
(2d Cir. 1986); Warrensburg Bd. & Paper Corp., 143
N.L.R.B. 398, 398-99 (1963), enforced, 340 F.2d 920
(2d Cir. 1965). For this reason, the Board finds it
unnecessary to adopt the proposal made by the

BIOLOGISTS DIG DEEPER 
Canada's new Biotron superlab contains miniature chunks of the natural world that 
will help us predict the impact of climate change on living organisms 
BY LINDSAY BORTH WICK 
GROUP OF PLANT SCIENTISTS GATHERED IN VIENNA IN 2005 AT THE 
International Botanical Congress. The meeting was pretty much what you would 
expect until its conclusion, when the congress declared: As a matter of urgency, 
facilities for controlled, ecosystem-scale experiments are required now. With-
out a better toolbox to study how the natural world responds to global climate 
change, sustained human habitability of Earth would be at risk. 
Fortunately, just such a toolbox was already being designed by Norman 
Winer, a Canadian biochemist and plant biologist. Htiner had begun work on his Biotron Institute for 
Experimental Climate Change Research in 1999. In early 2008 it will open its doors, the first facility in the

The Garden 
LAST FALL IN THE GERMAN 
city of Kassel.. a group of 
about 15 women harvested 
a bumper crop of pumpkins, 
squash, and wine grapes 
from a small community gar-
den. Nothing unusual there, 
perhaps—except that the 
women were from Morocco, 
Afghanistan, Somalia, and 
the former Yugoslavia. 
The intercultural garden 
in Kassel is one of about 100 
in Germany, but the only one 
run entirely by women. (And 
after the gardeners had long 
discussions about the haz-
ards of pesticides, its produce 
will be totally organic.) The 
gardens began in 1495, after 
a group of Bosnian women 
in Gottingen, waiting out the 
Balkan conflict, told social 
workers how much they 
missed the famous plum and 
apple orchards of Bosnia's 
Drina Valley. 
There has been adversity 
along the way. A garden in 
Berlin had to be placed under 
police protection after it was 
targeted by neo-Nazi protest-
ers. In Cologne the gates of 
another garden have been 
destroyed three times. And it 
isn't always easy to coax tra-
ditional crops such as Afghan 
mint, coriander, and Iranian 
leeks from the mineral-rich 
German soil. Yet the gardens 
thrive. Says Behoumi, a 
31-year-old from Morocco,

world that will allow researchers 
to re-create and study how a com-
plete ecosystem, such as Arctic 
tundra or boreal forest, responds 
to climate change. The Biotron, 
Hiiner says, is as close as you 
can get to nature [in a lab]. 
The Biotron will help integrate 
biology into the scientific study of 
global warming. Existing climate 
change models, says Hillier, are 
more about physics than biology; 
moreover, they describe changes 
that are happening to the planet 
rather than to particular habitats, 
species, or individuals. Scientists 
haven't been able to create pre-
dictive models, for example, 
of how changes in rainfall and 
researchers tested in two sepa-
rate missions whether humans 
could live sustainably in a sealed, 
self-contained environment as 
a precursor to colonizing outer 
space. The Biotron, scientifically 
speaking, is in a different league. 
The superlaboratory is a 
joint project of the University of 
Western Ontario, the University 
of Guelph, Ontario, and Agricul-
ture and Agri-Food Canada, a 
federal agency. The nondescript 
five-story building, located in the 
agricultural heartland of south-
western Ontario, is an engineer-
ing marvel, yet a bargain at just 
U.S. $28 million. 
Inside are state-of-the-art fa-
cilities that support research into 
microorganisms, insects, and 
plants, all of which can be geneti-
cally modified to suit research-
ers' needs. Temperature in the 
Researchers will vie for access to 
the Biotron much as physicists compete 
to use the world's few particle _ 
accelerators or astronomers the latest and 
biggest optical telescopes 
temperature will affect soybean 
yields in the U.S. grain belt or 
butterflies in the Amazon basin, 
because, with a few exceptions, 
they haven't had the tools to 
measure the impact of climate 
change on living organisms. 
Now there's a place where 
whole ecosystems can be scrupu-
lously re-created and organisms 
scrutinized, from their DNA to 
their interaction with other organ-
isms. With more complete data, 
scientists will be able to make 
better predictions—and (heir ex-
perimental findings could better 
inform policy makers, who might, 
for example, provide subsidies for 
crops that respond well to emerg-
ing climate patterns. 
The Biotron may call to mind 
Biosphere 2, the large artificial 
habitat plopped down 20 years 
ago in the Arizona desert, where 
Biotron's climate chambers can 
be varied from —40 degrees Fahr-
enheit to 122 degrees, to simulate 
anything from the Arctic winter to 
a tropical rainforest On the roof of 
the building are six biomes—air-
locked, greenhouse-like structures 
that have been custom designed 
to precisely control environmental 
factors such as temperature, UV 
radiation, light intensity, wind, pre-
cipitation, and CO2. Each biome is 
large enough to house bees more 
than 30 feet tall and to allow for 
there-creation of complex biologi-
cal communities that can extend 
from the highest tree canopies to 
underground soil layers. 
If the possibilities seem end-
less, they nearly are. The plan is 
for the world's leading scientists to 
rotate in and out of the lab space, 
and the biomes will be regularly 
reconfigured. One such setup will 
use cross sections of Arctic perma-
frost, transported from northern 
Canada, so researchers can study 
how it reacts to rising tempera-
tures: As the permafrost thaws, 
how much methane gas will be 
released? How will bacteria and 
overwintering insects be affected 
by changing freeze-thaw cycles? 
Scientists will design and study 
more temperate ecosystems, 
as well, to learn how changes 
in temperature and CO2 affect 
the growth of photosynthetic 
organisms, including crops and 
boreal forest, 
Biotron researchers will also be 
able to study the benefits and risks 
of biotechnology in agriculture, 
forestry, and medicine by examin-
ing the basic biology of genetically 
modified organisms: What is the 
rate of gene transfer from trans-
genic plants to wild ones? Can 
plants be engineered to manufac-
ture medicinal compounds that 
will benefit humans? 
The Biotron will be equipped 
with a sophisticated imaging and 
analysis system—a virtual control 
room—that will expand its reach 
globally, allowing researchers 
anywhere to manage and moni-
tor experiments remotely over 
the Internet in real time. A scien.-
fist in India studying the impact 
of climate change on rice could 
instruct the Biotron to raise the 
temperature or CO2 concentra-
tion in a biome set up to simulate 
a SouthAsian rice paddy. Then he 
or she could monitor the impact 
of this change through images 
and other data automatically col-
lected and stored in a supercom-
puling network 
Researchers will vie for access 
to the Biotron in much the same 
way that physicists compete to 
use the world's few particle accel-
erators or astronomers the latest 
and biggest optical telescopes. 
like them, itis a. place for frontier 
science, where old models will fall 
and new and unexpected ones will 
arise—except that the goal is not 
to understand our cosmic origins 
but to influence our destiny.

where inference is “trustworthy under all of the circumstances” including relationship, shared
interest and control); Kontos v. Kontos, 968 F.Supp. 400, 407-408 (1997) (no adverse inference
allowed from invocation of Fifth Amendment by sister of civil defendant in absence of “identity
of interests”); Sebastian v. City of Chicago, 2008 WL 2875255 *33-34 (N.D. Ill. 2008)(no
adverse inference from invocation of Fifth Amendment in absence of close family or business
relationship). Similarly, any other witnesses taking the Fifth Amendment and remaining silent to
protect themselves are obviously not creating any kind of evidence against Prof. Dershowitz.
See, Coquina Investments, 760 F.3d at 1310 (11th Cir. 2014).
Conclusion

In conclusion, Prof. Dershowitz has no interest in joining this case other than to strike the
scurrilous and irrelevant allegations against him. If the Court grants Jane Does #3 and #4 motion
for joinder (DE 279), then Prof. Dershowitz’s motion for limited intervention should be granted
for such purposes as may be appropriate including submitting a motion to strike or other relief,
so as to give him an opportunity to defend himself against harmful, defamatory and false
allegations of the worse kind. If the Court rejects the pending motion for joinder, then the Court
should strike the scurrilous allegations against Dershowitz, or, alternatively, determine the
possible mootness of his Motion for Limited Intervention. Of course, if the Court strikes the
allegations against him sua sponte, Prof. Dershowitz will withdraw his motion for limited
intervention.

Wall Street Journal

Norway to Jews: You're Not Welcome

Here
Alan M. Dershowitz

MARCH 29, 2011 -- I recently completed a tour of Norwegian
universities, where I spoke about international law as applied to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But the tour nearly never happened.

Its sponsor, a Norwegian pro-Israel group, offered to have me lecture
without any charge to the three major universities. Norwegian
universities generally jump at any opportunity to invite lecturers from
elsewhere. When my Harvard colleague Stephen Walt, co-author of
The Israel Lobby, came to Norway, he was immediately invited to
present a lecture at the Norwegian University of Science and
Technology in Trondheim. Likewise with Ilan Pappe, a demonizer of
Israel who teaches at Oxford.

My hosts expected, therefore, that their offer to have me present a
different academic perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
would be eagerly accepted. I have written half a dozen books on the
subject presenting a centrist view in support of the two-state solution.
But the universities refused.

The dean of the law faculty at Bergen University said he would be
honored to have me present a lecture on the O.J. Simpson case, as
long as I was willing to promise not to mention Israel. An
administrator at the Trondheim school said that Israel was too
controversial.

The University of Oslo simply said no without offering an excuse.
That led one journalist to wonder whether the Norwegian universities
believe that I am not entirely house-trained.

I use standard terms when I can find them, and coin new ones like “aims” and “ends”

when I can’t. But even standard ones are ambiguous. The vocabulary of economics is

not settled. Look up “capital” or “output” or “cash flow”, for example, in any

economic dictionary. It will show ranges of meanings, and appreciably different

ones from one dictionary to the next. I coped by defining as | went along, and would

have had to do the same even if this book were meant for economists only.

Otherwise the ambiguities would have left loopholes.

As was made clear at the outset, we did not review the facts, circumstances, or terms
included in the plea offer, nor any allegations that individuals involved in the investigation
engaged in misconduct. Despite that agreement, we note that your letters of April 8, April 28,
and May 14 focus in large part on accusations of investigative or prosecutorial misconduct. Not
only do allegations of prosecutorial misconduct fall outside the boundary of our agreed review,
they also fall outside the authority of the Criminal Division in the first instance. Simply, the
Criminal Division does not investi gate or resolve allegations of professional misconduct by
federal prosecutors. For these Teasons, we do not respond to the portion of those letters that
discuss alleged misconduct,

Based on our review of all of these materials, and after careful consideration of the issues,
we conclude that U.S. Attomey Acosta could properly use his discretion to authorize prosecution
in this case. We will briefly address each of the issues that you have raised,

Knowledge of age. Federal child exploitation statutes differ as to whether there must be
proof that the defendant was aware that the children were under the age of 18. However, even
for those statutes where knowledge of age is an element of the offense, it is possible to satisfy
that element with proof that the defendant was deliberately ignorant of facts which would suggest
that the person was a minor. For that reason, the fact that some of the individuals allegedly lied
to Mr. Epstein about their age is not dispositive of the issue. While there may be an open factual
issue as to Mr. Epstein’s knowledge, we cannot say that it would be impossible to prove
knowledge of age for any such charges which require it. Therefore, Mr. Acosta could rightfully
conclude that this factual issue is best resolved by a jury.

Travel for the purpose. In the materials you prepared, you suggest that Mr. Epstein
should not be charged with violating 18 U.S.C. § 2423(b) because his dominant purpose in going
to Florida was not to engage in iNegal sexual activity, but rather to return to one of his residences,
While we fully understand your argument, we also find that the U.S. Attorney’s office has a good
faith basis fully to develop the facts on this issue and brief the law to permit a court to decide
whether the law properly reaches such conduct. Mr. Acosta would not be abusing his discretion
if he decided to pursue such a course of action,

a retreat that qualified her to be a yoga instructor. She had been liv-
ing on and off with Snowden during the previous two years abroad,
including while he worked at the CIA in Switzerland and the NSA in
Japan, and now she moved in with Snowden again. The twenty-five-
year-old Mills posted on Instagram, “Finally in our first US place
together.” She also put pictures online of him in bed with her, affec-
tionately referring to him in her posts as a “computer crusader.”

He worked on problem solving for corporate clients at Dell head-
quarters in Annapolis. In preparation for his new corporate role,
Snowden shaved off his facial hair and, with Lindsay’s help, bought a
Ralph Lauren suit. His corporate clients were assisting the NSA, the
CIA, and the DIA. Consequently, Snowden dealt with a wide range of
intelligence officers and gave presentations on the vulnerabilities in
computer security at the DIA-sponsored Joint Counterintelligence
seminar. In February 2011, he attended a black tie Valentine’s Day
gala sponsored by corporate members of the Armed Forces Commu-
nication and Electronics Association. The guest speaker was Michael
Hayden, who had headed the CIA when Snowden was abruptly

© forced out two years earlier. Nevertheless, Snowden joined the cue ©
to have his photo taken with the former director, a perk of the char-
ity event.

These dealings in no way mitigated his resentment of the intel-
ligence establishment. What began at the CIA in 2009 as objections
to what he saw as the incompetence of his superiors grew into well-
articulated disapproval of the way the U.S. government conducted
its intelligence. He found NSA surveillance particularly worrisome,
later telling The Guardian, “They [the NSA] are intent on making
every conversation and every form of behavior in the world known
to them.” He claimed after defecting to Moscow that he had voiced
his concerns about what he considered illicit surveillance to ten NSA
officials, “none of whom took any action to address them.” The NSA
can find no record of these complaints, but if Snowden had indeed
complained to these officials while working for Dell, his superiors
at Dell either didn’t notice or didn’t care that they had a very dis-
gruntled employee on their hands.

Snowden also made no secret on the Internet of his anger at the
U.S. government and the corporations that served it. He railed on

stock rated Neutral is included as a Hold, and a stock rated Underperform is included as a Sell.

FUNDAMENTAL EQUITY OPINION KEY: Opinions include a Volatility Risk Rating, an Investment Rating and an Income Rating. VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential
price fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst’s assessment of a stock’s: (i) absolute total return potential and (ii)
attractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). There are three investment ratings: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total
return of at least 10% and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than
Buy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0-12
month total return expectation for a stock and the firm’s guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be
referenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst’s view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).

up in our inner Group of Eight discussions, I could usually count only on Dan
Meridor, and occasionally a handful of others, to argue in favor of any form of
initiative on our side. In private meetings, Bibi did sometimes engage in discussion
about what Israel might do. But he invariably steered the conversation elsewhere,
insisting that the real issue was the Palestinians’ lack of any interest in making
peace.

My main worry wasn’t the immediate future of the negotiations. For now, the
chances of an agreement seemed close to zero. It was the longer-term damage
Bibi’s approach would do in further delaying any serious move by Israel to put our
relations with the Palestinians on a more stable and sustainable footing. The
dithering, delay and deadlock suited him politically. Ironically, my own efforts on
the security front had also made it easier for us to do next to nothing. Intermittent
outbreaks of violence always remained a threat. Yet the West Bank security fence,
along with our military, police and intelligence measures, meant it was very
unlikely we’d see a return to the full-blown terror war of the second intifada. I was
also working to secure US support for our development of increasingly effective
anti-missile weapons to reduce the threat from Hamas in Gaza. The overall result
was that for many, if not most, Israelis, the conflict with the Palestinians didn’t
impact on their day-to-day lives. It was unseen and largely unfelt.

Still, the effect of the stalemate on our relationship with Washington did matter:
both for our security cooperation on things like the anti-missile weapons and,
crucially, the challenge which had led me into Bibi’s government in the first place:
keeping Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.

It was a race against time. The Iranians were producing more and more
yellowcake, building more advanced centrifuges, accumulating more low-enriched
uranium. They were getting better at hiding and protecting the network of facilities
being used to try to produce a nuclear weapon. And in the early months of Bibi’s
Prime Ministership, the question we faced wasn’t even whether to take military
action against Iran — something I knew, from Bob Gates and others, that the
Obama administration viewed no more favourably than George W. Bush. It was

let him know how much I appreciated what he had done for me and he
loved the head swell that it would make him feel as well. Hating the
thought of going back to him, I wasn’t going to let that put a damper on
my spirits while I was still out there. It was my time to party harder than
ever before. Every night was a new adventure for me. Chang-Mai was a
maze of places to get lost in and the vibrant city was my playground. The
way | saw it this was my last chance to get out and break free, letting
loose my inner girl it felt so good to take the lead of my own life.

Chapter 21

It was an average evening getting ready in front of the bathroom mirror
on just an average Sunday, though unbeknownst to us girls as we sat
there chatting away carelessly, this night was already written in the stars
for me. It was a very long time ago now when I was still a young child
that I sat looking up to those same stars from my bedroom window with
my hands pressed tightly together as I cried for God to hear my prayers.
All 1 asked him for was death. My precious life was already such a
hopeless battle that I felt too small to fight alone for. Begging him to
deliver me from this cruel world I would pray for all of my pain would to
away for good. My only clause in my prayers was the possibility that
there was somebody in this wide world that I was meant to love,
something much bigger than I could have even imagined yet. This
invocation of mine was forgotten about long ago now, until tonight.

I wish [ had known that night I sat crying beneath the stars that it
would all be different one day and that [ hadn’t sold myself short to the
accustomed lifestyle 1 was brought up to believing was acceptable. It was
this night my very soul was about to cosmically collide with the man I
was always meant for, the man my heart already belonged to and would
know from the instant we met. This night would be the first day to the
beginning of my new life to come.

I blushed my cheeks and put on my mascara before me and my
girlfriend headed out to hit the town. We were dressed to kill and looking
for something to do when we ran into a few of our class mates at one of
our favorite drinking spots. They were meeting up for some drinks before
a Muay-Thai kickboxing tournament. It sounded like fun when they
invited us along to watch it with them. The massive crowd lined the street
where the fight was being held and once I got inside the arena it was push

and shove to try to find a spot to watch from. The friends that we were
hanging out with were meeting up with another group of guys that were
training for the kickboxing tournaments that we were watching.

Then it happened it was the first moment I laid eyes on the man that
would love me for the rest of my life. I wasn’t expecting the most
amazing time of my life to happen right there and then but it did and I
would never be the same again. Destiny fell right smack into my lap and
there was no stopping it! It wasn’t just his smoldering appeal that was
obvious at first sight it was the entire package of mannerism and chivalry
that made him stand out of the crowd. Stepping right out of the pages of
the fairytales I used to read, he was nothing like | had ever come to know
before.

Watching him from a close distance he was playfully shadow boxing
one of the guys from my massage class and it was at that moment that
this handsome stranger first caught me staring at him. From top to toe this
athletically built man was intriguing to watch, | couldn’t take my eyes off
him like [ was magnetically drawn to his power of attraction. He further
interested me when he wasn’t acting like the majority of harping dogs
that would jump at the eyes I was giving him now. Instead he coyly
played hard to get, making me work for any conversation with him. The
fight started and the men were going bezerk, screaming at the fighters in
the ring offering either fighter their support or discrimination depending

on whom they were batting for. It was like watching a primitive scene out

of the days when the cavemen ruled the earth but it was as equally
alluring to watch unfold, the sweat, the blood and the absolute brut
fascination of it all.

After the fight and all of the men revved up from the fight, I suggested
that we all head to the pizza joint in front of the Princess Hotel where |
was staying for a late night snack. I made it my goal to make myself
known to this appealing stranger. In the tuk-tuk on the way there [ made
sure I sat next to Robbie. Scooting my knees closer and closer to him on
the short ride he continued his chase by moving further away from me, a
game of cat and mouse that I loved. When he answered back the array of
my questions he had the cutest Aussie accent that drove me absolutely
wild.

Gradually we got to know each other better over a pie of peperoni
pizza and two can’s of coke. Too me he might as well have been the only
other person in the restaurant, he knew he had my undivided attention and
I think he liked it. There was no one like him that [ had ever met before
and I knew there was no other who could make me feel the way that I felt
at the first sight of him. Being charming and suave was all an accidental
tront. It was easy to read him. Immediately it wasn’t hard to see his sweet
side, holding the door and pulling out my chair at the restaurant, 1 was

not guilty of the specific misdeed of which he is being accused, but he is guilty of a similar
misdemeanor of which you know nothing and of which you do not accuse him. He
therefore quite truly denies his guilt in the one case, but in doing so betrays his sense of
guilt with regard to the other. The adult neurotic behaves in this and in many other ways
just as the child does. People of this kind are often to be met, and it is indeed a question
whether your technique will succeed in distinguishing such self-accused persons from
those who are really guilty.

In addition to citing Freud and dozens of other psychological sources, I also invoked my favorite
novelist, Dostoevski, noting that in the Brothers Karamazov:

“the author describes how Ivan—the brother who had desired death of the father but had
not perpetrated the act—manifests all the traditional symptoms of guilt described by
Wigmore, whereas the actual murderer reacts in a cool dispassionate way,
consistent—according to Wigmore—with innocence.”

Judge Bazelon approved of my somewhat sophomoric display of erudition, so long as at least one
other judge agreed to reverse the conviction and order a new trial with a proper instruction on
flight and guilt.'*®

Judge Fahey did agree, while writing a short concurrence. Judge Burger wrote a scathing
dissent—arguing that our proposed instruction “may be appropriate to a philosophical
interchange between judges, lawyers and experts in psychology...but was unnecessary to a jury.”
Judge Bazelon assured me that Burger’s dissent “proves we’re right.”

All in all the Bazelon clerkship proved to be a turning point in my life. He helped shape me into
the person I have become. He influenced me as a lawyer, teacher, writer, public intellectual and
as a liberal Jew. His highest praise for any person was that he or she “is a mensch.” I have
aspired to that accolade. When Judge Bazelon retired in 1985, I wrote the following about his
contributions to our nation:

David Bazelon is certainly not a household name to most Americans. Yet Judge
Bazelon—who just retired after thirty six years of distinguished service on the US Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia—has been your conscience in Washington since
1949.

No single judge—whether on the Supreme Court, the lower federal courts or the state
courts—has had a more profound impact on the law’s sensitivity to human needs.

'8 The new instructions were to follow these principles:

“When evidence of flight has been introduced into a case, in my opinion the trial court should, if
requested, explain to the jury, in appropriate language, that flight does not necessarily reflect feelings of
guilt, and that feelings of guilt, which are present in many innocent people, do not necessarily reflect
actual guilt. This explanation may help the jury to understand and follow the instruction which should
then be given, that they are not to presume guilt from flight; that they may, but need not, consider flight
as one circumstance tending to show feelings of guilt; and that they may, but need not, consider feelings
of guilt as evidence tending to show actual guilt.”

In fact the entire political terrain of the U.S. has shifted 180 degrees in the past 8 years with one exception—the White House.
A betting person with any lick of sense would be loath to bet against a Republican presidency and a radical reversal of
economic policies.

VI._Issues and Political History
Another factor favoring Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton has to do with longevity and negative selection. The political

process, more than any system I’ve ever worked with, thrives on pointing out mistakes and overlooking successes. My advice
to many candidates has been to speak as little as possible and to describe policies in as general a manner as you can get
away with. People aren’t looking through your transcripts to find the next wonderful and positive thing you’ve done, but instead
they try to find your missteps, transgressions, faux pas and failures. Politics is a totally negative process. You live or die by
the sum total of what you’ve done wrong, not on the balance between what you’ve done right and what you’ve done wrong.
In the words of Shakespeare, “the good is oft interred with their bones.”6

Trump has had very limited exposure as a practicing politician and, therefore, has only his own words and phrases to criticize.
While he may have a number of missteps in business or in his personal life, no one cares. And yet, he truly enjoys celebrity
status as no one in politics today does. Also, given how much Trump has said about any number of issues over the past couple
of years, there are probably quotes that can be used on any side of most any issue. But with Hillary, it’s different.

Hillary has done a lot. She’s been involved in politics at a visible level since the Watergate hearings and maybe even earlier.
Her past contains numerous misdeeds and failures as much because she’s done so much and perhaps not so much because
she has been a failure. Yet, a diligent, hard-driving researcher can find a laundry list of her significant misdeeds.

To wit,

e As events have unfolded, her vote in favor of the Iraq War is a clear sign of poor political judgment, especially in her party.

e Her behavior surrounding the attack on the consulate in Benghazi and the failure to respond to four American deaths sure
looks like a case of poor judgment.

e Her use of a private e-mail server while Secretary of State and thus the potential exposure of critical U.S. intelligence to
those who would do us harm again smacks of poor judgement.

e The Clinton Foundation along with its big gifts and extraordinarily large speaking fees surely creates an aura of impropriety,
favoritism and the absence of sound judgement.

e Her involvement in the cover-up of Fast and Furious is transparent bad judgment.

e Her disregard for coal miners and coal companies in her reckless quest to be seen as a defender of the environment is yet
another case of dangerous judgement.

e The IRS scandal: While not directly implicated as a participant in an administration cover-up of the Cincinnati IRS office
headed by Lois Lerner’s misuse of government power, there are definite indications of her gross negligence in the pursuit
of even-handed fairness of the power to tax.

e As | have predicted,’ Obamacare has not only driven considerable premium increases for coverage since 2013, when the
marketplace first opened for enrollment, but has also added significant cost burdens onto health insurance companies,
many of whom are choosing to leave the Obamacare marketplace as costs continue to outpace profits. This has led to
entire states, such as Alaska and Alabama, being left with only one insurer on their respective Obamacare marketplaces,
with 650 counties total being left with just one insurer in 2017.°

e Her personal investments in cattle futures.° In the late 1970s, she turned an initial investment of $1,000 into $100,000 in
just 10 months, despite having no previous investment experience. Her close friend, James Blair, an experienced
commodities trader, advised her to enter the commodities market, but Clinton claimed to have made her own investment
decisions. One academic study published in The Journal of Economics and Finance estimated the likelihood of achieving
a result such as Clinton’s as 1 in 31 trillion.’°

position; it did little to unnerve a comfortable sense of national destiny.

Much of our current confidence can be measured by the astonishing degree to which
we embrace the scrambling of even the most elemental parts of our lives, from how
we bank to how we drive. Most societies in the past were largely terrified of
disruption. If you had arrived in prosperous 17 century Holland and proposed to
“disrupt agriculture,” or radically change people’s banking habits, you would have
been lynched. Our age is different. Many of the most unsettling forces in our world
are ones we encourage, feed and push along. If I had said to you a decade ago - “I’m
going to record all of your movements so you can spend less time in traffic.” - is that
really a deal you would have accepted? But if you use a GPS mapping system on your
phone, you have. That Orwell's sick prognostication of technocratic life would be
one you'd embrace? That it would describe a desireable feature of network life?
“You had to live - did live, from habit that became instinct - in the assumption that
every sound you made was overheard, and ... every movement scrutinized.”*° If I
had told you we were going to build a world wide high-speed data system that
would, as a side effect, make it simple for children in London to connect with, learn
from and then join terrorists in Syria - would you have thought that wise?

The optimistic bumper sticker of our age - that any disruption is good disruption -
marks a wonderful feature of the American character. It is, perhaps, to be expected
of a nation built by immigrants who overturned their own lives in the hopes of
something better. To pull up and leave home for a land where you did not speak the
language, knew little of the culture, and faced a blank sheet of the future, demanded
faith. You had to believe too: Any disruption is good disruption. But no nation, even
the most heroically hopeful, is immune from the forces of history. Edmund Burke’s
old line, that “every revolution contains within it the seeds of evil,” runs like a
counterpoint through the hopeful music of the age now. America’s remarkable spirit
does not make the demand for a national outlook, for an American grand strategy,
any less real. We’re starting to be aware of just how dangerous this age can really
be. In many ways, our very confidence and sometimes blindly certain feeling of
destiny probably makes it even more essential that we have a sense, as we rest in
Silicon Valley or Iowa or wherever, of where we are going, and why.

The phrase “grand strategy” is one that carries a particular meaning when we think
about problems of global balance. It means the way in which ail of a nation’s
powerful tools of economics, finance, ideology, politics, and other resources can be
used, together, in the service of security and prosperity.5! To get the terms right, we

JS: Alright. Virginia, the reason for this conversation is because it is our understanding that
you know a man by the name Jeffrey Epstein, and I want to begin by asking you please to
tell us about the circumstances of your first meeting Mr. Epstein.

V: Ok. I was introduced to Mr. Epstein by Ghislaine Maxwell. I was working at Donald
Trump’s spa in Mar-a-Lago and I was prompted by Ghislaine to come to Jeffrey’s
mansion in Palm Beach that afternoon after work to make some extra money and to learn
about massage. She met me at the spa, and I was reading a book about anatomy, so I was
already interested in massage therapy as it was and not having any of the education or
you know anything behind me, I thought this was a great opportunity to work for her and
go. So, I went to Jeffrey’s mansion about 5 or 6 in the afternoon. My dad drove me
there. My dad worked at Mar-a-Lago with me, and he met Ghislaine and she seemed like
a nice, proper English lady, and she knows, I mean, you know, one time then _once
before I left to travel overseas, she just seemed really nice and like she would like to help
me out. So my dad left, and I had no problem getting home that night, one of her drivers
would take me back after my trial. So she led me upstairs, and into Jeffrey’s bedroom,
and past that is Jeffrey’s massage room, which has got his steam room and a shower and
a massage table, and there is actually an extra room that has, that nobody knows about it,
it’s kinda like a secret room and it’s got a whole bunch of decorative pictures of
pornographic literature and sex toys andIcan___? _ what happened in there.

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024052.txt,"The New Leaf team is one of the most experienced and proven teams in this sector. The Fund
Managers’ combination of proven track record, in-depth knowledge of the medical device and
diagnostics fields, a strong current LC. portfolio, and a thought-leading network of LC.
advisors, puts New Leaf in a position of leadership within this sector.

MEDICAL DEVICES INVESTMENT STRATEGY

NLV-III’s investment strategy in medical devices will focus on identifying a limited number of
investment opportunities in companies with compelling later stage risk profiles. The Fund will
seek to identify investments in companies that are developing innovative and differentiated
medical devices, targeting large market opportunities, that offer the potential to meaningfully
reduce overall patient treatment costs in high morbidity disease settings through substantial
efficacy and safety benefits versus existing standards of care. Investments in this sector will
have established regulatory approval pathways and clear regulatory precedents, or are already
at the commercial stage at the time of initial investment. The objective will be to identify
companies that because of their specific therapeutic area or technology focus, or because the
company already has received key regulatory approvals, that they will be less affected by the
headwinds that are challenging the sector more broadly. Importantly, these investments will be
in therapeutic areas that are known to be of high strategic interest to a number of larger medical
device companies, and thus have a high potential of generating M&A interest. The primary
risks in these investments will be mostly operational execution, competition, and other market
related risks.

Similar to the second half of the investment period for NLV-I, the Fund will have a more
limited focus on medical device investments in NLV-II] compared to previous funds. The
slower projected pace of investment is based on the view that the operating and exit
environment for companies in this sector will continue to be challenging due to increased
regulatory and reimbursement uncertainty in the U.S. and E.U. These headwinds have resulted
in increased development costs and significantly lengthened timelines for most development
stage companies.

While the Fund Managers expect to see fewer compelling investment opportunities than have
been available historically in the medical device sector, they do believe that they will be able to
identify and source a number of later stage opportunities that are less affected by these
obstacles, and that these will be attractive investment opportunities for NLV-III. One factor that
supports this view is that the reduced level of competition for deals resulting from the decline
in the number of active venture capital firms mentioned previously is even more pronounced in
the medical device sector. Given New Leaf’s historic leadership within this sector, and its clear
commitment to remain active during this period of reduced funding, the Fund Managers expect
that they will have excellent deal flow. Although the number of deals in this sector is likely to
be somewhat lower than in previous funds, with the later stage focus, it is likely that the size of
investments in this sector will be larger. Recent medical device investments in the New Leaf
portfolio that fit this later stage definition include: Neuronetics (NLV-II, commercial stage),
CardioKinetix (NLV-IL, clinical development stage), and Interlace Medical (NLV-I, start-up
focused on 510k product, acquired by Hologix, exited at 8.6x).

Senator Kyl further commented that he had discussed the CVRA's potential application in grand jury proceedings, an
application that required the Act [*83] to extend rights before indictment. !4+ Thus, if anything, the legislative history does
not support OLC's conclusion - it contradicts it. 13°
OLC should have had no doubt as to the intent of Senator Kyl and his cosponsors at the time of the Act's passage. Shortly after
shepherding the CVRA through the Congress, Senator Kyl cowrote a law review article about the Act. '° In that article, he
directly indicated that the CVRA applies before charges are filed. Senator Kyl and his coauthors wrote:

While most of the rights guaranteed by the CVRA apply in the context of legal proceedings following arrest and charging, other
important rights are triggered by the harm inflicted by the crime itself. For example, the right to be treated with fairness, the
right to be reasonably protected from the accused (who may qualify as the accused before his arrest), and the right to be treated
with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy each may arise without regard to the existence of legal proceedings. !37
Remarkably, OLC cited Senator Kyl's law review article (in a footnote), but then concluded without explanation that the
CVRA cosponsor's views were for some reason different than Congress's. !78

OLC also appears to acknowledge that its interpretation of the CVRA could well contradict what it describes as prosecutorial
good practice. ‘3? OLC noted that some Justice Department components (for example, the Environmental and Natural
Resources Division) had advocated that the right to confer should apply during pre-charging plea discussions. '4° OLC then
acknowledged that limiting the right to confer until after formal charging could reduce the impact of a victim's participation in
subsequent court proceedings. !+! OLC attempted to dodge this problem by explaining: The question before us, though, is
not whether it would be advisable as a matter of good practice ... for Government attorneys to confer with victims pre-charge
when appropriate ... .. '4? OLC then explained that even under its narrow interpretation of the statute, the CVRA would still
ensure that [*84] the victim has an opportunity to be heard by the court, and by the Government, before the court accepts the
plea. 143

But OLC failed to recognize that its interpretation of the CVRA rendered the right to be heard a nullity in many important cases
- including, notably, the Epstein case. !44 Where prosecutors and defense attorneys work out a nonprosecution agreement that
agreement will never be presented to a court for review. Thus, in cases where the need for victim participation may be the
greatest - that is, in cases where the Government is considering never filing any charges - OLC's interpretation would bar
victims from having any rights at all.

Even in situations where a prosecutor works out a plea agreement, OLC's interpretation is problematic. As OLC recognizes,
prosecutors and defense counsel commonly work out pre-indictment plea agreements (particularly in white-collar cases), under

CAPITAL CHAPTER VI|_ Capital Markets for Cannabis Companies
In addition, an increasing number of direct lenders are participating in the private debt markets
for cannabis-related companies. These lenders represent an important capital source for the industry,
as typical forms of debt capital, such as bank financing, remain unavailable to most companies. As in
other industries, debt financing is typically available only to those companies having meaningful cash
flow or tangible assets to secure the debt. While the number of lenders is increasing, there is still a
relative scarcity of debt capital available to the cannabis industry, which can lead to a higher debt cost
of capital of 200-500 basis points or more for cannabis-related companies, as compared to companies

in other industries.

The following chart illustrates the type of debt that may be available to cannabis-related companies,
representative terms of such debt, and the types of companies that may be able to access debt in the
private markets.

= Final Thoughts

As stated previously, valuations and stock price fluctuations in the cannabis industry continue to be
driven more by expectations for the cannabis industry in general than by individual company funda-
mentals. Today, in the public markets, trading volumes are too low, trading prices are too volatile and
operating histories are too limited to place any reliance on current valuation levels in the cannabis
industry. We believe that this dynamic will continue until cannabis-related companies have matured
and start to realize meaningful revenue, profitability and other financial metrics that will allow inves-
tors to evaluate companies within the industry by more traditional methodology.

It is still too early to know how the cannabis industry or its sectors will be valued in the future. It
may come to pass that companies in the cannabis industry are valued comparably to public companies
in industries with similar characteristics, such as the alcohol, tobacco, pharmaceutical and consumer

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019244.txt,"BREAKING DOWN DEMOCRACY: Goals, Strategies, and Methods of Modern Authoritarians

Chapter 1

Validating Autocracy through the Ballot

A major difference between modern authoritarian
systems and traditional dictatorships lies in the role of
elections for parliament and head of state.

Twentieth-century dictatorships often dispensed with
elections entirely or conducted them under blatantly
fraudulent conditions. In the Soviet bloc, elections
were a pointless ritual in which citizens were pres-
sured to go to a polling place and cast ballots for the
Communist Party candidate, the only one permitted to
compete. Military and postcolonial dictatorships often
canceled elections on spurious “national emergency
grounds, or rigged the outcome through crude bal-
lot-stuffing and open intimidation.

At acertain point in the 1980s, however, the strong-
men, juntas, and revolutionary councils of the era
realized that reasonably fair elections could no longer
be avoided. Sometimes a ruling group understood
that this would likely lead to an opposition victory. But
usually, the incumbent leaders—and often foreign
journalists and diplomats—presumed that voters in
repressive settings preferred stability to uncertainty
and would opt for the reassuring faces of authority.

These calculations proved wildly misplaced. Opposi-
tion parties swept to victory in country after coun-
try—in Uruguay, Argentina, Nicaragua, South Korea,
the Philippines, Poland. The word “stunning” made

a frequent appearance in news accounts, as in the
stunning rejection of the ruling party in Poland, or the
stunning setback suffered by Chile's Augusto Pinochet
in a referendum on the continuation of his dicta-
torship. Or, perhaps most astonishing, the stunning
defeat of Communist Party stalwarts in a number of
Soviet cities in 1990 local elections.*

Elections became a key force behind the wave of de-
mocratization that engulfed much of the world during
that decade. Today, the obligation to hold some form of
multiparty balloting is felt by nearly all governments.

The illusion of pluralism

Yet just as with other democratic institutions, modern
authoritarians have mastered the techniques of con-
trol over the electoral process, maintaining political
dominance behind a screen of false diversity.

They have adapted in many ways to the age of the inter-

“We're not perfect. But we do have
democracy.”

—Hugo Chavez

“Yes, we falsified the last election...

In fact, 93.5 percent [of ballots were]
for President Lukashenka. People
say this is not a European result, so
we changed it to 86 percent.”

—Alyaksandr Lukashenka

net and the expectations of a better-informed public. In
the most sophisticated authoritarian states, profes-
sional political operatives—in Russia they are called
“oolitical technologists’—work just as hard as their
counterparts in the United States. Their goal, however,
is not to defeat opposition candidates in a competitive
setting, but rather to organize a system that creates the
illusion of competition while squelching it in reality.

In most countries, elections are largely “free and fair,
meaning the playing field is reasonably level, there is an
honest tabulation of the ballots, vote buying and ballot
stuffing do not change the outcome, and independent
election observers are allowed to monitor the proceed-
ings. For 2015, Freedom in the World placed the num-
ber of electoral democracies at 125, around 64 percent
of the world’s sovereign states.? By historical standards,
this is an impressive figure. Still, there are 70 countries
that do not qualify as electoral democracies. In all but
a few of these settings, elections are indeed held, but
they are either badly flawed or patently dishonest.

Yet even in systems where elections are tainted or fixed
outright, authoritarian leaders often claim legitimacy
from the ballot box. Of the countries assessed in this
study, only China rejects elections as part of the leader-
ships strategy for political control. In Russia, Turkey, Ven-
ezuela, and elsewhere, the leadership invokes victory at
the polls as a mandate for government, including the
adoption of policies that are in fact deeply unpopular.

In some authoritarian states, elections are neither free
nor fair, with heavy manipulation that directly ensures

Comparing Table 16.1 to Gardner’s Multiple Intelligences (MI) framework briefly reviewed in
Chapter 2, the high degree of harmony is obvious, and is borne out by more detailed analysis.
Preschool curriculum as standardly practiced is very well attuned to MI, and naturally covers
all the bases that Gardner identifies as important. And this is not at all surprising since one of
Gardner’s key motivations in articulating MI theory was the pragmatics of educating humans

Global Asset Allocation 

________________________________

The J.P. Morgan View: Go East.

 

Click here <http://emaillink.jpmorgan.com/t/AQ/AAGO5g/AAMcAQ/OFFmSw/EGA/ABYQPQ/AQ/16gv>  for the full Note and disclaimers.

 

*         Asset allocation –– The growth gap between East and West is widening, and has allowed us to join the Obama Pivot towards Asia. We stay long Japan and EM Asia in equities on stronger signs of an economic rebound in the East, while we again cut growth numbers for the US and Europe. 

*         Economics –– Weaker activity data force us to lower Q4 for the US from 1.5% to 0.8% and the Euro area from -1.5% to -1.8%. But strong trade and industrial data in Asia, as well as more fiscal easing in Japan, have induced us to raise Japanese growth for the 3rd time in a row, and to signal upside risk on China. 

*         Fixed Income –– Go long duration in the US as we see yields mean reverting and we are not quite high in the 6-month range. 

*         Equities –– Strong retail buying is adding fuel to equity markets. 

*         Credit –– Idiosyncrasies driving relative performance signals a welcome move-away from the one-factor-drives-all world of late. 

*         Currencies –– Staying short JPY. Be also short USD but against AUD, RUB and KRW. 

*         Commodities –– Our main trades are long industrial metals, US natural gas, and Brent time spreads vs. short agriculture. 

*         Another good week for risk markets with equities and credit rallying further, but this week without a selloff in bonds. Much of the rally in equities is likely the aftermath of the last minute escape from Fiscal Cliff 1 on December 31. But since then, we have also seen a sudden surge in equity fund inflows, which seem incongruous with lukewarm incoming data and thus may well come from investors who missed last year's stock market rally. In 2012, fund investors poured $680bn into bond mutual funds and ETFs, while taking some $23bn out of equity funds. 

*         Given the recent vintage of these equity fund inflows, they are unlikely to reverse quickly as there is not a lot of profit on them yet. Near-term momentum thus remains good for stocks, in our view. At the same time, the more bullish sentiment on stocks is now sending a contrarian signal. Last year, we based much of our long equity recommendation on our impression that most market participants saw more downside risk across the globe than we thought would become realized. This does not appear to be the case anymore, as the main remaining market concern is only about Fiscal Cliff 2. No more talk of Chinese hard landing or a Greek exit. Hence, the case for being long risk assets is more value based, rather than the reversal in risk perceptions which we think has largely happened by now. We would therefore describe our remaining longs in equities and credit as modest and medium term. 

*	 

*         We could again be induced to move our equity overweight to an “aggressive” level, if there were to be reason to raise growth and earnings projections. All we have so far is improved forward looking indicators – largely PMIs and positive feedback from asset markets – that are signaling a pickup in growth this quarter. But so far, this is simply confirming our and consensus views on how the year is set to start. They are not allowing us yet to upgrade our global growth expectations (Chart on right). 

*         More ominously, the continued strong rallies in risk markets to new highs for the cycle are hiding the fact that recent hard data on Q4 activity have again forced us to lower our estimate of Q4 global GDP growth, now to 1.7%, largely due to the US and Europe. The average global growth pace of the past 3 months has fallen to only 1.8%, barely more than half of trend. The expectation remains that Q1 should come in at 2.4% as both Japan and the Euro area exit recession. 

*         While staying overall long risk markets, both credit and equities at the moment, we have increasingly focused on tactical cross-market exposures, and in particular the underweight of US equities. In GMOS this week, we took profit on the overweight of Euro area equities against the US given the still very weak economy, with Q4 likely now the biggest GDP decline since the end of the global recession (We do stay overweight Euro periphery bond). But we remain aggressively overweight both Japan and EM Asia versus the US, with Japan currency hedged. The upside surprise on Chinese CPI today dented its equity market somewhat, but we think this will be temporary as it should not yet lead to monetary tightening. The recent set of strong trade and industrial data from China and the region are signaling to us significant upside risk on Q1 and 2013 growth projections. 

*         We have been long Japanese equities since Nov 16, which more by luck than skill defined the beginning of its equity rally. Topix is up 20% since then, almost straight line. We believe new PM Abe conviction and political power to reflate the economy are real. It has already helped the yen lose 10% versus the dollar. Given this move, faster fiscal easing and support from equities, we have raised our 2013 growth forecast for a 3rd time, this time to 0.8%. We stay long the Japanese reflation trade. 

Fixed Income 

*         Bonds recovered some of their losses from last week, but remain down on the year. We do not see the current surge in equities as a negative for bonds, yet, as equity inflows are not coming out of bond funds, and growth remains too weak to elicit an early end to QE. With USTs very much at the top of their 6-month trading range, we go tactically long duration, but would take profit soon on a decent rally. In the Euro are, in contrast, the continued flow into the periphery should remain negative for Bund and euro swaps. We retain a bearish bias here. 

Equities 

*         Equities are up again this week, helped by rapidly improving equity ETF inflows. Strong buying by retail investors is adding fuel to equity markets against a backdrop of rather subdued macro drivers, maintaining a positive-near term momentum. The reporting season is also helping with US companies beating so far by 2% the bottom up analysts’ estimates at the beginning of the year. 

*         Our recommended equity portfolio focuses on regional and sectoral exposures. Underweighting US equities remains our main regional theme. This trade also protects our portfolio against looming debt ceiling risks. US equities had been the consensus overweight by equity investors for two years and their outperformance started reversing over the summer. US equities have so far erased their 2012 outperformance but are far from erasing their 2011 outperformance. 

*         We focus the US equity underweight against EM Asia and Japan. In GMOS this week, we took profit on our overweight in MSCI EMU versus S&P500 given looming Italian election risks into February, and still disappointing European economic activity data. We stay overweight in Topix vs. S&P500 currency hedged. Fiscal easing, financed via debt monetization, and coupled with structural reforms has the potential to sustain this trade beyond a 3-6 month horizon, in our view. This week’s fiscal stimulus announced by the Japanese gov’t appears supportive of the Japanese trade. 

*         Across sectors we favor Cyclical vs. Defensive sectors but have taken part profit as the pace of the improvement in the global manufacturing PMI slowed in December. We stay overweight the DJ US Home Construction Index and large mortgage banks (BKX Index) vs. the S&P500 to position for a continued recovery in US housing. 

Credit 

*         High-grade spreads and yields were a few bps tighter this week, although US and European high-yield continued to rally strongly. Double-digit spread tightening sent both to new all-time yield lows; now just 5.9% in the US and 6.5% in Europe. The clear outlier this week was EMBIG, the ill health of the Venezuelan president and a NY court ruling in favor of hold-out creditors in Argentina’s ‘pari passu’ saga helped push spreads up 12bp. We believe such idiosyncrasies driving relative performance signals an uncharacteristic break-down in spread correlations and a welcome move-away from the one-factor-drives-all world of late. 

*         The strength of equity flows has caught our attention this week, but there is little evidence of a wider rotation out of bonds. There has indeed been some evidence of bond into equity fund flows in ETFs (best seen through our flow radars in Flows & Liquidity), but bond mutual funds continue to see inflows, which accelerated this week. Also, our client survey reports on-going demand for credit and new issues remain well bid (see CMOS and F&L for more details). 

Foreign Exchange 

*         2013 has started with bubbling optimism across global markets. Equities are approaching five-year highs and credit spreads their five-year lows, while government bonds are selling off worldwide and inflation breakevens behave (outside the UK). And per the traditional pattern, the dollar is falling versus most currencies, except those which entered 2013 with enormous liabilities – the yen given Japan’s full-throated commitment to looser monetary and fiscal policy, and the rand on sovereign credit and balance of payment concerns. EUR/USD has spiked since Thursday’s ECB meeting but is underperforming much of the commodity complex (MXN, CLP, AUD, NZD) year-to-date, highlighting that China's data surprises this week count for as much as a less-worried ECB. 

*         These country-specific issues are more powerful than systemic ones for the moment, which is likely why correlations across dollar-based pairs have sunk to three-year lows. The yen story still looks to us the most unique – USD/JPY is the only major asset globally where vols are up this year – and the one with broader consequences for neighbors (through EM Asian intervention policy). Hence, this week's focus in our FX Markets Weekly on two other dimensions of the bearish yen view: what is the currency worth if the BoJ successfully delivers 2% inflation, and how broad is the yen short. 

*         To those who believe in purchasing power parity (and we are not amongst them), USD/JPY could move to 100 on a credible BoJ. Realizing these extreme targets requires Japanese participation in this yen move, since international investors could reach their risk limits on yen shorts. So far domestics look fairly unconvinced. Japan has been posting net capital outflows (foreign purchases of JGBs minus Japanese purchases of foreign bonds) since mid-2011, but the pace of those outflows has not increased since then-candidate Shinzo Abe began calling for much looser monetary policy. Stay short yen on the possibility that locals join the move, but rotate exposure. Book gains on a KRW/JPY one-touch, a USD/JPY seagull and CHF/JPY cash. Stay long NOK/JPY and re-enter EUR/JPY (both in cash). Stay short USD vs a basket of AUD, RUB and KRW. 

Commodities 

*         Commodities are up around 1% this week, with all sectors gaining ground. In Wednesday’s GMOS, we retained all our previous positions. Our main trades are long Brent time spreads (long front vs. third futures contract), long industrial metals, long US natural gas and short agriculture. Production losses in the North Sea should support our Brent trade, while the current economic rebound in China should push industrial metals higher. US Natural gas should benefit from the ongoing switch from coal to gas for power generation and 2013 should see the first slowdown in production since the boom began five years ago. 

*         The GSCI agriculture index has already reversed around 80% of its rise in summer 2012 as farmers have planted a much larger area, which means a higher likelihood of much higher future supply. We stay short for now as we think this downtrend has further to go. We are also long gasoil vs. Brent. Global inventories are very low and demand from Asia is picking up, consistent with the economic data, which we expect to improve further over the coming months. An expected cold snap should also help push demand higher through January 

*         We took profit on our long position in gold last Friday and year-to-date gold is down around 1%. We believe many investors had bought gold over the past few years to hedge against the risk of “QE unlimited.” The recent FOMC minutes, however, have since raised the risk of an early end to QE, reducing to need to hedge through gold. The risk is thus that a number of market participants will reduce their gold hedges, pushing gold prices down further. We still like gold as a hedge against long-term inflation risks once global growth returns to trend and we would look to reopen the position at around $1,550/oz..

5 Lessons of the DSK Affair

Bernard-Henri Lévy

July 2, 2011 -- The Strauss-Kahn affair is not over.

For it to be over, the American system of justice must pursue its
investigation and work to the very end.

If it’s truly to be over, Dominique Strauss-Kahn must be granted not
only his freedom, but—even more importantly—trestoration of his
honor.

In other words, “the Strauss-Kahn affair” will continue to be regarded
as such as long as it hasn’t been clearly established that there never
was any affair at all—and that the plaintiff, not content to have lied
about this or that aspect of her past, also lied in accusing the former
head of the IMF of having raped her.

And yet, given recent revelations, we can already draw a few lessons
from what will ultimately—no doubt very soon—be known as the
Strauss-Kahn non-affair.

1. The cannibalisation of Justice by the Sideshow.

This cannibalisation is not exclusively an American phenomenon, of
course, and we have witnessed myriad examples of it in Europe and
France. But it must be said that, with this affair, it has reached the
heights of obscenity. The improvised press conference by the
woman’s lawyer on the steps of a courthouse normally dedicated to
the sober discernment of the truth was obscene. The “shame on
you’s” that greeted Dominique Strauss-Kahn as he arrived for the
hearing on June 6th, shouted by battalions of hotel chambermaids
who knew nothing of the actual case and whose protest had been
orchestrated and scripted, were obscene. And so, too, though in
another manner, was the famous “perp walk” which, I’m aware, is the

Mr. Weinberg — 
I am a reporter with the ABC News investigative unit. We are gathering background research on the major 
candidates for President. 
Seeing that both former President Clinton and Mr. Trump have been mentioned in connection to the Jeffrey 
Epstein case, I am interested in better understanding the case, it's current status, and any information that 
could help explain Mr. Epstein's dealings and interactions with both men. 
I would very much appreciate the chance to meet and discuss this subject in an off the record conversation 
at your earliest convenience. 
Please let me know if that would be possible, and if so, when and where we could meet.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019250.txt,"BREAKING DOWN DEMOCRACY: Goals, Strategies, and Methods of Modern Authoritarians

Furthermore, because the population now has greater
access to foreign sources of news and entertain-
ment, regimes must grapple with the complex task of
monopolizing the political discourse in ways that are
far more convincing and compelling than the robotic
pronouncements that played such a crucial part in
communism's loss of credibility.

As is the case with so much of modern authoritarian
practice, Russia has taken the lead in developing strat-
egies and methods of media domination. The system
built under Vladimir Putin is defined by the following
characteristics:

1. Control over the commanding heights of the
media: Among Putin's first goals as president
was securing domination of the most influential
media—the national television stations. They
had been controlled by various oligarchs, who
used the outlets to promote their personal and
political interests. While the resulting journalism
was hardly objective and independent, Russian
television and Russian media generally were no-
table for their liveliness and diversity during the
presidency of Boris Yeltsin. All did not sing out
of the same hymnal, and most influential outlets
reflected a variety of opinions about government
policies, including the Kremlin's conduct of the
war in Chechnya.

Putin moved quickly to change these conditions.
He reorganized and exerted tighter political con-
trol over state-owned television stations, brought
others under indirect state control, and ensured
that most of the remainder fell into the hands

of loyal businessmen. Likewise, a number of the
countn/’s leading newspapers and journals were
bought by cronies of the leadership. The era of
media diversity came to an abrupt end.’

2. Distortion of coverage on sensitive topics: Un-
like in communist times, the media do provide
independent coverage of topics that the Kremlin
considers less politically relevant. However,
some normally apolitical topics can take ona
highly political meaning. For example, coverage
of the penalties meted out to Russian Olympic
athletes for systematic doping reflected the
leadership's position that the scandal was a
product of American machinations.’

3. Shrinking gap between offline and online me-
dia: For much of Putin's tenure, the internet

remained lightly regulated in comparison with
the Kremlin's tight control over television and
other mass media. However, Freedom House
has noted growing restrictions over the past
several years, with a series of new laws, prosecu-
tions, and ownership changes that have reduced
the Russian internet's freedom and diversity in
practice.’

. Asmall stable of independent outlets: A token

number of media outlets are allowed to remain
independent at the sufferance of the Kremlin.
These include the newspaper Novaya Gazeta,
the indirectly state-owned radio station Ekho
Moskvy, and a handful of internet-based news
services, some of which are forced to operate
from neighboring countries. Coerced owner-
ship changes and other forms of pressure have
gradually reduced the already tiny independent
media sector in recent years. And the remaining
independent outlets have little reach, small audi-
ences, and at best modest impact on domestic
politics.

. The ‘weaponization’ of information: While Putin

has used the press as a propaganda instrument
throughout his political career, it was after his
third term as president began in 2012 that the
media were given a special, central role in de-
monizing Putin's critics, preparing the Russian
people for armed conflict in Ukraine and else-
where, depicting Europe as morally corrupt, and
attributing Russia's problems and setbacks to
the United States.* With the invasion of Ukraine
in 2014, the world awakened to the return of
propaganda as an instrument of warfare. This is
not just normal political spin or public diploma-
cy, but sheer, raw propaganda that celiberately
crosses the line between interpretation of facts
and outright mendacity. The aim is both to stir
up belligerence at home and to isolate, confuse,
and demoralize the enemy.°

. The centralization of information policy: The

creation in 2013 of Rossiya Segodnya, an umbrel-
la organization for Moscow's foreign news ser-
vices, signaled the leadership's intention to use
information in a more strategic way to advance
the country’s international objectives. Dmitry
Kiselyov, a controversial television presenter,
was named to head the new entity.® He actually
embraces his identity as the Kremlin's chief
propagandist, arguing that “Western” concepts

Favorable conditions for biopharmaceutical investments for NLV-III

The Fund Managers believe that NLV-III will be invested in a market with attractive conditions
for investment in the biopharmaceutical sector. As a result, the Fund should have the
opportunity to invest in compelling biopharmaceutical opportunities that have attractive risk-
return profiles. A number of factors support this positive view of the investment thesis in the
biopharmaceuticals sector.

First, the Fund will invest in a portfolio of biopharmaceutical companies with an emphasis on
those that are developing targeted therapeutic opportunities that address mechanisms of
disease at the molecular level with high specificity and offer meaningful efficacy and safety
benefits to specific sub-groups of patients. Where possible, the Fund will look to invest in
companies with product programs that are guided by validated biomarkers that can enable
highly specific patient selection and provide an objective measurement of drug effect. The
Fund Managers believe that opportunities with these characteristics offer important benefits to
all market participants in the biopharmaceuticals sector, and that these substantially de-risk the
R&D and commercial sides of the biopharmaceutical business model in ways that can
meaningfully benefit investors.

Patients are offered therapies that are more targeted to their disease, and benefit from
improvements in efficacy and safety through increased life expectancy, improved quality of life,
and a more rapid return to a fully productive life;

Physicians have access to an arsenal of products that they can choose from to tailor therapy to
specific patients’ disease, and avoid the costs and risks associated with using less effective
therapies that carry all the safety risks, but may or may not have any effect on the specific
disease subtype of an individual patient;

Payers may pay higher prices for these therapies, but with the enhanced efficacy and safety
profile that’s possible with biomarker based targeting, they can expect to see better overall
patient outcomes, that ultimately save money within the system;

Pharmaceutical Companies benefit because with targeted approaches to drug discovery and

development, the probabilities of success improve, interactions with regulators become less
risky, timelines to move products from the lab to the market can be significantly shortened, and

hard to keep track of who cooperates and who doesn’t, especially if it’s institutions you’re
monitoring. Enron, which in 2001 filed one of the largest bankruptcies in U.S. history, hid
billions of dollars in debt in hundreds of shell firms, which bought poorly performing Enron
stocks so that Enron could create a fraudulent company profile and mislead its auditors. Lehman
Brothers, in the years before its 2008 collapse, used a smaller firm called Hudson Castle (of
which it owned 25 percent) to shift risky investments off its books so that Hudson Castle, not
Lehman Brothers, could absorb “headline risk.” Which leads us to shaming’s third weakness.

(3.) Shaming’s biggest drawback is its insufficiency. Some people have no shame. In the
research my colleagues and I have conducted on first-year students, involving games that require
cooperation, we have found that shame does not encourage cooperation among those players
who are least cooperative. This suggests that a certain fraction of a given population will always
behave shamelessly, like the False cleanerfish, if the payoff is high enough. The banks may have
gone bankrupt, but the bankers got their bonuses. There was even speculation that publishing
individual banker bonuses would lead to banker jealousy, not shame.

My colleagues and I conclude that ultimately shame is not enough to catalyze major
social change. Slavery did not end because abolitionists shamed slave owners into freeing their
slaves. Child labor did not stop because factories were shamed into forbidding children to work.
Destruction of the ozone layer did not slow because industries were ashamed to manufacture
products that contained chlorofluorocarbons. This is why punishment remains imperative. Even
if shaming were enough to bring the behavior of most people into line, governments need a
system of punishment to protect the group from the least cooperative players.

Finally, consider who belongs to the group. Today we are faced with the additional

challenge of balancing human interests and the interests of nonhuman life. How can we

In 1972 I got my PhD in Biology and it was conventional to nominate the very best post-docs for a Junior 
Fellowship, Harvard's most prestigious award—it provided three years of research support without any duties. I 
was the best student out of Evolutionary and Organismic Biology in more than 20 years. The entire department 
was behind me. 
but Watson was on the 3-man committee, in charge of all the science candidates and he deemed my two papers, 
reciprocal altruism and parental investment and sexual selection as not being science and dismissed me in one 
sentence. Well bless his soul, he now does not even understand his own subject—yes, i speak of genetics—
because having remained resolutely ignorant of evolutionary logic and biology he can neither understand the 
shape and form of the genotype nor how it differs systematically within life 
i have been preparing something for you for a long time on human intelligence, Africa, parasites etc because i

duration of our honeymoon until we had to ride coach on our way to
Bangkok Airport to fly out to Australia. Chatting away with always so
much to say to each other we watched a movie and finally got
comfortable leaning up against each other as pillows. We both fell asleep
on the long ride and when we woke up to the sound of the buses brakes
coming to a halt we initially realized my purse and Robbie’s wallet with
all of our money and cards in it was missing. Stranded in the city of
Bangkok was frightening enough as it was but too make matters worse a
lady looking in her mid-seventies, scrawny and hunched over from an
obvious lack of nutrition lifted up her skirt to a passer-byer with a she-
male hanging off his arm and began smacking her vagina blaring out
“Look! No cock...Pussy, pussy! Only five baht” repeating herself many
times over the man just walked on past as she sat back down on the curb
waiting for the next alluring customer. Robbie and I shook our heads in
disgust and disbelief, things could really be that bad for someone, | would
know best as it wasn’t far off the life Jeffrey had been training me up for.

Completely broke at two o’clock in the morning and with no one to call
for help, I panicked right away. Robbie rubbed my back and his tired eyes
trying to make the situation better. Luckily we had made friends with
some really nice people from the resort on the island who gave us about
two thousand baht when they saw how devastated Robbie and I were.
With just enough money to rent a really. cheap room for the night at a
backpackers hoste! and pay for a taxi to the airport the following day, we
were saved.

Early the next morning we were off in separate planes, since Robbie’s
ticket was pre-booked and no available seats left for me to join him meant
we would be landing in Australia separately. Fortunately we had found a
corresponding flight that arrived within the same hour of each other but I
would have to make a stop over to the Philippines. The lengthy hours of
the duration on the flight seemed to stretch on with only the thoughts of
the journey ahead of me I couldn’t wait to get back to my husbands
loving arms. The trip was going well, sleeping the majority of the flight
until I had to change planes in the Philippines.

After the plane landed and before any passenger was allowed to get off
we were handed a declaration statement that informed us that if we were
carrying any drugs or weaponry, we would be arrested and face charges
with death as the ultimate penalty. Not that I had anything to worry about,
but what a thought to willingly sign over your life. I got the chills
handing over my signed declaration and traveling documents to the
customs officer. Obtaining my passport he additionally asked to see my
departing ticket. No problem | thought, just I had done many of times,
and | handed over the requested information. The officer looked me over

and got on the phone immediately which sounded like a phone call to his
superiors but | couldn’t tell since it was in another language. A brief
conversation but long enough to get me thinking, he then called over two
guards who took me by the arms and brought me into an empty room but
for a desk and three chairs to be interrogated. No one would tell me what
was going on they all just scattered around in frenzy, ignoring all of my
hysterical inquisitions. Leaving me by myself and alone with my thoughts
I couldn’t help but panic even worse now.

This was a total bombshell of confusion on my part, what had | done
wrong? Minute’s later a large-framed women in a green uniform entered
the room with the guards from before and sat down across from me with
a stern look in her eyes. She placed my documents on the desk in between
us. Not saying a word to me she was waiting for me to give her an
explanation for something. “Can you please tell me what this is about,
have I done something wrong?” L asked her politely, trying to restraint
any animosity towards her. Her reply sounded as grim as she looked.
“You have been in Thailand for three months and now you have only a
one way ticket booked to Australia with no visa. What exactly are your
plans once you get there, Ms. Roberts?” To myself 1 wondered what
business it was to her, don’t people travel with one-way tickets all the
time? Knowing I was in no position to be able to say anything like that or
even at all I just gave in nicely and told her my intentions to travel over
there. Crying through my entire explanation | wasn’t sure if | was going ~
to even make my flight now. She had to think about everything | had told
her fora moment, deciding whether or not she would grant me
permission to meet my husband in Australia or send me back alone to
Bangkok. With only time on my side she had to make a hasty verdict
now. One more question had to be answered before | was let go, she
wanted some proof. “If you have just got married can you show me your
marriage certificate then?” This didn’t help my stories credibility at all
seeing that we were married in a Buddhist temple and given woven
bracelets instead of certificates. Explaining to her that I didn’t have one to
show her yet but was already aware that I would have to obtain a legal
marriage certificate through a courthouse upon my arrival in Australia to
stay there legally, it was only because of my husbands beliefs we wanted
to get married in a Buddhist ceremony. She must have shared a common
interest in religion or something like that as she finally cracked a smile
upon the photos of the wedding day that 1 showed her and carrying in my
purse since getting them developed, if she wanted proof, well this is all I
really had.

Handing me back my documents and ticket I was now free to leave but
she wasn’t leaving me much time to run through the airports terminal to
get to my departing plane. Expeditiously bolting through the busy airport

of uniformed US personnel. The focus was, of all things, on defense against a
missile attack from Iran. I contacted Leon Panetta to see whether we could delay it.
The official reason cited by the Americans, when they agreed to do it, did have the
merit of being true: that Bibi was coming under pressure to shift our budgetary
priorities away from defense toward social and economic issues. But Panetta
understood that my request for a delay meant we were at least considering military
action. He also realized that if we did launch an attack, it was in the Americans’
own interest for their troops be as far away from Israel as possible. We agreed to
reschedule the exercise for October 2012. That meant that if we did decide to
attack, we’d have until well into September, when significant numbers of US
troops would begin arriving.

As we weighed our final decision, I held a series of high-level meetings in
Washington: with Panetta, national security adviser Tom Donilon, Hillary Clinton,
and President Obama himself. Though not explicitly saying we were ready to
attack, I left no doubt that we were seriously considering it, and explained the
reasons we believed our country’s fundamental security interests might make it
necessary. The message from all of the Americans I met was that the
administration shared our basic goal: to prevent, or at least seriously impair, Iran’s
drive to get a nuclear bomb. But they continued to believe that non-military
pressure was the best way to do it.

The Americans knew we were skeptical that the non-military route would work,
and that we were deeply worried about the implications of not taking military
action if it failed. I discussed our thinking — and, in general terms, our plans — in
my meetings with Panetta. He already had a pretty good idea of the broad contours
of what we were contemplating, since US radar systems and electronic intercepts
had been recording the volume and nature of air force exercises we’d been
conducting over recent months. Leon and I had by now got to know each other
well, having first met when he was in charge of the CIA at the start of the Obama
administration. In one of our early meetings at CIA headquarters in Langley, there
had been a small bunch of grapes on his desk and I plucked a few in my mouth
with obvious enjoyment. Now, at the Pentagon, he had a big bowlful ready
whenever we met. The fact that he opposed an Israeli military operation made him
no less of a pleasure to deal with. He was unfailingly calm and even tempered. He
had an encyclopedic grasp of issues of defense, intelligence, budgets and policy.
He was always rock-solid in America’s commitments to Israel. It’s worth

Holiday services with my family in Brooklyn. The Lyon’s Den, a popular New York gossip
column, carried the following vignette: [C] He was close to each clerk in a different way,
following our careers, advising us on life choices and encouraging us to “do great things.”

Three months after I started working for Justice Goldberg I was in his secretary’s office while she
was talking on the phone to her husband who was an officer in the U.S. armed forces. I think he
had something to do with communications, because he told her that shots had been fired in Dallas.
We turned on a small television set that had been in my cubicle ever since the World Series a
couple of months earlier. Nothing was yet on the news. A few minutes later everyone in the
world knew that President Kennedy had been shot. It was a Friday morning and the nine Justices
of the Supreme Court were in their weekly private conference, which no one, except for the
Justices, was allowed to attend. There were no secretary, clerks or messengers. I had been given
strict instructions never to interrupt Justice Goldberg during one of these conferences, but I knew
this was an exception. And so I went to the door of the private conference room and knocked.
Justice Goldberg, being the junior Justice, answered the door and gave me a dirty look, saying, “I
told you not to interrupt me.” I said, “Mr. Justice, you are going to want to know that the
President has been shot.” Several of the Justices immediately gathered around my little television
set which, it turned out, was the only one in the entire Supreme Court building. We watched, as
the news got progressively worse, finally leading to the announcement that the President was
dead. The Chief Justice asked all of the Justices to disperse for fear that there might be a
conspiracy involving attacks on other institutions. The clerks stayed behind to finish the court’s
business.

The following night, right after the Sabbath was over, Justice Goldberg asked me to pick him up
and drive him to the White House. He was closely connected both to the Kennedy family and to
Lyndon Johnson, and the new President wanted his advice. I picked up the Justice in my old
Peugeot, which was filled with children’s toys. I drove him to the White House gate. Goldberg
asked me to wait for him, since the meeting would be relatively brief, and drive him home. When
the White House guard looked into the car, he immediately flung the back door open and grabbed
a toy plastic gun. Nerves were pretty tense. He wouldn’t let me wait inside the White House
gate, so I had to wait outside until the Justice returned. I also drove him to the funeral and was
with him when the news came over the radio that Lee Harvey Oswald had been shot. Goldberg
exclaimed angrily, “What kind of a country are we living in!”

Shortly thereafter, Chief Justice Earl Warren told the Supreme Court staff and employees that he
was becoming Chairman of the newly formed Warren Commission. I asked Goldberg why he
would do that. Goldberg told me something, which only in retrospect became clear. He said that
the President had asked him to perform a patriotic duty and to convince the American public that
the act was that of a lone gunman, and not a conspiracy by the communists. Warren agreed
because he did not want to allow any excuses either for a return of McCarthyism or for military
hostilities between the Soviet Union and the United States. I later learned that Lyndon Johnson
personally believed that there was a conspiracy behind the Kennedy assassination, but handpicked
the Warren Commission to assure that even if the evidence pointed in that direction, it would be
covered up in the interest of national security.

to know their nature by learning to use them. By watching what they do, observing
them in their surprising movements. We know at least already that puzzles like the
future of US-China relations or income inequality or artificial intelligence are simply
not addressable with traditional thinking because they occur on a network surface
now. Old-style ideas about each of these will likely lead us down dangerous paths.
Our leaders today are, as a result, imperiling us in ways they can’t even understand.
Honestly, these figures are not mentally prepared to fight any sort of battle on this
landscape. They probably never will be.

I’m not saying effective leadership now demands you know what “the instantiation
of a class” in object oriented programming means - or that you master the technical
roots of some other crucial, philosophical idea of connective design. But a feeling for
the laws of networks, for the normalness of connection and the pressures that it
produces is essential at least. That the terrorists of ISIS or the founders of gaming
app companies are better at growth hacking - the subtle art of using data,
connection and instinct to breed massive virtual communities - than our own
institutions or our leaders should unnerve us for a couple of reasons. First, because
it demonstrates a mastery of new power tools that move with astonishing speed,
assembling nation-sized movements and forces in incomprehensively brief periods
of time. But we should also worry - and this is as crucial - because that fast pace is
colliding with a set of slower-moving instincts, institutions and people who still
control substantial levers of power.

At the same moment in time that many of us are alive with the joy of being around
something that is beginning, most of our leaders are locked sadly or with terror into
the ending of something else. Same exact moment. Different instincts. It reminds me
of Virginia Woolf's novel of transitions, The Years, when the once-commanding
Colonel Pargiter finally passes away, liberating his daughter Eleanor into a world of
adventure even as the change dooms Crosby, the family’s long-serving maid. “For
Crosby, it was the end of everything,” Woolf wrote. “She had known every cupboard,
flagstone, chair and table in the large rambling house, not from five or six feet
distance as they had known it; but from her knees as she had scrubbed and
polished; she had known every groove, stain, fork, knife, napkin and cupboard. They
and their doings had made her entire world. And now she was going off, alone, toa
single room at Richmond.”?° The people now lamenting the decline of television, of
newspapers, of a disconnected age, who are baffled by constant connection or apps
of the moment or machines that learn should be given their quiet moments with the
old structures. They knew that world from their knees, built and maintained it as
much for us as for them. Elements of that slower unconnected era must be

that men don't want to date women as smart as they are. | felt like a bad feminist.

Oh, you shouldn't tone yourself down! said Mr. Ambition. It makes you attractive...
Attractive intellectually, I mean.

I sighed. Yes, I said. Intellectually.”

I'm sorry,” he said again.

I'm going home, I said.

We're still friends, right?” he asked.

Yes, but give me some time to get over this, I said. Probably about a month.”

What do you mean? He came after me as I walked to the door. Like, you don't want to
see me at all for a month? You don't want me to call you, or reach out to you, or
anything?

I looked at him, again, for a long moment. I regretted his stricken expression. Again, I
spoke as gently as I could. Maybe in a month.

He offered me a ride, which I declined. My fifteen-minute estimate was almost on target:
twenty minutes later, I stepped into my bedroom, leaned back against my door and burst
into tears.

te Kk ok

I ran into Richard the next evening, and we spent the night together. Richard put a fair
amount of effort into convincing me to talk to Mr. Ambition.

It sounds like he didn't actually mean to break up with you, said Richard. It sounds
like the conversation got away from him. He didn't start that conversation intending to
break up with you; maybe he was looking for reassurance, and you approached his
questions too logically, and he concluded that you don't care. You really like him. It
seems like it's worth trying to make it work.

You may have noticed that both of these men tried hard to convince me that the other
man cared about me. I decline to analyze what that means about me and my current
approach to relationships.

However, I will say that I tried giving Richard more emotional feedback than I have in a
long time; I even told him I missed him the next time he went on vacation. And I did try
talking to Mr. Ambition again, and he acknowledged that he hadn't exactly intended to
break up with me.

But then Mr. Ambition and I had several of those encounters that I think of as post-
breakup talks. I hate that shit. Every evening ended on a confusing, inconclusive note.
He kept saying that he was confidently ambiguous. We weren't dating, we weren't not
dating. It reminded me of a phase I went through with a college ex-boyfriend, back in my
monogamous days: my ex and I spent several weeks post-breakup being exclusive but
not together. So preposterous. People are so broken.

reason why NSA documents remained secrets, as all intelligence
workers at Dell were told when they signed their oath to protect
NSA secrets, was that the unauthorized release of communications
intelligence documents would violate U.S. espionage laws. Even so,
there was no shortage of activists overseas, such as Assange, who
would be willing to publish NSA documents revealing its global sur-
veillance activities. Cyberpunks, as these activists called themselves,
tended to be hostile to the NSA because they believed (correctly)
that it monitored their activities on the Internet. This anti-NSA
view was well represented at the Chaos Computer Club convention
in Berlin in 2012. In addressing these cyberpunks, Assange and his
followers at WikiLeaks declared that the main enemy in cyberspace
was the NSA. The NSA documents Snowden had taken were far
more explosive than anything Assange had posted to date because
they contained NSA intelligence source material.

In the late fall of 2012, Snowden further tested his newly found
powers. Using an alias, he reached out to some of the leading hack-
tivists. It opened a door for him to the darker side of cyberspace.

schools, country houses and vacations.

Back on the set Oliver is shooting the actual dinner. Assistant directors ask for volunteers to dance to the live
music. Prince Dimitri twirls and dips Jackie Weld. Kelly Klein, in her own Karl Lagerfeld sheer black organza,
watches from a table with scattered champagne glasses half-filled with apple juice along with her 86-year-old
father, Tulley Rector. Charlie Sheen leaves for LA and Shia is very annoyed he was not introduced to his
hero. Carrie Mulligan, costumed like Audrey Hepburn, chats with us between takes.

The final set up is a long tracking shot of Josh Brolin and his wife as they triumphantly enter the ball. It is
close to 9 p.m. and Lord William Astor arrives to pick me up for Amalia Dayan and Adam Lindemann's dinner
for artists uptown.

Oliver is introduced to William and delights in calling him Lord as he immediately moves him into the top of
the shot and instructs him to tell Eli Wallach, We must do lunch. Ever the proper English gentleman,
William advises Oliver that Lords do not use American slang and improvises his own lines. The tracking shot
continues for numerous takes following Josh and Noelle as every VIP extra gets another shot at instant stardom
with one-line greetings.

At last, “It’s a wrap” is screamed after 10 p.m. Prince Dimitri tells The Wall Street Journal it was, a day of
electrifying glamour, and “the longest gala of my life. I was in black tie for thirteen hours.”

Donald Trump is on set at 7 a.m. ready for his close up. He is trying to make a mid-day departure on his jet

September, Oliver had invited Donald Trump to dinner at 21 to meet his leading men Josh and Shia so they
could observe New York's most charismatic powerbroker in his natural environment.

The scene is London so the grey skies are perfect. Gekko has moved abroad to make his financial

comeback. The scene opens on the back of his head in a barber's chair as he watches the financial news on TV.
The camera pulls back and Gordon Gekko is finally revealed as the powerful bull he once was in an exquisite
suit and signature slicked-back hair. Donald Trump walks into the shop for a cut and the banter begins about
the money market. From his chair, Donald leans into Michael and suggests a comb over like his famous

The crew is yucking it up and Donald feels great. Paparazzi shoot the whole scene with long lenses from across
the street. The unit publicist is helpless to keep this under wraps. Donald emerges, poses and gives interviews.
Michael comes out, and the press think they have a scoop on the ending. Gekko is back in all his lovable titan
splendor. Full-page photos of Michael and Donald run the next day in the tabloids. Never underestimate Oliver
Stone’s surprise endings.

book.

Why start this journey into the churning, still-confusing and affronting world
around us now by the shores of Lake Taihu? Why begin with the sentiments of a
slower culture that Master Nan embodied, passed like delicate and still-warm tea,
with so much calm in the face of all this urgency? It’s not only because of Master
Nan’s insight that this world is tearing at our minds, that the faster we move the
sicker we'll get. It’s something else. The training of an instinct, of a really fresh way
of looking at the world, demands a kind of calm. Understanding of anything, after all,
is most durably assembled in slow conversations, in patient probing. It is developed
as much from brushes with music and literature as it is from any direct, slamming
confrontation with the truth. The birth of an instinct requires a rewiring of our
minds, a reframing of our hopes, and this can only be done at the pace of
contemplation. (It’s the best way to keep the fear at bay.) We seek those stilled,
freeze-framed moments where we'll pause amid lightspeed fast networks to think
about why they work and just what they are doing to us. Tranquility, fora moment
at least, in the face of the alternately horrible and wonderful way the world is being
remade. That’s what you'll get here, in the following pages. Nan’s model statesman
Su Qin, knife stabbed into his own thigh and slouched with exhaustion is a sort of
totem for us. Knife in thigh. Stop. Think. Even, hard as it may be, wait for the right
path to present itself. No matter how uncomfortable it may be at times, it is better to
be unconventional than conventional in our revolutionary age. This is the only way
to cultivate a Seventh Sense. The old methods will not teach you a new way.

Let me tell you what is going to happen: In coming years there will be a struggle
between those who have the Seventh Sense - who are born with it or trained to it -
and those who don't. New, network forces all around us will take on old, established
ones - they already are - in business, politics, warfare, science. Then - because
those who don’t have the Seventh Sense for network power will lose, as anyone who
tries to stop the future always loses - a new age will begin. This age will involve
violent, historic wrestling between different groups with different versions of the
Seventh Sense.Competing interests and ideals and aims will fire these contending
forces. Networks will fight networks. Some of the plans of these connected age
groups will be good, others evil, and anyhow the winners will be ruthless. Then, and
this is where it will get particularly strange and incredible, there will be a battle
between those with the Seventh Sense and the very systems of connection,
machines and intelligence they have built. Human instincts laid in competition
against the machine instincts. That struggle? I’m not quite sure how it will turn out.
But for now, at least, we can say this: The future sits almost like a cold-eyed dare in
front of us. Just try to avoid this!

+ 1/4 teaspoon SALT

+ 1/4 cup OIL
+ 1 tablespoon BALSAMIC VINEGAR

+ 1 tablespoon VANILLA (once I replaced this with ORANGE EXTRACT and added
some CINNAMON, and the result was amazing)

Preheat oven to baking temperature.

In a bowl beat together the OIL, SUGAR, SALT, SPICES and COCOA until well-
combined. Add the remaining ingredients, and stir until well-combined. Pour into a
greased enamel plate or cake dish and bake 20-30 minutes. Don't worry if the batter tastes
quite spicy -- it mellows out a lot, when you bake it so that the end result is more
chocolate with a spicy after-taste. Cool.

Then mix the following ingredients together, and pour the resultant icing on top:

dangerousness are based on weak evidence, unfounded assumptions, or both.

Consider sexual offenders. Their crime is intentional, frequently repeated, and aimed at innocent
victims. Given that many sexual offenders repeat their offenses, it has the appearance of inevitability, of
a process that is highly determined. Because many sexual offenders were abused as children, some
experts conclude that we should blame their parents. Other experts believe that particular situations either
promote or support sexual offenders, including the church and medical exam rooms. And yet other
experts, including the psychiatrist Boris Schiffer, reveal brain differences among pedophiles, including
especially the areas involved in reward and self-control. Together, these observations suggest that the
combination of a deviant nature and toxic nurture have led to a more deterministic universe. In this
universe, sexual offenses are inevitable or so highly probable that we should lock up offenders and post
their crimes in every county’s registry, and if possible, as replacements for flamingo lawn art.

If this assessment of sexual offenders is right, how should we think about responsibility, blame,
and punishment. If sexual offenders can’t help themselves, how should we assign blame? How should we
assign an appropriate level and form of punishment, if punishment is even appropriate? Studies of
recidivism among sexual offenders generate rates as low as 15% and as high as 80%. These studies also
reveal that recidivism rates differ for incest perpetrators, rapists, and child molesters. These numbers tell
us that even child molesters don’t always repeat their crimes. They also tell us that sexual offences should
not be lumped, but split apart into their underlying causes and triggers. Like the high odds favoring a
horse with a distinguished lineage and top rated jockey, there are high odds favoring repeated sexual
molestation in an individual who was sexually abused as a child and enters the clergy. Does this mean
that we should all bet on this one horse or forget the race altogether? Does this mean that we should lock
up the priest before he has an opportunity to enter his parish? No and No. Neither horse racing nor sexual
molestation are that easily determined. Future success and future dangerousness are probabilistic. They
represent our best guesses. When the law determines that someone is at high risk of committing a future
offense, it doesn’t really care whether the individual is perfectly healthy or brain damaged. It cares about
risk. In terms of blame and punishment, however, the law cares about the perpetrator’s brain. The law
cares about a person’s capacity to act rationally and independently. It is this capacity that allows us to
assign responsibility. It is this capacity that drives many theories of blame and punishment, including the
Australian legal scholar Michael Moore’s massive treatise Placing Blame. These are reasons why
scientific understanding of future dangerousness is important for law and society.

Armed with these ideas about future dangerousness, we can return to the list of potential evildoers
that I mentioned in the prologue. This list included individuals who caused relatively minor harms such as
Reverend Lawrence Murphy and Charles Manson, as well as those who committed much more major
harms such as Idi Amin and Mao Zedong. Whether we consider these individuals and their acts as evil is
orthogonal to the fact that each one posed a great risk to society. Each of these individuals would have
been judged as high risk for causing future danger. Only some of these individuals should have been
punished if punishment is guided by our understanding of responsibility and blame. Only those
individuals who can take responsibility for their actions and change should be punished. On this view, all
of the dictators were rightly blamed and punished. And so too were Jane Toppan, Bernard Madoff, and
Charles Granger. In contrast, although Lawrence Murphy should have been locked up as opposed to
exiled to a cottage, both Murphy and Charles Manson are more difficult to assess in terms of
responsibility, and thus, the appropriateness of punishment. No one would want them walking the streets
today, free to rape innocent children or create a cult of murderers. But for the law to evolve, we need
better tools to evaluate the biological underpinnings of diminished capacity. These measures, still in the
early stages of development, will help refine our understanding of risk, guide our clinical interventions,
and contribute to the construction of a safer society.

As we move forward, we must also recognize the rapidly changing landscape, and the future
dangerousness of globalization, especially its capacity to breed evildoers. Like authority, conformity,

ereignty, they are aligning themselves with a Russian
leader who has sought to dominate neighboring
states and who regularly invokes his country’s imperial
and Soviet past. Putin has refused to apologize for
Russias historical subjugation of Central and Eastern
Europe. He has defended the Soviet Unions occupa-
tions as necessary to secure its national interests, and
denounced the movement of former Soviet bloc coun-
tries to join the EU and seek protection in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).

Far-right parties apparently see Putin not as a threat
to national security, but as an exemplar of their own
nationalist values. Like him, they hope to build a
strong national state without regard for international
agreements, domestic checks and balances, or funda-
mental human rights. Putin's contempt for democracy
carries no stigma among these parties, for which
elections and civil liberties are purely instrumental.
While Le Pen, Wilders, and their ilk need elections as
a means of gaining power and a free press to convey
their arguments, they are hostile to the extension of
rights to immigrants and minorities, and unenthusias-
tic about independent courts that might block their
initiatives. To the extent that the EU enforces demo-
cratic norms in its region, Putin and Europe's far right
have a common enemy in Brussels.

Flacks for autocrats

Paul Manafort, a Washington lobbyist and consultant,
had a long career of work for leading Republicans,
including presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and
Ronald Reagan. But by the time he became Donald
Trump's campaign chairman in 2016, Manafort was
best known for his work on behalf of foreign political
leaders, including several with distinctly autocratic
pedigrees: Ferdinand Marcos, the strongman of the
Philippines until 1986; Mobutu Sese Seko, the klepto-
cratic dictator of what is now the Democratic Republic
of Congo; Sani Abacha, a Nigerian military ruler; and
Viktor Yanukovych, president of Ukraine from 2010 to
2014, when he was forced to abandon the presidency
and flee to Russia in the wake of nationwide protests.

anafort's work to dress up the images of Marcos and
obutu stood out at a time when American consul-
tants seldom represented dictators or authoritarians.
nthe 1980s, U.S. political operatives with experience
in major campaigns were expanding their clientele
to include foreign governments and political parties,
though usually in democratic settings.

By 2005, when Manafort signed on to work with Yanu-

kovych, political consultants, public relations special-
ists, and blue-chip law firms were earning fees paid

by a majority of the world’s autocracies, dictatorships,
and illiberal regimes. Some, especially Middle Eastern
monarchies, are American allies. But others are hostile
to democracy and regard the United States—and often
the EU—as adversaries. The lobbyists and spin masters
they employ are not located exclusively in the United
States. Authoritarians with the requisite means and
interests have hired representatives in London and
Brussels as well as Washington and New York.

Lawyers and consultants often represent dictator-
ships indirectly, through state-owned enterprises. A
number of China's state businesses have hired legal
and political consultants in major democracies, as
have state energy corporations in oil-rich countries
like Azerbaijan, Venezuela, and Angola.

But authoritarian governments generally seek the
assistance of global public relations companies in the
wake of repressive crackdowns at home or acts of
aggression against neighbors. During Manafort’s rela-
tively brief tenure with the Trump campaign, it emerged
that several American firms had been contracted to
discourage Congress from criticizing the Yanukovych
government for its jailing of Yanukovych’s 2010 presi-
dential campaign rival, Yuliya Tymoshenko. That effort
failed, as members of Congress and the American me-
dia made Tymoshenko’ fate a crucial criterion in their
assessment of Yanukovych’s record.’? Manafort had
more success in his earlier work to prepare Yanukovych
for his candidacy in 2010. Ukrainian observers credited
the American adviser with smoothing Yanukovychs
rough edges, convincing him to stay on message, and
reminding him that it was important to assure U.S. and
European audiences that he was committed to democ-
racy and the fight against corruption.

n 2016, Reuters reported that five global public rela-
tions firms had competed for a contract to improve
China's image abroad. The planned campaign would
presumably repair reputational damage caused by

the Chinese government's intensifying domestic
repression, its aggressive territorial policies in the
South China Sea, and a push by Chinese companies
to acquire crucial assets in democratic countries. The
firms that participated in the public relations audition
were Hill+Knowlton, Ogilvy, Ketchum, FleishmanHil-
lard, and Edelman. According to the Reuters account,
the firms were asked to give a presentation “on China's
most pressing image problems and demonstrate their
expertise on managing new forms of media.

suit against Jeffrey Epstein to recover damages for his sexual assault of L.M. See Complaint,
L.M. v. Epstein, (Exhibit “V”’).

47. Jane Doe’s federal complaint indicated that she sought damages of more than
$50,000,000. Listing the amount of damages sought in the complaint was in accord with other
civil suits that were. filed against Epstein (before any lawsuit filed by Edwards). See Complaint,
Jane Doe #4 v. Epstein (Exhibit “W”) (filed by Herman and Mermelstein, PA).

48. At about the same time as Edwards filed his three lawsuits against Epstein, other
civil attorneys were filing similar lawsuits against Epstein. For example, on or about April 14,
2008 another law firm, Herman and Mermelstein, filed the first civil action against Epstein on
behalf of one of its seven clients who were molested by Epstein. The complaints that attorney
Herman filed on behalf of his seven clients were similar in tenor and tone to the complaint that
Edwards filed on behalf of his three clients. See id.

49. Over the next year and a half, more than 20 other similar civil actions were filed by
vations attorneys against Epstein alleging sexual assault of minor girls. These complaints were
also similar in tenor and tone to the complaint that Edwards filed on behalf of his clients. These
complaints are all public record and have not been attached, but are available in this Court’s files
and the files of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.

schema learning the learning of schemata carrying out cognitive processes in more specialized,
context-dependent ways than the general MindAgents do. Eventually, once a CogPrime instance
becomes sufficiently complex and advanced, these cognitive schema may replace the MindAgents
altogether, leaving the system to operate almost entirely based on cognitive schemata.

In order to make the process of cognitive schema learning easier, we may provide a number
of elementary schemata embodying the basic cognitive processes contained in the MindAgents.
Of course, cognitive schemata need not use these they may embody entirely different cognitive
processes than the MindAgents. Eventually, we want the system to discover better ways of doing
things than anything even hinted at by its initial MindAgents. But for the initial phases or the
system’s schema learning, it will have a much easier time learning to use the basic cognitive
operations as the initial MindAgents, rather than inventing new ways of thinking from scratch!

For instance, we may provide elementary schemata corresponding to inference operations,
such as
schemes Deduction

Input InheritanceLink: X, Y
Output InheritanceLink

The inference MindAgents apply this rule in certain ways, designed to be reasonably effective
in a variety of situations. But there are certainly other ways of using the deduction rule, outside
of the basic control strategies embodied in the inference MindAgents. By learning schemata in-
volving the Deduction schema, the system can learn special, context-specific rules for combining
deduction with concept-formation, association-formation and other cognitive processes. And as
it gets smarter, it can then take these schemata involving the Deduction schema, and replace
it with a new schema that eg. contains a context-appropriate deduction formula.

Eventually, to support cognitive schema learning, we will want to cast the hard-wired MindA-
gents as cognitive schemata, so the system can see what is going on inside them. Pragmatically,
what this requires is coding versions of the MindAgents in Combo (see Chapter 21 of Part 2)
rather than C++, so they can be treated like any other cognitive schemata; or alternately, rep-
resenting them as declarative Atoms in the Atomspace. Figure 18.1 illustrates the possibility of
representing the PLN deduction rule in the Atomspace rather than as a hard-wired procedure
coded in C++.

But even prior to this kind of fully cognitively transparent implementation, the system can
still reason about its use of different mind dynamics by considering each MindAgent as a virtual
Procedure with a real SchemaNode attached to it. This can lead to some valuable learning, with
the obvious limitation that in this approach the system is thinking about its MindAgents as
black boxes rather than being equipped with full knowledge of their internals.

18.3 Self-Modification via Supercompilation

Now we turn to a very different form of advanced self-modification: supercompilation. Super-
compilation merely enables procedures to run much, much faster than they otherwise would.
This is in a sense weaker than self-modication methods that fundamentally create new algo-
rithms, but it shouldn’t be underestimated. A 50x speedup in some cognitive process can enable
that process to give much smarter answers, which can then elicit different behaviors from the
world or from other cognitive processes, thus resulting in a qualitatively different overall cog-
nitive dynamic.

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011842.txt,"/ BARAK / 85

Once it was clear to the Americans there would be no talks until the President
returned, however, Madeline began urging me to go see Arafat personally. The two
members of our team who were the least pessimistic about Camp David’s outcome,
Shlomo Ben-Ami and Yossi Ginossar, also said they thought it was a good idea. It
was they who’d pressed me to go see Arafat for tea and sweets earlier in the
summit. But that meeting had produced not even a glimmer of negotiating
flexibility from the Palestinian leader. Yossi had said at the time that it would help
the atmosphere, and pay dividends later on. But that hadn’t happened either.
“Madam Secretary,” I told Madeleine, “eating more baklava with Arafat isn’t
going to help. The situation is simple: he needs to answer whether he views the
President’s proposal as a basis for going forward.”

When Clinton returned, he promptly got back down to business: making one
last push to see whether a peace deal was possible. He phoned me around midnight
on the 24 of July, a few hours after he’d arrived. He told me he had sent an even
more far-reaching package to Arafat, expanding on my proposals. Now, all of the
outer Arab neighborhoods in East Jerusalem would come under Palestinian
sovereignty, in addition to the Muslim and Christian quarters in the Old City. And
Arafat would be given “custodial sovereignty” over the Muslim holy sites on the
Temple Mount. I didn’t object. Though it was further than I felt I could go, it was
within the spirit of my “pocket deposit”. The same ground rules still applied: these
were American proposals, which the President was telling Arafat he would try to
deliver if he accepted them as a basis for serious negotiations. But when Clinton
phoned me back, around 3:15 in the morning, it was to tell me that Arafat had
again said no.

The curtain had finally come down. What remained now was to clear up the set.
I did meet Arafat once more, in a joint session with President Clinton, but only for
closing statements. The President and I spoke as much in sorrow and frustration as
anger. Both of us said we thought an historic agreement had been within our grasp,
and that far-reaching proposals had been tabled to make it possible. Arafat
responded with words both of us had heard before: effusive toward Clinton,
rhapsodic about his “old partner” Rabin and fulsome in his ostensible commitment
to keep trying for peace. But it was just words. We knew he was not willing even
to talk about the kind of compromises a real, final peace would require.

The President’s remarks to the media were, by the standards of post-summit
diplomacy, unmistakably clear in making that point. He praised me and the Israeli

TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019849.txt,"﻿SERIOUS MOONLIGHT
Behind the scenes at the 2017 Academy Awards with filmdom’s first lady of Oscar cheerleading (my close friends know I was captain of the twirlers in high school)

By Peggy Siegal

UPDATED: Tuesday at 6pm

Was this year different from all other years at the Oscars? 

In one way, it wasn't. A24's Moonlight won best picture because voters went for content over style. The win was for it’s poetic take on the American ideals that the Academy values most and wants reflected globally. History was also made as Moonlight became the first Oscar winner with an all black cast and addressed the LGBTQ community. And, it was a beautiful film. 

But on the other hand, Oscar voters were also dealing with a political and emotional crisis in the film industry. After two years of #OscarsSoWhite, they responded by nominating a record six African American actors, four African American producers and one African American director, Barry Jenkins, the fourth ever nominated in that category. Three films addressing race were nominated for best picture: “Fences,” “Hidden Figures” and “Moonlight.”

Lionsgate's La La Land was a joyous escape from months of simmering frustration and anger at Donald J. Trump, himself a creature of the entertainment industry. The charming and modern musical “La La” ‎danced its way to multiple awards from critics, at the PGA, the DGA, the BAFTA and the Venice Film Festival, a record seven Golden Globes, en route to an historic fourteen Academy Award nominations. Prognosticators predicted a La La” landslide. 

So what happened? Days before the voting deadline, La La Land was tripped-up by a last-minute backlash against frivolity. Even in La La Land, these are serious times. 

Backstage at the Dolby Theater, star-struck nitwit accountant Brian Cullinan, oblivious to the fact that the Oscars are a sacred secular ceremony and distracted while tweeting a photo of Emma Stone, handed Warren Beatty the wrong envelope. Chaos—and headlines—ensued. Tweets, chaos and headlines? It was all too Trump for words. 

When I arrived at the Dolby Theater that night, I asked a dateless Andrew Garfield to take me onto the red carpet with him, to the chagrin of his publicist. But a security guard rejected me because my ticket was the wrong color. Andrew winked, laughed and disappeared. Undaunted, I went back to the curb to find another walker. As I stood at the limo drop-off, inconspicuous in a day-glow orange satin dress, Kelly Bush, a publicist I knew‎ from last year's The Revenant campaign, sidled over and said, There is going to be an upset. ‘Moonlight’ is winning.

On cue, “La La Land” producer Marc Platt arrived with the studs on his formal shirt popping off. As I nervously fiddled in his buttonholes, I blurted, Kelly Bush just said ‘Moonlight’ is winning.” Marc turned white. 

The red carpet was a three lane highway. The speed lane was for the super stars, the middle for frantic handlers, and on the right was the schlepper lane for relatives and relative nobodies. Four security guards escorted me there. ‎By the time Marc and I met again at the end of the three prong red carpet, La La Land publicist and West Coast campaign queen Lisa Taback was furious I’d told the shaken producer his film might lose. I said, Kelly Bush said that, not me. But I felt terrible. 

Sure enough, the “La La” landslide never happened. It did win a spectacular six Oscars before Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway walked to center stage for the best picture finale. 
I was now standing against the wall at the first row of the first balcony. Lionsgate publicists Julie Fontaine and Jennifer Peterson, both dressed in haute couture gowns and borrowed emeralds, anxiously insisted I join their good luck group hug as best picture was announced. Despite my faux pas, and my work on most of the year’s top films, including “Moonlight,” “Manchester by the Sea” and “Hidden Figures,” Oscar night I was in the “La La” camp due to my long friendship with it’s director Damien Chazelle.

So we three bejeweled broads were hugging tightly, when Faye broke Warren’s pregnant pause and screamed La La Land. The girls cried, the “La La” producers ran to the stage and I was thinking about how to apologize to Marc Platt as he thanked his family. Then, the stage filled up with men in headsets. Producer Jordan Horowitz, the class act of the evening, grabbed the right card and calmly announced Moonlight. No Joke. ‎ Platt, Horowitz and their co-producer Fred Berger handed their Oscars to Moonlight director Barry Jenkins, and producers Jeremy Kleiner and Adele Romanski and left the stage as Mahershala Ali, the first Muslim actor to get the gold guy, joined the cast waving his historic Oscar. 

Julie and Jennifer ran to Soho House to oversee Lionsgate's victory party, where hundreds of confused well-wishers waited to celebrate the “La La” wins, including Emma Stone’s best actress, Justin Hurwitz’s best score, and Benj Pasek, Justin Paul and Justin Hurwitz’s best song for “City of Stars.” At 32, Damien Chazelle also made history as the youngest best director ever. Some, lacking any empathy for the winners and losers onstage, called this historic screw-up great live-television.” But standing in the balcony, alone and speechless, all I could think was, “How did I miss this?”

I ran to the Governor's Ball, which is the next stop for winners on their busy night. They get their statues engraved there before they drop by their studio’s party, get photographed, Oscar in hand at Vanity Fair’s fete, wall-to-wall with celebrities, and then head to Guy Oseary's home high in Beverly Hills to rock-and-roll ‘till dawn.

At the entrance to the Governor's Ball, Warren Beatty walked up to me, still holding the two priceless envelopes as proof of his innocence. I asked him, What happened? 

His phone rang. It was so noisy, he bent toward me to hear better. The phone was almost in my face and I heard Annette Benning asking where he was and saying, Warren, come home. ‎ Warren said, No. I have done nothing wrong. 

Warren's wonderful film, Rules Don't Apply received little Academy love, yet he was generous enough to show up. Now, fifty years after “Bonnie and Clyde,” he was in the Oscar spotlight again, the latest unwitting star of Oscar’s all-time blooper reel. As Jimmy Kimmel said, “We don’t have to watch reality shows anymore because we are living in one.” 

Here’s reality-show Oscar week as I lived it:

Tuesday, February 21st

I checked into Jeff Klein's Sunset Tower Hotel still exhausted from last weekend's oh-so-grand birthday extravaganza thrown by fun loving billionaire Stephen Schwarzman in Palm Beach—and headed straight to Charles Finch's photo exhibition, The Art of Behind the Scenes, to see rare candid on-set photos of Audrey Hepburn, Brigitte Bardot, Grace Kelly and Ava Gardner.

Oscar balloting had closed an hour earlier, and IndieWire's Oscar blogger Anne Thompson announced that a female friend had voted for all the diverse and minority nominees. This first hint of things to come didn’t register as a bell ringer for best picture. Spotted: Jean Pigozzi, Brett Ratner and Paul Haggis.

Back at The Sunset Tower Bar, diminutive maitre d' Dmitri Dimitrov slid up to me, cupped his hands in prayer and whispered, Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper are in the corner booth with Warner Bros. Sue Kroll. They were talking about their remake of A Star is Born going into production within the month. 

At the next table was Ryan Murphy, creator of the multi-award winning FX mini-series The People vs. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story,” eating with his muse Sarah Paulson, who won countless awards for portraying Marcia Clark. I joked that the Oscar nominated documentary O.J.: Made in America from ESPN would win because voters thought both films are the same. 

Wednesday, February 22nd

I met Adam Lindemann and museum director Michael Govan at LACMA’s The Inner Eye: Vision and Transcendence in African Art. Michael and I discussed the struggle to diversify the Academy. He told me that at LACMA he’d hired women, African American and Latino curators years before. 

Vanity Fair Editor-in-Chief Graydon Carter and Barneys hosted a private dinner for La La Land at the Chateau Marmont. Graydon always tries to entertain the winning film. Drinks around the pool were followed by a seated dinner for fifty in a bungalow. Emma Stone brought her mother. Handsome hotelier Andre Balazs darts around. Ryan Gosling stayed home with his girlfriend Eva Mendes and their two baby girls. Emma talked about her next film Battle of the Sexes. She plays Billie Jean King opposite Steve Carell, an excellent tennis player in real life, as Bobby Riggs. 

Damien Chazelle came late from a dinner for the nominated directors. The Academy hosts a series of secret dinners during Oscar week for key nominees to keep them away from sponsors who profit from their celebrity. They also want to protect their own sponsor, ABC-TV, with exclusivity and audience surprise. 

Thursday, February 23rd

Larry Gagosian's annual Oscar-week art opening is always a hot ticket. Serious collectors blended in unnoticed among the mere lookers and pretty gallerists quietly pointing out one glorious Joe Bradley painting after another. Each costs a cool million and between 6:00pm and 8:00pm they are all sold. Buyers and Larry's close friends then migrate down the block to Mr. Chow. Elton John and David Furnish, Jonah Hill, Dakota Johnson, Sharon Stone, NBCUniversal's Ron Meyer, Gus Van Sant, Emily Ratajkowski, Dasha Zhukova, artists Alex Israel, Harmony Korine and Dan Colen, rocker Robbie Robertson and Page Six’s Ian Mohr dig into orange chicken on sticks. Larry's girls come around and slip his home address onto laps. This means you have made the cut to attend Larry's after party at his house. 

Ian and I head to Paul Haggis' intimate Artist for Peace and Justice benefit dinner for 65 at the LA club No Name‎ where a great time set guests back $2,500 for Haiti. We arrive just in time to hear Jeff Bridges sing a song from Crazy Heart, Jack Black recall School of Rock  and Rita Wilson sing ABBA's Dancing Queen. Jackson Browne is the master of ceremonies. 

I end up at A24's party at the Sunset Tower for their films 20th Century Woman and Moonlight. Barry Jenkins wants to know if he is winning the Oscar. I chirp, Yes, best adapted screenplay is all yours! Not the answer he was looking for. I should have said, Yes, you will win best picture, make history and bring the house down‎. I would have looked like a genius. 

Finally, I speak to Janelle Monae, who is absolutely stunning. She also wants to know if Hidden Figures is winning the Oscar. I assure her that her real win was at the box office. 

Before passing out in my Sunset Tower suite, I email Damien Chazelle a social wrap-up on the evening, as he is now sick as a dog, in bed with his dog and has had visiting nurses injecting fluids into his flu-infested body all day. 

He, too, asks if he is winning the Oscar. I write, It's not if, but how many. 

Friday, February 24

I’m a gal hell bent on making a fashion statement with every outing, who runs her business from the back seat of a chauffeured black Cadillac with the license plate PEG-FILM. So marching or attending a protest rally is not the likely place to find me. But when I read the United Talent Agency's United Voice Rally was happening at their Beverly Hills headquarters--2,000 of the creative community’s best looking turning out on a gorgeous afternoon to stand together for freedom of speech, and against exclusion and division, it was an invitation I couldn’t refuse. This is a substitute for UTA’s traditional pre-Oscar party--and the ten percenters donated and raised $320,000 for the American Civil Liberties Union and the International Rescue Committee. CEO Jeremy Zimmer and clients Jodie Foster and Michael J. Fox speak passionately. 

The surprise highlight is taped remarks from Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi, nominated for The Salesman. Farhadi made international headlines announcing he would not travel to Hollywood in protest of President Trump's proposed travel ban on seven Muslim countries. Some Oscar voters do not see all five nominated foreign films, so Trump assured Asghar his Oscar. 

I stop by the Women in Film cocktail party at Nightingale Plaza where Meryl Streep announces, I feel like never saying anything again. We hear last year's best actress Brie Larson and activist/documentary nominee Ava DuVernay speak. Back at the Sunset Tower, Livia and Colin Firth host their annual dinner for 50 to celebrate The Green Carpet Challenge and The Journey to Sustainable Luxury. Spotted: Emma Stone, Meryl Streep, Ruth Negga, Kevin Bacon, Tom Ford, Salma Hayek, and Mick Jagger. Kyra Sedgwick arrives late from directing her first film, Story of a Girl, starring her husband Kevin Bacon. Kyra sits with Meryl over coffee and says how exciting it is to direct. When I ask Meryl if she will join the minute ranks of female directors, the acting icon says, Never. My job is done at the end of the day. I like to go home at night and let someone else worry about tomorrow's location. 

Friday ends at the CAA party, a tough ticket now handed out by Maha Dahkil and Michael Kives. The white tent is filled with a sea of celebrity. Every CAA client comes out to eat, mingle, kibbitz and dance. Spotted: Meryl Streep (yes, she had a busy day too), Leonardo DiCaprio, Scarlett Johansson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Orlando Bloom, Jerry Bruckheimer, J.J. Abrams, Ron Howard, Naomi Watts, Mick Jagger, Lady Gaga, Barry Jenkins, John Mayer, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kate Hudson, Jon Hamm and Jeff Bezos.

At 2 a.m. I email Damien Chazelle another party report as he is still sick in bed. Now, a team of medical talent is working on getting him well for Oscar night.

Saturday, February 25

I march down to the Academy's theater to hear my producer friend (since Diner), Mark Johnson, also an Academy governor, conduct a symposium for four of five nominated foreign film directors. ‎ As brilliant as the conversation was, four guys from Australia, Denmark, Germany and Sweden depressingly knew that the absent Iranian Asghar Farhadi was winning. 

I took Mark, instead of the still-quarantined Damien Chazelle, up Coldwater Canyon to Barry Diller and Diane von Furstenberg's annual picnic lunch for Graydon Carter and Anna Scott. This gathering of the powerful and mighty occurs at exactly the same time as the Independent Spirit Awards for young and new talent. The two hot owners of A24, David Fenkel and Daniel Katz, are so sure their Moonlight was winning all six awards they are here instead of the Spirit Award’s tent on the beach in Santa Monica. When asked, What are you doing here?” they simultaneously say, Our people are there. The reason they were on the lawn for the first time is that they have a new television and film production deal with Diller. 

‎It's all very familiar, cozy and the best party of the week. Collectively there are more Oscar and Emmy winners on this lawn than will file into the Dolby Theater on Sunday. 

I sit with petite Gloria Cooper, mother of Bradley. She is the only one wearing a hat, a large white felt fedora hiding enormous black sunglasses and her pretty face. I entertain Gloria with local gossip, which she loves, but when I ask her for details on the start of production for A Star is Born, I get nothing. 

I ask guests, Who is winning best actor?  They reply, Denzel, but I voted for Casey. Casey, who touched my heart on and off screen, ran in a tight race with humility, despite a nasty whisper campaign against him. I never asked about best picture. I'm still in thrall to the conventional wisdom: It's a La La landslide.


Rupert Murdoch brings his bride Jerry Hall who kisses and chats with Mick Jagger as the lawn people try to eavesdrop. Spotted: DvF's kids Alexander and Tatiana, Sir Howard Stringer, Oliver Stone, Ted Sarandos, Brett Ratner, Ron Meyer, Tom Ford, Larry Gagosian and Chrissie Erpf, Jeffrey Katzenberg, George Stevens, Jr., Toby Maguire, Sandy Gallin, Robert Kraft, Harvey Weinstein and breathtakingly beautiful Georgina Chapman, Lynn Wyatt, Fran Lebowitz, Henry Kravis, Jeff and Scott Berg and Irwin Winkler.

Another favorite event is Charles Finch's star-studded dinner at Madeo‎ sponsored by Chanel. I sit next to Amazon’s Roy Price and Oliver Stone, who sits next to Michael Keaton. I bring over Pharrell Williams to meet Oliver Stone, director of “Snowden” and “JFK.” The conversation segwayed from Hillary Clinton to Oliver’s new documentary on Putin. 

Lily Collins comes over and asks to be introduced to Mick Jagger at the table next to us. She says, Tell Mick my father says ‘hello.’ Lily is the daughter of Phil Collins and starred in Warren Beatty's Rules Don't Apply. Mick, never one to pass up a flirt with an Audrey Hepburn look-alike, ‎whispers in her ear that he loved her in the film and was on the set, but sadly missed her.

Spotted: Nicole Kidman, Naomi Watts, Christian Louboutin, Kristen Stewart, Ruth Negga and “Arrival” director Denis Villeneuve. 

Wendy Stark, daughter of Funny Girl producer Ray Stark and granddaughter of Fanny Brice, invited me to Jeffrey Katzenberg's Night Before Party on the Fox lot for the Motion Picture Home. Walking around with Linda and Jerry Bruckheimer, I kiss David O. Russell and Colleen Camp. Brian D'Arcy James tells me he may return to his original role in Hamilton as King George. I go home with the heaviest swag bag in the world.


Sunday, Feb. 26th

The shocking end of the Oscar show continues to mystify me. How could I be so close to every filmmaker and totally miss the upset? 

Because Damien is still sick, he begs off on his invitation to take me to Guy Oseary's—and heads back to bed. As I stand at the end of the Vanity Fair ‎carpet at the entrance to the Wallis Annenberg Center, Casey Affleck arrives holding his Oscar. I ask him to replace Damien as my escort and he says, Of course. I am leaving in 15 minutes. Don't lose me.” Casey then sends me off to find Jimmy Kimmel, who has already left the party. Fifteen minutes turns into an hour as everyone wants a selfie with the winner. 

Spotted from “Moonlight”: Barry Jenkins, Mahershala Ali, Naomie Harris, Jeremy Kleiner. From “La La Land” Emma Stone and John Legend. From “Manchester by the Sea”, Casey Affleck, Michelle Williams, Lucas Hedges and Kenny Lonergan. From “Hidden Figures”: Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Pharrell Williams, and “Fences” Oscar winner Viola Davis. Also swirling around the room: Brie Larson, Dakota Fanning, Elton John, Amy Adams, Jennifer Aniston, Javier Bardem, Michael Shannon, Alicia Vikander, Scarlett Johansson, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Halle Berry, Isabelle Huppert, Michelle Dockery, Faye Dunaway, Andrew Garfield, Dakota Johnson, Mick Jagger and family, Kelly Ripa, and Patty and Lydia Hearst. I find exhausted Oscar show producers Jennifer Todd and Mike De Luca and tell them what a wonderful job they did. 

On the way out, a familiar looking lady keeps waving and smiling at Casey as we wait in the cold for cars. I say, Casey, that is Monica Lewinsky waving at you. Casey is unfazed; he can’t wait to get out of the spotlight. Once we reach the Checkpoint Charlie to Guy's party, a team of girls wrapped in wool instructs the driver to lower the window and asks for a name. Casey, holding up the Oscar says, Affleck.” She says, You only have a plus one. The real deal is, if you win, you can bring a car full of friends—and eventually we’re cleared for takeoff. Once inside we lose each other in the darkness and pulsating Caribbean music. I get home at 5:00am, pack my three huge suitcases and rush off to the private airport in Van Nuys, still wondering how I could have missed “Moonlight”’s triumph. Why couldn’t I see the forest through the trees? I must have been in La La-land. 

xoxo,
Peggy

P.S. The following weekend I arrive in the Dominican Republic at Casa de Campo at the home of sugar baron Pepe Fanjul and his wife Emilia. Juan Carlos, the past king of Spain, wants to watch a few movies with me. I pulled a dozen DVDs out of my bag and say, Your Majesty, which one?  He says, First, La La Land for fun, then Moonlight because it won, then The Founder for American ingenuity.”

Allawi's Iragiya bloc, or whether different parties, or sects, would
rotate within its leadership in future years.

Iraqis need to decide whether the council's leader will always be a
Shi'ite, given that Allawi is Shi'ite, or whether Sunnis, Kurds and
Christians will be entitled to compete for the post. If the new council
will have powers equal to that of the prime minister, will it become
part of the sectarian division of power in Iraq? Will it become a
permanent seat that is given to the second runner up in any
parliamentary election? And what will its status become if Allawi
becomes prime minister one day?

Would it stay with Allawi's team or will it go to the defeated
coalition in parliament? If this is the case, it needs to be said, either in
writing or gentleman's agreement; especially that in today's case,
Allawi's team is not a minority in parliament, but actually, the
coalition with the largest number of seats.

When a young man at a town-hall meeting in Kyrgyzstan asks Hillary
which designers she wears, she answers immediately: “Would you
ever ask a man that question?” The crowd of young people laughed
and applauded. Hillary and Bill like to vacation at Oscar de la
Renta’s Punta Cana resort, in the Dominican Republic, but she
wasn’t about to mention that, or venture that Vera Wang designed
Chelsea’s wedding dress. Like Albright and Rice, Hillary wants
women’s issues to be substantive. “All the young men on our staff
don’t seem to think they’re important,” Hillary remarked archly one
day in 2009, an early sign of the schisms to come. To reinforce the
message she named Verveer, her former chief of staff in the White
House, to be the first ambassador-at-large for global women’s issues.
Even amid the Sturm und Drang of the Middle East and North Africa,
she’s liable to leave her imprint in the same areas that brought her
into public life in the first place—helping women and children and
strengthening civil society. It’s a straight line from the Children’s
Defense Fund, where she worked as a young law-school graduate, to
Foggy Bottom. From micro-credit to food assistance to education,
Hillary knows that women in underdeveloped villages usually spend
aid money on their families, while men more often spend it on
themselves, which is a polite way of saying on liquor and prostitutes.
Seemingly minor changes can yield huge benefits. “As we meet ... as
many as three billion people are gathering around open fires or old
and inefficient stoves in small kitchens in poorly ventilated houses,”
Hillary tells a New York philanthropic audience. “As the women
cook, smoke fills their lungs and toxins begin poisoning them and
their children,” she explains before noting that the World Health
Organization estimates that nearly two million people a year—half of
them children—die from pneumonia and other ailments that are likely
connected to this problem, more than twice the number of deaths
from malaria. She has been involved in this cause for years, but now

Media

The UK media have long been important international sources of information and
insight on China, reporting independently and critically. While independent reporting
continues, Chinese official media have become more influential in the United Kingdom
and internationally through their UK presence. Primarily, they have expanded their
operations and reach. For example, the re-branded China Global Television Network
Europe Ltd (CGTN), headquartered in London, is seeking to increase activities and
China Daily now distributes its China Watch “supplement” as an advertisement inside
the respected conservative newspaper the Daily Telegraph. The UK and Chinese
governments have also concluded a Television Co-Production Agreement that provides
a framework under which TV producers in both countries can share resources but have
to respect “stipulations in the relevant Party’s law and regulations.”

Given the United Kingdom's special historical relationship with Hong Kong, the
central authorities’ heavy influence on the Hong Kong media and the deterioration of
media freedom in Hong Kong are of relevance in the United Kingdom, where the case
of rising self-censorship at the South China Morning Post, for example, has been noted.”
According to confidential reports, some journalists who have left Hong Kong for the
United Kingdom have encountered intimidation attempts.

The effects of media-influencing activities taking place in the United Kingdom are
hard to assess. Critical reporting continues, but the rise of commercial ventures
transporting censorship into the United Kingdom looks set to continue too. For the
moment, increasingly difficult access to information and insight in China, as a result
of domestic repression, is at least as great a problem as attempts to influence or repress
remotely in the United Kingdom.

The Economy

For years, the United Kingdom was a bit of an outlier in its openness to Chinese
investment and its willingness to grant Chinese firms, even state-owned ones, access to
its critical infrastructure. Nonetheless, there is now growing concern in London about
China’s ability to leverage its growing economic power into political influence and to
use its riches to buy, borrow, or steal key Western technologies that sit at the heart of
Western economies.

In partnership with France and Germany, the UK government has also introduced
mechanisms to monitor and block Chinese takeovers of high-technology companies in
sensitive sectors.'® The three nations also support efforts to tighten EU-wide regulations
to govern Chinese investment so that Chinese entities cannot exploit the weaker
regulatory systems of some European countries to gain access to potentially sensitive

2) Memorandum from the Congressional Research Service to the Committee on Government
Operations concerning “The Executive's Duty to Enforce the Laws (Feb. 6, 1985), reprinted in
Constitutionality of GAO's Bid Protest Function: Hearings Before a Subcomm. of the House Comm.
on Government Operations, 99th Cong., Ist Sess. 544 (1985): This memorandum stated that the
President lacks the authority to decline to enforce statutes. The CRS argued that [t]he refusal of the
President to execute the law is indistinguishable from the power to suspend the laws. That power, as is
true of the power to amend or to revive an expired law, is a legislative power. Id. at 554.

Cases (not included in the submitted materials)

1) Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926): The President refused to comply with -- that is, enforce
-- a limitation on his power of removal that he regarded as unconstitutional, even though the question
had not been addressed by the Supreme Court. A member of Congress, Senator Pepper, urged the
Supreme Court to uphold the validity of the provision. The Supreme Court vindicated the President's
interpretation without any member of the Court indicating that the President had acted unlawfully or
inappropriately in refusing to enforce the removal restriction based on his belief that it was
unconstitutional.

2) United States v. Lovett, 328 U.S. 303 (1946): The President enforced a statute that directed him to
withhold compensation from three named employees, even though the President believed the law to be
unconstitutional. The Justice Department argued against the constitutionality of the statute in the
ensuing litigation. (The Court permitted an attorney to appear on behalf of Congress, amicus curiae, to
defend the statute.)

3) INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983): This case involved the withholding of citizenship from an
applicant pursuant to a legislative veto of an Attorney General decision to grant citizenship. Despite a
Carter Administration policy against complying with legislative vetoes (see Carter Presidential
memorandum, supra), the executive branch enforced the legislative veto, and, in so doing, allowed for
judicial review of the statute. As with Lovett, the Justice Department argued against the
constitutionality of the statute.

4) Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988): The President viewed the independent counsel statute as
unconstitutional. The Attorney General enforced it, making findings and forwarding them to the
Special Division. In litigation, however, the Justice Department attacked the constitutionality of the
statute and left its defense to the Senate Counsel, as amicus curiae, and the independent counsel
herself. ,

5) Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S. 868 (1991): A unanimous Court ruled that the appointment of
special trial judges by the Chief Judge of the United States Tax Court did not violate the Appointments
Clause. Five Justices concluded that the Tax Court was a Court of Law for Appointments Clause
purposes, despite the fact that it was an Article I court, so that the Tax Court could constitutionally
appoint inferior officers. Four Justices, in a concurrence by Justice Scalia, contended that the Tax Court
was a Department under the Appointments Clause. The concurrence stated that Court of Law did
not include Article I courts and that the Framers intended to prevent Congress from having the power
both to create offices and to appoint officers. In this regard, the concurrence stated that it was not
enough simply to repose the power to execute the laws (or to appoint) in the President; it was also
necessary to provide him with the means to resist legislative encroachment upon that power. The
means selected were various, including a separate political constituency, to which he alone was
responsible, and the power to veto encroaching laws, see Art. I, § 7, or even to disregard them when
they are unconstitutional. Id. at 906 (Scalia, J., concurring).

Xi Jinping’s Chinese Dream

OBAMA MEETS
XI JINPING
American
policy makers
must under-
stand that the
new Chinese
leader needs to
bea
nationalist to
be a reformer.

Robert Lawrence Kuhn

BEWING What to make of Xi Jinping,
China’s new senior leader, who holds
his first summit meeting this week with
President Barack Obama?

The hope is that Xiis a reformer who
will guide China through domestic
transformation and to responsible
statecraft. The fear is that Xiis ana-
tionalist, who has set China on an ag-
gressive course of bullying its neigh-
bors and confronting the United States.

The fear seems not unfounded. China
has intensified its territorial claims,
from island disputes with Japan to vast
areas of the South China Sea.

Xi frequently inspects People’s Liber-
ation Army forces, especially naval
fleets, exhorting China’s military to
“get ready to fight and to win wars”’
and “to win regional warfare under
LT.-oriented conditions.”

Xi holds China’s top three positions:
head of the ruling Communist Party of
China, head of state, and, as chairman
of the Central Military Commission,
head of the military. He will likely lead
China for a decade.

Just after becoming party chief in late
2012, Xi announced what would become
the hallmark of his administration. ‘“‘The
Chinese Dream,’ he said, is “‘the great
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.”

Xi’s Chinese Dream is described as
achieving the ‘““Two 100s”’: the material
goal of China becoming a ‘‘moderately
well-off society”’ by about 2020, the
100th anniversary of the Chinese Com-
munist Party, and the modernization
goal of China becoming a fully de-
veloped nation by about 2049, the 100th
anniversary of the People’s Republic.

The Chinese Dream has four parts:
Strong China (economically, politically,
diplomatically, scientifically, militar-
ily); Civilized China (equity and fair-
ness, rich culture, high morals); Har-
monious China (amity among social
classes); Beautiful China (healthy en-
vironment, low pollution).

“A moderately well-off society” is
where all citizens, rural and urban, en-
joy high standards of living. This in-
cludes doubling the 2010 G.D.P. per cap-
ita (approaching $10,000 per person) by
about 2020 and completing urbanization
(roughly one billion people, 70 percent
of China’s population) by about 2030.

“Modernization” means China re-
gaining its position as a world leader in
science and technology as well as in eco-
nomics and business; the resurgence of
Chinese civilization, culture and mili-
tary might; and China participating ac-
tively in all areas of human endeavor.

If Xi’s nationalism seems at odds
with these grand goals, it is not. Here
are six reasons why:

International Herald Cribune

THE GLOBAL EDITION OF THE NEW YORK TIMES

« Need to consolidate power. Xi was not
selected by Deng Xiaoping, the archi-
tect of reform, as were his predecessors
(Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao), and he
was not elected by the people. Conven-
tional wisdom had it that Xi would be a
weak leader. In order to realize his
Chinese Dream, Xi needs to assert
strength and assure control. So far, he
has exceeded expectations.

« Need to enable reform. Xi and Premier
Li Keqiang are determined to enact far-
reaching economic reforms, the most
extensive in 15 years, but there is stiff
resistance from those whose domi-
nance would be diminished and bene-
fits cut (such as state-owned enter-
prises with ties to party power).

This resistance can no longer be
couched credibly in terms of ideology,
so it appeals to nationalistic aspirations
by accusing reformers of ‘worshipping
Western ways,” “glorifying Western
models” or ‘‘caving in to Western pres-
sures,”’ Xi’s proactive nationalism is a
strategy of ‘‘offense is the best de-
fense’’ — an inoculation, as it were,
against the political virus of being
labeled ‘‘soft’’ or “pro-Western.”

Reformers in China are generally as-
sociated with pro-American attitudes
and thus subject to fierce public crit-
icism. By establishing himself as a na-
tionalist operating independently of the
United States (his first foreign trip was
to Russia), Xiis able to secure econom-
icreforms by distinguishing them from
serving Western/American interests.

* Need to legitimze one-party rule. To
perpetuate its rule (which China’s top
leaders truly believe is essential for the
well-being of the country), the Chinese
Communist Party has constructed a
grand narrative that is founded on
three critical claims: Only the Commu-
nist Party can continue to improve cit-
izen’s standard of living (and amelior-
ate severe social and economic
disparities); only the party can main-
tain a stable, unified country and con-
struct a happy, harmonious society;
and only the party can effect the ‘“‘reju-
venation of the Chinese nation,” which
stresses a firm command of ‘‘core in-
terests’’ (i.e., sovereignty and territori-
ality) and increasing global respect.

* Maintain stability through unity.
China faces numerous internal ten-
sions, especially a class-divided popu-
lace (rich-poor, urban-rural, coastal-in-
land) that have erupted within one
generation. Moreover, an increasingly
complex society can fracture along mul-
tiple fault lines. Pollution, corruption,
healthcare, housing, migrant workers,
workers’ wages, social cynicism, chan-
ging values, among other raging issues,

EDITORIAL OPINION

threaten to tragment society — and all
are exacerbated by an energetic social
media. Only nationalism, which reson-
ates intrinsically and passionately
across Chinese society, can provide suf-
ficiently strong social glue.

© Differentiate from predecessors. Top
Chinese leaders must combine historic-
al continuity with their own distin-
guishing theories and practices. How
shall Xi fare?

Economic growth rates must decline,
and a host of domestic tensions (or
crises) are coming his way, such as
public anger at corruption and resis-
tance to pollution. Hence another ra-
tionale for nationalism.

In the past, nationalistic surges were
triggered largely by external events
(such as NATO's accidental bombing of
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in
1999). Xiis putting nationalism at the
core of his leadership — his nationalism
is proactive, riding the high road of pa-
triotism and pride.

* Personal beliefs. Xi has deep-seated
patriotic convictions, the product of
family, life and career. His father, Xi
Zhongxun, was a founder of the new
China and a leading reformer under
Deng Xiaoping. In 2006, when Xi Jin-
ping was party secretary of Zhejiang
Province, he told me about Chinese
pride and patriotism as motivating
China’s historic resurgence — words
remarkably similar to his recent pro-
nouncements.

So is Xiareformer? A nationalist?
The answer is that he is both, because
only by being a nationalist can he be a
reformer. American policy makers must
understand Xi’s nationalism so that
when the reigning superpower meets
the rising superpower, both can benefit.

as it May Increase Budget Deficit...

e Congressional Budget Office expects Reform to /ower the deficit by $143
billion during 2010-19
- Gross cost of $938 billion for expanded coverage, per CBO.
- Less: $511 billion in spending cuts from lower Medicare reimbursement rate + $420
billion in tax revenues (excl. excise tax) from higher payroll tax rates on high-income
families and indoor tanning services + $149 billion in penalty payments by

PPACA —

Verdict Is Still Out on Eventual Costs / Deficit Impact

e Issues With Official Cost Estimates to Consider
- Deficit neutral status somewhat reliant on future lawmakers’ willingness to implement Medicare
savings/reimbursement reductions:

e Reductions in payment rates for many types of Healthcare providers relative to the rates that
would have been paid under prior law (always a politically difficult decision).

e However the good news is that recommendations from the Independent Payment Advisory
Board focused on reducing growth in per capita Medicare spending if it exceeds target
automatically become the law without congressional intervention if Congress allows IPAB to
operate as planned.

- CBO estimates the effects of proposals as written: CBO acknowledges that it is unclear whether
reform can actually reduce the annual growth rate in Medicare spending from 4% (historical
average) to 2% for the next two decades, as PPACA estimates assume.

- Relies on excise taxes on sectors of the healthcare industry that could be passed through to
consumers via price increases.

- Starting in 2018, assumes taxation of high premium employment-based health insurance plans.

e Opportunities For Cost Savings to Consider
- Increased access to preventative care could potentially slow down overall healthcare cost growth.
Such potential effect is not captured in CBO scoring.

- Investments in information technology and new provider & consumer incentives can drive better
and more efficient care.

U.S. 501, 508 (1984) (citing Richmond Newspapers, 448 U.S. 569-71). For this reason, the
appellate briefs should be unsealed so that the public has the benefit of seeing the very
statements and arguments that formed the basis of this Court’s Decision. It is especially
important to provide a transparent view into these judicial proceedings because suspicions have
already been raised about how the District Attorney’s Office handled Epstein’s case.

When, as here, “issues of major public importance are involved, the interests of the
public as well as the press in access to court records ‘weigh heavily’ in favor of release.” Danco,
274 A.D.2d at 8, 711 N.Y.S.2d at 425 (citation omitted). This constitutional presumption of
open access to court records requires “the most compelling circumstances” to justify any
restriction upon that right. Jn re Application of Nat’l Broad. Co., 635 F.2d at 952. Here, it is
impossible to conceive of any circumstances that might justify wholesale sealing of relevant
court documents that are necessary to understand how prosecutors and this Court handled a
matter of such intense public concern.

The interest of Epstein’s victims to remain anonymous can be satisfied by directing the
District Attorney’s Office to redact the names of victims before disclosing the appellate briefs.
To be clear, the Post has no interest in identifying victims of sexual assault who wish to remain
anonymous. It does, however, have a right to know why the Manhattan District Attorney
abruptly changed position after initially arguing that Epstein should be treated leniently. The
District Attorney’s Office has indicated that it “would not oppose producing a copy of the
People’s brief ... keeping intact those portions of the brief that recount the procedural history of
the SORA hearing, the portion of the brief that is seemingly of interest to the Post.” Browning

state requires more than energy, brains, and celebrity. Dean Acheson
helped rebuild Europe after World War II. Henry Kissinger, who
acted like the secretary of state for Richard Nixon even before he got
the job, engineered the opening to China. But does anyone think
Colin Powell left State with a better reputation than he had before
becoming secretary? Madeleine Albright and Condoleezza Rice
broke the gender barrier and were competent enough, but left no
historic imprint. The State Department isn’t called “Foggy Bottom”
for nothing.

For any secretary of state, the prerequisite for success is a strong
relationship with the president. “He’s hard for her to connect with,”
admits one of her top people. “It’s hard for her to break through to
the more-than-polite level.” That isn’t meant to suggest chilliness or
dysfunction. “Is it Bush-Baker?” the aide continues, referring to the
relationship between the first President Bush and James Baker, who
was so tight with his boss that he felt obliged to resign as secretary of
state to run Bush’s ill-fated re-election campaign in 1992. “No. But
there’s a lot of mutual respect, and she feels like she’s always got a
shot with him.” Imagine how it feels to be a supplicant, looking for
her “shot” at impressing the president. It was only four years ago that
Hillary said her main opponent in the Democratic primaries was
“irresponsible and frankly naive” when he promised to meet with the
leaders of Iran, North Korea, and other rogue regimes without
preconditions during his first year in office. She hasn’t forgotten who
turned out to be right on that one.

One day I asked Hillary point-blank how she gets along with Obama,
with whom she meets a few times a week when neither is on the road.
She gave me a predictable answer, that her relationship is “not only
very good professionally but very warm personally.” Of course,
“warm” is just another term of art in Washington, where the advice to
anyone looking for a friend has long been to get a dog. When I ask

3. The President should presume that enactments are constitutional. There will be some occasions,
however, when a statute appears to conflict with the Constitution. In such cases, the President can and
should exercise his independent judgment to determine whether the statute is constitutional. In
reaching a conclusion, the President should give great deference to the fact that Congress passed the
statute and that Congress believed it was upholding ‘its obligation to enact constitutional legislation.
Where possible, the President should construe provisions to avoid constitutional problems.

4. The Supreme Court plays a special role in resolving disputes about the constitutionality of .
enactments. As a general matter, if the President believes that the Court would sustain a particular
provision as constitutional, the President should execute the statute, notwithstanding his own beliefs
about the constitutional issue. If, however, the President, exercising his independent judgment,
determines both that a provision would violate the Constitution and that it is probable that the Court
would agree with him, the President has the authority to decline to execute the statute.

5. | Where the President's independent constitutional judgment and his determination of the Court's
probable decision converge on a conclusion of unconstitutionality, the President must make a decision
about whether‘or not to comply with the provision. That decision is necessarily specific to context, and
it should be reached after careful weighing of the effect of compliance with the provision on the
constitutional rights of affected individuals and on the executive branch's constitutional authority. Also
relevant is the likelihood that compliance or non-compliance will permit judicial resolution of the
issue. That is, the President may base his decision to comply (or decline to comply) in part on a desire
to afford the Supreme Court an opportunity to review the constitutional judgment of the legislative
branch.

6. The President has enhanced responsibility to resist unconstitutional provisions that encroach upon
the constitutional powers of the Presidency. Where the President believes that an enactment
unconstitutionally limits his powers, he has the authority to defend his office and decline to abide by it,
unless he is convinced that the Court would disagree with his assessment. If the President does not
challenge such provisions (i.e., by refusing to execute them), there often will be no occasion for
judicial consideration of their constitutionality; a policy of consistent Presidential enforcement of
statutes limiting his power thus would deny the Supreme Court the opportunity to review the
limitations and thereby would allow for unconstitutional restrictions on the President's authority.

Some legislative encroachments on executive authority, however, will not be justiciable or are for
other reasons unlikely to be resolved in court. If resolution in the courts is unlikely and the President
cannot look to a judicial determination, he must shoulder the responsibility of protecting the
constitutional role of the presidency. This is usually true, for example, of provisions limiting the
President's authority as Commander in Chief. Where it is not possible to construe such provisions
constitutionally, the President has the authority to act on his understanding of the Constitution.

One example of a Presidential challenge to a statute encroaching upon his powers that did result in
litigation was Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926). In that case, President Wilson had defied a
statute that prevented him from removing postmasters without Senate approval; the Supreme Court
ultimately struck down the statute as an unconstitutional limitation on the President's removal power.
Myers is particularly instructive because, at the time President Wilson acted, there was no Supreme
Court precedent on point and the statute was not manifestly unconstitutional. In fact, the
constitutionality of restrictions on the President's authority to remove executive branch officials had
been debated since the passage of the Tenure of Office Act in 1867 over President Johnson's veto. The
closeness of the question was underscored by the fact that three Justices, including Justices Holmes and
Brandeis, dissented in Myers. Yet, despite the unsettled constitutionality of President Wilson's action,

‘no member of the Court in Myers suggested that Wilson overstepped his constitutional authority -- or

encompassing statutory victims’ bill of rights. 7! Victims' advocates sought to expand on the protections found in other
previously-enacted victims' rights statutes, including, notably, the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990. 7? That statute
had also included a bill of rights for crime victims, yet because of limited enforcement mechanisms, crime victims had been
unable to secure court protection of the rights listed in the statute. 73

The statute that Congress passed to solve these problems - the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2004 - gave victims the right to
participate in the [*66] system.” 7+ It extended broad rights to crime victims, including the right to be treated with fairness

25 and the reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the

and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy
Government in the case. 7° It also commanded that these rights must be afforded by the Justice Department and other
departments and agencies of the United States engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution of crime. 77 The CVRA
also contained specific enforcement mechanisms. The Act provided that rights can be asserted by the crime victim or the
crime victim's lawful representative, and the attorney for the Government ... ._ 28 The courts were also required under the Act

to ensure that the crime victim is afforded the rights given by the law. 7?

Congress appeared to have at least two goals in mind in passing the CVRA. The first was simply to ensure that crime victims
understood what was happening in the criminal justice process. This goal is apparent from the fact that the CVRA gives crime
victims rights to notification about various court hearings, as well as more general rights to confer with prosecutors and to be
treated with fairness. 7° The CVRA's Senate sponsors explained:

In case after case we found victims, and their families, were ignored, cast aside, and treated as non-participants in a critical
event in their lives. They were kept in the dark by prosecutors too busy to care enough, by judges focused on [defendants']
rights, and by a court system that simply did not have a place for them. 3!

In passing the CVRA, Congress sought to change the system's obliviousness to crime victims that often left crime victims and

their families victimized yet again. 3?

than 200 cannabis-related companies were traded on the OTC during this period, the data indicates
that very few raised meaningful capital.

1. Underenforcement Against Corruption

Crimes of corruption by state and local officials are a good example of harms that, at times, criminal justice systems have
unduly ignored. 34 Local police and prosecutors are not institutionally well-situated to pursue and evaluate those crimes. They
often have professional, if not personal, ties to other local officials, which heightens the risk of undue favoritism or judgments
that are otherwise not fully disinterested. That is the main reason [*855] that federal investigators and prosecutors have state

and local corruption in their portfolios. *°

2. Underenforcement Against Sexual Assault

Sexual assault offenses are another context in which underenforcement is now widely recognized, but the causes are different.

Rather than favoritism toward offenders, the problem seems to be bias against the type of offense, and, in varying degrees,
against the victims. Failures of police to rigorously pursue allegations of sexual assaults have been widely documented. %°
Among the explanations that advocates, attorneys and some scholars point to are the entrenched nature of long-recognized,
gender-driven biases by police against domestic violence or sexual assault claims and against individuals from particular
groups or under particular circumstances, especially against victims who are poor or are racial, ethnic or gender minorities. 37
One large-scale empirical study of why rape-kit evidence remained untested, for example, suggested that the explanation in part
was negative beliefs and stereotypes about victims, which adversely affected the quality of the investigation. 3° It bears
noting that much of this bias is understood to be subtle or unconscious patterns built on cultural norms, rather than conscious,
purposeful disfavor. 3? But when evidentiary records are incomplete or ambiguous, their effects are substantial.

[*856]
3. Underenforcement Against Police Excessive Uses of Force

Failures to prosecute in the wake of police shootings and other possibly excessive uses of force against civilians are scenarios
that raise suspicions of both bias against victims, many of whom are black men (and often criminal suspects, another disfavored

victims and defendants); Natapoff, supra note 28, at 1753; David Alan Sklansky, Police and Democracy, /03 Mich. L. Rev. 1699, 1822
(2005) (arguing that policing failures in some communities undercuts the egalitarian project of protecting all citizens from private
violence).

34 The point extends to private actors, especially organized crime, with ties to local officials.

35 See infra Part III.B.1. On local corruption, see generally, for example, Corruption and American Cities: Essays and Case Studies in Ethical
Accountability (Joaquin Jay Gonzalez III &? Roger L. Kemp eds., 2016) (discussing the role of corruption in American cities); James L.
Merriner, Grafters and Goo Goos: Corruption and Reform in Chicago, 1833-2003 (2004) (discussing the role of corruption in Chicago).

36 See Tuerkheimer, supra note 28, at 1292-99.

37, ACLU, Responses from the Field: Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, and Policing 40 (2015); see also Tuerkheimer, supra note 28, at
1292-99 (citing a range of studies to conclude that in many jurisdictions, the widespread perception that law enforcement officers will likely
not pursue allegations of rape [due to race, class or gender bias] is entirely accurate).

that important from the point of view of humanlike cognitive development. We suggest that
the key features of naive physics and folk psychology enumerated above can be mastered by an
AGI in BlocksNBeadsWorld in spite of its imitations, and that — together with an appropriate
AGI design — this probably suffices for creating an AGI with the inductive biases constituting
humanlike intelligence.

To drive this point home more thoroughly, consider three potential virtual world scenarios:

1. A world containing realistic fluid dynamics, where a child can pour water back and forth
between two cups of different shapes and sizes, to understand issues such as conservation
of volume

2. A world more like today’s Second Life, where fluids don’t really exist, and things like lakes
are simulated via very simple rules, and pouring stuff back and forth between cups doesn’t
happen unless it’s programmed into the cups in a very specialized way

3. A BlocksNBeadsWorld type world, where a child can pour masses of beads back and forth
between cups, but not masses of liquid

Our qualitative judgment is that Scenario 3 is going to allow a young AI to gain the same es-
sential insights as Scenario 1, whereas Scenario 2 is just too impoverished. I have explored dozens
of similar scenarios regarding different preschool tasks or cognitive development experiments,
and come to similar conclusions across the board. Thus, our current view is that something like
BlocksNBeadsWorld can serve as an adequate infrastructure for an AGI Preschool, supporting
the development of human-level, roughly human-like AGI.

And, if this view turns out to be incorrect, and BlocksNBeads World is revealed as inadequate,
then we will very likely still advocate the conceptual approach enunciated above as a guide for
designing virtual worlds for AGI. That is, we would suggest to explore the hypothetical failure
of BlocksNBeadsWorld via asking two questions:

1. Are there basic naive physics or folk psychology requirements that were missed in creating
the specifications, based on which the adequacy of BlocksNBeadsWorld was assessed?

2. Does BlocksNBeads World fail to sufficiently emulate the real world in respect to some of
the articulated naive physics or folk psychology requirements?

The answers to these questions would guide the improvement of the world or the design of a
better one.

Regarding the practical implementation of BlocksNBeadsWorld, it seems clear that this is
within the scope of modern game engine technology, however, it is not something that could be
encompassed within an existing game or world engine without significant additions; it would
require substantial custom engineering. There exist commodity and open-source physics en-
gines that efficiently carry out Newtonian mechanics calculations; while they might require
some tuning and extension to handle BlocksNBead World, the main issue would be achieving
adequate speed of physics calculation, which given current technology would need to be done
via modifying existing engines to appropriately distribute processing among multiple GPUs.

Finally, an additional avenue that merits mention is the use of BlocksNBeads physics in-
ternally within an AGI system, as part of an internal simulation world that allows it to make
“mind’s eye” estimative simulations of real or hypothetical physical situations. There seems no
reason that the same physics software libraries couldn’t be used both for the external virtual
world that the AGI’s body lives in, and for an internal simulation world that the AGI uses as
a cognitive tool. In fact, the BlocksNBeads library could be used as an internal cognitive tool
by AGI systems controlling physical robots as well. This might require more tuning of the bead

abuse. According to widely circulated press reports reviewed by Edwards, Brunel is in his
sixties and has a reputation throughout the world (and especially in the modeling industry) as a
cocaine addict that has for years molested children through modeling agencies while acting as
their agent — conduct that has been the subject of critical reports, books, several news articles,
and a 60 Minutes documentary on Brunel’s sexual exploitation of underage models. See
hitp://bradmillershero. blogspot.com/2010/08/women-are-objects.html, attached hereto as Exhibit
“FR.”

63. Edwards learned that Brunel is also someone that visited Epstein on
approximately 67 occasions while Epstein was in jail. See Epstein's jail visitor log attached as
Exhibit “GG.”

64. | Edwards learned that Brunel currently runs the modeling agency MC2, a company
for which Epstein provides financial support. See Message Pad's attached as Exhibit “J” supra
and Sworn Statement of MC2 employee Maritza Vasquez, June 15, 2010, “Maritza Vasquez
Sworn Statement” attached at Exhibit “HH” at 1-16.

65. Employees of MC2 told Edwards that Epstein’s numerous condos at 301 East 66
Street in New York were used to house young models. Edwards was told that MC2 modeling
agency, affiliated with Epstein and Brunel brought underage girls from all over the world,
promising them modeling contracts. Epstein and Brunel would then obtain a visa for these girls,
then would charge the underage girls rent, presumably to live as underage prostitutes in the
condos. See Maritza Vasquez Sworn Statement, Exhibit “HH” at 7-10, 12-15, 29-30, 39-41, 59-

By the end of November, I believed that the chances of a peace agreement with
Arafat were so microscopic as to border on non-existent, and that my own
prospects for retaining sufficient support to be an effective Prime Minister much
beyond Clinton’s departure were not much better. It was not just Arik and the
Likud, but other parties on the right that were actively attempting to bring down
the government. I was being squeezed politically: by opposition to the concessions,
especially on Jerusalem, I’d been willing to consider in pursuit of a peace
agreement, and by the ever-worsening Palestinian violence. Shlomo Ben-Ami put
it best, saying that in the view of most Israelis, “Arafat’s response to Camp David
was not peace, it was an intifada.”

By the second part of November, there were five separate motions of no-
confidence working their way through the Knesset. I could have quashed them all
at a single stroke, since Arik, both publicly and privately, was conveying to me his
continuing interest in joining a unity coalition. But I again decided against it, at
this stage not so much because I expected a peace deal, but because I believed
continued Israeli engagement in the peace process was essential to preventing
Arafat from evading his responsibility for making a deal impossible.

I could also have wrongfooted my opponents by insisting that any early election
be not just for a new Prime Minister but for a new Knesset, something very few
existing Knesset members were anxious to see happen. I did, in fact, do precisely
that at the end of November, delaying an immediate move to try to topple the
government. But I immediately regretted doing it. The game-playing side of
politics was the part I least understood, and most disliked. I recognized that to
bring down the Knesset along with me would be unfair to the country, not to
mention my own Labor Party, which still had the largest number of parliamentary
seats. In pursuing my peace efforts with Hafez al-Assad, and at Camp David, I'd
insisted I was acting on the mandate I’d received in the Prime Ministerial election.
If the peace efforts had failed, or if a significant part of the country felt I was
wrong to have tried in the way I did, surely the responsibility for that, too, should
fall on me.

I remained confident I had been right to make the efforts with Arafat, with
Assad, and, of course, to have followed through on my pledge to withdraw our
troops from Lebanon. But believing that you are night, even if later events might
bear you out, was not all that mattered in politics. You had to be able to bring the
public with you. It was clear my support was ebbing away. Looking ahead to the

I see the statement didn't go. Monday? Maybe tomorrow?

I will speak to Jeffery Epstein's lawyer but JE has a conflict with you and will want your silence as whilst you
are being attacked there is less heat on him.

Either is lying or not. If we let her lie without challenge then the lies become the reality and
that may lead to you facing investigation. These are serious allegations and In the UK prosecuting people who
face allegations of sex abuse is now common place and a lot of resources are focused on this.

We can't sit back and let you be a conspirator by silence.

Your are not guilty and must follow Dershowtiz line. He is a leading lawyer and he hasn't followed the don't say
anything for fear of litigation. He has rightly called Pe biutt and shouted his innocence.

You have to stand up and deny the allegations or be branded guilty by association and that may lead to other
investigations and worse.

I feel I am going around in circles.

I know what is right to do and that is to shout your innocence.
Try and get some rest. Call me tomorrow if you want anytime.
Speak to Deshowitz.

Don't allay yourself to JE as that is not the way to go.

incredibly generous with her time and her thoughts.

A Sugar Baby Leaves The Business

Previously on Role/Reboot, we ran an interview with my friend Olivia, a 25-year-old
graduate student who had just started having sex for money through a sugar baby”
website called SeekingArrangement.com. In the interview, Olivia covered a lot of topics.
She mentioned that she usually feels powerful in her relationships with her clients. As she
put it, When I show up, I don't feel like -- here is this rich, powerful person who is about
to bestow wealth upon me. I feel like -- here is this person who is a bit sad and lonely,
and maybe I can make their day better. Olivia also noted that her negotiations can be
delicate, because some men are quite squeamish while talking about money. And she
explained that she’s married -- but it was already an open relationship, and she doesn't see
having sex for money as different from the other kinds of sex that she and her husband
were already having with other people. To deal with it, they're sure to communicate
clearly. As Olivia said, We just have to talk about it.”

In the months since that interview, Olivia and I have hung out occasionally to talk about
her experience with sex work. She's traveled across the city to meet me, and often bought
me coffee; non-judgmental social support for sex workers can be rare, and I've seen more
of her since she started the job. Although she really enjoyed the work at first, there were
tough times too, especially after the novelty wore off. Recently, Olivia decided to stop
seeing clients. We talked it through and she gave me permission to write about it. (She
also reviewed this article pre-publication.)

Obviously, there were logistical complexities from the beginning. Taxes were a

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012881.txt,"There are many situations where taking a risk pays off, whether we think of stealth military
operations, chancy shots in the final seconds of a basketball game, or significant investments in an up and
coming stock option. Playing it safe pays off. But those who stick their necks out and take a chance, may
bring home significant gains. It is because of these competing strategies and potential payoffs that
evolutionary biologists have imagined that selection could maintain both personality types within a
population — a point noted earlier for the MAOA and glucose-related genes. If selection has worked in
this way, then there must be genetic variation that allows for both strategies. To date, the strongest
evidence comes from a family of genes associated with the regulation of dopamine, with the memorable
acronyms of DAT1, DRD2 and DRD4; each of these genes is associated with different forms, each form
associated with different levels of dopamine. Recall from chapter 2 that dopamine plays an essential role
in our experience of reward, including how motivated we are to get it and what we anticipate based on our
understanding of the situation — have we been rewarded in the past, how often, and how much? The idea
here is that those who carry genes that output a higher level of dopamine may weight rewards more
heavily and thus, show risk-blindness; for these individuals, the eye is on the prize, not the path or
obstacles to this prize.

Across a number of studies, results show that variation in the expression of these genes is
associated with high-risk, low self-control behaviors, including pathological gambling, substance abuse,
sensation seeking, and financial investments. For example, in two separate studies, individuals with
different variants of the DRD4 gene played a financial investment game involving real money. In one,
designed by Joan Chiao, subjects decided to invest in either a risky asset with variable returns or a riskless
asset with consistent returns. In the second study, the Swedish economist Ana Dreber and the American
anthropologist Corin Apicella allowed subjects to either walk away with an initial starting pot of money,
or to invest some of it ina risky asset. Those with the DRD4 variant that expresses higher levels of
dopamine were more likely to pursue the risky investment. What this work reveals is that part of the
variation we observe among people who make risky investments, drink too much alcohol, and gamble
with their income, is due to variation in the dopamine family of genes. These are hidden risks that come
to life thanks to molecular biologist’s microscope. What also comes to life is the fact that these same
genes are relevant to violence, causing some to strike out even though there are significant risks and
terrible consequences.

In several studies, using an American health data base of several thousand adolescents, results
consistently show a relationship between particular variants of the dopamine genes and violence. For
example, the sociologist Guang Guo examined the relationship between violent delinquency — involving
use of guns and knives — and variation in DRD2 and DAT1 among 2,5000 individuals ages 12-23 years.

DRD2 was of particular interest because medical records and clinical trials reveal that administering

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013547.txt,"the early studies by Professor Seymore Kety of Harvard and Dr. Harold Himwich of
the Thudicum Laboratory in Galesberg, Illinois, using measures of whole brain
oxygen and glucose utilization as indices of energy generation and utilization by the
brain, surprised many of us. They indicated that energy use by the whole brain was
relatively constant when states of relaxed awakeness, mathematical cognition and
deep sleep were compared. Of course, modern studies have indicated that relative
regional brain energy utilization is state dependent and may vary quite widely.

More spiritual aspects of energies and their transformations were made
clearer during several month visits to Baba Muktananda’s, now Gurumayi
Chidvilasananda’s, Sidha Yoga Ashrams. Baba Muktananda loved and worshipped
his Hindu Guru, Bhagawan Nityananda. Baba had been a restlessly wandering,
guru-hunting, young man. Nityananda said he had “wheels for feet.” After many
years of devoted meditation, chanting and service, sadhanna, all the while being
prohibited from eating mangos, his favorite food, his passive, taciturn, ecstatic guru,
Nityananda, presented voluble, energetic, joyful Baba with the guru’s rather
aromatic and worn sandals. This symbolically acknowledged Baba’s successful
absorption of the guru’s transforming spiritual energy, shaktipat, the power of his
enlightenment.

At Nityananda death, Baba, using world tours, spiritual fellowship meetings,
satsangs (public conversations) and spiritual training sessions called “intensives’”,
organized Ashrams in West Coast sites such as Oakland and Venice, and on the
East Coast, in South Fallsburg, New York, buying several old residence hotels in
the Borscht Belt. Baba was introduced to America by one of his first advance men,
Be Here Now Baba Ram Das, Timothy Leary’s co-investigator in the Harvard
Student LSD project when his name was Richard Alpert. ESTs Werner Erhard was
another of Baba’s advance men.

Baba discipled and disciplined a sister and brother who, when 18 and 11
respectively, were sent to live in his Ashram in Ganeshpuri India by their parents.
The girl was known as Malti when she served as a translator for Baba and
Gurumayi Chidvilasananda after receiving the energy of her enlightenment. The

younger brother was given the name of Baba’s guru, Nityananda. When Baba took

First meating: Prince Andrew puts his arms around 17-year-old Virginia, cantre

On one of those occasions Virginia Roberts was subsequently paid $15,000 (£9,400). Her shocking
account of her four years as Epstein’s personal masseuse is supported by court documents, an
eyewitness, photographs and flight details of Epstein’s private jets.

One picture, said to have been taken by Epstein during Andrew's first encounter with the girl in
March 2001 and published today by The Mail on Sunday, shows the Prince with his arm around her
waist.

This is not the first time the Duke of York’s judgment and choice of associates have been

questioned. He appears to relish the company of super-rich oil billionaires from the Middle East,
North Africa and the former Soviet Union.

The peculiar sale of his former marital home to a Kazakh businessman for £15 million after it had
languished unsold for five years at £12 million has never been satisfactorily explained.

In the recent leak of American diplomatic cables it was revealed that he had criticised an official
corruption investigation into the huge Al-Yamamah arms deal between Britain and Saudi Arabia,
while he is also said to be close to Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi, son of the beleaguered Libyan president,
and may have had a role in the early release of Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Al Megrahi.

While the effective tax rate of the S&P 500 is generally about 28% (currently closer to
25% due to the recent commodity recession), we estimate that the tax rate for the S&P
500’s domestic operations is much higher at roughly 33% — although this includes
state and local taxes. If all companies with tax rates above the proposed new tax rate of
20% were to drop to 20%, and no companies provisioned for US taxes on foreign
profits, we estimate the domestic effective tax rate for the S&P 500 would fall in line
with its foreign tax rate of roughly 19%. This would represent a 9ppt decrease in the
current S&P 500 tax rate and a 12% increase in EPS. We show the sensitivity to S&P
500 EPS to different assumed tax rates in the chart below, but we reiterate that these
estimates exaggerate the actual impact on profits, as a significant portion of these
benefits would likely be passed on to consumers via lower prices. We assume that in
aggregate, roughly half of the gains from the lower tax rate would be retained (i.e. half
of the amounts shown in the sensitivity analysis in Chart 2).

Note: Our base case assumes that half of the benefit would be passed on to customers, competed
away or offset by other changes to the tax code. Thus, we woulld expect the uplift to our EPS forecast
to be roughly half the calculated benefit from simply lowering the corporate tax rate.

The market is beginning to price in the benefits of tax cuts , but we may still be in the
early days — note that potential beneficiaries of fiscal stimulus (i.e. infrastructure
spending) have seen an 18% multiple re-rating but de minimis fundamental support,
whereas potential beneficiaries of lower corporate tax rates have seen performance
driven nearly equivalently by multiples and earnings.

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023098.txt,"cut the bit entirely from its cable recycling of the roast. But in the more than three years
since, I have often reflected upon Mr. Gottfried's mesmerizing performance. At a terrible
time it was an incongruous but welcome gift. He was inviting us to once again let loose.

I bring up that night now because I've seen The Aristocrats, a new documentary inspired
in part by Mr. Gottfried's strange triumph. Unveiled in January at Sundance, it's coming to
a theater near some of you this summer. (It could be the first movie to get an NC-17
rating for sex and nudity not depicted on screen.) But I also bring up that night for the
shadow it casts on a culture that is now caught in the vise of the government war against
indecency. The chill cast by that war is taking new casualties each day, and with each
one, the commissars of censorship are emboldened to extend their reach. When even the
expletives of our soldiers in Iraq are censored on a public television documentary, Mr.
Gottfried's unchecked indecency seems to belong to another age.

The latest scheme for broadening that censorship arrived the week after the Oscar show
was reduced to colorless piffle on network television. Ted Stevens, the powerful chairman
of the Senate Commerce Committee, pronounced himself sick of four-letter words with
participles on cable and satellite television. I think we have the same power to deal with
cable as over the air, he said, promising to carry the fight all the way to the Supreme
Court. Never mind that anyone can keep pay TV at bay by not purchasing it, and that any
parent who does subscribe can click on foolproof blocking devices to censor any channel.
Senator Stevens's point is to intimidate MTV, Comedy Central, the satellite radio
purveyors of Howard Stern and countless others from this moment on, whether he
ultimately succeeds in exerting seemingly unconstitutional power over them or not.

If you can see only one of the shows that he wants to banish or launder, let me
recommend the series that probably has more four-letter words, with or without
participles, than any in TV history. That would be Deadwood on HBO. Its linguistic gait
befits its chapter of American history, the story of a gold-rush mining camp in the Dakota
Territory of the late 1870's. Deadwood is the back story of a joke like The Aristocrats
and of everything else that is joyously vulgar in American culture and that our new
Puritans want to stamp out. It's the ur-text of Vegas and hip-hop and pulp fiction. It
captures with Boschian relish what freedom, by turns cruel and comic and exhilarating,
looked and sounded like at full throttle in frontier America before anyone got around to
building churches or a government.

Its creator is David Milch, a former Yale fraternity brother of George W. Bush and the
onetime protégé of Robert Penn Warren, whose 1946 novel All the King's Men upends
bowdlerized fairy tales about American politics just as Deadwood dismantles
Hollywood's old sanitized Westerns. As Mr. Milch says in an interview on the DVD of the
first Deadwood season: It's very well documented that the obscenity of the West was
striking, and that the obscenity of mining camps was unbelievable. There was a
tremendous energy to the language, he adds, but the reason this language never surfaced
in movie Westerns during the genre's heyday was the Hays production code. For some 30
years starting in 1934, Hollywood's self-censorship strictures kept even married couples in
separate beds on screen.

well aware of Jane Doe #3 when it was negotiating the NPA, as it listed her as a victim in the

the Court finds it unnecessary to strike the portion of the Rule 21 Motion related to her

Judge Aldrich immediately expressed skepticism about the reach of my argument, suggesting that
the Stanley decision wasn’t relevant to a movie theater. He told me about his grandmother who
“once went to a movie entitled Sur Les Troits de Paris. She thought it was a travelogue. She
didn’t after she got there of course...I heard about it.” I assured him that we had dealt with that
problem by providing a “prologue” that advises the audience who are admitted only before the
film begins what they are about to see:

“the story of a young girl who is trying to work out her relationships. There are a number
of scenes which show the young girl and her lover nude. Several scenes depict sexual
intercourse under various circumstances, some of them quite unusual. If you believe that
you would be offended or embarrassed by the showing of such scenes, you are invited at
this time to obtain a refund of your admission at the box office.”

As Judge Aldrich continued to press me about his grandmother’s sensibilities, I was reminded of
the old Jewish joke about the man with the broken watch who goes into a storefront window and
asks the man behind the counter to fix his watch. “I don’t fix watches. I perform circumcisions,”
the man replied. “Then why do you have clocks and watches in your window,” the customer
wondered. “What do you think I should put in my window?” the store owner responded.

I had that joke in my head when I offered the following argument to Judge Aldrich:

If a store were to open in Boston which was simply marked “Pornography Shop,” it had
nothing in the window, it had no advertising, it was a place where people like Stanley
could come and quietly and discreetly purchase their 8mm films, [I submit] that Stanley vs.
Georgia would proscribe prosecution of that seller. I submit that necessarily if there is this
right to exercise one’s freedom to read and see a film, there is necessarily the concomitant
right to purchase it. But the state has a great interest in making sure that the purchasing is
not done in a way that intrudes on sensibilities or intrudes on other legitimate interests.

The judges pressed me on whether obscene films, even when viewed in a restricted theater, could

cause viewers to go out and commit crimes such as rape. I responded that if that were true, it

would be just as likely—perhaps even more so—that a person watching such films alone in his
basement would be influenced in that manner. I argued that Stanley had implicitly rejected that
theory.

The questioning persisted, with Judge Julian wondering whether Judge Aldrich’s aunt was typical:
As a matter of common sense though, unless we are to be so gullible as to be incredibly
gullible, don’t the great vast majority of the people who go to a theater to see a film like
this know what they’re going to see?

MR. DERSHOWITZ: Precisely.

JUDGE JULIAN: So this prologue is a lot of nonsense, just a gesture to try to wipe out-----

Dershowitz asks the Court to modify the Confidentiality Order to allow Dershowitz to
use the transcript in ways necessary for his defense including sharing the transcript with any
counsel and other legal support, experts, consultants, insurers, and others typically permitted
access to supposedly confidential information in addition to using it with potential witnesses and
others as deemed necessary in the professional judgment of his counsel as set forth above.

Conduct, including its comments, regarding the handling of any information deemed by this
Court to be confidential within the limitations of the applicable rules.

it. ALLOWING DERSHOWITZ TO USE THE DEPOSITION FOR THE LIMITED
PURPOSES OF HIS DEFENSE IS REQUIRED BY FLORIDA LAW.

Florida law requires that any sealing order be the least restrictive means necessary to
accomplish its purpose. The Florida Supreme Court held in Barron v. Florida Freedom
Newspapers, 531 So. 2d 113 (Fla. 1988), that a sealing order can be entered only where “no
reasonable alternative is available to accomplish the desired result, and, if none exists, the trial
court must use the least restrictive closure necessary to accomplish its purpose.” Jd. at 118
(emphasis added); see also Carter v. Conde Nast Publ’ns, 983 So. 2d 23, 26 (Fla. 5th DCA
2008) (“an order sealing court records must state, inter alia, the particular grounds for making the
court records confidential, that the closure is no broader than necessary, and that there are no less
restrictive measures available.”).

This Court has not set forth any reasons addressing a request by Roberts to seal her
deposition transcript, much less determined that “no reasonable alternative is available” to

accomplish Roberts’s desired result. See News-Press Publ’g Co. v. State, 345 So. 2d 865, 867

Housing / Property

As the supply of housing has increased in the last two decades, homeownership rates have also
increased, although only slightly. Rates increased 1.9 percentage points between 2000 and 2010, and
increased an additional 3.8 percentage points from 2010 to 2012. Average home prices dropped by
11.8 percent in 2008, but then increased in 2009 and 2010 by 4 percent and 12.3 percent,
respectively. In 2012, average home prices fell 17.4% and then rebounded in 2013 with an increase of
22.1%. The average sales price in 2013 was $538,369. Presumably, much of the increased supply of
new homes and condominiums has gone to non-residents and vacationers. Over the past decade,
housing costs have accelerated at a far greater pace than resident incomes, putting home ownership
beyond the reach of all but a few relatively wealthy islanders.

In 2013, St. Thomas and St. John had an average home sale price of $713,183, while the average home
sale price in St. Croix was $306,083. While prices have not caught up with what they were in 2007, St.
Thomas and St. John have seen some recovery in the overall housing market. St. Croix, however,
continues to suffer from the closing of the Hovensa refinery. In 2014, the average single family home
sales price in St. Croix was $334,167, while in St. Thomas it was $909,839. 2015 year to date averages
are show an increase in average single family home price in St. Croix and a decrease in St. Thomas and
St. John, with averages of $414,178 and $759,811 respectively.

for it. My charts and tables show that this has been true wherever and whenever
tested, in eight economies over 40 to 140 years. We crowd our niches like other
creatures, I think, and have no room for growth except as innovation widens the
niche. The charts and tables seem to tell us that innovation costs no more in failure

rates and learning curves that daily coping does.

Macroeconomics and Keynes

Macro emerged in the 1930s under the influence of Keynes. Simon Kuznets, the chief
architect of the U.S. national accounts, was one of the five economists Keynes invited
to proof the chapters of his General Theory as he wrote them’. National accounts

were soon reorganized along Keynesian lines.

To read the General Theory, a beautiful work, one would think that counter opinions
were led by his close friend Arthur Pigou. But Pigou was already in print with
recommendations much like Keynes’ when it was published in 1936. Opposition
came rather from Mises, the other Austrians, Lionel Robbins and the Chicago school.
They argued that intervention tends to make things worse. So do many economists
today. Keynes believed in fiscal and monetary policy as I describe in Chapter 1. He

favored fiscal policy.

Chapter 2 said that he made a basic distinction between investment producing new
things and repurchase of things already produced. Only the first counted as real
investment. The difference matters because only the first puts plant and people to
work. Transfers neither add nor subtract value. Even so, my own language counts all
as investment, and ranks investment only by return. I make no distinction among
investment adding new plant and equipment, or investment in stocks and bonds

already issued, or in existing structures, or even under the mattress.

generally holding.

But fundamentally, Arik’s war plan was not a response to the Katyushas. It
was a way of using military force to achieve Prime Minister Begin’s political
aim: stopping the Camp David peace process in its tracks, and ensuring it did
not go beyond the peace treaty with Egypt. And even that message was not
principally intended for the Palestinians, I suspect, but for the Americans.
Israel’s Labor-led governments had always calculated that we needed at least
some measure of support from foreign allies, especially the US. Under Begin,
we'd already bombed Saddam Hussein’s nuclear reactor without telling the
Americans beforehand. Shortly after I returned to the kirya, he provoked further
anger in Washington by announcing the de facto annexation of the Golan — in
effect “balancing” our Sinai withdrawal with a dramatic reassertion of Israeli
control over other land captured in the 1967 war. Part of Arik’s plan in Lebanon
was to deliver an even more forceful riposte to any suggestion that we would
give up control of the West Bank and Gaza.

Yet these political aims, which I was gradually beginning to grasp in their
full form through my discussions with Arik, were only part of the reason I was
deeply uneasy about the plans for our Lebanon invasion. Having now spent
nearly two decades in the military, I recognized that the security challenge north
of the border was real. I did not believe it was inherently wrong for Begin’s
government to order a pre-emptive military operation with the aim of ending it.
My view, as an army officer, was that the decision on how, when and whether
to go to war was for our elected government. But for that principle to work, I
also believed that government ministers had to know what they were deciding.
The more we geared up for an invasion, the less certain I became that Begin’s
cabinet understood what we were planning to do.

Arik’s original plan was codenamed Oranim: Hebrew for “pine trees”. It
involved pushing deep into Lebanon, all the way up to the strategically critical
road that ran between Beirut and Damascus. We would link up in Beirut with
the main Maronite Christian force, the Phalangists, whom we had been
supporting and training for several years. When that plan was presented to
Begin’s cabinet at the end of 1981, however, most ministers opposed it. Thus
was born Arik’s Plan B, so-called “Little Pines”. Its stated aim was a lot more
modest. We would create a “security zone” — a 40-kilometer, or 25-mile, strip
running north of the border with Lebanon.

lraq’s seizure of Kuwait in 1990. China's claim of
ownership of the South China Sea, along with its
creeping militarization of previously uninhabited
islets, is at least as ambitious as Russia's move,
though the impact is perhaps less jolting given
the dearth of occupied populations.

There have been other reversions to 20th-centu-
ry methods of repression. For example:

Political prisoners: During the 20th century,
opposition figures, political dissidents, advocates
for minority groups, and people who wrote critical
commentaries were regularly sentenced to prison
terms, often under grim conditions, by dicta-
torships of all stripes. Amnesty International's
founding mission was the defense of what were
called “prisoners of conscience,” and they ranged
from dissidents and Jewish refuseniks in the So-
viet Union to those who resisted right-wing juntas
in Latin America. Soviet dissidents like Natan
Sharansky and Vladimir Bukovsky were the focus
of international campaigns organized by human
rights organizations and cautiously embraced by
the United States and other governments.

The ranks of political prisoners declined sub-
stantially after the end of the Cold War and the
collapse of dictatorships in Latin America, Asia,
and to acertain extent Africa. Indeed, it was a
major objective of the new authoritarianism to
maintain political control without shedding blood
or putting people behind bars, actions that pro-
voked condemnation by human rights advocates,
democratic governments, and UN entities.

Recently, however, the political prisoner has
made a comeback. One notably egregious
offender is Azerbaijan. Under President Ilham
Aliyev, this country of just 9.4 million people has
amassed one of the world's largest numbers of
political prisoners per capita, with approximately
80 prisoners of conscience during 2015, accord-
ing to verified figures. Azerbaijan's repression
has grown despite the fact that Aliyev already
enjoyed near-total control of key institutions and
distinctly gentle treatment from U.S. and Euro-
pean political leaders due to Azerbaijan's role as
an alternative to Russian energy exports.

Venezuela also has a substantial number of
political prisoners—around 100 as of June 2016,
according to credible sources, including promi-

nent members of the political opposition.? Under
President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, some estimates
suggest that Egypt holds as many as 60,000 polit-
ical prisoners.’ Turkish authorities have similarly
rounded up tens of thousands of people in the
wake of the July 2016 coup attempt. A much
smaller country, Bahrain, has convicted hundreds
of people of political crimes since 2011, when the
monarchy began arresting members of the polit-
ical opposition who were demanding democratic
elections and other freedoms.’

China is in a class by itself. Since the 1989
crackdown on prodemocracy protests in Tian-
anmen Square, the Communist Party leadership
has regularly jailed political dissidents, espe-
cially those who argued publicly for democratic
political changes or made gestures toward the
formation of opposition political parties. The
most notable political prisoner is Liu Xiaobo, the
Nobel Peace Prize winner who was sentenced to
11 years in prison in 2009. However, conditions
have grown far worse under President Xi Jinping,
as a numbing procession of lawyers, journalists,
bloggers, women's advocates, minority rights
campaigners, and religious believers have been
detained, placed under house arrest, disap-
peared, or sentenced to prison.>

Public confessions: Humiliating public con-
fessions of ideological crimes were a staple of
Soviet leader Joseph Stalin's purges and Mao
Zedong’s Cultural Revolution in China. They
were also employed by Eastern European sat-
ellite regimes during the show trials of the late
1940s. A peculiarly communist technique, the
public confession was largely abandoned after
the deaths of Stalin and Mao.

Under Xi, China has revived the practice. A grow-
ing list of editors, human rights lawyers, and advo-
cates of political reform have been coerced into
making televised confessions of their “crimes.”
The Chinese authorities even intimidated a Swed-
ish citizen, legal reform activist Peter Dahlin, into
confessing that he broke Chinese law and “hurt
the feelings of the Chinese people.” Dahlin was
accused of endangering state security by funding
human rights lawyers and compiling reports on
the state of human rights in China.®

alternatives, and finally decided on an explanation, and then perhaps
you tested that explanation another time. A self-generated explana-
tion is a hypothesis, and hypotheses that we have come up with our-
selves serve as the basis for learning. We tend to remember what we
ourselves have said and thought more than we remember the words
of others,

Rule #7: Help students come up with their own explanations
when they have made a mistake.

Here is the next one.

Mistake #8: Thinking that a student remembers what you just
taught him

I can’t tell you how many times I have said X in a lecture or dis-
cussion only to be asked why I believed not X. Why does this happen?
People really don’t listen. They are not being annoying. They really
can’t easily listen. There is so much going on in their own heads while
you are talking that it is remarkable they hear anything of what any-
one says to them. Teachers live in a world where students are worried
about the perceptions of their friends, events at home, and a million
other things that have nothing to do with what a teacher is saying. A
teacher simply cannot assume that a student will remember what he
was just told. In any case, a teacher shouldn't necessarily be telling
students the truth.

How could telling a student the truth be a bad idea? When tell-
ing is about facts, it is certainly a fine idea. But remember, I do not
think that it is the job of a teacher to tell students facts. A teacher’s
primary responsibility is to get students to understand the world bet-
ter and to help enhance their capabilities. Neither of these things hap-
pens through a teacher telling a student anything. Comprehension is
an internal affair, arrived at by thinking. Ability comes from practice.
Neither comes from a teacher. What a teacher can do is to encourage
students to take on more and thus enhance their capabilities, or think
more and thus enhance their comprehension. This means that telling
a student a fact that he needs just makes it all too simple. Figuring out
what you need is the real issue. Confirming what a student has dis-
covered is a fine idea, but even that isn’t always a matter of telling the
student the truth. A Socratic teacher might deny what he knows is true

generally would be required to withhold and remit to the U.S. government a percentage of the
Fund’s net income and gains that are both effectively connected with that trade or business and
allocated to Non-U.S. Partners, and would be liable for interest and penalties with respect to
amounts which were not so withheld. The relevant withholding percentage is the maximum
U.S. federal income tax rate for individuals or corporations, as applicable. In addition, Non-U.S.
Partners generally would be required to file U.S. federal income tax returns and pay tax in
respect of their shares of the Fund’s effectively connected income including capital gains, but
would be allowed a credit against U.S. federal income tax liability for amounts withheld by the
Fund on their behalf. Non-U.S. Partners which are non-U.S. corporations might also be subject
to a “branch profits” tax on certain earnings of the Fund deemed to have been repatriated to
those Partners.

Treatment of Interest and Dividends from U.S. Sources - Certain categories of investment
income from U.S. sources realized by the Fund, such as dividends and interest, generally will be
subject to U.S. income tax withholding, at a 30% rate on the gross amount of that income, when
included in the distributive shares of Non-U.S. Partners. A Non-U.S. Partner whose distributive
share of such income is subject to U.S. withholding tax may be able to claim an exemption or a
reduced rate of withholding under a tax treaty or convention between the U.S. and that
Partner's country of residence by providing appropriate documentation regarding that
Partner’s residence for tax purposes and its satisfaction of any conditions imposed by the treaty.
A Non-U.S. Partner resident in a jurisdiction with which the U.S. has a tax treaty, however, will
not be entitled to the benefits of that treaty with respect to that Non-U.S. Partner’s distributive
share of the Fund’s income and gains unless the Fund is treated as fiscally transparent under
the law of that non-US. jurisdiction and certain other conditions are satisfied. Finally, in order
to claim the benefits of a tax treaty to reduce U.S. withholding tax on U.S.-source interest and
dividends paid by corporations that are not actively traded, a Non-U.S. Partner — and any
direct or indirect equity owner of a Non-U.S. Partner seeking treaty benefits for itself because
the Non-U.S. Partner is considered fiscally transparent in that equity owner’s jurisdiction —
generally will be required to obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number from the IRS and may
be required to provide that number and certain other documentation to the Fund. Other
exemptions may be available for certain types of interest income.

Treatment of the Fund’s Capital Gains from U.S. Sources - Under current U.S. law, in general,
capital gains attributable to sales by the Fund of the securities of U.S. corporations will not be
subject to U.S. federal income taxation or tax withholding when allocated to a Non-U.5. Partner
unless that Partner is an individual who is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more during the
taxable year in which such gains are realized and certain other conditions are satisfied.

This general rule does not apply to gains attributable to a U.S. trade or business or gains
attributable to dispositions of securities of any “United States real property holding
corporation” (“USRPHC”), defined in Section 897 of the Code as, in general, a company with
50% or more of the fair market value of its business assets consisting of interests in U.S. real

U.S. corporation that is a USRPHC (other than debt securities with no equity component) may

* America’s government has grown dramatically - USA Inc.’s revenue as percent of
GDP has risen from 2% to 15%. Individual / social insurance (Social Security +
Medicare) taxes have risen dramatically while customs / excise / estate taxes
have declined in relative importance. In addition, USA Inc.’s spending as percent
of GDP has risen to 24% in 2010, up from 3% average between 1790 and 1930.

¢ USA Inc.’s average operating income was at or near breakeven for most of the
periods from 1910 to 1970.

In the 1970s, as healthcare expenses (related to Medicare and Medicaid) began
to surge, USA Inc. reported more frequent — and bigger — losses. Since 1970,
USA Inc. showed a profit just 4 times (F1998-F2001, when economic growth was
especially robust and defense spending was relatively low).

¢ General expense trends since 1970: non-defense discretionary spending has
been flattish (except in recessions with material one-time charges), healthcare
spending (largely Medicare + Medicaid) has risen materially, Social Security
spending has been flattish, defense spending has been down to flattish, and
interest payments varied with interest rates.

Operations of USA Inc. Are Solid,

Excluding Medicare / Medicaid and One-Time Charges

Revenues of USA Inc. (largely from individual and corporate income and
payroll taxes) can fund most expenses (largely spending on defense,
Social Security, unemployment insurance, education, law enforcement,
transportation, energy, infrastructure, federal employee & veteran
benefits, and interest payments).

In fact, for USA Inc.'s operations besides Medicare / Medicaid and
one-time expenses, there’s ample scope to increase spending for
defense, education, law enforcement, transportation, infrastructure
and energy by ~4%* in aggregate and still remain break-even.

Note: *Excluding Medicare / Medicaid revenue & expenses, USA Inc.’s expenses are, on average, 4% below revenue levels

As long as the customers keep coming, as long as people will do
anything to get their kids into Yale, Yale will not have to change. Now
bear in mind that going to Yale isn’t such a bad experience. This is
not my point. But Yale’s attitude (and every other top university’s at-
titude) toward what those universities are inherently about is seriously
harming the education of every high school student and almost every
college student in the country. Yale doesn’t know that it is doing this.

The faculty of Yale didn’t wake up one morning and think that
destroying the American education system would be a good idea. They
never think that subject-based education is a bad thing. They are pro-
fessors of subjects, after all. It makes sense to them.

Most of the Yale faculty doesn’t think for even a minute about
the U.S. high school system, or the community college system, or the
thousands of other colleges in the United States. Yale professors are
thinking about their research, ideas, and projects. Yale administrators
are thinking about making Yale work better and about money and
prestige issues. They are not thinking that the subject-based education
that is the basis of the university structure has filtered down to high
school for no good reason. They think that there is a good reason: to
prepare high school students for college, namely to make the profes-
sors’ lives easier when the students arrive at college.

They do not know they are killing education with their subject ori-
entation. But they are, just as surely as if they had a plan to do so and
were working on it on a daily basis. And, the parents who just must
send their kids to Yale are regularly giving them the power to continue
doing just that.

People who do not live and work within the confines of a great
university imagine that professors are basically teachers, like high
school teachers but more intellectual. They do not understand the col-
lective mindset at a place like Yale, a mindset that the Yale faculty, for
the most part, is perfectly happy with. They do not understand why
asking what I taught was a funny question. They do not readily get, if
teaching isn’t a professor’s main concern, what exactly his concerns
would be.

To explain all this requires looking at the life of a typical Yale fac-
ulty member and beginning to understand the world in which he
lives. We must begin by understanding the aims of the university it-
self. Universities are employers, after all, and professors, like any other
employee, worry about what their boss thinks of them. Curiously,

Lost National Initiative. Effective efforts to combat trafficking must mobilize the expertise of
HAS, DHS, and DOJ.

DOJ also notes a misspelling in the new subsection (F)(ii)— “edibility” instead of
“eligibility”.

16. Section 214

Section 214 of the bill authorizes the Attorney General to make grants to assist victims of
severe forms of trafficking up to $2.5 million in 2008, increasing to $15 million in 2011. The
Department of Justice already has authority to make grants for the provision of services for crime
victims and does so at a level in excess of $250 million a year. Also, the authorization of yet
another grant program runs counter to the Administration’s proposal in the 2008 Budget to
consolidate DOJ’s more than 70 grant programs,

Moreover, any provision purporting to expand or alter definitions of individuals of
qualifying for victim benefits must include the requirement that a Federal law enforcement agent
must declare the individual to be a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons, and that the
victim agree to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution, or that the victim be under the age
of 18,

DOJ opposes the consultation requirement in subsection (a}(1) with the Secretary of State
for establishing programs to serve domestic, U.S. citizen trafficking victims. Such domestic
authority falls outside of the mission and expertise of the Department of State. DOJ also opposes
the mandatory consultation with non-government organizations (NGOs) regarding the provision
of services, This creates a conflict of interest since many of the NGOs will apply for and could
receive grants under the program. Finally, any section regarding the provision of victim services
must also contain language that includes organizations that provide services to “juveniles
subjected to trafficking, as defined in section 203(g) of the Trafficking Victims Protection
Reauthorization Act of 2005,” which would ensure that the funds authorized to the Attorney
General for establishment of grants will go toward the work and development of the Innocence
Lost Task Forces.

DOJ opposes subsection (b) because it provides Victims of Crime Act of 1984 funds to
prostitutes implicated in violations of the Mann Act (criminalizing transportation of prostitutes in
interstate commerce), Such persons do not meet the legal definition of “victim” as that term is
defined in the law, unless the person prostituted is under the age of 18 at the time the crime was
committed or the petson, through the application of another Federal statute or regulation,
satisfies the legal definition of a victim. Such persons are already eligibie under the Crime
Victims Fund Act to receive benefits.

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024085.txt,"for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The following discussion is based on the assumption that
the Fund will not be treated as a “publicly traded partnership.”

Treatment of U.S. Partners and Non-US. Partners - The discussion below addresses separately
certain U.S. federal income tax matters relevant to U.S. Partners and Non-U.S. Partners. For
purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. person” generally means any U.S. citizen or resident
individual, any corporation, limited liability company, or partnership organized under U.S. law,
any estate (other than an estate the income of which, from sources outside the U.S. that is not
effectively connected with a trade or business within the U.S., is not includible in its gross
income for U.S. federal income tax purposes), and any trust if a court within the U.S. is able to
exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons
have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust. The term “U.S. Partner”
means any partner that is a U.S. person and, unless the context otherwise requires, includes any
U.S. person that holds an equity interest in the Fund through one or more partnerships or other
entities treated as transparent for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The term “Non-U.S.
Partner” means a Partner that is not a U.S. person.

Taxation of Fund Operations Generally - As a partnership, the Fund will not pay U.S. federal
income taxes, but each U.S. Partner will be required to report that Partner’s distributive share
(whether or not distributed) of the Fund’s income, gains, losses, deductions and credits of the
character specified in Section 702 of the Code. It is possible that the U.S. Partners could incur
U.S. federal income tax liabilities without receiving from the Fund sufficient distributions to
defray such tax liabilities. The Fund’s taxable year will be the calendar year, or such other
period as required by the Code. Tax information will be delivered to all Partners on an annual
basis to enable the Partners to complete their tax returns.

Election to Adjust Basis of Fund Assets - Under the principal agreements relating to the Fund
and Section 754 of the Code, the General Partner will have the authority to elect to adjust the
basis of the Fund’s assets (commonly referred to as “Section 754 adjustments”) in connection
with certain distributions made by the Fund to Partners or certain transfers of Limited Partner
Interests in the Fund. Although the General Partner has no present intention of making an
election on behalf of the Fund under Section 754 of the Code, Section 754 adjustments may
nevertheless be mandatory under certain circumstances and could affect the amount of a
Partner’s allocations (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) of gain or loss recognized by the
Fund on a disposition of its assets.

The General Partner also will have the authority under the principal agreements relating to the
Fund to elect to treat the Fund as an “electing investment partnership” and, as a result,
potentially avoid making Section 754 adjustments that otherwise would be mandatory with
respect to certain transfers of Limited Partner Interests in the Fund. Such election, however,
may result in the disallowance (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) of certain losses allocated
by the Fund to transferees of Limited Partner Interests in the Fund. It is possible, however, that
the Fund will not be able to qualify as an electing investment partnership.

The General Partner will have the authority to require any Partner engaging in a transaction
that requires a Section 754 adjustment (for example, a transfer of the Partner’s Limited Partner

Interest) to bear the ongoing administrative and other costs incurred by the Fund or its Partners
in connection with these basis adjustment rules. These costs, which could be significant, may be

(and hopeful) to expose students to the massive gaps in our understanding. They may 
find a firmer-and possibly a radically different-scientific theory. The basis upon 
which we as scientists are relying is so shaky that we must openly state the situation 
for what it is: it is a mystery.

Thomas L. Friedman

May 28, 201 1—Cairo -- I had some time to kill at the Cairo airport
the other day so I rummaged through the “Egyptian Treasures” shop.
I didn’t care much for the King Tut paper weights and ashtrays but
was intrigued by a stuffed camel, which, if you squeezed its hump,
emitted a camel honk. When I turned it over to see where it was
manufactured, it read: “Made in China.” Now that they have decided
to put former President Hosni Mubarak on trial, I hope Egyptians add
to his indictment that he presided for 30 years over a country where
nearly half the population lives on $2 day and 20 percent are
unemployed while it is importing low-wage manufactured goods — a
stuffed camel, no less — from China.

That’s an embarrassment for Mubarak and America, which has
donated some $30 billion in aid to modernize Egypt’s economy over
the last 30 years — and President Obama just promised a couple
billion more. Egypt’s economy has nose-dived since the uprising, and
the new government really does need the money to stay afloat. But I
only hope that Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
understand that right now — right this second — Egypt needs
something more from Washington than money: quiet, behind-the-
scenes engagement with Egypt’s ruling generals over how to
complete the transition to democracy here.

Here’s why. After the ouster of Mubarak in February, his presidential
powers were shifted to a military council, led by the defense minister.
It’s an odd situation, or as the Egyptian novelist Alaa Al Aswany,
author of “The Yacoubian Building,” put it to me: “We have had a
revolution here that succeeded — but is not in power. So the goals of

battalion commander was asking us for permission to open fire.

“Do not open fire,” I was saying as Yanoush arrived. “I repeat: do not open
fire.” When Yanoush asked me what was going on, I told him the lead unit had
reported unknown vehicles with missiles and wanted to know whether it could
attack. “Tell them yes,” Yanoush said. I looked first at him, then at Mitzna. “We
can’t,” I said. “It’s dark. The situation is confused. We don’t know whose
missiles these are. It doesn’t make sense they’d be Syrian, just sitting there,
pointed north. At least give it a few minutes.” I think Yanoush would have
grabbed the microphone and told the unit to fire had not Amram been there as
well. Together, we convinced him to hold off. I ordered the brigade commander
to get one of the battalion’s APC crews to go out on foot and get as near as
possible to the missiles. It was nearly 15 minutes later when they returned. They
said they’d never seen this kind of missile vehicle, but that the soldiers manning
them seemed to be speaking Hebrew. It turned out to be a new ground-to-
ground missile, not yet formally in service, which had been sent into Lebanon
without our knowledge by the northern command.

While that trouble was averted, much worse lay ahead. Yanoush asked to be
brought up to date on our progress in taking control of the area around the
Tovlano Triangle. We briefed him on the situation as we understood it: that
Rifkind had reported the triangle was clear, but that the second brigade had still
not reached it. Yanoush tried to radio the divisional commanders. When he
couldn’t raise them, he ordered the brigade and battalion commanders to pick
up their pace and move forward.

With Yanoush back and the advance resumed, I tried to grab at least a few
hours’ sleep. But around 3:45 am, a junior officer shook me awake. When I
rejoined Yanoush and Amram, they told me the lead battalion was now in deep
trouble. It was led by Ira Ephron, one of Dan Shomron’s best company
commanders during the 1973 war. For reasons I’ve never been able to establish,
Ira’s orders were not to take the hills south of the triangle as we’d planned, but
to go through it to a point two miles or so north. Minutes after crossing the
triangle, his tanks came under heavy fire. Hoping to escape, he kept going, only
to find himself surrounded by a Syrian armored force. They were trapped near a
village called Sultan Yacoub, nearly three miles north of Tovlano. Since it was
early June, it would be light soon, and his predicament could only get worse.

At dawn, he reported he was under heavy artillery, anti-tank missile, RPG
and close-range rifle fire. The only realistic hope was to retreat. We were unable

7. The rewriting of history will become more wide-
spread and will greatly complicate societal ef-
forts to confront both past and present political
abuses. The rehabilitation of Joseph Stalin and
the airbrushing of Mao Zedong’s destructive
reign serve to facilitate an authoritarian form of
nationalism in which strength and unity super-
sede justice and freedom, and the state is exalt-
ed at the expense of individual human beings.

8. Authoritarian or illiberal forces are more likely to
gain supremacy in countries where the parties
that represent liberal democracy do not simply
lose elections, but experience a full-blown political
collapse, whether through corruption, ineptitude,
or failure to build lasting bonds with the public. In
the end, elections do matter, and real change still
requires victory at the polls. This is why robust,
self-confident, and uncorrupted opposition par-
ties are essential to democracy’s survival.

Recommendations

In studies of this kind, recommendations are primarily
addressed to policymakers, particularly in the admin-
istration and Congress of the United States. Given
the election of Donald Trump, however, a different
approach is called for.

Trump has made clear again and again his admiration
for Vladimir Putin, to the point of asserting a kind of
moral equivalency between the Russian and American
governments. Since he assumed office, Trump and
certain aides have encouraged in America the kind of
“oost-truth” environment that has prevailed in Russia
under Putin. The new president has shown no interest
in an American role in promoting human rights and
democracy around the world; indeed, he seemed to
dismiss this core element of U.S. foreign policy in

his initial address to Congress, instead emphasizing
“harmony and stability and “the sovereign rights of all
nations.” Under these circumstances, to rely first and
foremost on the U.S. government to meet the chal-
lenge posed by Russia, China, and other authoritarian
states would amount to an exercise in futility.

The role of governments, both in the United States
and Europe, will remain crucial. But the threat posed
by modern authoritarianism has spread well beyond
its original proving grounds. To some extent, the prob-
lems discussed in this report have already infected
the United States and a number of European coun-
tries. They represent a menace to the media, academ-
ic freedom, civil society, electoral systems, and the

rule of law. They even put in jeopardy the integrity of
the facts and figures that an accountable government
and a successful economy require. When the values
of the political leadership are seen to waver, indepen-
dent, nongovernmental voices and institutions will

be called upon to do their part—not just to defend
democracy at home, but to convince skeptical politi-
cians and citizens that supporting the same struggle
abroad serves the public interest.

To the U.S. government: We urge the Trump adminis-
tration to appoint a director of global communications
who is experienced in journalism and allow that per-
son to build a program to counter hostile authoritari-
an messaging through up-to-date delivery techniques,
honest reporting, and forthright commentary. Near
the end of 2016, Congress passed legislation that
placed the country’s government-supported interna-
tional media outlets—Voice of America (VOA), Radio
Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), and their sister
services focused on Asia and other regions—under
more direct presidential control, on the theory that a
commander-in-chief who was committed to counter-
ing aggressive Russian influence would be better able
to develop and implement new strategies. President
Trump has yet to indicate how he intends to use this
authority.

In the contest against Soviet communism, America’s
international broadcasting entities were the crown
jewels of U.S. soft power. Indeed, in some countries,
such as Poland or Romania, Radio Free Europe
functioned as the opposition press, and clearly had

a greater audience and more influence than the
censored government press. In the post-Cold War
period, what were initially shortwave radio services
have evolved into modern media outlets, with video
content, podcasts, blogs, social media engagement,
and other forms of information delivery. Nevertheless,
the United States today needs to update the strategy
and operations of its publicly supported broadcast-
ers and—most importantly—provide them with the
resources to compete with a Russian propaganda
machine that is nimble, attuned to popular discontent,
and generously funded.

To the independent media: The mainstream press
in the United States has recently shown increased
interest in reporting on Russian methods of infor-
mation warfare, some of which have been embraced
by far-right media outlets that seek to undermine
popular support for the core institutions of Ameri-
can democracy. We urge more responsible media to

competitive devaluation, which risks a
new protectionism. Currency
manipulation could become a danger
that reaches far beyond the debate about
Chinese policies. The world economy
will need at some point to withdraw the
drug of cheap money and negative real
interest rates. The U.S. should anticipate
these dangers.

The International Monetary Fund also
could help set standards about exchange-
rate policies and serve as a referee that
blows a whistle, even if it cannot
penalize. The IMF and the World Trade
Organization should anticipate this risk
and give effect to the existing WTO
agreement that economies must avoid
manipulating exchange rates . . . to gain
an unfair competitive advantage.

Third, the U.S. needs to break the logjam
on opening markets. As the leading world
economy, America should initially try to
strengthen and increase international
trade through the WTO. As my
colleagues at the Peterson Institute have

eliminating tariffs and quotas for almost
all exports of the poorest countries;

building with a mixture of office and retail. There are other small retail commercial buildings both
along the waterfront and the inland side of the road; such as restaurants, bars and a convenience
store/gas outlet.

In addition to the drawing power of these retail users, the lvanna Eudora Kean High School is located
approximately 1,500 feet west of the subject property.

During the last several years, development has been predominantly of retail/office uses. The largest
recent development in this area has been East End Plaza, which was constructed in 2008. However,
the completion of this commercial building coincided with the downturn in the overall economy in the
territory, and the property has struggled to reach stabilization. There is also a newly constructed,
small commercial strip center in close proximity to the subject called Crosswinds Center that opened
approximately two years ago. Ace Hardware is the anchor tenant in this building, while the majority of
the other commercial bays remain vacant.

There have also been two notable bar/restaurant openings within the past two years, both at the
subject property. Near the subject, a Senor Frogs restaurant opened in November 2013 featuring a
dining and nightclub atmosphere. Additionally, a tavern/restaurant called Tap & Still has opened
approximately 450 feet southwest of the subject. A new Thai/Sushi restaurant is under construction
within Red Hook Plaza, just west of the subject. These new establishments are indicative of the
improving retail/commercial climate of the Red Hook area.

Outlook and Conclusions

The area is in the slow growth stage of its life cycle. There have been signs of increased demand as
existing commercial space has been leasing up more rapidly over the past six months, showing the
upside of the subject’s area. We anticipate that property values will slightly increase in the near
future.

CHAPTER THIRTY
The Consequences for the ‘War on Terrorism’ “

“Because of a number of unauthorized disclosures and a lot of hand-wringing over the government’s role in the
effort to try to uncover these terrorists, there have been some policy and legal and other actions that make our
ability collectively, internationally, to find these terrorists much more challenging.”

CIA Director John Brennan in response to the Paris attack, November 2015

In the evening of November 13, 2015, normal life in Paris was brought to a screeching halt by
nine Jihadist terrorists acting on behalf of ISIS. Three blew themselves up at the stadium at Saint-
Denis, where President Hollande was attending a match between France and Germany, while the
others shot killed 130 people at cafes, restaurants and a theater. 388 others had been wounded in
the carnage. The attack was planned over many months by Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a 28-year old
Belgium citizen of Moroccan origins, who served ISIS as a logistics officer in Syria in 2014. To
organize the attack, he smuggled three suicide bombers into Europe through Greece, raise
financing, set up a base in the Molenbeek section of Brussels, import deactivated assault weapons
from Slovenia (which then had to be restored by a technician), buy ammunition, acquire suicide
vests, obtain “burner” cell phones, rent cars and make on-line bookings for quarters in Paris for
the nine attackers.. Even though Abaaoud was well known to western intelligence services, none
of the communications surrounding the preparations for the attack came to the attention of the
NSA or its allied services in Europe.

Those Paris attackers who did not kill themselves with their suicide vests were killed by the
police, but the real challenge in such a terrorist operation is not bringing culprits to justice after
the massacre civilians. It is preventing them from carrying it out. As “soft targets,” such as
restaurants, cafes, theaters and street gatherings, cannot be continually protected by police, the
only practical means by which a government can prevent such attacks is to learn in advance about
their planning and preparations. One means of acquiring this information is by listening in on the
channels through which members of loosely-knit terrorists organizations, such as ISIS,
communicates with one another. This form of intelligence-gathering obviously works best so
long as the terrorists remain unaware that the communication channels they are using are being
monitored. Once they find out that their messages and conversations are being intercepted, they
will likely find a safer means to communicate important information. For that reason,
communications intelligence organizations keep the sources and methods they employ for
monitoring these channels in a tightly-sealed envelope of secrecy.

To claim originality in any field is rash. It is safer to say that some things in this book
are new as far as 1 know. | know at least what I can’t remember reading elsewhere. |
am more confident in judging what will surprise in the sense of conflict with what is
taught today. There we need only keep up with the current conversation. Judging

originality with confidence means having read everything before.

My surprises were not all new, and my novelties (if such) where not all surprises. A
few ideas met both descriptions. They pay rule, and the equally heretical Y rule,
probably count as both although Becker came within a step of getting there first.
Depreciation theory is likely to be both. Other possible candidates might include my
observation that holds by money managers reveal prices as clearly as trades do, and
my hawks-and-doves analogy inferring from this that index funds should
outperform managed ones when aggregate AUM held by money managers, not
trades by them, exceeds a critical percentage of the market to be determined. There
may also be both surprise and novelty in my suggestion of monetary policy by
establishment of real dollars as legal tender. In my wannabe biologist role, I just

may have been first to the point out the gaffe in the math of Hamilton’s rule.

Free growth theory takes Mill a little farther by ruling out growth by thrift at the
collective scale. It should prove a major surprise to lawmakers, who incentivize
thrift in the name of growth, and a milder one to economists already prepared by
the insights of Solow. My possible originality here was in the simultaneous rates
equations | derived to test them, and the test itself accessing data for market-valued
capital as well as consumption from the Piketty-Zucman website. My definitions of
market-valued net investment and net output, substituting for the book-valued
versions used in national accounts, were essential for testing. I suppose these rank

as novelties but not surprises.

That, of course, was precisely my point: those who were not offended should be free to watch a
film in which no one was hurt.

Finally, the Chief Justice asked me about theaters:

[H]ow about moving the bear-baiting into a theater and charging $5 admission for it? I
don’t want to overwork you on the bear-baiting, but in order to have a film of bear-
baiting, you’ve got to go through unlawful process in the first instance.

With less than a minute before my time had expired, the Chief Justice asked whether I thought the
analogy to the bear-baiting contest was “valid.” I politely told him what I thought:

I think the analogy of bear-baiting is not valid [because it] is an illegal act which hurts
animals. It is different from [lovemaking] presented on a screen to a public which has
chosen to view it.

By this point my time was nearly up. I quickly summarized my argument that under a functional
definition of privacy

A theater with its curtains drawn deserves [at least as much constitutional protection as] a
home with its shades drawn up.

The Chief Justice had monopolized the entire argument with his bear-baiting analogy. He 9or his
law clerksO had apparently prepared a series of questions for me about bear baiting and Burger
had simply gone down the list ignoring my answers. The other eight justices were unable to ask
questions, though several of them seemed anxious to probe certain points. Some of them seemed
embarrassed by their Chief’s performance. By the end of the argument, I finally understood what
a bear-baiting contest must feel like—at least to the bear. It was not only the dumbest series of
questions I have ever been asked during an oral argument—with at the possible exception of
those put to me by a senile judge about the facts of the next case scheduled for argument. It was
probably the stupidest conversation I’ve ever had with anyone about the First Amendment. But
no one ever said that intelligence was a criterion for being a judge, or even a Chief Justice. What
mattered to Warren Burger was that he looked like what a Chief Justice is supposed to look like!

A few months later the Supreme Court rendered a 5 to 3 decision in the J Am Curious Yellow case
that did not reach the broad issue decided by the district court (nor did it mention bear-baiting);
instead, it decided the case on a narrow procedural ground. We eventually settled the case to the
advantage of the defendants. The film was shown throughout the country and no one went to
prison. Judge Aldrich’s opinion, suggesting that all censorship of the content of movies exhibited
to adults in discreet settings was unconstitutional, remained the only court decision on that issue
until June of 1973, when the Supreme Court changed the definition of obscenity in a case called
Miller v. California and a series of companion decisions.

In these cases Chief Justice Burger, writing for the majority, expressly and emphatically rejected
the approach I had argued in the J Am Curious Yellow case.

University, as well as your conduct in non-academic settings as a prominent figure in the skeptics movement. |
am reporting this story along with two of my colleagues on the science desk, Azeen Ghorayshi and Virginia
Hughes.

Our story is about several allegations of sexual misconduct dating from 2006 to 2016 (see full details below).
Our reporting also goes into how the various institutions you have been affiliated with — Case Western,
Arizona State University, the Australian National University, the New College of the Humanities, and the Center
for Inquiry, for which you serve as an honorary member of the board of directors — have handled complaints
and concerns about your behavior during this time.

Our story is corroborated by emails, university documents, official complaints, testimony from victims and
eyewitnesses, and interviews with more than two dozen of your current and former academic colleagues,
students, and peers in the skeptics movement.

| wanted to offer you the opportunity to comment and/or respond to the main facts we plan to publish. If you
wish to comment on any of the below findings, we need to hear from you as soon as possible. We are
planning on publishing our story Tuesday morning, Eastern US Time.

Based on our reporting, this is what we plan to publish:

Incident 1:

° In November of 2006, at an event launching the new Center for Inquiry in Washington D.C., you met a
volunteer for CFI D.C.

° At the event, you asked for her business card. Later, you followed her as she was leaving and asked
her if she was “of age.”

° Later, you emailed her to invite her to dinner.

° You planned to dine with her in the restaurant at the Washington D.C. hotel where you were staying.

° You told her to come up to your room first because you needed to finish some work.

° In your hotel room, you seemed in no rush to leave. You ordered a cheese plate, and later champagne,
despite her suggestion that you go down to dinner.

° You then made a comment about her eye makeup, getting very close to her face.

° You then lifted her by her arms, and pushed her onto the bed beneath you, forcibly kissing her and
trying to pull down the crotch of her tights.

° She struggled to push you off her.

° You said, “When | was in college | could never get a girl that looked like you.”

° When you pulled out a condom, she got out from under you. She said “I have to go,” and rushed out of
the room.

Incident 2:

° In an incident that occurred in fall of 2007 while you were a physics professor at Case Western Reserve

University, a student tried to talk to you about her plans after graduation. You mentioned to her how tough it
must be to have all the other physics majors asking her out on dates.

° In a second incident in December of 2007, while you were still at Case Western, the same student
visited your office to interview you for a student science journal. You closed the door behind her, and ignored
the questions she had prepared. Then you made a casual comment about taking her out for dinner.

° Later, in a regular column for the school paper, she described her experiences with you, without
mentioning you by name. “There was even one particular creep of a professor who once told me he thought
differently of me compared to other students and asked me to dinner: a situation so disturbing that it left me
upset for weeks afterward,” she wrote.

center that sends healthy subjects moral reminders about the virtues of truth, is shut down or barely
audible within the mind of a pathological liar. The brain of a pathological liar allows for the ultimate
poker face. The brain of a healthy individual allows us to perfect the poker face by repeating a distorted
narrative, converting a lie into a self-justified truth. This is dangerous denial.

When we lie, either to manipulate someone else or ourselves, we distort the truth. We can either
do this on the fly or use a narrative held in long-term memory. When Hilary Clinton told her supporters
that she had to dodge bullets in Bosnia, she either lied in the moment to convey a stronger image or she
developed this distortion over a long period of time. In the first instance, she knew that her comment
about Bosnia was false. She was deceptive, but not self-deceived. In the second case, she was self-
deceived and most likely unaware. Her narrative was so clear that she could picture running for cover
without the usual welcoming party. Several studies now reveal that both forms of lying engage brain
areas associated with self-control and conflict— the right backside of the prefrontal cortex and the
anterior cingulate. This makes sense. To tell a lie, either to oneself or another, requires controlling what
we know about reality to convey an alternative reality. When we hold both versions of this narrative in
mind, there is conflict. As we rehearse one version more than the other, the conflict dissipates. The more
we rehearse, the more we push this narrative into long term memory. The more we push this narrative
into long term memory, the more it becomes part of what we believe is true. The more we believe it is
true, the more we hold onto a narrative that can be used to justify our actions.

The imaging results fit well with our understanding of which brain regions are involved in self-
control, conflict, memory, and social knowledge. To understand which regions are either necessary or
sufficient for representing truths and lies, we turn to a technique called ‘ranscranial direct current
stimulation. This method allows researchers to safely increase or decrease activity in a brain area
through electrical stimulation. Think of this technique as a volume knob on an old fashioned radio. Turn it
clockwise and you amplify the signal. Turn it counter-clockwise and you quiet the signal. When the
German neuroscientist Ahmed Karim and his colleagues applied this technique to the right backside of
the prefrontal cortex, and decreased activity, healthy subjects were better at telling lies, lied without guilt,
and were less stressed out as measured by the sweatiness of their skin. This pattern mirrors the natural
state of pathological liars. Absent the circuitry in the brain that exerts self-control over our distortions,
Karim turned healthy subjects into conscience-free, poker-faced, liars.

If self-deception and deception are not only part of normal brain function, but adaptive processes,
then what makes this system turn toxic? What tips the brain over to the dark side, allowing self-deceptive

illusions to empower the individuals and groups to cause great harm?

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029076.txt,"Questioner: Very simply put, there’s a growing movement among young people here in
Europe, in France and in Austria and elsewhere, and they’re arguing very effectively
against Wall Street institutions and they’re also appealing to people on an ethnic and
racial level. And I was just wondering what you would recommend to counteract these
movements, which are growing.

Bannon: One of the reasons that you can understand how they’re being fueled is that
they’re not seeing the benefits of capitalism. I mean particularly — and I think it’s
particularly more advanced in Europe than it is in the United States, but in the United
States it’s getting pretty advanced — is that when you have this kind of crony capitalism,
you have a different set of rules for the people that make the rules. It’s this partnership of
big government and corporatists. I think it starts to fuel, particularly as you start to see
negative job creation. If you go back, in fact, and look at the United States’ GDP, you look
at a bunch of Europe. If you take out government spending, you know, we’ve had negative
growth on a real basis for over a decade.

And that all trickles down to the man in the street. If you look at people’s lives, and
particularly millennials, look at people under 30 — people under 30, there’s 50% really
under employment of people in the United States, which is probably the most advanced
economy in the West, and it gets worse in Europe.

I think in Spain it’s something like 50 or 60% of the youth under 30 are underemployed.
And that means the decade of their twenties, which is where you have to learn a skill,
where you have to learn a craft, where you really start to get comfortable in your
profession, you’re taking that away from the entire generation. That’s only going to fuel
tribalism, that’s only going to fuel [unintelligible]... That’s why to me, it’s incumbent upon
freedom-loving people to make sure that we sort out these governments and make sure
that we sort out particularly this crony capitalism so that the benefits become more of this
entrepreneurial spirit and that can flow back to working-class and middle-class people.
Because if not, we’re going to pay a huge price for this. You can already start to see it.
Questioner: I have a question, because you worked on Wall Street. What is the opinion
there on whether they think bank bailouts are justified? Is there a Christian-centered
[unintelligible | that they think should be bailed out? The crisis starts earlier than 2008.
What was the precedent then? What was the feeling on Wall Street when they bailed out

the banks? How should Christians feel about advocating or being against that?

Consensus underestimating GDP and inflation
We are upbeat on Japan’s outlook and think consensus is underestimating the strength
of medium-term GDP and inflation. We expect growth of 1.4% in CY2017 and 1.2% in
CY2018, well above consensus of just 0.8% growth next year. For the first time in four
years both monetary and fiscal policy are supporting growth. The combination of
modestly higher commodity prices, a weaker yen, and a tightening output gap should
drive Japan-style core inflation to 1.0% in CY2017, and 1.4% in CY2018. We expect the
BoJ to keep its rate targets unchanged for the foreseeable future as inflation moves in
the right direction.
Fiscal and monetary policy realigning
For years Japan has oscillated between loose and tight fiscal policy. Japanese
policymakers now seem to be on the same page and we see little risk of another policy
error. If anything, we see upside risks from greater fiscal stimulus via a third
supplementary budget or a relatively aggressive FY17 ordinary budget. Meanwhile, the
BoJ’s new interest-pegging regime ensures that financial conditions will become
increasingly stimulatory as inflation rises.

2017 – a year of recovering domestic demand
We think the economy is heading towards a cyclical sweet spot and see a broad-based
recovery in domestic demand. Specifically, 1) consumption is poised to rebound as the
saving rate peaks; 2) capex should accelerate in response to the improving demand
outlook, deepening supply-side constraints, and “low-for-longer” real rates; and 3)
increased efforts by policymakers to accelerate income redistribution could push up the
velocity of money at the margin, helping to reflate the economy.
Unauthorized redistribution of this report is prohibited. This report is intended for amanda.ens@baml.com
Biggest risk factor: US policy uncertainty
External developments pose the greatest risk to our forecasts, chief among them US
policy uncertainty. The downside scenario for Japan is a combination of rising US
protectionism, sliding global trade, and a stronger yen, which could reduce 2017 growth
to zero. The Trump presidency may increase pressure on Japan to achieve greater
military self-reliance, boosting defense spending. There will also be greater incentives to
deepen economic and trade linkages with key regional players, such as China and Russia.

Escape from zero
The Q3 CY16 GDP print confirms our view that Japan has at last emerged from the de
facto zero-growth trap of the past few years. Growth accelerated to an aboveconsensus
2.2% q-o-q saar, after a 0.7% rise in Q2 CY16 and 2.1% rise in Q1 CY16. We
expect a moderation in Q4 CY16, but underlying growth will remain firmly in the 1.0-
1.5% range. We are currently tracking CY2016 growth of 0.7%, a modest improvement
from 0.6% in CY2015, though the switch to a new GDP standard 1 next month raises
uncertainty around our forecasts.
Upturn in exports to be sustained through Q3 CY17
The recent recovery has been driven by a fading consumption tax shock and stronger
exports. The downturn in the global industrial cycle in 2014-16 hurt Japan, but
manufacturing activity bottomed out early this year and is now modestly expanding
(Chart 2). The OECD leading indicator continues to signal a synchronized pick-up in
global growth (Chart 3). The domestic inventory cycle also points to production gains
ahead (Chart 4). For Japanese exporters, the improvement in demand has been most
visible for Europe (Chart 5). US and Chinese demand will likely follow, though the
mainland’s structural shift to services implies only a modest acceleration. We expect the
current up-cycle in global exports to be sustained through Q3 CY17 – possibly longer
depending on developments in the US (more on this later). The combination of stronger
external demand and a weaker currency should shore up business confidence, especially
among manufacturers, and lay the foundations of Japan’s recovery.

Automatic easing
Policy headwinds are also abating: for the first time since 2013, both fiscal and
monetary policy are poised to turn stimulatory in 2017.
Monetary policy: BoJ pegs to zero
The BoJ’s transition to yield-curve targeting ensures that real yields will drop as inflation
picks up, implying that financial conditions will turn increasingly loose as the recovery
progresses. There are good reasons to be cautiously optimistic: after all, despite a triple
whammy of weak domestic demand, weak commodity prices, and a stronger yen,
Japanese inflation measures are showing early signs of bottoming out (Chart 6).
We expect Japan-style core inflation (CPI ex fresh food) to trough in Q4 CY16, after
which it should accelerate relatively quickly in the first two quarters of 2017 in response
to 1) a recovery in crude oil prices, 2) a weaker yen (we assume USDJPY rebounds to
120 by the end of the year), and 3) stronger wage growth. This also implies stronger
core-core inflation (CPI ex food & energy). We are bullish on all three factors and see
CY17 core inflation running at an above-consensus 1.0% and 1.4% in CY18.
This is still short of the central bank’s 2% target (Chart 7). But we believe there will be
little pressure to lower rates further, especially against the backdrop of a weakening yen
and rising global yields. More broadly, things are moving in the right direction for the
BoJ. The private sector has been steadily re-leveraging, albeit gradually. Meanwhile,
labor markets continue to tighten and wage growth is slowly improving: the 4-quarter
moving average for hourly wages is now up to 1.2% y-o-y (Chart 8). With the labor
market for lower-cost part-time workers nearing saturation, growth in higher-quality,
full-time jobs is picking up (Chart 9). We expect a moderation in employment gains and
faster wage growth ahead.

Fiscal policy: turning looser In FY17
Fiscal policy is undergoing an equally important shift. In August, the Cabinet approved
an economic stimulus package totaling JPY28trn (roughly 5.5% of GDP). Though “real
water” government spending is a comparatively modest JPY7.5trn (1.5% of GDP), this is
enough to put the fiscal impulse back in expansionary territory, after three years of
tightening (Chart 10). The stimulus measures, which are centered on public investment
and cash transfers to households, should boost CY2017 GDP by 0.5ppt. Public
construction orders are already rebounding as the government front-loaded public
infrastructure spending (Chart 11). Meanwhile, the next stage of the consumption tax
increase has been postponed until October 2019.

To be clear, we are not talking about massive shifts in the fiscal stance here—the
Ministry of Finance remains very much opposed to expanding the deficit and Prime
Minister Abe has yet to abandon the government’s long-standing goal of balancing the
primary balance by FY2020.
However, there is a growing consensus among Japanese policymakers that premature
fiscal tightening is counter-productive for reflation efforts, especially when monetary
policy is stretched. Even BoJ Governor Kuroda, who initially underplayed the risks from
2014 fiscal tightening, has recently acknowledged that loose monetary and fiscal
policies will have a “synergistic effect.” The upshot is that the risk of another policy
error is low, in our view. If anything, we see upside risks from greater fiscal stimulus in
the form of a third supplementary budget or relatively aggressive FY17 ordinary budget.
We would not rule out further delays to the October 2019 consumption tax hike, either.

2017: a good year for domestic demand
Policy tailwinds are only one pillar of our call for Japan’s outperformance in 2017. We
also believe the stars are aligning for an organic improvement in domestic demand,
which would support the current recovery: the economy is firing on all cylinders for the
first time since 2013, and growth should accelerate to 1.4% in CY2017, followed by
1.2% expansion in CY2018 (Chart 12).
We see three catalysts: a consumer comeback, stronger capex, and a shift in income
away from high-saving corporations in favour of higher-spending households and
stockholders.

1. Consumer comeback
Households have been the noticeable laggard in the current recovery and the main
reason why Japan’s economy has barely grown since the 2014 consumption tax hike.
This is not for a lack of income growth: real employee compensation (wages +
employment) has staged an impressive recovery of late, rising 1.2% in CY15, and an
estimated 1.9% in CY16 (Chart 13).
One explanation is that private consumption is simply being underestimated in demandside
GDP statistics: researchers at the Bank of Japan recently produced experimental
supply-side estimates of GDP that were significantly higher than existing expenditureside
statistics. 2 We find the BoJ research interesting and agree that Japanese
consumption statistics are beset by data quality issues. But this alone cannot account
for the consumption slump. We think two factors are equally to blame for depressed
household spending: 1) a squeeze on disposable income from higher taxes and social
security contributions; and 2) a surge in the saving rate (Chart 14).
Calling Japan right in 2017 is largely about correctly forecasting whether these two
trends will reverse. We see several reasons for optimism. First, we expect real employee
compensation to accelerate further, driven by a continued pick-up in per capita wages.
The call on the saving rate is admittedly trickier. But having surpassed the 2006 highs,
we think it is unlikely to surge further, given that consumer confidence is improving and
income growth is firming. FY17 tax reforms are also likely to support household
sentiment at the margin: for example, discussions are underway about enlarging tax cuts
for second-earners who work part-time. Overall, we expect private consumption to rise
1.0% in CY17, adding 0.6ppt to growth.
Should the saving rate stabilize, as we expect, consumption should again start rising in
tandem with compensation. Investors should not have to wait long to get some visibility
around these trends. We expect the saving rate to peak in Q4 CY16 and consumption to
rise strongly from this quarter.

2. Capex revival
We also see a fundamental case for higher capital spending. Borrowing rates are very
low and will fall further in real terms as inflation rises. Stronger growth and improved
confidence should also encourage higher capex. And deepening supply-side constraints
offer a strong incentive for Japan Inc. to accelerate productivity-enhancing capex,
ensuring that this expansion is durable.
For these reasons, we think that the impulse of capital expenditures will likely be higher
in the non-manufacturing sector, where capacity utilization rates are higher, and labor
shortages (and hence wage pressures) are more acute (Chart 15 and Chart 16).

Chart 17 shows the ratio of personnel costs to sales, using MoF corporate survey data.
The ratio is particularly high for lodging & accommodations (23%), eating & drinking
services (27%), medical, healthcare & welfare (37%) and education & learning support
(37%). Somewhat surprisingly, personnel expenses are fairly restrained in retail. But this
is partly due to the relatively heavy reliance on lower-cost part-time workers. Given the
rapid growth in part-timers’ wages, such cost savings is likely to become increasingly
difficult to maintain.

Analysis by METI suggests that many of these non-manufacturing industries have the
scope to raise productivity. Wholesale/retail, utilities, and eating & accommodation have
particularly low levels of productivity relative to the US (Chart 18). We think the solution
is to boost capex, especially in ICT and automation. More broadly, an acceleration in
capex is needed if we are to see a pick-up in productivity and sustained profits. Though
we are by no means in the late stages of the profit cycle, the trend clearly points to
higher wage costs going forward, requiring proactive efficiency-enhancing investment
by corporates. Bottom-up data capex data for MSCI Japan also suggest that the
investment cycle has troughed and will pick up next year as earnings momentum
improves (Chart 19).

3. Policy priorities and redistribution
We think an increase in government pressure on corporations could speed up income
redistribution at the margin, ensuring that money circulates to those sectors and agents
with a higher propensity to consume. Elevated corporate savings remain a focal point
for the government. Cabinet Office officials have used the concept of the “cash-out
ratio” 3 to highlight the creaky transmission from corporate profits to spending. Chart 20

The idea of the “cash-out” ratio was first raised by private sector representatives of the Council on
Fiscal and Economic Policy. The measure is defined as cash out / cash and deposits. The numerator
includes capex, personnel expenses, R&D, dividends, and changes in equity investments in related
companies. The denominator includes cash and deposits, and securities, short-term lending, and
investment securities classified under liquid assets. Since we are restricted to Ministry of Finance
Corporate survey data, our version of the “cash-out ratio” is defined as capex + personnel costs +
dividends / cash and liquid assets.

shows that this measure has been on a steady downtrend, with the numbers particularly
low for large corporates.
So far, the government’s approach has relied more on carrots than sticks, with Prime
Minister Abe using a combination of moral suasion and sweeteners to encourage firms
to disgorge profits. The pattern has continued as we approach FY2017. For example,
local media have reported that the government is considering offering corporate tax
breaks to SMEs that raise wages, in light of more modest wage growth at SMEs.
Discussions are also underway in the Prime Minister’s office about reforming working
practices with the immediate focus on “Equal Pay for Equal work (EPEW)”—i.e. reducing
the wage gap between regular and non-regular employees.
But the issue is contentious from both a capital and labour perspective. And considering
the time it will likely take for related legislation to pass in the Diet, we think the lack of
compliance mechanisms may mean that the immediate impact of EPEW will be limited.
Instead, the debate seems to have shifted towards limiting excessive and unproductive
overtime work. This is low-hanging fruit that does not address the issue of Japan’s
labour market rigidities, which are at the heart of the problem of suppressed wages and
weak household spending power.
That said, there are signs that the government’s patience is wearing thin and that the
Prime Minister is increasingly leaning towards direct intervention. For example, the
government has already delivered a minimum wage hike in FY2016 and plans to take the
national average up to JPY1,000 by 2020 via yearly hikes of 3%. These policy changes
should offer small tailwinds for the recovery in private consumption. We also think the
debate over a possible retained earnings tax is unlikely to go away. We are sceptical it
will be introduced in this year’s tax reforms. However, the government’s escalating war
on corporates hoarding cash is likely to lead to a continued rise in dividend payouts and
share buybacks (Chart 21).

Risk factors: largely from overseas
A key risk to our 2017 outlook on the domestic side may be weaker-than-expected
growth in real labor income, or a continued surge in the household saving rate, which
would constrain consumption.
However, we think the biggest risks in either direction stem from abroad. Specifically,
we see higher uncertainty over global trade, risk sentiment, and FX as a result of
political transitions in the US and Eurozone. We consider multiple policy scenarios under
a Trump presidency.
Trump’s campaign promises have mixed implications for Japan. On a positive note
deregulation, tax cuts, and aggressive infrastructure spending could boost US aggregate

demand. Our US economics team expects the stimulus to boost growth in H2 CY17 and
likely CY18. Japan should be a big winner from stronger US growth, given its high
exposure to the US economy in terms of exports and corporate profits (Chart 22 and
Chart 23). On the negative side, aggressive protectionist trade measures, if
implemented, would depress US growth and global trade further. If combined with a
stronger yen, Japan’s economy would be hit hard.

Base case: “benign Trump” scenario
For the moment, we are assuming limited positive and negative policy changes. Our US
team expects uncertainty to cause a modest slowing of growth in the first half of next
year, but this will be more than offset by fiscal stimulus in the second half and into
2018. But the size of the fiscal expansion will likely be smaller than promised, and the
introduction of modest protectionist measures means that the boost to global trade will
essentially be zero. Table 1 shows the impact on growth under two scenarios, based on
different assumptions for global trade and FX. Under the upside case, Japan’s GDP could
rebound towards 2%, as the economy benefits from a combination of stronger global
trade and a weak currency. Under a downside “protectionist” scenario, 2017 growth
would slow to around zero and would most likely tip Japan back into deflation.

Political impact of a Trump administration
For Japan, the impact of Trump’s election goes beyond economic issues. It also impacts
defense spending and regional trade arrangements.
Military self-reliance and budget choices
Trump has made it clear that he wants allies of the US to shoulder a greater share of
the defense burden. There is a lot of uncertainty as to how far Trump will go to redefine
the US-Japan alliance. Despite his criticism, Japan already pays about 75% of US
military hosting costs. However, it seems fair to assume that Japan will be expected to

increase its defense spending. Under Prime Minister Abe, the defense budget has
expanded by 7% but has been kept at roughly 1% of GDP, in keeping with historical
guidelines. This is small by international standards and more likely than not will rise in
the coming years (Chart 24). The composition of spending is also likely to shift from
operating costs towards procurement, which is currently a very small part of the budget
(Chart 25).

TPP and trade policy: potential for linkages with other regional players
Trump and his aides have made it clear that they consider the Trans Pacific Partnership
(TPP) to be a “bad deal.” Media have reported that President Obama is not considering
pushing the deal through a lame duck Congress. This means the deal is likely dead in its
current form.
While negative for Japan, the expected withdrawal of the US from TPP could spur new
arrangements with regional partners. One potential positive is the prospect of improved
economic and trade linkages with other key players in the region, including Russia and
even China. Three upcoming events are worth monitoring closely (Table 2): first, the 19-
20 November APEC Summit in Lima, Peru, where we are likely to see vigorous
discussions on the future of the TPP as well as further progress on the Regional
Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP); second, the 15 December Abe-Putin
Summit, in Yamaguchi prefecture; and third a potential trilateral summit between Japan,
China, and Korea, which onshore media now say is being scheduled for 19-20 December,
though it may not happen given the unfolding leadership upheaval in Korea.
Bullish bottom line – don’t underestimate the recovery
We are optimistic on Japan and think the acceleration in GDP and inflation in 2017 will
be much stronger than consensus expects. For the first time since 2013, fiscal and
monetary policy will be lined up in the same expansionary direction. The global export
cycle has turned and is now tracking modest expansion. Meanwhile, the headwinds to
domestic demand are finally turning into tailwinds. Unlike in the past, we think the risks
of a policy error are low. Assuming that external risks are kept at bay, we think Japan will
surprise with the strength of its recovery.

Dear Dr. Krauss,

Thank you for your responses, which state that the allegations made against you are false and/or distorted.
That does raise a question:

Why do you think that multiple women, over more than a decade, have separately made accusations against
you?

I appreciate the opportunity to respond to your email. I am currently on a plane until noon pacific time, and then
heading to a meeting right after landing, till about 2 pm or so. While Iam running the risk that you will report
my comments, if you do, either out of context, or incompletely, I am responding with an effort to be complete,
as I always try and do with reporters. If you decide to go ahead with a story, which, after reading my responses,
I hope you decide is inappropriate, I would like you to quote my responses fully in order not to distort them.

It is hard to know how to respond to a list of false and/or distorted allegations, along with misleading
statements. I treat people I interact with with respect, and I work hard to support and mentor students,
colleagues, and members of the general public, and this is supported by the institutions of which Iam a part. I
do not sexually harass people. If the purpose of your reporting is to somehow argue that Universities and other
institutions are lax in dealing with well known individuals like myself, then in fact the situation is quite the
opposite. My high public profile opens me up to more scrutiny at these institutions, not less, and it also opens
me up to a host of unfounded outside complaints and allegations that other faculty do not receive, each of which
the University has to respond to. The fact that I have remained a professor in all Universities with which I have
been associated, in good standing, and also an officer or an invited speaker at organizations like CFI, which
have strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the fact that their experience validates a trust in my
behavior. I was asked to be an honorary director of CFI, and continue to be invited to their last 3 meetings to
speak, specifically because, as they have written me after the fact, the attendees universally appreciated my
talks, my courtesy, and graciousness in spending time with the attendees. Ifthe purpose of your report is to
impugn my integrity or suggest I have a history of harassment, that too is false. As noted in one of your
‘miscellaneous facts’, as a scientist I try and remain skeptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather than
allegations and innuendo by people whose motives I cannot judge. I also try and judge the facts in context. The
fact that Universities and other organizations employ me or have me on their boards, or invite me to meetings is
because they value my contributions and my actions.

The items you list are false or distorted. Item 1 refers to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in 2006 where
we mutually decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be appropriate, and there
were respectful and platonic encounters afterwards. There is nothing to comment on in item 3, which involves
an anonymous 3rd party claim because I know nothing about it, there are no details provided, and it clearly was
not taken seriously enough to result in any university action. Item 4 is confusing. Are you saying that because I
decided I didn’t want to go out to a bar with a group of attendees that I was harassing them? The second part
did not happen. Re incident 5: The ‘female companion’ in this case is my wife, who accompanied me on the
cruise, and has attested to the fact that the claim is false. This is what I wrote at the time in response to the blog
in question, causing it to be taken down.

It is worth responding to Item 2 and 6 in more detail,

Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 8 of 18

Roberts, who showed the Herald the written instructions for the rendezvous, never picked up the girl because Roberts met a man on the trip who would
become her husband. The couple married and moved to Australia, where they currently live.

In 2007 — at the same time the FBI was investigating Epstein — Roberts, pregnant with her second child, said she unexpectedly received phone calls from
Maxwell and Epstein. She said they were worried that she had told police about them. She assured them she had not spoken to anyone, she said.

Shortly afterward, Roberts said, she was contacted by someone who claimed to be with the FBI. But she was afraid to tell that person details, fearing it was
really an Epstein associate posing as an FBI agent.

That agent, identified in court papers as Timothy Slater, confirmed that he and the other agent on the case, Nesbitt Kuyrkendall, called Roberts in January
or February 2007. Ina sworn statement, Slater said he informed Roberts that they suspected she was a victim of Epstein’s.

The agent said Roberts answered basic questions, but became uncomfortable and “asked that I not bother her again.”

Roberts said the agent didn’t try too hard to convince her to talk, and she was surprised when he hung up after asking her a few graphic questions about
her sex life. She said she was suspicious, but would have cooperated had the FBI talked to her in person and explained why they were asking about
Epstein.

“T was still scared to death,”’ Roberts said. “Jeffrey used to tell me that he owned the entire Palm Beach Police Department. I just didn’t want my family
harmed.”

She nevertheless was listed by federal prosecutors as one of Epstein’s Palm Beach victims.

As the years went by and Roberts had a daughter, she would be haunted by a fear that Epstein was still taking advantage of young girls. In 2011, she went
public in a paid interview with a British tabloid, the Daily Mail, asserting that she had had sex with Prince Andrew, one of Epstein’s friends, several times
when she was a teen.

In her 2015 affidavit, she discussed in detail some of her alleged sex encounters with the prince and Epstein’s other friends, including lawyer Alan
Dershowitz. Edwards included the affidavit in the court file as part of the Jane Does’ Crime Victims’ Rights Act case, at which time it became public.

Virginia Roberts says she was loaned out by Jeffrey Epstein to his friend Prince Andrew, shown here. He denies they had sex. COURTESY OF VIRGINIA ROBERTS

was performing that evening, in the open air, with most of the suburb in attendance. As soon as I took my first shot, an
old man approached me,” said French photographer Antoine Agoudjian. “Tears streamed down his face. He told me that
his son had died. That he had been electrocuted, that he was his pride and joy, and that I looked just like him. He broke
into sobs and moved towards me with outstretched arms. His name was Ishran. I asked if he would dance for me, and he
began dancing. The troupe paused and perched on an outcrop of rocks in the background. It was beautiful, not because
the man is beautiful, but because he represents something deep inside the collective consciousness of the Armenian

community: a celebratory resilience in the face of overwhelming loss.”

strategy to raise the national economy, and emerge from the financial crisis stronger than
before? How do you respond to the unfair and hateful rumors that Dubai has turned into
a ghost city?

The performance of our economy in the first quarter of this year proves that we are on the way out of the crisis,
and that we are on the right track. Our economy will resume its health faster than other economies, but the
speed of that=2 Oresumption is not governed only by the strength of our economy and its abundant resources.
The speed will also be influenced by developments in the international economy — including the measures of
revival in the grouping of industrialized states known as the G-20, whose role in international trade movement
is about 90 percent of the total international trade, and whose GDP is about 60 percent of the entire world GDP.
The speed of general recovery will also be influenced by the capability of international measures connected
with monitoring markets, and the role, functions and work mechanisms of international financial institutions,
especially the International Monetary Fund. I am optimistic that good implementation of the decisions of G-20
and the International Monetary Fund will speed up the recovery of the global economy.

Sometime ago, several Western papers published unfair reports about the UAE, claiming
human right violations of foreign labor in the UAE, and the lack of free elections in the
UAE, etc. What do you think of these allegations? What do you think is the reason behind
spreading such malicious reports?

They may write whatever they like, and play the tunes that please them. We are not annoyed by criticism, nor
do we fear campaigns. They have their models, experience, values, standards, their cultural and intellectual
frames of references. We have our models, values, st andards and frames of references. We are open to the
entire human experience in every field. We learn from them, but we will never import ready-made models. We
do not accept that, and our society does not accept this. As for the allegations about foreign labor, it is an old
theme, repeated every now and then. Yes, certain sectors of foreign labor are not in the state we like or hope.
But we are steadily improving that state, and we are making progress every year. For years, the talk about
foreign labor has not ceased. Such talk is open to all and to the countries that provide such labor. Despite that,
millions are trying to come to work in our country. So, why do those foreign countries don’t stop their citizens
from coming to work in the UAE if the work situation is such as these nasty reports claim?

The UAE is facing a regional and global media campaign that questions its ability to
overcome the global financial crisis. How does Your Highness evaluate such campaigns?
What are the tools and the initiatives with which to respond, including the development
of local media?

Action is louder than words. Our achievements and hard work would be the response to these campaigns. The
UAE is immune to such campaigns, and questioning of its ability to continue developing a strong federation is
not going to yield anything. When we established the UAE federation, we faced analysis and speculation
campaigns, questioning our ability to sustain the Federation and ensure its success. Similarly, the launch of
every major project was met with uncertainty and rumors from media campaigns. All these campaigns are
history now and their promoters have been proven to be wrong.

As for your suggestion of responding to these campaigns with tools and initiatives, including the development

me, before we headed back from California, that he’d recommended me for the
post. It was an especially exciting prospect because the US-backed negotiations
with Egypt did finally appear to be nearing an agreement. As commander of
Division 252, I’d be coordinating and implementing Israel’s Sinai withdrawal.

But I didn’t get the job, at least not on my return. Raful Eitan had indeed
succeeded Motta as chief of staff, and he had the final say. I'd evidently been
right to assume I would figure no higher in his estimation than I had as sayeret
commander. To be fair, however, he did agree to my becoming commander of
Dan’s reserve division in the south: the same 611 that Arik Sharon had led
across the canal in 1973. When I took up that post in April 1979 — just days
after the formal Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty was indeed signed — I was also
promoted. I became a one-star general. And eighteen months later, when the
regular division post came open again, I did get the nod to command the 252™.

Even then, it was a close-run thing. Raful called me in to see him and said he
wanted me to return to the kirya instead, in the one-star general’s post inside
military intelligence. He said he had more than enough candidates for division
commander, but that my previous experience meant I was the best choice for the
intelligence post. I was determined to remain in the field, especially with signs
that Begin, and certainly his more right-wing supports in the Likud, were
already having second thoughts about the peace deal we’d struck with Egypt. In
part, they feared that a withdrawal from any of the land taken in the 1967 war
might create a precedent, and invite pressure, for more withdrawals. But the real
buyers’ remorse centered on the fact that, as part of the initial agreement at
Camp David, Begin had needed to accept a parallel framework for negotiations
toward a broader peace that would include the West Bank and Gaza
Palestinians.

In any case, with Raful balking a second time at giving me the division
command, | figured I had little to lose by fightinhg my corner, and telling him
exactly what I felt. “Look, I realize that you’re chief of staff,” I said. “But don’t
forget we’re both just temporarily in whatever role we hold. I’m not here as a
draftee. I’m in the army by choice. It’s your decision to tell me what position
you want me to take. But you can’t impose anything. I can always leave. Or I
can bide my time until you leave.” Raful apparently concluded he couldn’t
actually force me to take the intelligence job. With Dan having made his
preference clear, he didn’t press the point.

resulted in a term of imprisonment. According to press
reports, however, in 2006 the State Attorney, in part due

struck me from that first meeting as strong, cool-headed, highly intelligent and
intensely cerebral. Though we didn’t go into the details of the Iranian nuclear
threat, he did talk at some length about the implications for the region, and about
broader Middle Eastern security challenges. He displayed a grasp of the cultural
and political nuances of an increasingly diverse and complex world that was more
impressive than many of the other American political or military leaders whom I’d
met.

When he and I now returned to the issue of Iran, in the White House, he had an
undeniable command of the details of Iran’s nuclear program, and of the American
military options, should he choose to use them. He opened by summarizing the US
position. He emphasized that his and our objective was the same: the keep Iran
from developing a nuclear weapon. We were already cooperating to achieve that,
for instance through cyber-attacks to slow down the nuclear program. The
difference, he said, was that Israeli leaders seemed to feel an urgent need to reach a
decision on military action. In Obama’s view, such a move would be both
premature and potentially harmful to the coalition he’d helped assemble to exert
diplomatic and economic pressure on Iran.

Maybe you had to be an Israeli truly to understand our urgency about Iran. In
the early years of the state, the explanation we gave for our preoccupation with
security — our near-obsession, as some non-Israelis saw it — was that we were
surrounded by Arab countries pledged not just to defeat us, but erase us from the
map. Egypt or Syria, Jordan or Iraq, could afford to lose an Arab-Israeli war.
Israel’s first defeat, however, would be its last. That picture had changed
dramatically over the decades. We no longer had to worry about the prospect of
losing a war. The “qualitative edge” we possessed over all enemy armies in the
region ensured that. As Israel’s chief of staff, Prime Minister, and now Defense
Minister, I had made it a major priority to safeguard that advantage, not just
through our alliance with the US but with the remarkable domestic resources we
possessed in military engineering, manufacturing, design, invention and high-tech.
But the new-order challenge represented by Iran was not just theoretical or
academic. Though we had a policy of not commenting on on our own nuclear
status, it was widely assumed in the Arab world and internationally that Israel had,
at the very least, the capacity to manufacture nuclear weapons. But whatever
nuclear capability we might possess was for deterrence. Even when threatened
with conventional defeat, however briefly, in the Yom Kippur War of 1973, it is

Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 14 of 18

The girls who were abused by Jeffrey Epstein and the cops who championed their cause remain angry over what they regard as a gross injustice, while
Epstein's employees and those who engineered his non-prosecution agreement have prospered.

By

Taking a page from Epstein’s legal team, lawyers representing Epstein’s victims hired private investigators and former police detectives to dig into
Epstein’s life. Over the past decade, they’ve tracked down hundreds of people, including dozens of other potential victims; they’ve interviewed Epstein’s
recruiters, bookkeepers, housekeepers, butlers, pilots and drivers. They’ve traveled around the country and the world, taking statements and sworn
depositions, coaxing people to talk who had previously been too reticent to come forward.

In short, they did what criminal prosecutors didn’t do.

Some of the information they ’ve learned was given to federal authorities in New York. Edwards said those authorities have shown no interest in opening a
new investigation focused on crimes he is alleged to have committed in that state, where he is listed as a level 3 sex offender, the most dangerous
category, considered at risk to re-offend, records show. In New York, he has to register every 90 days.

Virginia Roberts holds a photo of herself at age 16, when she says Palm Beach multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein began abusing her sexually. Emily Michot
EMICHOT@MIAMIHERALD.COM

Holding abusers accountable

In 2015, Roberts sued Maxwell for defamation in New York after Maxwell called her a liar in a news interview. The civil lawsuit was an effort by Roberts
not just to clear her name, but an attempt to prove that Epstein and Maxwell operated an international underage sex trafficking operation. The lawsuit
was settled out of court in 2017 and nearly all the evidence presented in the case has been sealed.

Roberts’ attorney, Sigrid McCawley, claims that Roberts received a sizable settlement, although the amount is confidential.

“She wanted to hold her abusers accountable and we were able to do that by bringing this case ... which we ultimately settled very successfully for her,”
said McCawley, an associate of noted Bush-Gore recount lawyer David Boies, who has also pursued cases against Epstein in federal court in New York.

with the progress we managed to achieve on various tracks including investment, aviation industry, IT and
global competition in mana ging and financial markets.

The UAE has proven remarkable competency in addressing difficult questions imposed by the global financial
crisis. I strongly believe it won’t be long before international focus will shift from what is claimed to be
Dubai’s shortcomings to Dubai’s and the UAE’s overall success in passing this difficult test.

By Al-Sharq al-Awsat Daily

Almost a year ago, and during your visit to Asia, you warned against the global financial
crisis. Why precautionary measures have not been undertaken to avoid negative impacts
of this crisis on both Dubai and UAE?

The crisis have taken the whole world by surprise and evolved in tremendous pace. During my visit to Asia, I
had warned against turmoil in financial and commodities markets, marginalizing the role of international
financial institutions and potentials that these institutions fall short from fulfilling their expected roles ina
world where all international markets became very much related, turning into one huge global market which
does not follow any international rules, regulations or supervision.

I had urged leading world economies to move swiftly and reconsider roles and mechanisms of international
financial establishments and institutions, especially the International Monetary Fund -- and that what exactly
the G20 summit did last month earlier this month.

Regarding the precautionary measures, I believe that no preventive measures neither i1n the UAE or any other
country in the world, would have provided the desired immunity from the ramifications of the global financial
meltdown. The UAE’s solid economic structure, efficient performing establishments, adoption of a balanced
model of conservative banking policies overseen by the Federal Central Bank and liberal economic approach,
were the key elements that enhanced the country’s ability to survive the negative implications of the global
crisis and prevented any case of bankruptcy in any of the country’s banks or major corporations. The impact of
the crisis on our economy was significant during the last quarter of 2008, yet it was not as harsh as on other
major economies.

By Al-Sharq al-Awsat Daily

Despite Dubai government officials repeated rebuffs of bailing out some companies to
Abu Dhabi, speculations in that regard have never stopped. Isn’t normal for the
Emirates to cooperate among themselves to overcome such difficult times?

Cooperation among the seven Emirates has never stopped and they don’t wait for crises to show this
cooperation. There are several joint ventures between Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Founders and stakeholders of
most of the UAE Public Joint Stock companies are from Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi investors have huge
investments in Dubai and vice versa. Dubai has always welcomed business and investments from across the
UAE.

Regarding the speculations you referred to in your question, they will always remain just speculations. I believe
they are meant to be evil gossip as part of a vicious campaign against Dubai model. These speculations were not
only refuted by Dubai government officials but also by His Highness the President of the UAE last March.

Nikkei to 20,000: Inventory cycle upturn →
cyclicals; inflation → banks, insurance
Investment Strategy 18 November 2016
Unauthorized redistribution of this report is prohibited. This report is intended for amanda.ens@baml.com
Bullish equities 2017; rotation into cyclicals, banks, insurance
We are bullish Japan equities for 2017 and we estimate the Nikkei 225 index will recover
to 20,000 by end-2017 (see $/¥’s eventual surge: Buy Nikkei 06 September 2016). Our
new Chief Japan Economist Izumi Devalier forecasts above-consensus Japan GDP growth
and inflation in 2017, which is also supportive of our bullish equities scenario (see Ready
for ignition 18 November 2016). We expect rotation into cyclicals, banks and insurance
as explained below.
1) Upturn in inventory cycle: Defensives→Cyclicals
We expect cyclicals to outperform defensives, premised on our end-2017 $/¥ estimate
of ¥120, and this is supported by our above-consensus economic growth outlook. Our
Japan economist sees a shift to fiscal easing, firms countering the tight labor market by
increasing capex, and estimates industrial production to grow 3.5% and 3.6% in 2017
and 2018, respectively. With the inventory cycle exiting a “contraction” phase and
entering a “recovery” phase, conditions are likely to remain conducive to cyclicals
outperforming defensives (Chart 1, Exhibit 3).
2) Higher inflation, rates: Deflation stocks→Inflation stocks
Up to 1H16, the Japan equity market saw continued preference for deflationary stocks
as domestic inflation remained subdued and the JGB curve underwent excessive bull
flattening. Defensives outperformed cyclicals (Chart 1), growth outperformed value
(Chart 2), and stocks that benefit from a low-yield environment (REITs) outperformed
the converse (banks, insurance; Chart 3). However, we expect conditions to reverse into
2017. We see US Treasury yields rising and Japanese core CPI inflation recovering to
+1.4% yoy by 2018 and core-core to +1.1% yoy. Stronger inflation and higher foreign
yields should steepen the JGB yield curve above10yr, while below 10yr should escape
from downward pressure as BoJ rate cut expectations recede. Against this backdrop, we
expect to see a rotation from deflation to inflation stocks, which in addition to cyclicals
means banks and insurance should outperform REITs within the financial sector (Chart 3).
This is also in line with the global rotation expected by Michael Hartnett (The Flow
Show: The Inflation Era Begins 10 November 2016).
3) Nikkei winner of steeper UST and strong macro
In a scenario of strong external demand and US rate hikes (particularly with curve
steepening), Japan equities tend to be the winner on a local currency basis, led by
cyclicals, banks and insurance stocks (Exhibit 4). Resurgence in the “Japan macro trade”
of short yen / buy equities is also a possibility.
Our Buy-rated stocks in bank, insurance and cyclical sectors are listed in Table 1.

Risks: Geopolitics, diplomacy and US economic cycle
The biggest risk to our scenario is the implications for Japan’s diplomatic and
geopolitical environment of the Donald Trump presidency in the US. The likelihood of
agreement on the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) has already declined and been priced
into the market, but any downward spiral in Japan-US relations would likely be further
negative for Japan equities near-term. A rise in protectionism would be negative for
stocks with high US export exposure. Meanwhile if the US economy slows or enters
recession and the protectionist response weakens USD, it would be negative for
Japanese cyclicals, particularly exporters, due to stronger JPY and potential trade
conflicts. Moreover, a potential improvement in US-Russia (US-China) relations under
the new US President most likely implies a relative worsening in Japan-Russia (Japan-
China) relations. On the other hand, we expect Japan to move closer to Europe under
such a scenario, raising the incentive to sign the Japan-EU EPA (Economic Partner
Agreement), positive for related stocks. If the Trump presidency tips the US towards
isolationism, we expect Japan’s spending on defense to increase. If this results in higher
spending on Japan’s Self Defense Forces (rather than compensating for US spending on
Japan-based US military), Japan’s defense-related stocks would be beneficiaries, and it
could reshape the arms industry in Japan.

Disclosures
Important Disclosures
FUNDAMENTAL EQUITY OPINION KEY: Opinions include a Volatility Risk Rating, an Investment Rating and an Income Rating. VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential
price fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst’s assessment of a stock’s: (i) absolute total return potential and (ii)
attractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). There are three investment ratings: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total
return of at least 10% and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than
Buy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0-12
month total return expectation for a stock and the firm’s guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be
referenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst’s view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).
Investment rating Total return expectation (within 12-month period of date of initial rating) Ratings dispersion guidelines for coverage cluster*
Buy ≥ 10% ≤ 70%
Neutral ≥ 0% ≤ 30%
Underperform N/A ≥ 20%
* Ratings dispersions may vary from time to time where BofA Merrill Lynch Research believes it better reflects the investment prospects of stocks in a Coverage Cluster.
INCOME RATINGS, indicators of potential cash dividends, are: 7 - same/higher (dividend considered to be secure), 8 - same/lower (dividend not considered to be secure) and 9 - pays
no cash dividend. Coverage Cluster is comprised of stocks covered by a single analyst or two or more analysts sharing a common industry, sector, region or other classification(s). A stock’s
coverage cluster is included in the most recent BofA Merrill Lynch report referencing the stock.

As you know, I’m a reporter for BuzzFeed News who has been investigating sexual misconduct allegations
against you. As we've already discussed by email, I’d very much like to interview you about these allegations in
detail.

In particular, you stated in an email sent on Nov 13 that two universities had investigated an incident (# 6
below). You claimed that “both Universities independently concluded that the report was unsubstantiated and
fabricated with malicious intent.” We are not aware that either university concluded fabrication or malicious
intent, so if you have evidence to support this assertion, we would like to see and discuss it.

The story concerns your actions towards students while a professor of physics at Case Western Reserve
University, as well as your conduct in non-academic settings as a prominent figure in the skeptics movement. |
am reporting this story along with two of my colleagues on the science desk, Azeen Ghorayshi and Virginia
Hughes.

Our story is about several allegations of sexual misconduct dating from 2006 to 2016 (see full details below).
Our reporting also goes into how the various institutions you have been affiliated with — Case Western,
Arizona State University, the Australian National University, the New College of the Humanities, and the Center
for Inquiry, for which you serve as an honorary member of the board of directors — have handled complaints
and concerns about your behavior during this time.

Our story is corroborated by emails, university documents, official complaints, testimony from victims and
eyewitnesses, and interviews with more than two dozen of your current and former academic colleagues,
students, and peers in the skeptics movement.

| wanted to offer you the opportunity to comment and/or respond to the main facts we plan to publish. If you
wish to comment on any of the below findings, we need to hear from you as soon as possible. We are
planning on publishing our story Tuesday morning, Eastern US Time.

Based on our reporting, this is what we plan to publish:

Incident 1:

° In November of 2006, at an event launching the new Center for Inquiry in Washington D.C., you met a
volunteer for CFI D.C.

° At the event, you asked for her business card. Later, you followed her as she was leaving and asked
her if she was “of age.”

° Later, you emailed her to invite her to dinner.

° You planned to dine with her in the restaurant at the Washington D.C. hotel where you were staying.

° You told her to come up to your room first because you needed to finish some work.

° In your hotel room, you seemed in no rush to leave. You ordered a cheese plate, and later champagne,
despite her suggestion that you go down to dinner.

° You then made a comment about her eye makeup, getting very close to her face.

° You then lifted her by her arms, and pushed her onto the bed beneath you, forcibly kissing her and
trying to pull down the crotch of her tights.

° She struggled to push you off her.

° You said, “When | was in college | could never get a girl that looked like you.”

° When you pulled out a condom, she got out from under you. She said “I have to go,” and rushed out of
the room.

with members of our own group and fighting those outside, our ancestors would have been blind to race
as it was not yet an emergent property of our species. Language was, however, a property of our species,
and one that varied across populations. A hunter-gatherer walking the plains of South Africa would
indeed have run into people speaking either a completely different language, or the same language with a
different dialect. New languages are not easily acquired, and nor are new dialects. It takes real talent to
speak a new language or dialect without a trace of ones origins. Thus, like the stotting gazelles,
magnanimous spenders, and healthy evildoers discussed in chapter 2, the native languages and dialects we
speak are honest signals of social group membership. Honesty is supported by the costs we pay to
acquire them. Cheating is hard because there is a start-up cost associated with perfecting the natural
rhythm of a second language or novel dialect.

The babies in Kinzler’s experiments tell us something important: race and language are both
important social categories and discriminable from an early age. But language trumps race as a feature
because it is a better predictor of membership within the inner sanctum, at least early in life. Ultimately,
both language and race allow us to close off some from the inner sanctum and allow others in. Ultimately,
our allegiance to our native language and race can fuel our hatred toward those who look different and

speak in different tongues.

Closed doors
As adults, we tend to rely on rules of thumb to guide our social interactions, including who we trust and
who we distrust. We tend to trust those we know more than those we don’t know. Within the circle of
those we know, we believe those who are more like us than those who are unlike us, using fixed body
features — race, height, hair color — flexible psychological features — food preferences, sports’
interests, religious beliefs — and features that are flexibly constrained — language and intelligence.
Together, these different dimensions cause us to close the door on some and open it to others.
Language is particularly interesting. If you can’t understand someone because they don’t speak
your language or because their accent is too heavy, then the issue is not trust, but comprehension. But
what if you can understand the person perfectly well, but they speak with a foreign accent, either one
from a different country (e.g., a French speaker speaking English) or one from the same country but a

different region (e.g., a Southern accent in the northeast of the United States)?

information seen as the rate of entering new boxes of the partition, a logarithmic
rate of expansion of the possible. Counting the number of previously unoccupied
squares entered by the dynamical systems orbit per unit time over the generating
partition, for instance, yields an estimate of entropy that, as in the rat and computer
mouse examples above, is called the topological entropy, Hr. Hr, is about how
much new information is being generated by the system per unit time. Theorems
have been proven that Hr is a maximal estimate of the global dynamical entropy
with Hy proven to be a minimum estimate. Monitoring single or aggregate molecular
motion in a system with the maximum randomness of a space filling gas, we find
that, on the average, every box is entered and occupied uniformly such that H; = Hy
or said another way, H7 — Hy = 0.

As evidenced by the above described experiments in rats and people, the
same entropic relations (but usually not with maximal or minimal measure) can be
found in biological systems. We have previously described the manifold geometry of
a generic (typical, idealized) nonlinear dynamical systems as hyperbolic defined by
the presence of simultaneous but decomposable components of the motion
including the straight ahead and round and round actions on the center manifold,
the new possibility generating, expansive, away from the center manifold motions
along unstable manifolds and the back to the center manifold, contracting motions,
along the stable manifolds. Uniform expansive and contractive influences in the flow
leads to mixing of the order of the initial sequence of the values inscribed by the
orbits. This results in maximization of the entropies and satisfaction of a
concomitant of the uniformly hyperbolic condition, H7 — Hy = 0.

These clean and mathematically proven findings do not hold for the quasi-
mess that is human neuropsychobiology. Enmeshed as most of us are in only
intermittently random or nonuniformly hyperbolic systems with the in-between
entropies of the only apparently real world of maya, Hr — Hy # 0. How the H;— Hy
= 0 of uniform hyperbolicity fails, H7 — Hy # 0, and along with it the dispassionate
detachment of entropic emptiness and fullness, becomes a problem not unrelated to

the existence and quantitative qualities of personality styles and their dissolution

Cuba, a denial it continued to repeat to every reporter who queried the airline for the next six
weeks.

The first news that Snowden was even in Russia came on July 1, 2013. A statement posted on
n the Wikileaks web site and signed “Edward Snowden,” after thanking “friends new and old” for
his “continued liberty,” accused President Obama of pressuring “leaders of nations from which I
have requested protection to deny my asylum petitions. It added: “This kind of deception from a
world leader is not justice, and neither is the extralegal penalty of exile. These are the old, bad
tools of political aggression.” Since the Aeroflot flight to Cuba was the only means of getting
directly from Moscow to Latin America, Russian reporters, encouraged by the Wikileaks post,
continued taking the daily 11 hour flight to Cuba until August 1, 2013, The charade only ended
when Kucherena said in a press conference at the airport that Snowden would be taking up
residency at an undisclosed location in Moscow, and walked out of the airport with Snowden.

The question remained: where had Snowden been staying for those 39 days? Sarah Harrison,

his companion on the plane, told Vogue that she and Snowden had shared a windowless room in
the transit zone, where they watched TV, washed their clothes in a sink basin and ate meals from
the nearby Burger King. The only hotel with windowless rooms in the transit zone in 2013 was
the Vozdushny V-Express Capsule Hotel, located next to a newly-opened Burger King restaurant.

I next went there. The polite V-express desk clerk, who spoke English, showed me the standard
windowless double-room. It was approximately 24 square feet, the size of a large shipping
container. Most of the floor space was taken up by twin bed. Across from the bed, behind a
plastic curtain, was a stall with a shower, a toilet and sink. Not only was it very cramped quarters
for two people to share but it was fairly expensive. It cost 850 rubles an hour (about $18 in
2013.) For 39 days that hourly charge would add up to $16,600. Even though Snowden claimed
that he brought a large cache of cash to Russia, such a long stay was not allowed, according to
the desk clerk. The maximum stay allowed by the hotel was 24 hours. So either the rule was
waived for Snowden or he moved to another facility not available to the public.

I learned from a former KGB officer, there are a number of VIP quarters beyond the confines
of the airport, including suites at the 400-room Novotel hotel, which is located about seven miles
from the airport, that are used for debriefing and other purposes by the security services.
According to him, the security services are not restricted from entering and leaving the transit
zone.

The possibility that he was staying elsewhere would help explain the futile search for him by
of a large number of reporters over those 39 days. When they learned from tweets that Snowden
was not aboard plane to Havana on June 24, they aggressively questioned every restaurant
employees, security guards and airport personnel for weeks they could find. Some reporters even
took rooms in the V-Express Capsule Hotel and “tipped” maids and other hotel employees. They
also bought business-class tickets on flights to gain access to all the public VIP lounges in the
transit zones. Despite this intensive search, none of them found anyone who had seen Snowden

Palestinians control of most of Hebron, and accepted further withdrawals under the
Wye River agreement. But amid predictable protests from the right, he had
promptly retreated from his Wye commitments. I knew that his default response to
Obama’s call for a settlement freeze would be “no.” And it was, delivered first to
the cabinet and then to the public, as soon as he got back from his talks with the
President.

In my repeated meetings with Bibi in the weeks that followed — both one-on-
one, and within the informal group of close ministers and aides known as the
Group of Eight — I tried to persuade him that, if only because of America’s key role
on Iran, we needed to show some sign of engagement with Obama’s efforts. I was
not entirely alone. One ally was an old friend: Dan Meridor, who had rejoined the
Likud before the election. Another was more unexpected: Avigdor Lieberman. He
was never going to accept a settlement freeze. Not only did his heart, and political
interests, lie on the West Bank. He lived there. But like many in the party he led,
he had come to Israel from the former Soviet Union, shaping a worldview that in
many ways remained European, and pro-Western. He was worried about creating
the impression of blanket Israeli intransigence toward a popular new American
President, and isolating ourselves internationally, if we didn’t go some way
towards helping to restart talks with the Palestinians.

Though Bibi showed no signs of retreat on the settlement freeze, he did accept
that broader point. Ten days after Obama’s Cairo speech, he publicly accepted the
idea of a Palestinian state for the first time, having ruled it out as recently as the
month before in his White House talks with the President. The shift was dismissed
as trivial not just by the Palestinians, but by many in my own Labor party and
almost everyone else on the left. I disagreed. I knew how deep, genuine and
longstanding Bibi’s resistance to Palestinian statehood was. But I had another,
serious concern about the “peace plan” he announced: an entirely new precondition
he insisted the Palestinians must meet if peace was ever going to be possible. He
said they must “clearly and unambiguously recognize Israel as the state of the
Jewish people.” On a whole series of levels, that made no sense to me. We hadn’t
asked Egypt or Jordan to grant us explicit recognition as a Jewish state when we
made peace with them. Even when Bibi himself had briefly tried to open
negotiations with Damascus in his first period as Prime Minister, we’d never felt
the need to ask it of the Syrians either. To the extent there was any logic in
demanding it of the Palestinians, Bibi’s reasoning seemed to be that this would

broad industrialized world is aging.
According to Tharoor, the average age in
China today is around 38, whereas in
India it’s around 28. In 20 years, that gap
will be much larger. So this could be a
huge demographic dividend — “provided
that we can educate our youth — offering
vocational training to some and
university to others to equip them to take
advantage of what the 21st-century global
economy offers,” said Tharoor. “If we get
it right, India becomes the workhorse of
the world. If we get it wrong, there is
nothing worse than unemployable,
frustrated” youth.

Indeed, some of India’s disaffected youth
are turning to Maoism in rural areas. “We
have Maoists among our tribal
populations, who have not benefited from
the opportunities of modern India,”
Tharoor said. There have been violent
Maoist incidents in 165 of India’s 625
districts in recent years, as Maoists tap
into all those left out of the “Indian
dream.” So there is now a huge push here
to lure poor kids into school. India runs
the world’s biggest midday lunch
program, serving 250 million free school
lunches each day. It’s also doubled its
number of Indian Institutes of
Technology, from eight to 16, and is

Sheriff Bradshaw wants to be clear: none of these visits was
conjugal.

But even US attorney Acosta, who negotiated Epstein’s unusual
agreement with the government, would say that Epstein’s arrange-
ment was highly irregular.

“Epstein appears to have received highly unusual treatment
while in jail,” Acosta would say in a letter addressed to the gen-
eral public. “Although the terms of confinement in a state prison
are a matter appropriately left to the state of Florida and not fed-
eral authorities, without doubt, the treatment that he received
while in state custody undermined the purpose of a jail sentence.”

And, of course, Epstein’s stay at the Stockade was subsidized

Sean Hannity. He gave seven others “strategic advice and

business consulting.”

Last month Cohen said he borrowed from his home-equity
credit line to make a $130,000 payment in October 2016 to Stormy
Daniels, an adult-film star who says she had sex with Trump.

In a Thursday morning appearance on “Fox & Friends,” Trump
distanced himself from Cohen, saying he did only “a tiny, tiny
little fraction” of Trump’s legal work, but it included

representation “on this crazy Stormy Daniels deal.”

Russian Interference

Cohen is under investigation for bank fraud and violating

campaign-finance law. But his decade at Trump’s side as his
lawyer and enforcer could yield information he might trade to

investigators looking into the Trump campaign and Russia's

interference in the U.S. election.
still, if he chooses to defend himself, Cohen does have
assets. Companies he signs for own two investment properties

purchased in 2015. The larger one, with 92 units on New York's

Upper East Side, is 38 percent owned by Cohen's companies. The

businesses also appear to be the sole owner of a downtown
building with 20 units.
Together they likely generate less than $1 million in

annual net income for Cohen's companies after accounting for

partner interests, expenses and financing costs, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. Debt against the buildings is low, meaning
that Cohen could tap them for cash. Last October, the Cohens
sold a unit at Trump World Tower, near the United Nations, for
$3.3 million.

Cohen has been a savvy property investor. He previously
owned four buildings in need of repairs in Lower Manhattan,
rehabilitated them and sold them for $32 million in 2014, more
than doubling his initial investment.

‘Cautious, Methodical’

Richard Guarino, a partner at Friedman-Roth Realty, has
worked with Cohen on a handful of deals, including the purchase
of his Upper East Side building. As a real estate investor,

Cohen is “cautious, methodical, smart and, I think,
conservative,” Guarino says.

Cohen's current business partners are a family of New York

real estate lawyers headed by Herbert Chaves. The family, having
just sold a plot of Brooklyn land to a partnership including the
family company of Jared Kushner, were looking to reinvest their

gains when they bought Cohen’s Lower Manhattan buildings in

2014. Months later, they partnered with Cohen to buy the Upper
East Side property, 330 East 63rd Street. Guarino, a broker on
the deal, says he dealt only with Cohen, who served as a
representative for the investor group even though the Chaves
family companies hold the majority stake.

Purchased for $58 million, the squat, brown-brick seven-

story building has only a $17 million mortgage, meaning Cohen's

share has at least $15 million of equity he could borrow against
if his partners allowed him to do so. Another property at 133
Avenue D, not previously reported to be owned by Cohen, has at
least $5 million of equity not tapped by a mortgage. But more
debt means more risk and could hurt Cohen later if the taxi

business doesn’t turn around to help cover higher interest
payments.

Issuing the first amendment ofa law usually takes some time. Rushing things may lead to undesired
consequences while delay reflects unnecessary bureaucracy. The pace of passing new amendments to laws
bound by international agreements and world systems — for example, the Companies Law -- is determined by
the progress of these agreements. Several important international agreements, including a significant number
involving the World Trade Organization, are still not ripe. Yet, we are very keen on passing or amending any
laws if necessary to strike a healthy balance between our local interests and our commitments to international
trade and finance organizations.

Speculation about the dirham’s peg to the United States dollar keep flowing back out.
What value do you see in keeping the peg in the sh ort term and the long term? Is there
any move to change the structure or composition of the peg?

Governed by strict banking principles and guidelines, the UAE Central Bank is taking care of the issue of
dirham’s peg to international currencies. The US dollar’s devaluation against the Euro and the pound-sterling
during the past few years has triggered several debates about economic threats posed by the dirham’s peg to the
dollar. Today, after the dollar’s significant gains against other international currencies, we can barely hear these
voices.

There are no absolute wins or absolute20loses to pegging a local currency to a single foreign currency ora
currency basket. Decisions are always determined in light of the size of benefits.

One of the many effective measures taken by the UAE Government to deal with the
fallout of the global financial crisis has been to maintain or increase spending on
infrastructure projects, even if this leads to a deficit budget. Would the UAE be
comfortable with a deficit budget for the first time in many years? Would you
immediately put in place measures to wipe out the deficit (if that happens) in the next
year? What such measures would you consider?

This is a hypothetical question. Actually, we evaluate all possible scenarios and we are very keen on endorsing
a deficit-free budget. Yet I can read between the lines of your question about potential measures to face budget
deficit. My reply is: No Income Taxes.

The public relations image of UAE and Dubai is being taken to task in sections of the

Our strategy in that regard is very consistent, as we strongly believe in the sanctity of truth. Our commitment to
transparency is unequivocal and unquestioned. Our ultimate response to these reports can be seen in our
relentless efforts and ongoing success. The life sp an of lies is always short.

We have been very transparent with all measures undertaken over the past few months to counter the impact of
the global financial crisis. Senior government officials have spoken openly about the current situation,
highlighting key facts and figures -- including the actual size of the debts by both the government and
government affiliated companies.

Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 6 of 18

Virginia Roberts, now Giuffre, says she was 16 and working as a locker room attendant at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort when she was approached by Ghislaine Maxwell,
Jeffrey Epstein’s associate, about becoming a masseuse for Epstein. COURTESY OF VIRGINIA ROBERTS

That summer, when Roberts was 16, she said her father helped her get a job as a locker room attendant at the spa at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in
Palm Beach, records show. Her father worked at the resort as a maintenance man.

There she said she met Ghislaine Maxwell, an Epstein friend and socialite daughter of the late British publishing magnate Robert Maxwell. She offered
Roberts an opportunity to become a massage therapist, working for Epstein.

In a sworn court affidavit and in a recent interview with the Herald, Roberts described how Epstein and Maxwell began grooming her — not just to
perform massages, but to sexually pleasure them and others.

“Tt started with one and it trickled into two and so on,” Roberts told the Herald. “And before you know it, I’m being lent out to politicians and academics
and royalty.”

Roberts, too, was ordered to find Epstein girls — the younger, the better — by trolling areas where teenagers congregated, such as shopping malls, to lure
girls to whatever residence Epstein was staying in at the time, she told the Herald.

She began to travel with Epstein and Maxwell to Epstein’s other homes, in New York, New Mexico and the U.S. Virgin Islands — and her trips are
documented in flight logs that frequently list her name or her initials as a passenger, court records show.

“His appetite was insatiable. He wanted new girls, fresh, young faces every single day — that was just the sickness that he had,” Roberts said.
Neither Epstein nor his lead attorney, Goldberger, responded to requests for comment.

Roberts alleges that Epstein had cameras throughout his homes and said he liked her to tell him about the sexual peccadilloes of various important men
she had sex with.

“Epstein and Maxwell also got girls for Epstein’s friends and acquaintances. Epstein specifically told me that the reason for him doing this was so that
they would ‘owe him,’ they would ‘be in his pocket,’ and he would ‘have something on them,’ ” Roberts said in a court affidavit. “I understood him to

Did I teach her to ignore stupid no left turn signs? Of course I
did. But I never said such a thing to her or taught her how to decide
when it was safe to ignore a sign. I was just in her world and she was
watching.

I observed a similar phenomenon with my son. I like to watch
football and my son sat with me and learned to watch too. Twenty
years later, when an event occurred on the field, I noticed that we said
exactly the same thing at the same time. “Oof,” “oh come on,” “ugh.”
Whatever event on the field caused me to exclaim something, caused
my son to exclaim the same thing. Now, I could not tell you what
was an “oof” and what was an “ugh,” and neither could he. I do this
kind of thing unconsciously and so does he. He learned what I had to
teach, but he doesn’t know what he learned and I don’t know what I
taught.

What does this have to do with teaching? Perhaps we just need
to watch our teachers and then we can copy what they do. Well, not
exactly.

I took a yoga lesson the other day. The instructor got into a pose
and said I was to copy what he did. I said there wasn’t a chance that
I could copy what he did. He wasn’t used to being talked to like this.
(Most students are better at being students than I am, of course.) I
explained that I could barely understand what he had done, despite
seeing it, and I certainly didn’t know the intent of what he had done,
so I wouldn’t know which aspects of his action were significant and
which were unimportant. I told him this was no way to teach.

Now I know I will not be able to teach the yoga instructor how
to teach better, and I doubt he will be reading this book. But whether
you are teaching yoga or baseball or science or business, the rules are
the same. Before I list them, let me start with the top mistakes teach-
ers make. Some of these mistakes are forced on teachers by a badly
designed education system, and some are ones that teachers make no
matter what they are teaching or which system they are teaching in.

Some of these are less than obvious. So, let’s consider them one
by one:

Mistake #1: Assuming that there is some kind of learning other
than learning by doing

Mistake #2: Believing that a teacher’s job is assessment

Mistake #3: Thinking there is something that everyone must
know in order to proceed

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031272.txt,"After the month-long investigation, during which I was told I was not to interact with anyone on campus (again
moot because I was a hemisphere removed) the final report, from which I quote below absolved me of any
wrongdoing, reinstating my position, and indicated information inconsistent with the original claim and
apparent later claims:

The allegations were made by an observer to the incident.

- The complaint did not identify, nor disclose the identity of the conference attendee who was allegedly touched
in

an unwelcome manner.

- The conference attendee who took the ‘selfie’ photo did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference
organisers

at the time of the incident (November 2016).

- The conference attendee who witnessed the incident, did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference
organisers

at the time of the incident (November 2016).

-The photo submitted as part of the complaint does not provide evidence of any physical contact.

- The complainant alleged that a photo exists, showing your hand on the breast of the conference attendee who
took

the ‘selfie’ photo. This photo was not made available to the Australian National University, although it was
requested

in the course of the investigation.”

(And for the record I often put my hand up in front of a camera if there is a flash, as I specifically request selfies
not to include flashes, so that I don’t end up with a series bright spots in front of my eyes for the next half

hour. Moreover, I have no idea if the other eyewitnesses you quote, who were not involved in any complaint,
were in fact there but this was a formal banquet with individuals and their partners, which I attended long
enough to agree to sign things and do selfies before leaving early because I was tired. Even if I had any such
intent it would have been lunacy to pose for selfies in front of a group and openly do such a thing, including
presumably in front of this person’s partner, . Which, besides the fact that I don’t do such things, is one of the
many reasons it never happened.)

What makes this particular type of allegation so repugnant is that I get asked for literally thousands of selfies,
and when people come up to me they are vulnerable, often shaking, or sometimes aggressive. I am particularly
proud of the way I work to make all people feel at ease, and respected, rather than humiliated, whatever their
behavior or request. Thus, this false claim strikes at the heart of what I am about, which characterizes all my
interactions with fans: to acknowledge them in a way that makes them feel appreciated and respected. As I
understand you had a reporter watching me sign books and take selfies at the CFI conference in Las Vegas this
year, that behavior is what they will have witnessed and should report on. Moreover, I am proud of the
interactions I have had at both Case and ASU, with students, colleagues and staff of all genders and

ethnicities. I have worked hard to support them, mentor them, and treat them with respect. I treat others as
responsible adults, and I expect to be treated equally.

of networks and machine intelligence that will deliver real, perhaps even final,
leverage.

If the strategic aim of Europe’s leaders after Napoleon’s violent emergence and
defeat was to restore a balance of power, if America’s grand strategic purpose after
World War Two was the containment of the USSR and her totalizing ideologies,
nations now must try for positions of security and for command during the uneasy
transition ahead. The wellbeing of the whole system becomes a concern; entities,
protocols and ideas that threaten the system’s health are the most urgent dangers,
even as they represent seats of potentially historic power. We should ask: How is it
that international cooperation occurs in an age of connection? Will it happen
through slow, incremental movement? In sudden bursts? In fact, the routes to
cooperation are rarely easy in any age. They involve overcoming old bureaucratic
ideas, deeply held instincts of national interest, broken and humid and sometimes
murderous psychological needs - all while accepting a new picture of power - and
fresh risks and responsibilities. Our problem now, even in the face of these snapping
traps, is to define a clear vision of our future security - and then to make a path to
get there. No route exists today. “Originally, there were no roads in the world,” the
Chinese writer Lu Xun observed in a famous story at the start of the last century. “It
is only by walking on them that paths are made.”’® Ours is an age of first steps.

The social scientists John Padgett and Walter Powell, after considering examples of
epochal, collapsing change in political and biological systems of all sorts -
Renaissance finance markets, coral reefs, innovation clusters, and others - summed
up their conclusions in a little koan-like package of logic: “In the short run, actors
create relations. In the long run, relations create actors.” 7? The nouns we worry
about now, and the ones we hope for, take their meaning and their risk and energy
from relations. Your genome connected is different and more hopeful than it is
alone, unplugged, slipping into cancer. This idea that relations create actors is a
powerful basis for a new, enduring - even decent - grand strategy for an age of
revolutionary connection. It should also offer a check against some of our horrible
miscalculations: America invaded Iraq, for instance, intending to replace one state
with another. Instead we replaced a state with a network - and not one that we
controlled. That web still resists our old habits of control. Relations of family and
faith and clan link and activate murderous, relentless actors. The super power had
all the nouns: Tanks, planes, soldiers, money. But we did not have the networks. We
could not create relations. No move of ours held for long. We were like the team
JIEEDO - trying to defeat the wrong thing entirely.

A mild tropical climate, scenic beauty, and status as a U.S. territory make Virgin Islands appealing for
vacationers from United States and Europe. The islands host over 2.5 million visitors per year, most of
whom arrive by cruise ship, and tourism is the dominant economic engine of the islands, accounting
for roughly 70 percent of the total gross territorial product.

Each district has its own distinct landscape, mix and intensity of land uses, cultural identity, and
prospects for future development. St Thomas is home to the capital and the territory’s largest city,
Charlotte Amalie, which has an estimated population of roughly 19,000 persons. St Thomas is the
primary center for resort tourism, government, finance, trade, and commerce, but its rugged
landscape limits the land available for agriculture and other types of land-intensive development.
Charlotte Amalie is also home to a major deepwater harbor that is along major shipping routes to the
Panama Canal, and it is just east of the Cyril E King International Airport — one of the busiest airports in
Caribbean. St. Thomas has two cruise ship docks, and is the most frequented cruise ship port in the
Caribbean.

The island of St John is just under 3 miles to the east of St Thomas. Cruz Bay is located on the western
coast of the island and serves as its primary port and link to St Thomas. Nearly two thirds of St John is
owned by the National Park Service and is off-limits to commercial development.

St Croix is largest of the three islands, in both land area and population. It is roughly 45 miles to the
south of St Thomas. Its primary towns are Christiansted and Frederiksted. Overall the island is flatter
and has more land available for additional agricultural, commercial and residential development than
St Thomas. St Croix is also the primary manufacturing center for the Virgin Islands, with rum
distilleries, a major watch-assembly plant, and; until February 2012, one of the world’s largest
petroleum refineries (which recently ceased refining operations).

History

The Virgin Islands were originally settled by the Ciboney, Carib, and Arawaks. The islands were named
by Christopher Columbus on his second voyage in 1493 for Saint Ursula and her virgin followers. Over
the next three hundred years, the islands were held by many European powers, including Spain,
England, the Netherlands, France, and Denmark-Norway. The Danes developed the islands with
plantation estates, and the estates boundaries are still used in legal descriptions for land to this day.

The U.S. took possession of the islands on March 31, 1917 and the territory was renamed the Virgin
Islands of the United States. U.S. citizenship was granted to the inhabitants of the islands in 1927.

Government

The U.S. Virgin Islands are an organized, unincorporated United States territory. Even though they are
U.S. citizens, Virgin Islands residents cannot vote in presidential elections. Virgin Islands residents,
however, are able to vote in presidential primary elections for delegates to the Democratic National
Convention and the Republican National Convention.

The main political parties in the U.S. Virgin Islands are the Democratic Party of the Virgin Islands, the
Independent Citizens Movement, and the Republican Party of the Virgin Islands. Additional candidates
run as independents.

dehumanization and its role in denying reality, so too is self-deception a dangerous state of mind,
allowing individuals to inflict great harm while feeling aligned with the angels.

What did William Safire have in mind when he called Hilary Clinton a congenital liar?
Congenital refers to a trait that is present in utero, at birth or soon thereafter. Congenital disorders,
diseases, or anomalies typically refer to defects caused by a combination of genetic and environmental
problems. A cleft lip is an example of a congenital anomaly, one that appears at birth as a gap in the
upper lip. Because we don’t have detailed records of Hilary Clinton’s life as a child, it is hard to say
whether her lying was congenital in the same way that a hair lip is congenital. We can rule out the in
utero and at birth periods because Hilary, like all other children, was not born speaking or lying. These
capacities mature. That she developed a tendency to exaggerate and distort is consistent with other
reports. She falsely claimed that she was centrally involved in the creation of a Children’s Health
Insurance Program, an initiative that was actually created by Senators Ted Kennedy and Orin Hatch. She
also claimed that she played a significant role in the Good Friday Agreement for Northern Ireland, a
comment that Nobel laureate Lord William David Trimble described as “a wee bit silly.” When Safire
described Clinton as a congenital liar, what he was referring to was the habitual pattern of fabrication.
When patterns of the mind become habits, they are hard to break. Each distortion, rehearsed over and
over, becomes part of the fabric of truth. It is a life story that starts as fiction and ends up as non-fiction in
the mind of the story-teller. We can begin to understand this transformation by looking at the clinician’s
notebook.

For more than 100 years, psychiatrists have described a syndrome known as pathological lying.
If lying is pathological, it must deviate from some norm. The psychiatrist Charles Dike sums up the
essence of this disorder:

Pathological liars can believe their lies to the extent that, at least to
others, the belief may appear to be delusional; they generally have sound
judgment in other matters; it is questionable whether pathological lying
is always a conscious act and whether pathological lars always have
control over their lies; an external reason for lying (such as financial
gain) often appears absent and the internal or psychological purpose for
lying is often unclear; the lies in pathological lying are often unplanned
and rather impulsive; the pathological liar may become a prisoner of his
or her lies; the desired personality of the pathological liar may
overwhelm the actual one; pathological lying may sometimes be
associated with criminal behavior; the pathological lar may
acknowledge, at least in part, the falseness of the tales when
energetically challenged; and, in pathological lying, telling lies may
often seem to be an end in itself.

[Laughter]

Questioner: Hello, my name is Deborah Lubov. I’m a Vatican correspondent for Zenit
news agency, for their English edition. I have some experience working in New York — I
was working for PricewaterhouseCoopers auditing investment banks, one of which was
Goldman Sachs. And considering this conference is on poverty, I’m curious — from your
point of view especially, your experience in the investment banking world — what
concrete measures do you think they should be doing to combat, prevent this
phenomenon? We know that various sums of money are used in all sorts of ways and they
do have different initiatives, but in order to concretely counter this epidemic now, what

are your thoughts?

“For Christians, and particularly for those who believe in the underpinnings of the
Judeo-Christian West, I don’t believe that we should have a [financial] bailout.”

Bannon: That’s a great question. The 2008 crisis, I think the financial crisis — which, by
the way, I don’t think we’ve come through — is really driven I believe by the greed, much
of it driven by the greed of the investment banks. My old firm, Goldman Sachs —
traditionally the best banks are leveraged 8:1. When we had the financial crisis in 2008,
the investment banks were leveraged 35:1. Those rules had specifically been changed by a
guy named Hank Paulson. He was secretary of Treasury. As chairman of Goldman Sachs,
he had gone to Washington years before and asked for those changes. That made the
banks not really investment banks, but made them hedge funds — and highly susceptible
to changes in liquidity. And so the crisis of 2008 was, quite frankly, really never recovered
from in the United States. It’s one of the reasons last quarter you saw 2.9% negative
growth in a quarter. So the United States economy is in very, very tough shape.

And one of the reasons is that we’ve never really gone and dug down and sorted through
the problems of 2008. Particularly the fact — think about it — not one criminal charge has
ever been brought to any bank executive associated with 2008 crisis. And in fact, it gets

worse. No bonuses and none of their equity was taken. So part of the prime drivers of the

The scientific evidence presented in this section shows that our decisions to treat others according
to different moral principles or norms is powerfully affected by our sense of what counts as another
human being. What counts includes at least two important dimensions, one focused on agency and the
other on experience. These dimensions determine whether we blame or praise someone, punish or
rehabilitate them, and ultimately, include or exclude them from the inner circles of moral agents or moral
patients. Those who fall outside these two inner circles are morally worthless. Those who are morally
worthless can be destroyed or banished. Some things are justifiably excluded and fit with our general
sense of reality — rocks, dirt, cardboard boxes, plastic balls, and pieces of glass. Other things are
excluded because they don’t fit with our values of what reality should be. This is where distortion and
denial enter the process. This is where we create walls around members of one group in order to keep
others out. This is where we express partiality instead of the impartiality that Lady Justice champions
with her two balanced scales and blind fold-covered eyes. This is where we exclude others from our inner
sanctum in order to justify great harms. How is the inner sanctum set up and put into action over a

lifetime, sometimes for legitimate causes and sometimes for illegitimate and unconscionable causes?

Populating the inner sanctum

Elie Wiesel, the Nobel Peace Laureate and Holocaust survivor, remarked that “anti-Semitism is the most
ancient form of prejudice.” This claim may well be true of human written history, but is most definitely
false if one considers the fact that all social animals and human societies, including the hunter-gatherer
groups that are descendants of people that predated the Jews, hate some individuals and love others.
Prejudice, though often based on deep seated ideological biases and stereotypes that humans invent, is, at
root, a form of partiality. Every social animal, either extinct or alive today, expresses partiality. This is a
highly adaptive and ancient psychology, promoting the care of young, investment in mates, and escape
strategies against enemies. Humans are no different, except for the role that our promiscuous brains play
in fueling partiality with ideology and symbolism. Sometimes when we express our partiality it is for the
noble cause of caring for our children and for defending ideological beliefs surrounding humanitarian
causes, including defense of basic human rights. Sometimes when we express our partiality, it is for the
ignoble cause of destroying others. How does human partiality begin? Do babies express preferences for
certain social categories? How does their experience sculpt new categories? How is the inner sanctum

populated, enabling us to preferentially help those within and harm those outside?

Question: Obviously, before the European elections the two parties had a clear link to
Putin. If one of the representatives of the dangers of capitalism is the state involvement in
capitalism, so, I see there, also Marine Le Pen campaigning in Moscow with Putin, and
also UKIP strongly defending Russian positions in geopolitical terms.

[Harnwell restates, but unintelligible]

Harnwell: These two parties have both been cultivating President Putin [unintelligible].
Bannon: I think it’s a little bit more complicated. When Vladimir Putin, when you really
look at some of the underpinnings of some of his beliefs today, a lot of those come from
what I call Eurasianism; he’s got an adviser who harkens back to Julius Evola and
different writers of the early 20th century who are really the supporters of what’s called
the traditionalist movement, which really eventually metastasized into Italian fascism. A
lot of people that are traditionalists are attracted to that.

One of the reasons is that they believe that at least Putin is standing up for traditional
institutions, and he’s trying to do it in a form of nationalism — and I think that people,
particularly in certain countries, want to see the sovereignty for their country, they want
to see nationalism for their country. They don’t believe in this kind of pan-European
Union or they don’t believe in the centralized government in the United States. They’d
rather see more of a states-based entity that the founders originally set up where

freedoms were controlled at the local level.

° This incident allegedly occurred on in May 2011 on a CFI cruise. We understand that CFI staff were
informed that you had propositioned a female cruise-goer, who rejected an invitation to join you and your
female companion for sex in your cabin.

° At least two CFI staffers were sufficiently concerned about reports of your behavior that they urged
CFI’s president not to invite you on a 2014 cruise of the Galapagos Islands. You were invited on that cruise,
however.

Incident 6:

° During a visit to Melbourne, Australia, in November 2016, you were accused of sexual misconduct once
again.

° The incident happened at a dinner held at the Melbourne Zoo as part of the Australian Skeptics
National Convention, where you were a featured speaker.

° With conference delegates chatting over drinks, a woman asked you for a celebrity selfie.

° As the woman held out her phone to take the picture, you reached over her shoulder and grabbed her
right breast.

° She immediately reacted, bodychecking you and spinning around. “Don’t do that,” she said.

° BuzzFeed News has seen the complaint made by another woman to ASU, ANU, and the New College

of the Humanities in London, including the selfie, her face obscured to conceal her identity. It shows your hand
in motion as a blur in front of her shoulder, apparently moving toward her chest. Two other eyewitnesses have
confirmed the complainant's account of what happened.

° In April 2017, the complainant described the incident on her blog. After hearing more about your
reputation for inappropriate behavior from blog readers, she decided to file a complaint about the Nov. 2016
incident.

° On July 16, she filed formal complaints with Arizona State University, and with the Australian National
University in Canberra and the New College of the Humanities in London, where you have visiting
appointments.

° Both Arizona State and the Australian National University told her they would look into the matter. But
neither university found against you.

° “Based on the material available to the University, we do not have sufficient evidence to substantiate
the allegations,” Kiaran Kirk, dean of the College of Science at the Australian National University, wrote to her.

° Erin Ellison, who heads Arizona State’s Office of Equity & Inclusion, wrote to her explaining that an
inquiry “did not find a violation of university policy.”

° In October, Arizona State denied a request from BuzzFeed News for documents relating to complaints
of sexual harassment against you. However, Cynthia Jewett, the university's senior associate general counsel,
noted that two individuals, neither affiliated with the university, had complained about you. “The University did
not find either communication to state a credible allegation,” Jewett wrote.

Miscellaneous facts:

° In 2008, you founded the Origins Project at Arizona State University in Tempe, a multidisciplinary effort
to understand the origins of the universe, life, and social systems. You have led that effort ever since.

e Thanks to best-selling books like The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe From Nothing, frequent
essays in publications including the New Yorker and the New York Times, and the documentary you made with
biologist Richard Dawkins, called The Unbelievers, you are celebrated as one of America’s leading public
intellectuals.

° You served on the science policy committee for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign and are a
vocal critic of President Donald Trump.

Again quoting ExxonMobil management:

Just as we progressed rapidly at Liza, we'll move quickly to develop Payara if the

Recall that Hess management has suggested Payara will ‘definitely be commercial’.
However at this early stage we assume no value for Payara in our assessed value of
Hess’ not least as any attempt at precision is obviously premature. But with discussions
with management suggesting scenarios through appraisal where Payara is a lookalike to
Liza, we believe a ‘plus three year’ development scheme is a reasonable basis to frame
option value in a success case.

Under our $70 Brent base case, the theoretical NPV would be around $10/sh. This is on
top of the approximate $12-14/ share value we estimate is reasonable for Hess from
the existing Liza discovery. Note we continue to assume about 400,000 bpd gross
development scenario-reviewed again below to reflect the latest project proposal
submitted to the Guyana Government which now targets first production in 2H19.

Note we assume negligible value for natural gas revenue in this latest iteration, thus the

structure in our country.

Naturally, our children and new generations will remain the actual solution for this question. Hence, the
development of education, the competencies and capabilities of the UAE nationals will remain our main
priority. We are optimistic about our youth, and proud of their spirit of national belonging, of their growing
realization of the importance of self-reliance and active participation in building the homeland. I follow their
activities and expect a great deal from them, and ask them to double their efforts in learning and enhancing their
competencies in various fields, in20orders to become a distinguished group eagerly sought after by public and
private sectors. We are eager to increase the rate of Emiratization in government and private sectors. I informed
the Cabinet last march that the rate of Emiratization in the ministries has not reached the targeted level, as it did
not exceed 54 percent and 25 percent in the Federal Authorities. I gave directives to prepare a study to denote
the reasons for such a situation in order to draw suitable programs to fill this gap.

By Al-Sharq al-Awsat Daily

Almost a year ago, Your Highness introduced a major reshuffle in the Cabinet. You
mentioned that any minister is liable to change. Is there a plan for a cabinet reshuffle
soon?

There is a fact which should not be absent from the minds of people — that is, the government 1s at the service of
the people. A reshuffle is introduced when there is a need for it, and when we find that it suits an active
handling of the need of national demands, to ensure the power of the union to achieve the objectives of its
strategy, and whatever objective that may come up to meet the actual developments. I still say that any minister
or a man of responsibility entrusted with him is open to replacement by another one who is more capable of
shouldering that responsibility. The basic reference in any decision of this type is the criteria of performance
and level of fulfillment of plans for development projec ts.

By Al-Sharq al-Awsat Daily

Frankly, people outside the Emirates think there is a kind of sensitivity among the seven
Emirates. With reference to the federal system adopted by the state, how do you respond
to that?

I do not understand what you mean by “sensitivity” and the relation of the word to the federal system. But I
know the reason behind your question: it is the media reports which tried, in handling the reflections of the
international financial crisis on the UAE, to place hurdles and fabricate differences between Abu Dhabi and
Dubai. These are vicious attempts that ignored the way the UAE faced the repercussions of the global financial
crisis and the superb performance of our federal entities, under the leadership of His Highness, the President of
the UAE. The performance was excellent, and it presented a new proof of the capability and power of the
federation to face difficult challenges. Anyhow, since you brought the subject up, it is useful to remind
everybody that the seven Emirates chose the federal system, realizing that it is the most viable system to
survive and develop. The founding fathers had wisdom, vision and a future perspective. Whoever knows the
history of the area and its situation prior to the establishment of the union will realize the great achievement of
the union in the establishment of the UAE. Ifthe results are the test, then look at the advance and achievements
of the UAE20after 37 years of the Union. The UAE 1s a state of institutions governed by a constitution, which
covers the allocation of responsibilities to local and federal authorities. Like all federal states, the Federal
government is concerned with all the sovereign affairs, whether related to defense policy, the armed forces,
national security, foreign policy, and financial policy, legislations related to justice, economy, labor or
residence of foreigners.

The work release was approved by the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office,
said spokeswoman Therese Barbera.

“Jeffrey Epstein, while in custody, met the criteria for the Work Release
Program,” Barbera wrote in an email. “There was no factual basis to deny
Mr. Epstein the same availability of this program that is offered to other
inmates under similar circumstances. Mr. Epstein was closely monitored

and there were no problems encountered during his time in the program.”

But the sheriff’s own work release policy — a copy of which Barbera provided
to the Herald — specifically notes that sex offenders aren’t eligible for work While officially confined to the Palm Beach County stockade, serving time for his sex

2009. But his court papers clearly listed him as a sex offender. In fact, the papers Epstein signed — obtained by the Herald — included all the laws
governing registered sex offenders in Florida.

Barbera refused to explain why Epstein was seemingly allowed to deviate from the agency’s policies. She also would not respond to requests for an
accounting of the amount of money that Epstein paid the sheriff’s office for his private details.

Palm Beach Sheriff Ric Bradshaw, who has been in office since 2004 — and is widely considered to be one of the most powerful people in the county — did
not respond to requests for comment.

Aspokeswoman for Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw declined to say why Jeffrey Epstein was allowed work-release status despite rules prohibiting work release for sex
offenders. Taylor Jones PALM BEACH POST

Epstein’s registration requirements are somewhat confusing, even to those who are responsible for keeping his registration. The Florida Department of
Law Enforcement, which keeps the online registry, and the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office, where Epstein has to register in person twice a year, gave

program back by years. And even if the Iranians knew it was coming, they’d be
able to do nothing to stop it.

“Our problem, Mr, President,” I said, “is that we can’t be sure our friend will
show up. Since Iran is already very nearly in a zone of immunity against an Israeli
attack, we can’t afford to wait until the afternoon. By then, with our capabilities,
we won’t even be able to give the bully a black eye.” I said I trusted what he’d just
told me. “I’m sure it genuinely reflects your intentions now. But there are no
futures contracts in statesmanship. There’s no way that you, or any leader, can
commit yourself to what will happen in a year or two. When the moment of
decision arrives, nothing will be able to free you from the responsibility to look at
the situation as it is then, with American interests in mind.”

He accepted the point. But he reiterated his view that “kinetic action” — US
security-speak for a military strike — would not only remove his ability to exhaust
the non-military alternatives. He said it wouldn’t be in Israel’s interests, either.
“We hear that even people high up in your military, in military intelligence and the
Mossad, are against it.”

That, I couldn’t deny. “We highly respect our top people in the military, and in
intelligence. We make a point of listening to them before taking action,” I said.
“But here’s the difference. When they look up, they see Netanyahu, or me. When
Bibi and I look up, we see heaven. Whoever is up there, we clearly can’t go to
them for advice. We are responsible for Israel’s security.”

The president smiled, but brought the discussion back down to earth. When he
again urged us to consider the American position in any decision, I replied: “Mr
President, I feel compelled to tell you frankly how I see the situation. We highly
appreciate, and are grateful, that America supports Israel in so many ways. I
believe we’re doing our best to support American interests in the Middle East as
well. But when it comes to issues critical for the security and future of Israel, and
in a way for the future of the Jewish people, we can’t afford to delegate
responsibility even to our best friend and ally. When we face such situations, we
have to decide on our own, and act on our decisions. I would expect the United
States, and you as its president, to respect that position.” He did not seem
especially happy with what I’d said. But he showed no anger. Though we differed,
it was clear that he understood and respected our position. In any case, I believed it

well before the festivities. Before we get
to the matter of coalition politics, which
is very much on our minds right now as
Netanyahu struggles to put together a
government, let us consider the other
negative part of the Peres legacy: his stint
as Defense Minister under Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin from 1974 to 1977. Today
Peres is widely respected as the architect
of the Oslo Accord of 1993, achieved
while he was Foreign Minister. It was the
first political move toward a settlement
between Israel and the Palestinians, and
Peres deserves huge credit for securing
the agreement. However, two decades
earlier, as Defense Minister, he supported
the Jewish settlement project in the
newly-conquered Palestinian territories,
both overtly and covertly. Not for
nothing did Rabin label Peres in his
memoirs as “an indefatigable intriguer.”
In 1975, while Rabin was doing his
utmost to prevent the settlement of Elon
Moreh, near Nablus, Peres continuously
sabotaged his efforts. After no less than
eight settlement attempts, which were
ruled illegal by Israel’s Supreme Court, a
“compromise” was reached, and Elon
Moreh was established five kilometers to
the east of the original site. Moreover,
during the furor over Elon Moreh,
Defense Minister Peres quietly facilitated
the creation of Ofra, near Ramallah.

At times, some prosecutors felt that we should just go to
trial, and at times I felt that frustration myself. What was
right in the first meeting, however, remained right irre-
spective of defense tactics. Individuals have a constitu-
tional right to a defense. The aggressive exercise of that
right should not be punished, nor should a defense coun-
sel’s exercise of their right to appeal a U.S Attorney to
Washington D.C. Prosecutors must be careful not to allow
frustration and anger with defense counsel to influence
their judgment.

After the plea, I recall receiving several phone calls.
One was from the FBI Special Agent-In-Charge. He called
to offer congratulations. He had been at many of the
meetings regarding this case. He was aware of the tactics
of the defense, and he called to praise our prosecutors for
holding firm against the likes of Messrs. Black, Dershow-
itz, Lefkowitz and Starr. It was a proud moment. | also
received calls or communications from Messrs. Dershow-
itz, Lefkowitz and Starr. I had known all three individu-
als previously, from my time in law school and at
Kirkland & Ellis in the mid 90s. They all sought to make
peace. I agreed to talk and meet with each of them after
Epstein pled guilty, as I think it important that prosecu-
tors battle defense attorneys in a case and then move on. I
have tried, yet I confess that this has been difficult to do
fully in this case.

The bottom line is this: Mr. Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire,

schools, country houses and vacations.

Back on the set Oliver is shooting the actual dinner. Assistant directors ask for volunteers to dance to the live
music. Prince Dimitri twirls and dips Jackie Weld. Kelly Klein, in her own Karl Lagerfeld sheer black organza,
watches from a table with scattered champagne glasses half-filled with apple juice along with her 86-year-old
father, Tulley Rector. Charlie Sheen leaves for LA and Shia is very annoyed he was not introduced to his
hero. Carrie Mulligan, costumed like Audrey Hepburn, chats with us between takes.

The final set up is a long tracking shot of Josh Brolin and his wife as they triumphantly enter the ball. It is
close to 9 p.m. and Lord William Astor arrives to pick me up for Amalia Dayan and Adam Lindemann's dinner
for artists uptown.

Oliver is introduced to William and delights in calling him Lord as he immediately moves him into the top of
the shot and instructs him to tell Eli Wallach, We must do lunch. Ever the proper English gentleman,
William advises Oliver that Lords do not use American slang and improvises his own lines. The tracking shot
continues for numerous takes following Josh and Noelle as every VIP extra gets another shot at instant stardom
with one-line greetings.

At last, “It’s a wrap” is screamed after 10 p.m. Prince Dimitri tells The Wall Street Journal it was, a day of
electrifying glamour, and “the longest gala of my life. I was in black tie for thirteen hours.”

could observe New York's most charismatic powerbroker in his natural environment.

The scene is London so the grey skies are perfect. Gekko has moved abroad to make his financial

comeback. The scene opens on the back of his head in a barber's chair as he watches the financial news on TV.
The camera pulls back and Gordon Gekko is finally revealed as the powerful bull he once was in an exquisite
suit and signature slicked-back hair. Donald Trump walks into the shop for a cut and the banter begins about
the money market. From his chair, Donald leans into Michael and suggests a comb over like his famous

The crew is yucking it up and Donald feels great. Paparazzi shoot the whole scene with long lenses from across
the street. The unit publicist is helpless to keep this under wraps. Donald emerges, poses and gives interviews.
Michael comes out, and the press think they have a scoop on the ending. Gekko is back in all his lovable titan
splendor. Full-page photos of Michael and Donald run the next day in the tabloids. Never underestimate Oliver

consequences described above. No rulings have been or will be requested from the IRS.
Furthermore, any changes in the principal agreements relating to the Fund or the operations of
the Fund could affect the tax consequences described above.

Consultation with Tax Advisors - The description of U.S. tax matters set forth above is not
intended as a substitute for careful tax planning. It does not address all of the U.S. federal
income tax consequences to investors in the Fund, and does not address any of the foreign,
state, local, estate or other tax consequences of such investment to any investor, except as
otherwise specifically provided. Each prospective investor in the Fund is solely responsible for
all tax consequences to that person or entity of an investment in the Fund. Each prospective
investor is advised to consult its own tax counsel as to the U.S. federal income tax consequences
attributable to acquiring, holding and disposing of an Limited Partner Interest and as to
applicable foreign, state, local, estate or other taxes. The effect of existing U.S. income tax laws
and treaties, the tax laws of other jurisdictions to which an investor may be subject, and possible
changes in such laws and treaties (including proposed changes which have not yet been
adopted) will vary with the particular circumstances of each investor.

CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS

ERISA governs the investment of assets of ERISA Plans that may be investors, directly or
indirectly, in the Fund. ERISA, the regulations under ERISA issued by the United States
Department of Labor (the “DOL”) and opinions and other authority issued by the DOL and the
courts provide guidance that should be considered by fiduciaries of ERISA Plans prior to
investing in the Fund.

The following discussion of certain ERISA considerations is based on statutory authority and
judicial and administrative interpretations as of the date hereof and is designed only to provide
a general understanding of the basic issues. Accordingly, this discussion should not be
considered legal advice and the trustees and other fiduciaries of each ERISA Plan are
encouraged to consult their own legal advisors on these matters.

Fiduciary Duty of Investing Plans

A fiduciary considering investing assets of an Employee Plan (“plan assets”) in the Fund should
consult its legal adviser before making such an investment. Before authorizing an investment in
the Fund, any such fiduciary should, after considering the Employee Plan’s particular
circumstances, be satisfied that the investment of such plan assets in the Fund is appropriate
under the fiduciary standards of ERISA, including standards with respect to prudence,
diversification and compliance with the governing documents of the Employee Plan and its
related trust and the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code.

Plan Assets
ERISA and the regulation issued by the DOL at 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-101, as modified or deemed to
be modified by ERISA (the “Plan Assets Regulation”), define the term “plan assets” as applied

to entities in which a plan invests, directly or indirectly, such as the Fund. The Plan Assets
Regulation provides that when an ERISA Plan acquires an equity interest in an entity, and such

ordeal of the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq and the long occupation
that followed. Had the United States been successful in Iraq, Syria
would have been the next target, as pro-Israel neocons, the main
architects of the Iraq war, had intended. Syria was then confronted by
the 2005 Lebanese crisis, triggered by the assassination of former
prime minister Rafik Hariri. Syrian forces were ousted from Lebanon
and the Assad regime threatened with extinction by the combined
pressures of the United States and France.

There is also a much older memory that still hangs like a dark cloud --
that of the massacres at Hama in central Syria in 1982. It was then
that Hafez al-Assad put down, with great violence, an armed
insurrection by the Muslim Brothers. Beginning in 1977, this Islamic
group had launched a series of terrorist attacks against the regime,
murdering several of the president’s close associates and eventually
seizing control of Hama, where they killed Ba’ath Party and
government officials. The regime regained control of the town, but
only after a bloodbath in which between 10,000 and 20,000 people
lost their lives.

Thirty years later, some Islamists still dream of revenge, while
minorities such as the Alawites fear that if the regime were to fall,
they would be massacred in turn. Emerging from underground, the
Muslim Brothers have now called on the people to join the protests.
The cry for freedom risks being drowned by sectarian strife.

Such has been Bashar al-Assad’s harsh apprenticeship. He has had to
surmount a series of regime-threatening crises much like those his
father confronted in his time. Both Assads felt some satisfaction at
managing to survive them and thus provide Syria with a measure of
stability and security, especially compared with Iraq and Lebanon.
There was, however, a price to pay. Having to live and survive in a
hostile environment inevitably conferred great powers on the security
services, guardians of the regime -- to the increasing resentment of

Rule #5: No homework unless that homework is to produce
something.

Now let’s have a look at mistake #6.

Mistake #6: Thinking that because students have chosen to take
your course, they have an interest in learning what you plan to
teach them

Professors who typically teach courses that students have chosen
voluntarily to take generally are under the illusion that students have
come to the course hoping to learn what they intend to teach. Noth-
ing could be further from the truth. Unless you are teaching human
sexuality or how to get a job, or abnormal psychology, you generally
can expect that students have very little interest in the content you
are about to share and a great interest in the grade you eventually are
going to give them. The reason for this is simple enough. Professors
are teaching a subject.

Subject, in the university world, is a euphemism for profession.
The profession of English professors is something other than teaching
English—it is being a professional in some subspecialty in literature
or some allied field. Similarly, a professor of psychology has an area of
research within psychology that is his real profession. When a profes-
sor teaches, he is teaching how things work in his profession and he
is teaching the basics of being in that profession. The percentage of
undergraduates in a class that actually want to enter the profession
of the professors is very small. Most have no intention whatsoever of
entering the profession of the professors. So, they recognize instantly
that what they are learning is very unlikely to be of use to them in
their later lives. Some take it seriously anyway and some don’t. But for
the most part students really aren’t much interested in what a profes-
sor is teaching.

They don’t listen and they don’t do what you ask them to do. Why
not? They may be lazy, but that isn’t the real reason. It may be true
that they are taking four other classes, but that also isn’t the real rea-
son. The real reason has to do with the inherent value of work, which
is one of the real issues in the transformation from subject-based edu-
cation to cognitive process-based education. Students can feel, rightly,
that they have read enough Dickens or have solved enough equations

Were Vastly Underestimated

* In 1965, the official estimate of Medicare’s costs was $500 million per year,
roughly $3 billion in 2005 dollars.*

* The actual cost of Medicare has turned out to be 10x that estimate.

- Medicare’s actual net loss (tax receipts + trust fund interest — expenditures)

was $146 billion in 2008 alone. In other words, had the original estimate been
accurate, the cumulative 43-year cost since Medicare was created would
have been $129 billion, adjusted for inflation.

- In fact, the actual cumulative spending has been $1.4 trillion** (adjusted for
inflation)...in effect, 10x over budget.

* While calculations have been flawed from the beginning for some of USA Inc.’s
entitlement programs, little has been done to correct the problems.

ended, unchallenged, control of the West Bank.

Even the Labor party, fifteen years into Israel’s occupation of the West
Bank, was still speaking about a “Jordanian option” for an eventual political
settlement with the Palestinians who lived there — though this meant a kind of
confederation with Jordan under Hussein’s rule. Very few Israelis began
seriously to engage with the Palestinians own separate identity or national
aspirations until later in the 1980s — when I, too, would do so, amid the
widespread Palestinian unrest known as the intifada. But even without a fully
thought-out view on these issues, I was taken aback by Arik’s almost godlike
supposition that he could use fire and brimstone, or the modern military
equivalent, to remake the Middle East as he and Begin wished to see it. If only
because of the tacit assumption that the outside world, and especially the
Americans, would sit by and let the whole drama play out as scripted, it struck
me as an exercise in self-delusion.

There was also the matter of Arik’s vision of a “new” Lebanon under Bashir
Gemayel’s Phalangists. Unlike the other generals in the kirya, I’d never actually
met any of our “Lebanese Christian allies”. Yet a few weeks after taking up my
new post, I was invited to a lunchtime discussion with a group of Phalangist
officers on a training course in Israel. I emerged both unsettled and
underwhelmed. They were obviously politically astute. They bandied around
military vocabulary proficiently enough. But they were a bit like teenagers
playing with guns: full of macho, and too much after-shave. Hardly the kind of
“army” I could see as a lynchpin in Arik’s plan to redraw the geopolitical map
of the Middle East.

By June 1982, Arik’s invasion was a war simply waiting for a credible
trigger. On the evening of June 3, Palestinian terrorists shot and critically
wounded Israel’s ambassador in London, Shlomo Argov. Appalling though the
attack was, as a catalyst for a full-scale invasion, it seemed unlikely to be
enough for the Reagan Administration. Habib’s cease-fire terms did not include
terror attacks like the one in London. It was meant to keep the PLO from firing
across our northern border. Even to some Israelis, the attack on Ambassador
Argov seemed more a rationale than a reason for war. But Begin summoned an

CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT

Snowden’s Choices

“Tt is the choices we make that show who we truly are”

J.K Rowling, the Philosopher’s Stone

Whereas Russian authorities had the opportunity to thoroughly debrief Snowden as to his
motive for stealing state secrets, US authorities did not have that opportunity (and it seems
unlikely that they will have it in the foreseeable future.) So Snowden’s motive is a missing part of
the puzzle. It also cannot even be assumed that he had a single consistent motive during the nine-
month course of his illicit copying of documents. Snowden has shown, if nothing else, that he is
adaptable. He may have began taking documents for one reason and found other reasons as he
proceeded in his quest. Many of the circumstances of his probes, contacts, theft and escape
remain disputed by his supporters and shrouded by the secrecy of the NSA. What we do know is
that Snowden made four extraordinary choices during the nine month period in 2013 that speak to
the concerns that may have guided his actions. In the case of a classified intelligence breach, as
in a chess game, the sequence of moves a player makes provides an important clue to his strategy.

The first move that Snowden made in preparation of the Level 3 breach was switching jobs on
March 15th 2013. Snowden chose to leave his job as a system administrator at Dell SecureWorks
to take job at Booz Allen as an analyst-in-training. His motive was not money, as it was a lower-
paying position. At the time, he made this choice he had already set up an encrypted channel with
Laura Poitras for the purpose of sending her secret material. But he did not have to change jobs
to send her secrets. So what was his purpose in making this fateful choice?

The job change was not necessary to expose NSA domestic activities. If he had only wanted to
be a whistle-blower, there were ample documents about the NSA’s activities already available to
him on the NSANet. He also had access at Dell to the administrative file which contained the
FISA court orders issued every three months to Verizon. In addition, as the NSA’s damage
assessment established, before switching jobs Snowden had already taken most of the documents
pertaining to the NSA’s domestic operations that he could have supplied to Poitras and
Greenwald for whistle-blowing purposes. Indeed, while still at Dell, it will be recalled, he had he
had told Poitras he had a copy of Presidential Policy Directive 20, a document in which President
Obama authorized the NSA to tap into fiber cables crossing the United States. Snowden
described it to her as “a kind of martial law for cyber operations, created by the White House.”
True, he took a more recently-issued FISA warrant and PRISM presentation in April after
switching jobs, but he could have just as easily taken the January 2013 version of the FISA
warrant from the administrative file of Dell. It would have had the same explosive effect in the
media.

Nor did he switch jobs to lessen the risk of getting caught. He actually put himself in far greater
jeopardy by switching jobs. At Dell he was relatively safe from apprehension since he could take
documents, such as the above-mentioned Presidential Policy Directive 20, from access points at
the NSA shared by many of his peers. Since these shared access points provided the equivalent of
a common reading room at a library, it would be difficult to trace the theft of any documents
taken from them to a particular user. Indeed, if he just wanted to expose the NSA’s domestic

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020362

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011101.txt,"house they would have bought. They will not have missed a sure-fire investment.
The crash of 2008 showed that houses are risky too. The time to commit to huge and
illiquid investments, as houses are, is after ten or fifteen years of business

experience.

I see no reason why lending banks should not make equity investments too. Loans,
convertible loans and equity investments need the same “due diligence”, or research
into prospects of success and return. All might serve the same clients. “Lending
banks” might simply be investment banks. That’s why splitting of investment banks
and commercial (deposit-and-lend) banks may be a step in the wrong direction. The

key is splitting off deposits.

Macroeconomics in General

Splitting up commercial banks into omnibus funds and depositless lending banks
could change the nature of macroeconomics. Macro has meant the art of maintaining
growth and money value stability at the same time. This has proved mostly a
tightrope walk between inflation and recession. Easy money risks the first, and tight
money the second. My idea is to disconnect the problems of underemployment and
money value instability. If medicine for one has no side effect on the other, each can

be treated more freely.

I would first dissociate money value from money supply. No supply is too large if
money earns competitive returns while we hold it. That was one of the main ideas of
the omnibus fund. Milton Friedman thought my early version of this idea was
anathema. Franco Modigliani liked it fine, but asked tough questions. I'll try to

answer some of them below.

My approach to the problems of underemployment and the business cycle begins

with phasing out deposit-and-lend banks as | described. | more or less agree with

specifically about your work, Breitbart is very close to the tea party movement. So I’m just
wondering whether you could tell me about if in the current flow of contemporary politics
— first tell us a little bit about Breitbart, what the mission is, and then tell me about the
reach that you have and then could you say a little bit about the current dynamic of what’s
going on at the moment in the States.

Bannon: Outside of Fox News and the Drudge Report, we’re the third-largest
conservative news site and, quite frankly, we have a bigger global reach than even Fox.
And that’s why we’re expanding so much internationally.

Look, we believe — strongly — that there is a global tea party movement. We've seen that.
We were the first group to get in and start reporting on things like UKIP and Front
National and other center right. With all the baggage that those groups bring — and trust
me, a lot of them bring a lot of baggage, both ethnically and racially — but we think that
will all be worked through with time.

The central thing that binds that all together is a center-right populist movement of really
the middle class, the working men and women in the world who are just tired of being
dictated to by what we call the party of Davos. A group of kind of — we’re not conspiracy-
theory guys, but there’s certainly — and I could see this when I worked at Goldman Sachs
— there are people in New York that feel closer to people in London and in Berlin than
they do to people in Kansas and in Colorado, and they have more of this elite mentality
that they’re going to dictate to everybody how the world’s going to be run.

I will tell you that the working men and women of Europe and Asia and the United States
and Latin America don’t believe that. They believe they know what’s best for how they will
comport their lives. They think they know best about how to raise their families and how
to educate their families. So I think you're seeing a global reaction to centralized
government, whether that government is in Beijing or that government is in Washington,

DC, or that government is in Brussels. So we are the platform for the voice of that.

“Putin’s ... very, very very intelligent. I can see this in the United States where he’s
playing very strongly to social conservatives about his message about more traditional
values, so I think it’s something that we have to be very much on guard of.”

sensitivity to punishment and the capacity for self-control, these differences are statistical. What
“statistical” means is that if you were to stack up all of the brains with hyperactive dopamine circuits and
smaller frontal lobes into one pile, most, but not all would be from psychopaths. You would also find
psychopaths in the pile of brains showing normal dopamine activity and average-sized frontal lobes.
These brain differences are interesting, but they are not yet like fingerprints, absolutely and uniquely
distinctive and diagnostic of a disorder. Such honesty reveals the challenges we face in answering the
simple question What’s normal?

Lawyers, judges and juries face the same problem as clinicians, often relying upon documents
such as the DSM to determine when someone has acted outside the range of normal behavior. But for
legal cases, there are two relevant layers of the normalcy problem. The first concerns whether the
supposed criminal was sane or insane. An insanity defense requires evidence of a disease or defect of the
mind. It requires evidence that the individual lacked the capacity to appreciate the criminal nature of the
act as well as the capacity to conform. This is the part that relies on the DSM, as well as clinicians who
can testify based on their expertise. The second concerns a more general understanding of what a
prototypical or normal human would or could do in a given situation. The idea seems straightforward
enough, but as I mentioned above, is only deceptively straightforward.

Crimes of passion provide a useful illustration of the challenges we face, especially with respect
to understanding how harm is ignited in the face of moral norms against it. Highlighting the truism that
love makes you crazy, the crime of passion defense is invoked for cases where, in the heat of the moment,
an individual finds and kills his or her spouse in bed with a lover. The defining feature of a crime of
passion is that it was not planned and most people faced with the same situation would act similarly,
unable to control their emotions.

The crime of passion defense seems straightforward. Like autism and psychopathy, however, it
too relies upon a diagnosis of what a prototypical or average person would do in the same situation. This
diagnosis requires an understanding of two difficult mental states: planning and self-control. Planning
involves imagining the future, time traveling to a new world, dreaming up what we might do and how we
might feel. We plan in the short and long term, filling up our mental sticky notes with to-do lists. Self-
control enters into planning because what we imagine for ourselves — what we desire — 1s often
inappropriate or unethical because it harms others or ourselves. As noted in chapters 2 and 3, the capacity
to keep desire in check relies on moral engagement. Moral engagement requires self-control. Moral
disengagement requires denial in order to loosen the grip of self-control and enable desire to have its

way.

Jane Doe 3 is Virginia Roberts - so not a new individual. The allegations made by Victoria
Roberts against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue. The original allegations are not new and have
been fully responded to and shown to be untrue.

Each time the story is re told it changes with new salacious details about public figures and
world leaders and now it is alleged by Ms Roberts that Alan Derschowitz is involved in having
sexual relations with her, which he denies.

Ms Roberts claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such and not publicised as news, as
they are defamatory.

Ghislaine Maxwell's original response to the lies and defamatory claims remains the same.
Maxwell strongly denies allegations of an unsavoury nature, which have appeared in the British
press and elsewhere and reserves her right to seek redress at the repetition of such old
defamatory claims.

Mr. DERSHOWITZ. Well, I would submit that most politicians that get up and
make political speeches are doing it for a motive which is not unrelated to that.
Yet we don’t probe the motives of Presidents and Vice-presidents and Senators in
speaking. Nor should we probe the motives of newspaper publishers and film
producers.

JUDGE JULIAN. Perhaps they should be probed.

Mr. DERSHOWITZ. I think the First Amendment would be virtually a dead
letter; [if] we would only permit people to speak who spoke simply for art for art’s
sake or politics for politics’ sake...

Here we’re talking about something where money is being paid in order to show
the film and nobody can suggest that the film should be shown in this country for
free or at cost. There would simply be no films being manufactured in this country
and that aspect of the First Amendment will have substantially suffered.

I then returned to my distinction between an enclosed theater and an open display.

If Grove Press were to put up a billboard...above a large area where people
congregate and there were to be an alleged obscene picture on the billboard, and
the state were to try to enjoin that, I would have to [concede that there might be
some harm to people who didn’t want to be exposed to obscenity. ]

JUDGE JULIAN. That’s a very generous concession.

Mr. DERSHOWIZ. But in this case I do submit nobody is being exposed to
anything that he doesn’t want to be exposed to at all. The only thing that people
are being exposed to is the fact that they know that a film is being played in Boston
or in Springfield, and that fact, if it offends people, is not entitled to constitutional

protection so long as they can avoid being exposed directly to the contents of the
film.

Judge Aldrich was intrigued by this last point and said that he wished to pursue it further. I knew

I was in for some tough questioning:
JUDGE ALDRICH. I wish to pursue that point. I happen to be very straight
laced. Every time I walk down through Harvard Square and I see there is a movie
going on there that I know is obscene, of course, I don’t have to go in. I can
protect myself. But I’m offended by the fact that I see all these students who are
age 21 and a half going in and that we are maintaining in my home town, in which
I have such great pride, we are maintaining this house—I use the word “house”
advisedly—filthy pictures are being shown. Do I have any interests or rights?

Judge Aldrich had put his finger directly on the vicarious offensiveness rationale for
censorship. I needed to come up with an answer that didn’t devalue his concerns (and his
grandmother’s).

In their Rule 21 Motion, Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 do not claim that they were omitted
from this proceeding due to any “inadvertence” or “mistake” by Petitioners; rather, they seek to
join this proceeding as parties that could have been permissively joined in the original petition
under Rule 20 (“Permissive Joinder of Parties”). As courts generally use the standards of Rule
15 to evaluate such circumstances, the Court will consider the joinder issue as presented in the
Rule 15 Motion.' The Court will consider the arguments presented in the Rule 21 Motion as if
they are set forth in the Rule 15 Motion as well. Because the arguments are presented in the Rule
15 Motion (and because the Court is denying the Rule 15 Motion on its merits, as discussed
below), the Rule 21 Motion will be denied.

The Court also concludes that portions of the Rule 21 Motion—and related
filings—should be stricken from the record. Pending for this Court’s consideration is a Motion
for Limited Intervention filed by Alan M. Dershowitz, who seeks to intervene to “strike the
outrageous and impertinent allegations made against him and [to] request[] a show cause order to
the attorneys that have made them.” (DE 282 at 1). The Court has considered Mr. Dershowitz’s
arguments, but it finds that his intervention is unnecessary as Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
12(f) empowers the Court “on its own” to “strike from a pleading an insufficient defense or any
redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f).

Petitioners’ Rule 21 Motion consists of relatively little argumentation regarding why the

Court should permit them to join in this action: they argue that (1) they were sexually abused by

' The Court notes that, regardless of which motion it considers, the same standard
governs the addition of parties under Rule 21 and Rule 15. See Goston v. Potter, No. 08-cv-478
FJS ATB, 2010 WL 4774238, at *5 (N.D.N.Y. 2010) (citing Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. Universal

Lawyers Acknowledge Mistake In Filing Sexual Misconduct Charges Against Professor Dershowitz

Professor Alan M. Dershowitz released the following statement regarding resolution of the case styled
Bradley Edwards, et al. v. Alan M. Dershowitz, Case No. CACE 15-000072 (Cir. Ct., Broward Cnty., Fla.).

STATEMENT OF ALAN M. DERSHOWITZ

| am pleased that the litigation has concluded and | am gratified by the

Joint Statement issued today by Jeffrey E. Streitfeld on behalf of the parties, in which
“Edwards and Cassell acknowledge that it was a mistake to have filed sexual misconduct
accusations against Dershowitz and the sexual misconduct accusations made in all public
filings (including all exhibits) are hereby withdrawn.” Mr. Streitfeld’s announcement and
the Joint Statement are copied below.

MEDIATOR (Streitfeldlaw.com)

It is my pleasure to report that Bradley J. Edwards, Paul G. Cassell, and Alan M.

Dershowitz have resolved their disputes and have agreed to settle the claims raised in an
action pending in the Broward County, Florida Circuit Court. Since being appointed by
Circuit Court Judge Thomas Lynch IV last fall, it has been a privilege to act as the mediator

agreement, the parties have issued the attached Joint Statement.

JOINT STATEMENT OF BRAD EDWARDS, PAUL CASSELL AND ALAN DERSHOWITZ REGARDING
SETTLEMENT

Brad Edwards, Paul Cassell and Alan Dershowitz have today settled their pending
defamation claims in which Edwards and Cassell sued Dershowitz and Dershowitz
counterclaimed against Edwards and Cassell. The case was about Dershowitz’s public
claims that Edwards and Cassell, as the attorneys for Virginia Roberts, had failed to perform
the necessary due diligence before filing the allegations of their client, not whether the acts
of alleged misconduct in fact occurred. Edwards and Cassell vigorously denied the
contention that they had acted improperly and asserted that it defamed them. Dershowitz
countersued Edwards and Cassell, alleging they had falsely accused him of sexual contact
with Roberts—a claim he vigorously denied and that Dershowitz asserted defamed him.
Edwards and Cassell maintain that they filed their client’s allegations in good faith and
performed the necessary due diligence to do so, and have produced documents detailing
those efforts. Dershowitz completely denies any such misconduct, while not disputing
Roberts’s statements that the underlying alleged misconduct may have occurred with
someone else. Dershowitz has produced travel and other records for the relevant times
which he relies on to establish that he could not have been present when the alleged

Deep Throat: Why I Chose Not to Watch It

My initial victory in the Am Curious Yellow case—getting a three judge court to declare
unconstitutional all obscenity laws that applied to adults-only theaters—made me something of a
hero in the “adult film” industry—and something of a pariah in the radical feminist community.
(More about the latter soon.) Many “obscenity” clients came my way, including the musical play
Hair which was “banned in Boston” and several “soft core” films such as the very forgettable
“Belinda’”** and the unforgettable hard core film, Deep Throat.*’

I’m told that Deep Throat is a very hard core and very bad movie. I can’t personally attest to
these claims because, to this day, I have not seen it.** I avoided seeing the film not because I’m a
prude—I enjoy a good erotic movie as much as the next guy—but rather because I wanted to
make a point about the law of obscenity: the decision to watch or not to watch a particular film
should be a matter of choice for every adult citizen. Just as I told the judges in the / Am Curious
Yellow case that they didn’t have to view the film in order to rule that an adult had the
constitutional right to view it in an adults-only theater, so too I had the right to argue that
position without myself viewing Deep Throat. To paraphrase my earlier case, I was “curious”
about Deep Throat, but cared more about the principle of choice. I also believed that my not
viewing the film was a good tactic that helped to dramatize my point.

I decided to use that tactic in two separate cases involving the Deep Throat case. The first was
the prosecution of porno-actor Harry Reems for his role as an actor in the film. Reems was the
first actor in history ever to be prosecuted for the crime of obscenity. He was charged with
participating in a nation-wide conspiracy to transport an obscene film in interstate commerce.

The United States government charged him with conspiracy because Reems himself had nothing
to do with distributing the film in interstate commerce. As the prosecutor acknowledged:

“[Reems] made the film, got his money and got out back in 1972, that is, he didn’t do
anything else as a part of the conspiracy, he didn’t do any more overt acts, he didn’t
participate any further, and the question arises why in the thunder does he wind up being
charged [with acts that took place] four years later?”

His answer was that “once a person joins a conspiracy, he is liable for everything that happens in
that conspiracy until it is ended.” (Reems once asked me whether he could have been charged
with murder under the prosecutor’s theory, if some strong-arm methods used by the distributors
had resulted in a death years after the film had been completed. I told him that—under the
prosecution theory—he could charged with that crime.)

© See The Best Defense pages 174-78.

37 T was also involved—either as a defense lawyer, consultant or commentator—in the defense of several magazines
and books. See e.g. Dershowitz, Shouting Fire, pages :
38 During a preview of a film off Broadway about the Deep Throat controversy I saw some soft core excerpts. They
were God awful.

the jewels in their crown of omniscience. “ Snowden also suggested that to avoid being
automatically “targeted” by the NSA, one should avoid “jihadi forums.” These tips for evading
U.S. and British surveillance, far from being an off-hand leakage of information, were supplied by
him in written answers to interrogatives sent to him by Laura Poitras and Jacob Appelbaum while
Snowden was still on the NSA payroll in May 2013. If he intended to damage the NSA’s ability
to monitor unsuspecting individuals abroad, he clearly succeeded. Just as Robert Hanssen had
compromised the NSA’s interception of communication at the Soviet Embassy in the 1990s,
Snowden compromised the NSA’s interception of Jihadist targets on the Internet.

The Snowden intervention was soon felt by the CIA. “Within weeks of the leaks,” writes
Michael Morell, then CIA deputy director. He notes that “Terrorist organizations around the
world were already starting to modify their actions in light of what Snowden disclosed.
Communication sources dried up.” What heightened Morell’s concern about this loss of
intelligence sources was the discovery a 26-page document on an ISIS computer in Syria
indicating that the terrorist group had been considering using plague germs and other biological
weapons on foreign targets. The NSA was also seeing the Snowden effect on the war on
terrorists. In 2013, the FBI, CIA, and DIA had compiled a watch list of some 400 foreign
terrorist targets for NSA’s PRISM program. Up until June 6, many of these targets frequently
used Internet services, such as Twitter, Facebook, and Xbox live, to send what they believed
would be hidden messages. After the PRISM story broke in the Washington Post on June 6, the
NSA “saw one after another target go dark,” according to a senior executive involved in that
surveillance. In 2014, Admiral Rogers, the new NSA director, was even blunter. Asked whether
or not the disclosures by Snowden had reduced the NSA’s ability to pursue terrorist, he
answered: “Have I lost capability that we had prior to the revelations? Yes.”

In Moscow, Snowden insists that not a single death has been traced back to his disclosures. I
agree that it would be unfair to jump to the conclusion that he is responsible for any single event,
such as the massacre in Paris in November 2015, because we cannot know whether or not a
jihadist involved in the event, such as Abdelhamid Abaaoud in the case of Paris, would have used
the Internet if Snowden had not exposed the interception of it by the NSA. But however sincere
were his intentions, Snowden cannot escape his responsibility for his actions. He totally and
purposefully compromised an intelligence operation that could prevent such villainous attacks.

sufficiency is monitored from tick to tick. Checking every few seconds doesn’t rule
out every doomsday scenario, but gives about as much confidence as we're going to

Saltwater and freshwater schools debate the wisdom of fiscal and monetary policy.
But both sides frame their arguments in Keynesian language. | find it wanting. The
idea that intended consumption is either invested or not, and realized in equal
capital growth if it is, misses the essential mechanics. It measures employment of
plant and people in hours rather than in production. This is a good reason why
macro should start again from scratch. Another is to recast its basis equations in
terms of market-valued capital as well as flows. Another is to accommodate human
capital, for example by substituting the pay and Y rules for the doctrines that pay

measures work and that output is investment plus consumption.

None of those good reasons refers to the possibility of omnibus funds. They are only
a gleam in my eye. If they come to pass, and succeed as | imagine, macro will have
still more novelty to digest. If they lead to devolution into separate deposit and
lending banks, with the deposit banks operating as omnibus funds, good riddance to
the 10:1 leverage that has brought down economies every generation or so since

Marco Polo’s time.

The lagged flow method of assessing efficacy of ex ante investment is outdated by
the simultaneous rates one outlined in Chapter 4. It should go to honorable
retirement whenever market-valued capital is available. It superimposes the
inevitable unintended lag of accounts themselves, even under best practices, onto
the intended one needed for the new tree planted to bear fruit. Both lags blur

causality.

Conclusion

Authoritarianism Comes Calling

Until very recently, the spread of the methods and strategies
described in this report has largely been greeted with complacency
and indifference in the democratic world. Even as it became clear
that the rejection of liberal values by Russia, China, and other
authoritarian states was a permanent fixture of global politics,
democracies convinced themselves that although modern
authoritarianism posed a challenge to the spread of freedom beyond
its current reach, their own freedoms were in no jeopardy.

In the aftermath of the stunning events of 2016, it is
apparent that the post-Cold War democratic order is
in fact facing an unprecedented threat. Britain’s vote
to leave the European Union (EU), the election of Don-
ald Trump as president of the United States, and the
emergence of populist demagogues across Europe
have all raised questions about the future of democra-
cy in its traditional bastions.

It can no longer be assumed that Russia's challenge
to democracy is limited to its policies of internal
repression and aggression toward neighbors like
Ukraine and Georgia. The Kremlin’s development of
parallel institutions—government-controlled civil
society, a propaganda machine based on the latest
media technologies, realistic but purely decorative
elections—was once regarded as a project intended
for Russia alone. When Angela Merkel, in response to
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, exclaimed that Vladimir
Putin lives in a different world, she meant a specif-
ically Russian universe where facts are irrelevant,
international treaties are obsolete, and sovereignty is
a matter of power rather than law.

Now, however, the Kremlin has attempted to project
this version of reality onto the democratic world. In
the United States, Russia brazenly interfered in the
electoral process through hacking efforts sponsored
by its intelligence agencies. Whether this interference
actually affected the outcome of the election is sub-

ject to debate. But there is strong evidence, endorsed
by the entirety of the U.S. intelligence establishment
and numerous independent analyses, that the inter-
ference did occur.

Just as worrying is the suggestion that the United
States, much like Russia itself, has entered a “post-truth
era,” in which lies and distortions carry as much weight
as facts. Clearly, at least some of this hand-wring-

ing was a partisan reaction to Trumps victory. But it
followed an election in which the winning candidate
falsely claimed, among other things, that the balloting
was rigged against him, that violent crime had reached
record levels, and that undocumented immigrants were
responsible for a large share of the violence.

Meanwhile, as of early 2017, populist parties with Rus-
sian-friendly platforms and histories of nativism and

other forms of bigotry were expected to gain ground in
upcoming elections in countries like the Netherlands,
France, and Germany.

As it became more obvious that the democracies
were poorly equipped to contend with resurgent
authoritarianism, the leading autocracies were exper-
imenting with more frightening methods of assuring
domestic political control.

China in particular seemed to take an Orwellian
turn with the planned introduction of a social credit

of Lebanon’s capital city, they linked up with Bashir Gemayel’s Phalangists.

I remember a mix of feelings at the time. Partly, amazement that through
sheer determination and political maneuvering, Arik seemed to have pulled off
his grand plan — or at least the Lebanon part of it. Yes, we’d ended up fighting a
kind of half-war against the Syrians which, though we’d won it, still left 30,000
of Assad’s men in Lebanon. And they showed no signs of leaving. Our main
strategic threat north of the border was not, in fact, the Palestinians. Syria was
in military control of Lebanon and, after the peace with Egypt, our most
powerful adversary. And no matter what Big Pines might have achieved, it
seemed to clear to me that the Syrians would be free simply to replace the
weaponry we’d destroyed and fight another day.

In Arik’s mind, Bashir Gemayel would soon be in a position to fix that. But
beyond my skepticism from having met some of his boy officers in Tel Aviv, I
couldn’t see how that would work. I strained to imagine Gemayel daring to
form what would amount to a formal alliance with Israel and ordering the
Syrian troops to leave. And given what would be at stake for Damascus, I
certainly couldn’t see the Phalangists being able to drive them out by force.

The more immediate, open question involved Arafat and the Palestinians.
Our other two invasion forces had driven almost all the PLO fighters out of
south Lebanon, though not without costs and casualties. Most of the
Palestinians, however, had retreated north to their de facto capital, the
southwestern neighborhoods of Beirut. The idea of a ground assault — street-to-
street battles in an area packed with fighters, weapons and tens of thousands of
civilians — didn’t bear thinking about. After the war, some of the officers around
Beirut said Arik seemed to hoping that the Phalangist milita would go into the
overwhelmingly Muslim western side of Beirut. At one point, he was even
considering an Israeli attack. Fortunately, given the Phalangists’ record of
violence bordering on savagery during the Lebanese civil war, Bashir Gemayel
wasn’t willing to send them in. As for an Israeli assault, Begin’s ministers
weren’t ready to sign off on it, and the Americans let it be know, repeatedly,
that they were vehemently opposed to the idea.

Arik again turned to a fallback plan. He knew that Begin did share his
determination to get Arafat and the PLO out of Lebanon. Even the Americans
were ready to support such an arrangement, assuming it could be negotiated and
implemented in a way that would bring the fighting to an end. Whether by
intent or political fortune, the mere prospect of Arik further expanding the

I'm up 50% on my BTC investment! 
Here's how Bitcoin charmed Washington 
BY TIMOTHY B. LEE 
• November 21 at 2:52 pm 
The Bitcoin Foundation's Patrick Murck testifies before the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee. (U.S. 
Senate) 
The pair of Bitcoin hearings held this week by Senate committees could have been a disaster for the 
Bitcoin community. After all, Bitcoin first came to mainstream attention in 2011 when 
Gawker reported on Silk Road, an anonymous online marketplace that allowed users to purchase a wide 
variety of illegal drugs with Bitcoin. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) denounced the site and suggested 
that Bitcoin was an online form of money laundering. A few months ago, it would have been easy to 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029963 
imagine the first congressional hearings on Bitcoin being a prelude to a federal crackdown on the 
decentralized financial network. 
But that's not what happened. Instead, the hearings were lovefests. All three Obama administration 
officials who testified this week stressed that Bitcoin has legitimate uses and argued that no new 
regulations were needed to police illicit uses of the network. Most of the other witnesses echoed those 
sentiments. 
That wasn't a coincidence. The cordial atmosphere of this week's hearings was the culmination of 
months of careful diplomacy by Bitcoin advocates. Since the spring, leaders of the Bitcoin community 
and sympathetic policy advocates have been engaging with federal regulators, lawmakers and other 
influential figures inside the beltway. The result: a near-unanimous consensus that the federal 
government needs to be careful to avoid hampering the growth of the world's first completely 
decentralized payment network. 
A tough crowd 
On the morning of June 13, several dozen well-dressed Washingtonians filed into the Carlucci 
Auditorium at the stately headquarters of the United States Institute of Peace. For many of the 
government officials in the room, this would be their first opportunity to meet senior figures in the 
Bitcoin community in the flesh. Panelists included lead Bitcoin developer Gavin Andressen and 
Patrick Murck, general counsel of the Bitcoin Foundation. 
The way the event was framed didn't augur well for Bitcoin. One of the conference's two sponsors 
(along with Thompson Reuters) was the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children. A 
major theme of the second panel was the use of bitcoins to purchase child pornography. 
Child pornography is like Bitcoin in some ways, said Andrew Oosterbaan, who prosecutes child 
pornography cases for the Justice Department. It has intrinsic value to people who want it. The more 
valuable child pornography is the new child pornography. When you add an anonymous currency, 
you've taken individuals who are already incentivized to produce, given them a far more meaningful 
incentive to do so. 
Bitcoin is nothing like child pornography, a visibly angry Murck shot back. If there was one 
instance of a child being abused because of Bitcoin, that's one too many. I'm a father, I think there's a 
special place in hell for people who do that. 
But Murck also stressed that the Bitcoin community was willing to work with federal regulators to 
ensure that Bitcoin-based businesses complied with applicable laws. I want to craft a sane regulatory 
environment, he said, urging federal regulators to engage stakeholders. Don't have secret meetings. 
Have public meetings. We're all happy to live with the consequences of whatever rulemaking is open 
and transparent. 
Murck would get his wish for engagement, though many of the meetings would be held behind closed 
doors. We always intended that conference to be a launching point, says Ernie Allen, the president 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029964 
of the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children and an organizer of the June 
conference. The gathering catalyzed the creation of a task force to consider how policymakers should 
respond to Bitcoin's emergence. It is expected to issue its recommendations early next year. 
Allen says that conversations among members of that task force have changed how he thinks about 
the online payment network. Allen now believes that premature regulation would be 
counterproductive. 
We are enthusiastic about the potential of virtual currencies and the digital economy, Allen said in 
his Monday testimony before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. 
Allen said he remained concerned about the use of the currency for exchanging child pornography, 
but he warned that draconian regulations could push Bitcoin enterprises underground and 
overseas, where it would be much harder to police for illicit uses. 
The Senate studies Bitcoin 
Staff on the Homeland Security Committee, which is chaired by Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), had been 
preparing for their Bitcoin hearing for several months. Committee staffers began to study the topic in 
earnest in April, when the value of one bitcoin spiked to $266, generating a wave of media attention. 
Over the summer, committee staff interviewed around 50 experts in industry, government, academic 
and nonprofit organizations to learn how the Bitcoin network worked and how it might affect the 
economy and law enforcement. Committee staffers talked to government agencies, bankers, and 
technologists. They also talked extensively to representatives of the Bitcoin Foundation. 
The committee consulted with Dan Kaminsky, a well-known security expert who conducted 
an influential security analysis of the Bitcoin software in 2011. Staffers talked to Sarah Meiklejohn, a 
computer scientist at the University of California, San Diego, about whether Bitcoin is truly 
anonymous (it isn't). And they talked to Jerry Brito, a researcher at the Mercatus Center, a libertarian 
think tank. Brito testified at Monday's hearing. 
In August, the committee sent a series of letters to federal agencies seeking their views on Bitcoin and 
other virtual currencies. Letters were sent to the Department of Homeland Security, the Treasury 
Department, the Federal Reserve, the Justice Department and other agencies with regulatory 
authority related to financial markets or online crime. The letters asked the agencies to provide details 
of any inquiries they had conducted into the virtual currencies, and to describe whether they had 
plans to regulate the currency in the future. 
Meanwhile, representatives from the Bitcoin Foundation met with a number of executive branch 
officials at a closed-door meeting in August. What the Bitcoin Foundation tried to stress is that 
Bitcoin is less useful for [illicit] purposes than other centralized virtual currencies, said Brito, who 
attended the meeting. Bitcoin advocates also stressed that excessive regulation in the United States 
would merely push more of the Bitcoin economy overseas, where U.S. regulators might not be able to 
reach it at all. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029965 
Those arguments seem to have made an impression, because government officials repeated many of 
them at this week's hearings. The Homeland Security Committee invited representatives of three 
federal agencies to testify before the committee this week. Jennifer Shasky Calvery represented the 
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which enforces the nation's laws against money laundering. 
Mythili Raman spoke on behalf of the Justice Department, whose enforcement activities have 
included the shuttering the Bitcoin-based drug marketplace Silk Road. And Edward Lowery spoke for 
the Secret Service, which (along with the Justice Department) was involved in shutting down e-Gold 
and Liberty Reserve, two virtual currencies that the government alleged had become vast money-
laundering operations. Calvery also testified before the Senate Banking committee on Tuesday. 
Virtual currencies have yet to overtake more traditional methods to move funds internationally for 
criminal purposes, Calvery said. She pointed out that the Bitcoin network has processed only about 
$8 billion worth of transactions over the last year, compared to an estimated $1.6 trillion in global 
criminal proceeds in 2009. Clearly, the vast majority of those transactions are using some other 
financial network. 
We are attuned to the criminal use of Bitcoin, Raman said. But there are many legitimate uses. 
These virtual currencies are not in and of themselves illegal. 
Calvery agreed. Innovation is a very important part of our economy, she said, cautioning that 
premature regulation could stifle Bitcoin innovation. 
The personal touch 
Regulators are busy people. They're more likely to pay attention to flesh-and-blood advocates than to 
anonymous Internet commenters. Murck and Andresen's trip to Washington proved to be crucial to 
building productive relationships with policymakers. 
Calvery was a keynote speaker at the June conference. Murck and Calvery met in the speakers' room 
at the conference and had a conversation that would later lead to the closed-door August meeting 
between regulators and Bitcoin advocates. The day after the June conference, Murck was introduced 
to staffers on the Senate Homeland Security Committee, beginning a conversation that culminated in 
this week's hearings. 
Murck says that not everyone in the Bitcoin community was happy about his engagement with 
Washington. The Bitcoin community has a strong libertarian streak, and many Bitcoin devotees 
worried that conversations with federal regulators could help to legitimize and encourage regulation. 
But to the surprise of many, the Bitcoin advocates' charm offensive actually changed the minds of 
many D.C. insiders. Winning over Allen was a particular coup for the Bitcoin community. Allen's 
warnings against the dangers of premature regulation were particularly effective coming from a long-
time activist against child pornography. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029966 
Part of the effort was not just to address these issues from a law enforcement perspective, but to 
listen to the leaders of the Bitcoin movement, Allen said. And when he listened to them, he found 
some of their arguments to be surprisingly persuasive.

Passive Foreign Investment Companies - A portfolio investment by the Fund in a non-US.
corporation that is classified as a “passive foreign investment company” (“PFIC”) will cause
taxable U.S. Partners to be subject to taxation under Sections 1291 through 1298 of the Code. In
general, a non-US. corporation will be classified as a PFIC if 75% or more of its gross income
constitutes “passive income” — generally, interest, dividends, royalties, rent and similar
income, and gains on the disposition of assets that generate such income — or 50% or more of
its assets (by value or, in certain situations, by adjusted tax bases) produce passive income or
are held for the production of such income. Under the PFIC rules, gain attributable to a
disposition of PFIC stock, as well as income attributable to certain “excess distributions” with
respect to that PFIC stock, is allocated ratably over the shareholder’s holding period for the
stock. Gain allocated under this rule to (i) the year in which the shareholder disposes of the
PFIC stock and (ii) any year prior to the time the foreign corporation first satisfied the PFIC
income or assets test, as well as income attributable to any excess distribution on PFIC stock
allocated to those years, is subject to tax (as ordinary income) at the U.S. federal income tax
rates applicable to the shareholder for the year in which the disposition occurs. Disposition
gain attributable to years included in the shareholder’s holding period — other than those
described in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) — and income attributable to excess distributions
allocated to each such other year is subject to tax (as ordinary income) at the maximum U.S.
federal income tax rate applicable to the shareholder for the year in which the income is treated
as realized, and also to an interest-like charge on the shareholder’s “deferred” payment of this
tax liability that accrues generally from the year of deemed realization through the due date of
the shareholder’s U.S. federal income tax return for the year of disposition or distribution
(determined without regard to extensions). A U.S. Partner effectively will be treated as a U.S.
shareholder with respect to its proportionate share of any PFIC stock owned by the Fund. If,
however, that PFIC is also a “controlled foreign corporation” in which the Fund is a “United
States Shareholder” (as defined below), the PFIC rules generally will be superseded by the rules
discussed below dealing with controlled foreign corporations. The PFIC rules generally should
not affect tax-exempt U.S. Partners.

The PFIC rules are highly technical and it is possible that a non-U.S. corporation in which the
Fund makes an investment will be classified as a PFIC. If the Fund invests in the stock of a
portfolio company classified as a PFIC, and that company agrees to provide the Fund and, if
necessary, the IRS with certain financial information, the Fund may elect to treat that company
as a “qualified electing fund” (“QEF”). If the Fund holds stock of a non-U.S. corporation with
respect to which a QEF election has been made for the first taxable year in the Fund’s holding
period for which the non U.S. corporation is a PFIC, each U.S. Partner will be subject to tax
currently on its proportionate share of certain earnings and net capital gain of that non-US.
corporation — regardless of whether that corporation actually distributes cash or other property
to the Fund — but generally will not be subject to the tax regime described in the preceding
paragraph with respect to its investment in that corporation. Although the maximum rate of
tax imposed on certain dividends is currently 20%, this rate does not apply to dividends paid or
deemed paid by PFICs. A QEF election generally will not result in current inclusion of the
PFIC’s earnings for any year in which the PFIC has no net ordinary earnings and no net capital
gain. Alternatively, if such PFIC stock is publicly traded, the Fund may be eligible to value the

liked it as a student. Who said that listening to what I happened to be
talking about was an important thing to do? And, who said students
should be graded on how well they had listened to whatever truth I
was espousing? What if I was saying nonsense? I didn’t think I pos-
sessed a direct line to the truth any more than I had thought that my
own teachers did. The system didn’t make sense to me as a student
and it didn’t as a professor.

But it was a very easy job. And the pay, despite what people think
about professors’ salaries, was pretty good.

How hard was this teaching obligation? At Northwestern I was
required to teach one 3-hour- a-week course for 1 quarter every other
year. This came to about 36 hours of work in 2 years.

Yes, really.

So, how was I part of the problem? Actually my light teaching ob-
ligation is the tip of the iceberg of an enormous problem. It brings up
the question of how and why that light load works for a university, the
answer to which sheds light on what is wrong with our school system.

How do the economics of a university work such that a profes-
sor can teach so little? That is an important question. But an equally
important question is how it is that a professor, who is after all, in the
mind of the public at least, a teacher, teaches so little and is happy
about it?

People used to ask me, when I said that I was a professor, what
I taught. I would always laugh. I would suggest that they ask me in-
stead what I was a professor of, which was, of course, the only relevant
question. I didn’t teach much and when I did teach, I hardly taught
computer science, which was actually what I was a professor of. I usu-
ally taught my view of how the mind worked. Sometimes I taught how
education needed to be fixed. But, anyhow, as I have said, there wasn’t
all that much teaching going on in my life. Sometimes I taught more
often than required of me, simply because I was feeling guilty. The
rules said I didn’t have to teach much but there were students, usually
graduate students, who were thinking that as they had attended this
university in part to interact with me, at least I should teach a course
that included them at least once. So I did it because I felt guilty, not
because anyone higher up in the university cared what I did.

I remember a Yale undergraduate who wanted an appointment
with me. He was screaming in the halls, after he had been told that he
could see a graduate assistant instead of me, that he had paid $20,000

court. Jd.

Not only are the appellate briefs subject to the strong presumption of openness that
applies to all judicial documents but there is also an intense public interest in disclosing these
specific documents because they will shed light on why the District Attorney’s Office initially
took the controversial decision to argue in favor of lenient treatment of Epstein.? As Justice
Burger wrote, “[p]eople in an open society do not demand infallibility from their institutions, but
it is difficult for them to accept what they are prohibited from observing.” Richmond
Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 572 (1980). “Only a free and unrestrained press can
effectively expose deception in government. And paramount among the responsibilities of a free
press is the duty to prevent any part of the government from deceiving the people... .” N.Y.
Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713, 717 (1971) (Black, J. concurring). In short, the
appellate briefs should be unsealed so that the Post can inform the public about the decisions
taken by the District Attorney’s Office with respect to Epstein so that the public can decide
whether there was anything careless or improper about those decisions.

The need for transparency and public understanding of why the District Attorney’s Office
handled the Epstein case the way it did is heightened by the fact that District Attorney Vance has

faced criticism over claims that his office gives favorable treatment to rich and powerful men

? The presumption of openness is grounded in the U.S. and New York Constitutions as well as deeply-entrenched
common law rules that govern this Court. The First Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I,
section 8 of the New York State Constitution both recognize the presumptive right of the public and press to access
and inspect court records. Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 478 U.S. 1 (1986); Globe Newspaper Co. v.
Superior Court, 457 U.S. 596 (1982); In re Associated Press v. Bell, 70 N.Y.2d 32, 517 N.Y.S.2d 444 (1987). In
addition to being well established under the federal and state constitutions, the right of access to court records “‘is
also firmly grounded in common law principles.” Danco Labs., Ltd. v. Chem. Works of Gideon Richter, Ltd.,274

Topics: Portfolios, US corporate profits and the Twilight of the Gods (in the US, Europe, China and the IEA)

Twilight of the Gods part 3: Why is everyone assuming that the next Chinese tightening is the last one?
Every time China tightened monetary policy this year, most China research maintained that the tightening cycle is close to its

end. Perhaps; Premier Wen has stated that the country’s efforts to control inflation have worked, that price stability is in an
acceptable range, and that it will drop steadily from here. But last week’s headline inflation release of 6.4% hit a three year
high, and it is not clear to us that China is about to end its various inflation control policy measures.

In favor of Wen’s argument, food inflation has been a large contributor, some of which should be transitory. Blue-ear pig virus
(PRRS) killed hundreds of thousands of pigs in 2010, which affected this year’s supply (2006 was worse). As shown below,
pork prices have soared, but should come down if the supply situation normalizes. [Note: a “Strategic Pork Reserve” can be
released to mitigate price increases]. However, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization’, new virulent strains of
the virus have a fatality rate of 20% (even higher for piglets), and what is considered a temporary supply shock may be more
permanent. Chinese pig facilities have the highest animal densities in the world, contributing to the spread of disease to 25 of
China’s 33 provinces. Antibiotics have proven ineffective, and once one pig gets the disease, it tends to spread to the entire
herd in 7-10 days. China has vaccinated 100 million of its 500 million pigs, but existing vaccines do not prevent infection, they
only slow the rate of transmission to other pigs.

A separate issue is that China is doing a lot more to control the supply of money than the cost of money. As shown below, there
have been a lot more increases in bank reserve requirements than interest rate increases. Deposit rates are still negative in real
terms, and bank reserve requirements only affect banks, and not the shadow banking system, which is growing in China.

Forward-looking manufacturing surveys have declined and interbank lending rates (Shibor) have surged, so it’s clear that the
tightening steps are working. But private sector credit is still growing in China, and real estate prices are still nsing. The
bottom line is that the substantial stimulus provided by Chinese and other Asian policymakers in the wake of the
recession has not yet been adequately withdrawn, and that more steps will need to be taken to do so.

sED EDITION

Above: “How
China’s Leaders
Think”

Right: “The Man
Who Changed
China: The Life
and Legacy of
Jiang Zemin”

I don’t try to make any-
body happy, but I just want
to tell the truth. I can be
wrong, and maybe my
truth is not balanced.

Lu Feiran

hina expert and American public intellec-

tual, Robert Lawrence Kuhn is best known in

China for two books about Chinese leaders

and their views, including a biography of
former President Jiang Zemin in 2005 and one about
other leaders and their thinking in 2009.

Kuhn, also an investment banker, business con-
sultant, brain scientist and philosopher, has been
granted unprecedented access to Chinese leaders,
though he does not speak Chinese.

His biography “The Man Who Changed China:

The Life and Legacy of Jiang Zemin” published in
both Chinese and English, was a best-seller in China
where readers are not accustomed to humanized
biographies of leaders.

It was probably the first biography written by a
foreigner about a living Chinese leader that was
published in China.

Kuhn has also produced documentaries on China,
written extensively for Chinese media and is often
quoted by western media. He is a contributor and
consultant to CCTV, some Chinese newspapers and
the Xinhua News Agency.

Kuhn sees his mission as telling the world about
the real China.

He was in Shanghai late last month for an In-
ternational Channel Shanghai (ICS) program he
co-produced and wrote about China’s challenges, in
conjunction with the 18th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China. He held a press confer-
ence and also spoke with Shanghai Daily.

Chinese media sometimes accuse some Westerners
and Western media of China bashing, saying they
misunderstand or are even malevolent.

But 68-year-old Kuhn, a New Yorker, is believed
to have a more neutral view for China. He received
a bachelor’s degree in human biology from Johns
Hopkins University, a master’s of science in man-
agement from the MIT Sloan School of Management,
and a PhD in anatomy and brain research from
UCLA.

His books were published by the Shanghai Trans-
lation Publishing House and Shanghai Century
Publishing Group.

Kuhn said he “never tried to please the Chinese
government, though Western media thought I did.”

“I like feedback, including negative feedback,
because I know that people are engaged,” he told
Shanghai Daily.

“I don’t try to make anybody happy, but I just want
to tell the truth. I can be wrong, and maybe my truth
is not balanced.”

Sunday 25 November 2012 Shanghai Daily

Kuhn’s experience with China started in 1989,
when he was invited by former State Councilor Song
Jian, director of the State Science and Technology
Commission.

The two became friends and Kuhn began traveling
between the US and China, getting to know govern-
ment officials and ordinary people.

Kuhn said he felt frustrated because his experience
in China differed from the description in much of
the Western media. “Then they only focused on the
negative side and ignored the rest,” he said.

That disparity inspired him to write Jiang’s biog-
raphy, he said. Jiang himself said that Kuhn didn’t
“beautify” him and got his wedding date wrong.

Kuhn spent four years writing “The Man Who
Changed China.” Though he had only met Jiang three
times and did not interview him for the book, he
talked to many people close to Jiang, including rela-
tives, friends and colleagues, gathering stories and
perceptions. He became close to many of them.

“T thought I had been rather familiar with China
before I started working on the book,” said Kuhn.
“But after I started collecting the information, I
found that my knowledge was very limited.”

Humanized leader

Kuhn said he was determined to depict a real, ani-
mated Jiang, different from the seemingly impassive
figure appearing on state occasions, on Chinese TV
and in newspapers.

“For a very long time, Chinese leaders were either
described as God or the Devil, but never in-between,”
he said. “So I expected to display a Chinese leader
who is a human being.”

Soon after publication, it became a best-seller in
China. After Kuhn held a book-signing in Guang-
zhou, Guangdong Province, more than 300 books
were sold in an hour. In Shanghai, more than a
million copies were sold in 2005, the highest in the
social science category.

Chinese readers called the book refreshing be-
cause it told daily life stories and described Jiang’s
youth.

One Internet user called “Burn the scarecrow” said
before reading the biography, he thought Jiang was
“a quiet man standing high above the masses.”

“But after reading the book, my first feeling was
that he was once young like us and he is also an
ordinary man.”

The English version, however, received some criti-
cism, primarily that Kuhn was “fawning” over Jiang
and the government. Kuhn denied that.

“In fact, the book had a disclaimer, saying all

launched in 2015 and relaunched in 2017, has sought input on some of the issues
discussed here.” A newly launched NGO, Hong Kong Watch, focuses on drawing
attention to the United Kingdom's special responsibility toward Hong Kong. The
Conservative Party Human Rights Commission has produced its own report on the
deteriorating human rights situation in both China and Hong Kong and has organized
inquiries and events on topics such as the United Kingdom's Confucius Institutes.**
While the Foreign and Commonwealth Office presents the relationship with China

as primarily collaborative, it is also conducting research on Chinese influence and
interference activities.?> At the international level, the United Kingdom has joined
several open letters to signal its position on China’s violations of human rights.”

Civil society has also sought to raise the Foreign NGO Management Law as well as

to highlight intensified repression. By contrast, responses from academic institutions
have so far been sporadic. For example, in 2011, the University of Cambridge
disaffiliated CSSA Cambridge due to its undemocratic organization.” In 2017,
international academics joined together to convince the Cambridge University Press
to stop censoring its publications available in China.’® Still, despite experiencing such
influence campaigns in the past, such as with Libya, which was spelled out in the
2011 Woolf Inquiry, there seems to have been no coherent initiative on protecting
academic freedom and maintaining wider ethical standards in the face of these types
of campaigns.”?

addition to Dan and me, it included key members of the general staff and senior
defense ministry officials. The idea was for us to hear a half-dozen academics
and other specialists speak about the political aspects of the sudden eruption of
Palestinian violence.

Though he spoke for barely 10 minutes, it was the last speaker who left the
deepest impression. Shimon Shamir, a professor at Tel Aviv University, began
by emphasizing he was not an expert in riot control. Finding a response to the
violence was something we were far better equipped to do. But then he paused,
looked intently at Rabin, Dan and me, and said: “What I can do is draw on
history.” One by one, he cited examples of more than a dozen broadly similar
rebellions over the past century, in the Middle East and beyond. “If we were
dealing with simple rioting, things might be different.” But he said the
Palestinians were, fundamentally, acting out of a shared sense of grievance, and
shared national identity. Both were in large part the result of Israel having
controlled their daily lives now for more than two decades. “I’m afraid I can
find no historical precedent for the successful suppression of the national will of
a people,” he said. Even when those in power used unimaginably punitive tools:
like expulsion, or forced starvation. “Even, as we know well as a Jewish people,
extermination.”

I glanced at Yitzhak and at Dan. Both of them looked like I felt: in no doubt
the professor was right, yet also aware that, in the short term, we still had to find
a way of putting a lid on the cauldron and keeping the situation for getting
irretrievably out of control.

It wasn’t as if ’'d been unaware of the sense of the anger building among
many West Bank and Gaza Palestinians, or of their wish to see an end to Israel’s
military administration and the growing number of Jewish settlements. From
my time as head of the central command, I also knew that there was a young,
activist core intensifying efforts to organize attacks on troops and settlers. But
none of us had any inkling that something of the scale, longevity and political
complexity of the intfada lay ahead.

Partly, this was a failure of specific intelligence warnings. But it went deeper
than that. Sobering though it was, I had to accept that — no less so than before
the Yom Kippur War in 1973 — I and many others had for too long been
comforting ourselves with a fundamental misconception about our military
occupation and civilian settlement in the areas captured in 1967. The roots of
the myopia went back to the immediate aftermath of the Six-Day War, to the

of defense. Even worse, he personally still controls the two jobs in a
caretaker capacity, and seems in no hurry to give them up any time
soon.

On Tuesday, Allawi nominated two people for the Defense Ministry,
ex-army officers Nouri al-Duleimy and Abdul-Mayjid Abdul Latif, but
neither of them to date has been accepted by the prime minister. At a
recent press conference, Maliki accused his rival of sectarianism and
of breaching an agreement between them, hammered out last
November.

Then, Allawi sluggishly agreed to accept Maliki as premier, although
the latter controlled only 89 out of 325 seats in parliament whereas
Allawi's secular National Iraqi List commanded a slim majority of 91
seats. Instead, Allawi would be given a new job, which rivals, and in
some cases theoretically challenges, that of the prime minister -
chairman of the National Council for Strategic Policies (NCSP). That
post, six months down the road, is still nowhere close to being
formed. Allawi complains that his coalition is being treated not as a
partner but as a participant in the Maliki government.

Allawi accepted the novel post with a grain of salt. It took heavy
lobbying by Saudi Arabia, and a phone call from US President
Barack Obama, to convince him to settle for the NCSP, along with
assurances that the body would have real powers, rather than
ceremonial duties.

The new council was supposed to operate under the umbrella of the
Iraqi executive branch and replace the National Security Council,
mandated to monitor government ministers and make sure that they
carry out their duties according to the constitution. Additionally, the
council was supposed to have several branches: (domestic) political
affairs, foreign policy, economic and monetary affairs, security and
military affairs, energy, oil and gas, electricity, water and
environmental affairs.

I packed my bags. I told Danny Yatom to inform the Americans we were
leaving and to get our plane ready to take us back to Israel. I let the others in our
team know that we were going. A number of them, and several of the Americans as
well, urged me to reconsider. But I said I saw no point in staying. What I didn’t
know, however, was that one of the Palestinians’ original Oslo negotiators, Hassan
Asfour, had approached Dennis Ross with a new proposal: that we ask Arafat to
accept everything except the proposal on the holy sites as a basis for negotiation.
Sovereignty over the Temple Mount would be addressed in later, international
negotiations. When Dennis brought this to me, my instinct was to say no. Like so
much else at the summit, it was an inherently skewed formula: it would involve
major Israeli concessions on all the other main issues, without securing our
absolute minimum need in Jerusalem: sovereignty over the Temple Mount. I didn’t
say yes. Still, with Clinton’s words of advice still on my mind, I said that I’d think
it over.

When I met the rest of the Israeli team, almost all of them felt we should stay.
The consensus was that especially if violence broke out after the summit’s
collapse, we didn’t want to feel we’d left any stone unturned. At about 11 pm, I
phoned the President and told him that we would stay until he returned from
Okinawa. He was clearly pleased, and asked us to keep working in his absence.
When I resisted that, saying that any substantive talks needed his involvement, we
finally agreed that talks could continue in search of a formula for the holy sites. On
all the other issues, only informal discussions would be held until and unless a way
ahead on the Temple Mount was found. If that happened, and if Arafat finally
accepted the “pocket” proposals as an agreed starting point, formal negotiations
could resume. Clinton accepted this formula. He went to see Arafat and secured —
or thought he had secured — his agreement as well.

One of the President’s great strengths was his genius for blurring the edges of
potential differences in search of common ground. But when edges had to be
sharpened, this could lead to confusion. Before leaving for the G8, the President
neglected to mention to Arafat our explicit understanding that, with the exception
of the talks on the holy sites, nothing would happen until he accepted the
concessions that President Clinton and I had delivered as at least a basis for further
negotiations. As a result, Arafat’s team now set about happily asking questions and
probing my negotiators — pushing us to go further — but with no more inclination
than before to produce any concessions of their own.

Comey himself acknowledged that: throughout history, some presidents have decided that because 'problems' 
come from Justice, they should try to hold the Department close. But blurring those boundaries ultimately 
makes the problems worse by undermining public trust in the institutions and their work. Comey has also 
acknowledged that the president had the constitutional authority to fire him for any or no cause. 
President Trump also had the constitutional authority to order Comey to end the investigation of former national 
security adviser Mike Flynn. He could have pardoned Flynn, as Bush pardoned Weinberger, thus ending the 
Flynn investigation, as Bush ended the Iran-Contra investigation. What Trump could not do is what Nixon did: 
direct his aides to lie to the FBI, or commit other independent crimes. There is no evidence that Trump did that.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013237.txt,"18.3 Sel&Modification via Supercompilation 321

Supercompilation is an innovative and general approach to global program optimization
initially developed by Valentin Turchin. In its simplest form, it provides an algorithm that
takes in a piece of software and output another piece of software that does the same thing,
but far faster and using less memory. It was introduced to the West in Turchin’s 1986 technical
paper “The concept of a supercompiler” [TV 96], and since this time the concept has been avidly
developed by computer scientists in Russia, America, Denmark and other nations. Prior to 1986,
a great deal of work on supercompilation was carried out and published in Russia; and Valentin
Turchin, Andrei Klimov and their colleagues at the Keldysh Institute in Russia developed a
supercompiler for the Russian programming language Refal. Since 1998 these researchers and
their team at Supercompilers LLC have been working to replicate their achievement for the
more complicated but far more commercially significant language Java. It is a large project
and completion is scheduled for early 2003. But even at this stage, their partially complete
Java supercompiler has had some interesting practical successes — including the use of the
supercompiler to produce efficient Java code from CogPrime combinator trees.

The radical nature of supercompilation may not be apparent to those unfamiliar with the
usual art of automated program optimization. Most approaches to program optimization involve
some kind of direct program transformation. A program is transformed, by the step by step
application of a series of equivalences, into a different program, hopefully a more efficient one.
Supercompilation takes a different approach. A supercompiler studies a program and constructs
a model of the program’s dynamics. This model is in a special mathematical form, and it can,
in most cases, be used to create an efficient program doing the same thing as the original one.

The internal behavior of the supercompiler is, not surprisingly, quite complex; what we will
give here is merely a brief high-level summary. For an accessible overview of the supercompila-
tion algorithm, the reader is referred to the article “What is Supercompilation?” [1]

18.3.1 Three Aspects of Supercompilation

There are three separate levels to the supercompilation idea: first, a general philosophy; second
a translation of this philosophy into a concrete algorithmic framework; and third, the manifold
details involved making this algorithmic framework practicable in a particular programming
language. The third level is much more complicated in the Java context than it would be for
Sasha, for example.

The key philosophical concept underlying the supercompiler is that of a metasystem transi-
tion. In general, this term refers to a transition in which a system that previously had relatively
autonomous control, becomes part of a larger system that exhibits significant controlling influ-
ence over it. For example, in the evolution of life, when cells first become part of a multicellular
organism, there was a metasystem transition, in that the primary nexus of control passed from
the cellular level to the organism level.

The metasystem transition in supercompilation consists of the transition from considering
a program in itself, to considering a metaprogram which executes another program, treating
its free variables and their interdependencies as a subject for its mathematical analysis. In
other words, a metaprogram is a program that accepts a program as input, and then runs
this program, keeping the inputs in the form of free variables, doing analysis along the way
based on the way the program depends on these variables, and doing optimization based on
this analysis. A CogPrime schema does not explicitly contain variables, but the inputs to the

53. | Once Edwards filed his civil complaints for his three clients, he began the normal
process of discovery for cases such as these. He sent standard discovery requests to Epstein
about his sexual abuse of the minor girls, including requests for admissions, request for
protinetion, and interrogatories. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit “N”, at {11-19 and 25.

Rather than answer any substantive questions about his sexual abuse and his conspiracy for
procuring minor girls for him to abuse, Epstein invoked his 5th amendment right against self-
incrimination. An example of Epstein’s refusal to answer is attached as Composite Exhibit “Z”
(original discovery propounded to Epstein and his responses invoking Sth amendment).

54. During the discovery phase of the civil cases filed against Epstein, Epstein’s
deposition was taken at least five times. During all of those depositions, Epstein refused to
answer any substantive questions about his sexual abuse of minor girls. See, e.g., Deposition
Attachments 1, 6 and 7.

55. During these depositions, Epstein further attempted to obstruct legitimate
questioning by inserting a variety of irrelevant information about his case. As one of
innumerable examples, on March 8, 2010, Mr. Horowitz, representing seven victims, Jane Doe's
2-8, asked, Q: In 2004, did you rub Jane Doe 3's vagina? A: Excuse me. I'd like to answer that

with the FBI. It seemed very odd for someone doing an offi-
cial criminal investigation to just call up on the phone like
that. I hadn’t heard Epstein’s name for years. I didn’t know
who this person was and what it was really about. I couldn't
tell what was going on.

36. This man said he was looking into Jeffrey Epstein.
The man asked if I had been involved with Epstein. My first
instinct was to say nothing because I wasn’t sure he was
really with the FBI or any authorities. I answered a few basic
questions, telling him that I knew Jeffrey Epstein and had
met him at a young age. But the conversation didn't feel right.
This man never offered to come and meet with me in person.
Instead, he asked me right off the bat about Epstein’s sexual
practices. I thought it would be strange for a true law enforce-
ment officer to behave that way, so I became increasingly
uncomfortable and suspicious about who was actually call-
ing me.

37. I told the man nothing more about Epstein. The con-
versation probably didn’t even last three minutes, but it
immediately triggered all of the fears of Epstein and his pow-
erful friends that had caused me to escape in the first place.
If the call accomplished anything, it only put me back in a
state of fear and told me that I could be found quite easily
and had nobody officially protecting me.

38. I suspected that the man who called me was working
for Epstein or one of Epstein’s powerful friends. I believed that
if this was really an agent who was investigating Epstein, he
would have known who I was and how I fit into Epstein’s sex-
ual crimes in many different places. He would have inter-
viewed me in a way that would have established his credentials

Beside care with the _ titration of meditation-induced interpersonal
disconnection, detachment with love is the desired end point of most Hindu and
Buddhist meditative practice, another set of “side effects” of the energy arising early
in the course of too much meditation is called kriyas, spontaneous episodes of
involuntary behaviors and postures of the body such as unprovoked chanting and
writhing and stereotyped hand positions called mudras. Baba told us one of his
kriyas took the form of spontaneous erections that occurred during his first
experiences with deep meditative states. | recall a woman physician and fellow
ashramite in Los Angeles telling me that her panties often got so soaked during
meditation that she worried about being stuck to her cushion. Beyond these initial

that his mind filled with “joyous contentment.” Jewish mysticism of the 1300’s

from concrete, visualizable, classical mathematics to abstract, nonvisualizable
relational ideas. This conceptual transition to abstract, relational thought objects that
are no longer representable by pictures or accessible to our senses of mathematics
and physics is yet to reach the concrete DNA-causal religionists of modern
molecular biology. In 20 Century mathematics, Dieudonne’ observes that “...the
primary role in theory is played by the relations between mathematical objects
concerned rather than the nature of the objects themselves...these relations are

often the same for objects which appear to be very different and therefore they must

POLYAMORY:
[theory] In Praise of Monogamy

This post was published in mid-2011, and it got more attention than most things I've
written. The reaction was quite mixed. Some monogamists felt that I was damning
monogamy with faint praise. Some polyamorists felt that it was problematic for me to
write a post praising the culturally dominant Western mode of sexuality, because it's
already dominant. On the other hand, the piece was cross-posted at a number of high-
profile websites, and I got a lot of positive commentary too.

My favorite comments came from Pepper Mint, a polyamory advocate who commented
on this post when it was cross-posted at Feministe. J really felt like Pepper got what I
was trying to do. Here's an excerpt from one of his comments:

Monogamy is [perceived as] a hegemonic requirement, not an option that should be
advocated. So when people espouse monogamy (which is rare, since it is hegemonic),
they do it by claiming that anything else is impossible or they do it by making moral
statements. I challenge you to find a mainstream article that actually lists out the
pragmatic benefits of monogamy, like Clarisse has done here. I don't think I've ever seen
one. Indeed, when monogamy is explicitly discussed in the mainstream currently, it often
seems to be in ‘is monogamy realistic ?' articles.

Note that this is all to the detriment of monogamous people as well as nonmonogamous
people. When I talk to people about polyamory, I get a lot of defensive responses, for the
simple reason that monogamous people are often monogamous because they did not
know there was a choice, rather than monogamous by inclination or what have you.
Discourse that presents monogamy as an actual choice and lists out the pros and cons of
that choice is nonmonogamy-affirming in my book, unless it is hugely one-sided.

We have a problem in the poly communities I engage in, where people new to
polyamory spend a couple years unfairly trashing monogamy. This is partly out of anger
from their history and partly because they've finally found what they are looking for and
everything else looks shabby in comparison. But it creates ill-will where none need exist,
it screws up people's approach to relationships, and it bites people later if they want to
go back to monogamy.

So as a polyamory activist I'm very glad this essay was written, and I've posted similar
things myself in various forums. It addresses a hole in the discourse that is very
important to fill.”

Thanks, Pepper.

I’d start with his feet, go up to his calves, up his legs, buttocks, back, his neck, his head,
his arms, yada yada, and then it would be time to flip over, and some of the men would
want me to continue on massaging the front side of them and they would instigate me to
begin having sex with them or foreplay, whatever you want to call it.

JS: So routinely, these massages involved sexual activity. Is that accurate?

V: That is accurate.

JS: Ok. Let’s talk about the travel that you were involved in when you were on Jeffrey’s
private plane. Generally speaking, who were the passengers on the plane when you
traveled.

V: Well, Larry was the pilot, and then there was a short, small solid guy, I don’t know his
name, but he was a co-pilot, and then he changed and there was another guy brought in
later on. Generally speaking, there was always Jeffrey, sometimes Ghislaine, sometimes
Emmy, sometimes a whole bunch of other girls, sometimes famous people, sometimes
some politicians or yeah, just about anybody could fly on his plane. There was never no
any set routine who would come and who would go. It was an influx of people on
Jeffrey’s airplane.

JS: I want to deal with these things separately in order to respect some of the reservations
that you have, so I’m going to ask you who the people were that you remember flying
with Jeffrey on his plane when you were personally present without regard to whether
there was any sexual activity that occurred on the plane or not. So I’m not asking you to
implicate any of these famous people in improper conduct, but just tell me what the
names of the people are that you remember that you consider to be famous people.

V: Ok, there was Naomi Campbell, Heidi Klum, there was Bill Clinton. There was Al (?)
Gore, there was a whole bunch of models, I wouldn’t really honestly be able to give their
names. There was Matt Groning the producer of the simpons cartoon, Jack CCousteau’s
granddaughter a lot of interior designers, architects, politicians. I am just trying to think
of as many names as possible for you. Off the top of my head, that’s as good as I can get
for now.

JS: Ok, alright, that’s fine. And again, I am not implying by my questions, nor do I want
your answers to be interpreted as your suggesting that any of those people that you have
just identified were engaged in any improper activities on any particular flight, but I want
to talk to you now about what went on on occasion on the airplane. Ok?

V: Ok. It was a lot of the same thing that went down on the ground. A lot of times, it would
be just be me and Jeffrey, or me and Jeffrey and Ghislaine, or me and Jeffrey and some
other girl, sometimes Emmy, Sarah, and Nadia Bjournik. There would be sexual conduct,

Indeed, in that respect the shout of “Fire!” is not even speech, in any meaningful sense of that
term.*’ It is a clang sound — the equivalent of setting off a nonverbal alarm. Had Justice Holmes
been more honest about his example, he would have said that freedom of speech does not

protect a kid who pulls a fire alarm in the absence of a fire, in a theater when there is no fire, and
thereby causes a panic. But that obviously would have been irrelevant to the case at hand. The
proposition that pulling an alarm is not protected speech certainly leads to the conclusion that
shouting the word fire is also not protected, but it certainly does not support the very different
conclusion that circulating a thoughtful pamphlet is also not protected.

The analogy is thus not only inapt but also insulting. Most Americans do not respond to written
political advocacy with the same kind of automatic acceptance expected of schoolchildren
responding to a fire drill. Not a single recipient of the Schenck pamphlet is known to have
changed his mind after reading it. Indeed, one draftee, who appeared as a prosecution witness,
was asked whether reading a pamphlet asserting that the draft law was unjust would make him
“immediately decide that you must erase that law.” Not surprisingly, he replied, “I do my own
thinking.” A theatergoer would probably not respond similarly if asked how he would react to a
shout of “Fire!”

Another important reason the analogy is inapt is that Holmes emphasizes the factual falsity of the
shout “Fire!” The Schenck pamphlet, however, was not factually false. It contained political
opinions and ideas about the causes of war and about appropriate and lawful responses

to the draft. As the Supreme Court has repeatedly stated, “the First Amendment recognizes no
such thing as a ‘false’ idea.” Nor does it recognize false opinions about the causes of war.

A closer analogy to the facts of the Schenck case might have been provided by a person’s
standing outside a theater, offering the patrons a leaflet advising them that in his opinion the
theater was a fire hazard, and urging them not to enter but to complain to the building

inspectors. That analogy, however, would not have served Holmes’s argument for punishing
Schenck. Holmes needed an analogy that would appear relevant to Schenck’s political speech but
that would invite the conclusion that censorship was appropriate.

Ironically, the “Fire!” analogy is all that survives from the Schenck case; the ruling itself is no
longer good law. Pamphlets of the kind that resulted in Schenck’s imprisonment have been
circulated with impunity during subsequent wars.

Over the years I have assembled a collection of instances— including my own cases, speeches I
have heard, articles I have read — in which proponents of censorship have maintained that the
expression at issue is “just like” or “equivalent to” falsely shouting “Fire!” in a crowded theater
and ought to be banned, “just as” shouting “Fire!” ought to be banned. The analogy is generally
invoked, often with self-satisfaction, as an absolute argument stopper. It does, after all, claim the

could not have done if he had begun with the self-evidence proposition that setting off an alarm bell is not free
speech.

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023071.txt,"The costs and benefits of tax reform

2017 could be a watershed year from a tax reform perspective. Trump has continuously
stated that tax reform is a priority, and there is evidence of widespread support in
Congress. Tax reform could be enacted through reconciliation without the risk of being
filibustered, suggesting the timing could be imminent. Corporate tax reform could have
a significant impact on S&P 500 earnings, corporate behavior and capital markets. Much
has been written on the timing, funding and process by which corporate tax reform
could be enacted. In this report, we use House Speaker Paul Ryan’s Blueprint proposal as
a starting point in quantifying the impact of corporate tax reform on the S&P 500, with
some scenario analysis to account for differences included in the final bill (such as
Trump’s proposals). Our analysis is focused specifically on the impact of corporate tax
reform, however we recognize that there are many other factors that can impact the
sensitivity analysis (e.g. changes to household income tax rates, infrastructure spending,
etc.).

We estimate that the Blueprint proposal would initially boost S&P 500 EPS by $5-6,
assuming the end of interest expense deductions only applies to new debt, or is phased
in over time. But the devil is in the details. Over time, the loss of the interest tax shield
would be a significant drag on earnings as existing debt is refinanced. Additionally, the
corporate tax rate is critical in determining whether or not the tax reform policies end
up being accretive to earnings on a sustained basis. We estimate that at the 20% tax
rate, the Blueprint would be modestly accretive, the benefit would triple under Trump’s
proposed 15% tax rate, but at a higher 25% tax rate that would appease the deficit
hawks in Congress, the benefit would turn to a negative over time (Table 2). We also
estimate a one-time $8-9 charge to GAAP EPS that would be associated with the
discounted repatriation tax.

Table 2: Estimated impact of tax reform on S&P 500 2018 EPS

Tax policy 15% 20% 25%
Tax rate change 10.50 8.00 5.00
Ending interest deductibility — initial impact* -0.50 to -1.00 -0.50 to -1.50 -0.50 to -2.00
Border adjustments -4.00 -5.50 -6.50

Total initial impact 9.50 to 10.00 5.00 to 6.00 0.50 to 2.00
Ending interest deductibility — recurring impact -3.50 -5.00 -6.00

Recurring impact 7.00 1.50 -3.50

One-time repatriation tax (8.75%), GAAP
charge -8.50 -8.50 -8.50
Source: BofAML US Equity & Quant Strategy, FactSet, Compustat, S&P

*Assumes end to interest deductibility only applies ta new debt, where we estimate 70-90% of debt is long-term.

Note: For this exhibit, we assume that 100% of the cash is repatriated and 50% of it is spent on buybacks. For different buyback
assumptions, please see the section on repatriation.

In the following pages, we focus on the following topics that have large implications for
US equity investors, but it is important to consider corporate tax reform holistically
rather than drawing major implications from each measure in isolation:

e Reducing the US corporate tax rate

e Repatriation - mandatory tax on overseas profits
e Border adjustment tax

e Removal of interest expense deduction

The government revenue associated with each of these is included in the table below.

A new life: Virgina, naw a mother-of-three, in
Australia

Virginia says: ‘Ghislaine said | was to start immediately and that someone would drive me home.

My father left and | was told to go upstairs.’ She was led by another woman through Epstein's
bedroom into a massage room where he lay face down naked on a table.

He started to interviewed Virginia. This was unconventional, but Virginia had no suspicions.
Presumably, she thought, this was how the wealthy conducted their business.

Epstein elicited the information that Virginia had been a runaway, and was no longer a virgin.

Virginia was then told to start massaging Epstein, under the instructions of the woman who had
shown her in. The massage quickly developed into a sexual encounter.

Virginia was uncomfortable, but reluctant to deny such important people. ‘My face was red with
embarrassment,’ she says. ‘But | felt under immense pressure to please them.

The whole time it was going on, they were promising me the world, that I'd travel with Jeffrey on his
private jet and have a well-paid profession.’ Afterwards, she was given two $100 bills and told to
return the next day.

That was the beginning of the four years she spent with Epstein.
For three of those years, she was under Florida’s age of consent, which is 18.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013545.txt,"In the long distance running model of spiritual transformation, the first energy
appears suddenly in the middle of painful fatigue and feels like a vigorous
implementation of Halachic commands or Canon Law. The second burst of energy
emerges from readiness for resignation and ends in humane comprehension and
empathy. In some Christian monastic practice, a similar transition is represented in
the ritual of Tenebrae (or Darkness). Fifteen lit, unbleached candles are
extinguished, one by one over the night, while reading the Psalms. The practice is
said to represent the desertion of Christ by his disciples, as the church grows darker
over the night. After the singing of the Benedictus, the one remaining light is
quenched, plunging the church into total darkness. In Myth and Ritual in
Christianity, Alan Watts suggests that the loss of the last light of Tenebrae induces
the realization that “| am nothing.” This reduction in egocentrism, along with a dark-
piercing alertness is said to facilitate an invasion by a loving God that precipitates
the fasting, sleep deprived and praying petitioners into long lasting ecstatic states.

These uses of energy and its attendant characteristics are not physically
specifiable but rather hermeneutic of a force. It is both a potential and a realization,
observed and inferred. It is the “energy stuff’ of Freud’s /ibido, Wilhelm Reich’s
orgone energy, Pavlov’s drive, Rudolph Steiner etheric formative force, the
arousal and attention of brain wave and consciousness research, the Ch’ of
Chinese medicine, the Hindu divine energy of Shakti, the Hebraic ruach, the
Cabalist’s Yesod, the Sufis Baraka, the Christian Holy Spirit, the Yogic breath
energy, prana, Mesmer’s animal magnetism, Galvani’s life force, Goethe’s
Gestaltung, Madam Blavatsky’s astral light, Georg Groddeck’s it, Henri Bergson’s
elan vitale, Schroedingers entropy, Abraham Maslow, Ruth Benedict and
Buckminister Fuller's synergy, Bertalanffy’s anamorphosis, Colin Wilson’s x factor
and George De la Warr’s biomagnetism. Of course, by nationality, culture and field
of study, there are many more examples, each locally defined by its particular
context and haunting with its promise of universality.

Energy in the context of mathematical physics is intuitional, abstract and
relational. It is not created or destroyed, but rather transformed. Consistent with his

deceptively simple style of physical intuition training of the young, Feynman’s

applied only in this capacity, which entailed a five-year employment
agreement, the minimum requirement for an intelligence technol-
ogy job was an associate’s degree awarded by a two-year community
college in electronics and communications, engineering technology,
computer network systems, or electronics engineering technology.
Candidates had to have had a final GPA of at least 3.0 on a 4.0 scale
from a fully accredited technical school or university. Snowden, as
we've seen, did not meet these standards. If a candidate lacks these
qualifications, the CIA can make an exception only if he or she has
at least two years’ civilian or military work experience in the tele-
communications and/or automated information systems field that is
comparable to one of the requisite degree fields. Snowden in no way
qualified in this way either.

Under extraordinary circumstances, even the minimum require-
ments might be waived if the applicant had a distinguished mili-
tary career and an honorable discharge. Snowden, however, did not
complete his military training at Fort Benning and received only an
administrative discharge.

© The CIA, to be sure, had needed computer-savvy recruits to ser- ©
vice its expanding array of computer systems since 1990. By 2006,
however, there was no shortage of fully qualified applicants for IT
jobs who met the CIA’s minimum standards. Most of them had uni-
versity course records, work experience at IT companies, computer
science training certificates from technical schools, and other such
credentials. The CIA, like the NSA, also obtained technicians with
special skills for IT jobs from outside contractors. So it had no need
for employing a twenty-two-year-old dropout who did not meet its
requisites. According to Tyler Drumheller, a former CIA station chief
in Europe, the only plausible way that Snowden, with no qualifica-
tions, was allowed to jump the queue was that “he had some pull.”

In 2006, Snowden’s grandfather, who had attained the rank of
rear admiral, was certainly well connected in the intelligence world.
After twenty years’ service in the Coast Guard, Barrett had joined
an interagency task force in 1998, which included top executives
from the CIA, the FBI, and the Drug Enforcement Administration.
It had been set up to monitor any gaps in the U.S. embargo on Cuba,
and Barrett, as one of its leaders, was in constant liaison with the

long as it is not by accident, my intentions and goals are more clear cut than when I fail to do something
or allow it to happen. If I punch you and your arm bruises, the causality is clear: I caused your arm to
bruise. Iam responsible for this harm. I should be punished. If I stand by as someone is about to punch
you, but don’t deflect the punch when I easily could have, it feels odd to say that I caused your arm to
bruise. It also seems strange to say that Iam responsible and should be punished. By not deflecting the
punch, I allowed the harm to occur. I could have prevented it from happening, but I am not obliged to. As
social creatures, we have been designed to pick up on cues that reliably classify people into friends and
enemies. Friends intentionally help us while enemies intentionally harm us. Actions showcase our
intentions better than omissions.

The omission effect also makes sense in terms of personal responsibility. Not only do our guts tell
us that actors are more responsible for outcomes than omitters, but our guts also tell us that it is hard to
hold others responsible for their omissions. As I sit and write these words, I am committing heinous acts
of omission: I am not currently giving money to any charities, am not scheduled to teach in the dozens of
refugee camps around the world, and am not volunteering for any of the peace keeping armies sponsored
by the UN. Iam also guilty of many other minor crimes of omission, including the failure to consistently
give my change to homeless individuals, and the failure to spend time in homes for the elderly and
mentally handicapped. As I sit, Irack up countless harms of omission. It is hopefully the absurdity of this
comment that shows why there is a fracture in the arm that connects omissions to responsibility. In a large
scale society, it is impossible for us to hold people responsible for their omissions. There are far too many
reasons, often good ones, why people don’t act. The universe of reasons for acting is smaller.

If the omission effect arises because it is virtually impossible to hold omitters responsible in a
large scale society, than what about small scale societies including the hunter-gathers of our past, and the
tiny hamlets and villages that dot many countries, both developed and developing? When the number of
people that you know and interact with is small, does the omission effect vanish? In a fish bowl
community, you should be able to hold all of the other fish responsible for their actions and omissions
because you know what they are up to. To explore this idea, the psychologist Linda Abarbanell and I ran
a study with a rural, small scale Mayan population, living in the Chiapas region of Mexico. Every
individual listened to a reading of a moral dilemma. Each dilemma described an action or an omission
that resulted in harming one person, but saving the lives of many. Subjects judged the moral
permissibility of the action or omission.

Unlike thousands of adults on the internet who judged similar dilemmas, as well as other Mayans

living in a city, individuals in this small scale Mayan population perceived no moral difference between

Olivia asked my advice on one of these guys, who was clearly falling in love with her
from the start. She mentioned that she'd already talked to another sex worker about it.
The other worker's reaction was, essentially, What problem? As Olivia put it: She told
me that the guy is basically a locked-in regular now, so what am I so bothered about?
But after a while, Olivia couldn't take how guilty and anxious she felt around this guy,
what with the feelings she couldn't return. She stopped responding to his messages, but
didn't tell him clearly that it was over because trying to phrase the email felt so awful.

I was so unprofessional about it, she said. In the end, he sent me this incredibly sweet
note asking what he'd done to hurt me so badly. So my husband helped me write a 'it's not
you, it's me’ breakup email. I still feel bad.”

Another facet of emotional difficulty arose when Olivia's husband started taking a
medication that decreased his libido. This put the couple in the odd position of Olivia
having sex with other men, but not her husband -- with her husband's full knowledge and
consent. Although her husband tried to reassure her, she began feeling less secure and
stable at home. And sex work is stressful enough that home security can really, really
matter. Indeed, at one point Olivia mentioned: One of my friends is tempted to get into
sex work. But she says she doesn't think she can deal with it, emotionally, unless she has
a partner at home who loves her and will back her up. So I'm not supposed to let her have
sex for money until she's in a good solid relationship.”

Finally, as Olivia fielded other life stresses, she flatly realized that she couldn't have
anything extra going on. What with all the above conversations, we saw signs that the
change was coming, but when it arrived it was both sudden and intense. One day I just
knew I had to stop,” she told me. It's bad, because we're behind on rent now, but I had to
stop. My husband pointed out, gently, that we need the money. But of course he accepted
it when I said I was done. Anyway, I managed to line up a good temp job, so we're okay
for now.

I tried to show in the original interview that Olivia is very privileged compared to most
sex workers. She's got race privilege for her whiteness, class privilege from her
background; she's pretty and young and valuable, and has tons of education to boot.
She doesn't have a drug habit or some other truly debilitating issue. Although she's under
some financial stress, she's not desperate.

And that leads me to this question:

If even a woman like Olivia -- who was well-treated and made a lot of money and didn't
feel trapped; whose life sounded like the glam fantasy of today's high-end call girl -- if
even a woman like Olivia eventually needed a break from sex for money, then what
could this imply about the experience of less privileged women? I've got a bunch of sex
worker friends, and I would never say that a woman can't be a 100% consenting adult sex
worker who enjoys her job. But what I'm trying to get at, here, is that even on the high
end,” sex work can be incredibly demanding. Even when sex work is as pleasant as it
possibly can be, it's often very hard.

I'd like to see more conversations that acknowledge the reality of sex work as

summit, we responded. The only, brief, lull came when Arafat feared the
Americans would cancel his scheduled visit to Washington to see Clinton on
November 9. I was due to follow him three days later.

I met Clinton and Dennis Ross over dinner in a little kitchen area attached to the
Oval Office, and both seemed surprisingly upbeat. The President said he’d told
Arafat the broad points that would be in the new American negotiating paper. It
was Camp David-plus. Assuming all issues in a final peace were agreed, the
Palestinians would now end up, after a land swap near Gaza, with a “mid-90-
percent” share of the West Bank. On Jerusalem, the guiding principle would be
“what is Arab will be Palestinian, and what is Jewish, Israeli.” On the Temple
Mount, the Haram al-Sharif, each side would have control of its own holy sites.
Finally, though Palestinian refugees would be free to return in unlimited numbers
to a new Palestinian state, there would be no “right of return” to pre-1967 Israel.
The President told me that after he’d run all this by Arafat, he and Dennis had
asked whether “in principle” these were parameters he could accept. Arafat had
said yes.

I assume they expected me to say the same. But I told them I couldn’t give them
an answer. What concerned me now was the violence. Until it was reined in, I
would not be party to rewarding Arafat diplomatically. I urged the Americans to
make ending the violence their focus as well, because if they didn’t get tougher on
Arafat’s noncompliance with anything resembling a de-escalation, Israel would do
SO.

Since the Knesset had returned before my trip to Washington, I’d needed first to
make sure my government would survive. The obvious, or at least the most
mathematically secure, choice would have been a deal with Sharon. Especially
since the lynching in Ramallah, there were calls from politicians on all sides for a
unity coalition between Labor and Likud. Arik definitely wanted in. The main
issue reamined the peace process. I didn’t find Arik’s specific objections to Camp
David hard to deal with. As I’d said from the start, the fact that we’d failed to reach
an agreement at the summit meant that any concessions I’d considered were now,

Special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation may face a serious legal obstacle: It is tainted by 
antecedent political bias. The June 14 report from Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department's 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026477 
inspector general, unearthed a pattern of anti-Trump bias by high-ranking officials at the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation. Some of their communications, the report says, were not only indicative of a 
biased state of mind but imply a willingness to take action to impact a presidential candidate's 
electoral prospects. Although Mr. Horowitz could not definitively ascertain whether this bias 
directly affected specific FBI actions in the Hillary Clinton email investigation, it nonetheless 
affects the legality of the Trump-Russia collusion inquiry, code-named Crossfire Hurricane. 
Crossfire was launched only months before the 2016 election. Its FBI progenitors—the same ones 
who had investigated Mrs. Clinton—deployed at least one informant to probe Trump campaign 
advisers, obtained Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court wiretap warrants, issued national security 
letters to gather records, and unmasked the identities of campaign officials who were surveilled. They 
also repeatedly leaked investigative information. 
Mr. Horowitz is separately scrutinizing Crossfire and isn't expected to finish for months. But the 
current report reveals that FBI officials displayed not merely an appearance of bias against Donald 
Trump, but animus bordering on hatred. Peter Strzok, who led both the Clinton and Trump 
investigations, confidently assuaged a colleague's fear that Mr. Trump would become president: No 
he won't. We'll stop it. An unnamed FBI lawyer assigned to Crossfire told a colleague he was 
devastated and numb after Mr. Trump won, while declaring to another FBI attorney: Viva le 
resistance. 
The report highlights the FBI's failure to act promptly upon discovering that Anthony Weiner's laptop 
contained thousands of Mrs. Clinton's emails. Investigators justified the delay by citing the higher 
priority of Crossfire. But Mr. Horowitz writes: We did not have confidence that Strzok's decision to 
prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on [the] investigative lead discovered on the 
Weiner laptop was free from bias. 
Similarly, although Mr. Horowitz found no evidence that then-FBI Director James Comey was trying 
to influence the election, Mr. Comey did make decisions based on political considerations. He told the 
inspector general that his election-eve decision to reopen the Clinton email investigation was 
motivated by a desire to protect her assumed presidency's legitimacy. 
The inspector general wrote that Mr. Strzok's text messages created the appearance that investigative 
decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations. The report adds, importantly, that most 
of the text messages raising such questions pertained to the Russia investigation. Given how biases 
ineluctably shape behavior, these facts create a strong inference that by squelching the Clinton 
investigation and building a narrative of Trump-Russia collusion, a group of government officials 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026478 
I sought to bolster Mrs. Clinton's electoral chances and, if the unthinkable happened, obtain an 
insurance policy to cripple the Trump administration with accusations of illegitimacy. 
What does this have to do with Mr. Mueller, who was appointed in May 2017 after President Trump 
fired Mr. Comey? The inspector general concludes that the pervasive bias cast a cloud over the FBI 
investigations to which these employees were assigned, including Crossfire. And if Crossfire was 
politically motivated, then its culmination, the appointment of a special counsel, inherited the taint. All 
special-counsel activities—investigations, plea deals, subpoenas, reports, indictments and 
convictions—are fruit of a poisonous tree, byproducts of a violation of due process. That Mr. Mueller 
and his staff had nothing to do with Crossfire's origin offers no cure. 
When the government deprives a person of life, liberty or property, it is required to use fundamentally 
fair processes. The Supreme Court has made clear that when governmental action shocks the 
conscience, it violates due process. Such conduct includes investigative or prosecutorial efforts that 
appear, under the totality of the circumstances, to be motivated by corruption, bias or entrapment. 
In U.S. v. Russell (1973), the justices observed: We may someday be presented with a situation in 
which the conduct of law enforcement agents is so outrageous that due process principles would 
absolutely bar the government from invoking judicial processes to obtain a conviction. It didn't take 
long. In Blackledge v. Perry (1974), the court concluded that due process was offended by a 
prosecutor's realistic likelihood of 'vindictiveness'  that tainted the very initiation of proceedings. 
In Young v. U.S. ex rel. Vuitton (1987), the justices held that because prosecutors have power to 
employ the full machinery of the state in scrutinizing any given individual. . . we must have assurance 
that those who would wield this power will be guided solely by their sense of public responsibility for 
the attainment of justice. Prosecutors must be disinterested and make dispassionate assessments, 
free from any personal bias. 
In Williams v. Pennsylvania (2016), the court held that a state judge's potential bias violated due 
process because he had played a role, a quarter-century earlier, in prosecuting the death-row inmate 
whose habeas corpus petition he was hearing. The passage of time and involvement of others do not 
vitiate the taint but heighten the need for objective rules preventing the operation of bias that might 
otherwise be obscured, the justices wrote. A single biased individual might still have an influence 
that, while not so visible . . . is nevertheless significant. 
In addition to the numerous anti-Trump messages uncovered by the inspector general, there is a strong 
circumstantial case—including personnel, timing, methods and the absence of evidence—that 
Crossfire was initiated for political, not national-security, purposes. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026479 
It was initiated in defiance of a longstanding Justice Department presumption against investigating 
campaigns in an election year. And while impartiality is always required, a 2012 memo by then-
Attorney General Eric Holder emphasizes that impartiality is particularly important in an election 
year, and politics must play no role in the decisions of federal prosecutors or investigators regarding 
any investigations. . . . Law enforcement officers and prosecutors may never select the timing of 
investigative steps or criminal charges for the purpose of affecting any election, or for the purpose of 
giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party. 
Strong evidence of a crime can overcome this policy, as was the case with the bureau's investigation 
of Mrs. Clinton's private email server, which began more than a year before the 2016 election. But 
Crossfire was not a criminal investigation. It was a counterintelligence investigation predicated on the 
notion that Russia could be colluding with the Trump campaign. There appears to have been no 
discernible evidence of Trump-Russia collusion at the time Crossfire was launched, further reinforcing 
the notion that it was initiated for the purpose of affecting the presidential election. 
The chief evidence of collusion is the hacking of the Democratic National Committee's servers. But 
nothing in the public record suggests the Trump campaign aided that effort. The collusion narrative 
therefore hinges on the more generic assertion that Russia aimed to help Mr. Trump's election, and 
that the Trump campaign reciprocated by embracing pro-Russian policies. Yet despite massive 
surveillance and investigation, there's still no public evidence of any such exchange—only that Russia 
attempted to sow political discord by undermining Mrs. Clinton and to a lesser extent Mr. Trump. 
Some members of the Trump team interacted with Russians and advocated dovish policies. But so did 
numerous American political and academic elites, including many Clinton advisers. Presidential 
campaigns routinely seek opposition research and interact with foreign powers. The Clinton campaign 
funded the Steele dossier, whose British author paid Russians to dish anti-Trump dirt. The Podesta 
Group, led by the brother of Mrs. Clinton's campaign chairman, received millions lobbying for 
Russia's largest bank and the European Center for a Modern Ukraine, both with deep Kremlin ties. 
The Clinton Foundation and Bill Clinton took millions from Kremlin-connected businesses. 
No evidence has emerged of Trump-Russia collusion, and Mr. Mueller has yet to bring collusion-
related charges against anyone. Evidence suggests one of his targets, George Papadopoulos, was lured 
to London, plied with the prospect of Russian information damaging to Mrs. Clinton, and taken to 
dinner, where he drunkenly bragged that he'd heard about such dirt but never seen it. These 
circumstances not only fail to suggest Mr. Papadopoulos committed a crime, they reek of entrapment. 
The source of this information, former Australian diplomat Alexander Downer, admits Mr. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026480 
Papadopolous never mentioned emails, destroying any reasonable inference of a connection between 
the DNC hack and the Trump campaign. 
Crossfire's progenitors thus ignored an obvious question: If Russia promised unspecified dirt on Mrs. 
Clinton but never delivered it, how would that amount to collusion with the Trump campaign? If 
anything, such behavior suggests an attempt to entice and potentially embarrass Mr. Trump by 
dangling the prospect of compromising information and getting his aides to jump at it. 
Given the paucity of evidence, it's staggering that the FBI would initiate a counterintelligence 
investigation, led by politically biased staff, amid a presidential campaign. The aggressive methods 
and subsequent leaking only strengthen that conclusion. If the FBI sincerely believed Trump 
associates were Russian targets or agents, the proper response would have been to inform Mr. Trump 
so that he could protect his campaign and the country. 
Mr. Trump's critics argue that the claim of political bias is belied by the fact that Crossfire was not 
leaked before the election. In fact, there were vigorous, successful pre-election efforts to publicize the 
Trump-Russia collusion narrative. Shortly after Crossfire's launch, CIA Director John Brennan and 
Mr. Comey briefed Congress, triggering predictable leaking. Christopher Steele and his patrons 
embarked on a media roadshow, making their dossier something of an open secret in Washington. 
On Aug. 29, 2016, the New York Times published a letter to Mr. Comey from Senate Minority Leader 
Harry Reid, saying he'd learned of evidence of a direct connection between the Russian government 
and Donald Trump's presidential campaign, which had employed a number of individuals with 
significant and disturbing ties to Russia and the Kremlin. On Aug. 30, the ranking Democratic 
members of four House committees wrote a public letter to Mr. Comey requesting that the FBI assess 
whether connections between Trump campaign officials and Russian interests may have contributed 
to the DNC hack so as to interfere with the U.S. presidential election. On Sept. 23, Yahoo News's 
Michael Isikoff reported the Hill briefings and the Steele dossier's allegations regarding Carter Page. 
On Oct. 30, Harry Reid again publicly wrote Mr. Comey: In my communications with you and other 
top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive 
information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the 
Russian government. 
That these leaking efforts failed to prevent Mr. Trump's victory, or that Mr. Comey's ham-fisted 
interventions might have also hurt Mrs. Clinton's electoral prospects, does not diminish the legal 
significance of the anti-Trump bias shown by government officials. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026481 
The totality of the circumstances creates the appearance that Crossfire was politically motivated. Since 
an attempt by federal law enforcement to influence a presidential election shocks the conscience, 
any prosecutorial effort derived from such an outrageous abuse of power must be suppressed. The 
public will learn more once the inspector general finishes his investigation into Crossfire's genesis. 
But given what is now known, due process demands, at a minimum, that the special counsel's activity 
be paused. Those affected by Mr. Mueller's investigation could litigate such an argument in court. 
One would hope, however, that given the facts either Mr. Mueller himself or Deputy Attorney General 
Rod Rosenstein would do it first.

A Preschool-Based Roadmap to Advanced AGI

17.1 Introduction

Supposing the CogPrime approach to creating advanced AGI is workable — then what are the
right practical steps to follow? The various structures and algorithms outlined in Part 2 of
this book should be engineered and software-tested, of course — but that’s only part of the
study. The AGI system implemented will need to be taught, and it will need to be placed in
situations where it can develop an appropriate self-model and other critical internal network
structures. The complex structures and algorithms involved will need to be fine-tuned in various
ways, based on qualitatively observing the overall system’s behavior in various situations. To
get all this right without excessive confusion or time-wastage requires a fairly clear roadmap for
CogPrime development.

In this chapter we’ll sketch one particular roadmap for the development of human-level,
roughly human-like AGI — which we’re not selling as the only one, or even necessarily as the
best one. It’s just one roadmap that we have thought about a lot, and that we believe has a
strong chance of proving effective. Given resources to pursue only one path for AGI development
and teaching, this would be our choice, at present. The roadmap outlined here is not restricted
to CogPrime in any highly particular ways, but it has been developed largely with CogPrime
in mind; those developing other AGI designs could probably use this roadmap just fine, but
might end up wanting to make various adjustments based on the strengths and weaknesses of
their own approach.

What we mean here by a roadmap is, in brief: a sequence of milestone tasks, occurring
in a small set of common environments or scenarios, organized so as to lead to a commonly
agreed upon set of long-term goals. I.e., what we are after here is a capability roadmap —
roadmap laying out a series of capabilities whose achievement seems likely to lead to human-
level AGI. Other sorts of roadmaps such as tools roadmaps may also be valuable, but are not
our concern here.

More precisely, we confront the task of roadmapping by identifying scenarios in which to
embed our AGI system, and then competency areas in which the AGI system must be eval-
uated. Then, we envision a roadmap as consisting of a set of one or more task-sets, where each
task set is formed from a combination of a scenario with a list of competency areas. To create
a task-set one must choose a particular scenario, and then articulate a set of specific tasks,
each one addressing one or more of the competency areas. Each task must then get associated
with particular performance metrics — quantitative wherever possible, but perhaps qualitative

103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *850

It is [*851] unclear what portion of those incidents merit criminal prosecution. Key facts are often disputed, and while federal
and state jurisdiction are coextensive here, federal criminal law generally sets a higher bar for liability than state law, especially
due to its more onerous mens rea requirement. 7? That makes the former an imperfect backstop to the latter, because they are
only partially redundant. And as recent changes in federal policy suggest, 74 redundancy between governments is subject to
political shifts in those governments; federal oversight of state enforcement works only if federal officials are committed to the
oversight role. Moreover, keeping prosecution in the exclusive province of executive officials keeps prosecutorial discretion
more closely aligned with political majorities and thereby with popular sentiments about certain groups of defendants (such as
police officers) and victim groups (such as criminal suspects). In this context, redundancy in state law charging by courts or
private actors, rather than rival prosecutors, might make a real contribution. Finally, cases of sexual assault reveal a weakness
of federalism-based redundancy. State and federal criminal jurisdiction in the United States overlap more than elsewhere, but
they are not wholly coextensive. Federal prosecutors lack authority over most assaults that do not involve public officials or
federal [*852] property. Sexual assaults are one context in which the enforcement strategies favored in Europe and England -
regulated private prosecution or review of declination decisions - hold more promise.

I. UNDERENFORCEMENT AND REASONS NOT TO PROSECUTE
A. Sources of Unyustified Noncharging Decisions

Public prosecutors are the gatekeepers of criminal law enforcement, and justice systems employ a variety of safeguards against
prosecutors’ misjudgment, bias, incompetence, or laziness. Most are directed at prosecutors’ charging decisions rather than
decisions declining to charge (i.c., declination decisions), for familiar reasons - charging creates real burdens and risks for
defendants. *° Many familiar procedural components are aimed at preventing improper criminal charges or the harm they can
cause. Requirements that charges are based on sufficient evidence are an obvious example, but double jeopardy laws and
restrictions on prosecutors’ conflicts of interest serve the same purpose. The full range of pretrial and trial procedures designed
to assure accurate and unbiased adjudication are intended to sort out improper charges and attach punishments only to proper
ones. 7°

Safeguards against nonenforcement, or unjustified decisions not to prosecute, are fewer, are less explicit, and (in common law
jurisdictions) are less often in the form of legal rules and mandates. One explanation for this is simply that the interests at stake
are not as high - no individual faces prosecution and possible punishment. Another is that many non-prosecution decisions

assurance that such payment will reflect the fair value of the Fund’s existing investments at the
time such additional Limited Partners subscribe for such interests.

Difficulty in Valuing Portfolio Investments and Distribution in Kind

Generally, there will be no readily available market for a substantial number of the Fund’s
investments and hence, most of the Fund’s investments will be difficult to value. The securities
in which the Fund will invest may be among the most junior in a portfolio company’s capital
structure, and thus subject to the greatest risk of loss. It is highly speculative as to the whether
and when a portfolio company will be able to register its securities so that the securities become
eligible for trading in public markets. Certain investments may be distributed in kind to the
Partners of the Fund. An investor that receives assets other than cash from the Fund may incur
costs and delays in converting those assets to cash.

Non-Controlling Investments

The Fund generally expects to make non-controlling investments in portfolio companies where
the Fund may not be able to control or effectively influence the business or affairs of such
entities. Portfolio companies in which the Fund’s investments are made may have economic or
business interests or goals which are inconsistent with those of the Fund, and the Fund may not
be in a position to influence those interests or goals or otherwise protect the value of the Fund’s
investments in such entities. In addition, although the Fund may seek board representation in
connection with its investments, there is no assurance that such representation, if sought, will
be obtained.

Service on Board of Directors

The Fund typically will seek to have observation or visitation rights or the right to designate
directors to serve on the boards of directors of the Fund’s portfolio companies. In addition,
affiliates of the General Partner may serve, from time to time, as officers or directors of the
portfolio companies. The foregoing rights and activities could expose the General Partner, its
affiliates and the assets of the Fund to regulatory action and/or lawsuits and claims by a
portfolio company, its security holders and its creditors. While the General Partner intends to
manage the Fund in a way that will minimize exposure to these risks, the possibility of
successful claims or lawsuits or adverse regulatory action cannot be eliminated, and such events
could have significant adverse effects on the Fund.

Material Non-Public Information

By reason of their responsibilities in connection with their other activities, certain affiliates of
the General Partner may acquire confidential or material non-public information or be
otherwise restricted from initiating transactions in certain securities. The Fund will not be free
to act upon any such information. Due to these restrictions, the Fund may be not be able to
initiate a transaction that it otherwise might have initiated and may not be able to sell an
investment that it might otherwise might have sold.

In their capacity as officers or directors, affiliates of the General Partner will be subject to
fiduciary or other duties to the portfolio company, which may adversely affect the Fund. For
example, the Fund may be prohibited from selling publicly traded securities of a portfolio
company if the General Partner or any of its affiliates is in possession of material non-public
information relating to such company.

being burned and burned again—long ago made her wary and
sometimes defensive.

Up, Up, and Away

As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton has flown more than half a
million miles to 80 countries in her two and a half years on the job.
Her plane looks like Air Force One on the outside, but isn’t as grand
on the inside. It’s one of four Boeing 757s that the military fitted with
15 ordinary coach seats for reporters in the rear, a business-class staff
workspace with tables in the middle that seats about 25, and
Clinton’s quarters up front near an area jammed with
communications gear. She spends most of her time in a small private
room with a desk, a modest pullout sofa bed, and a flat-screen for
secure videoconferencing. The intimacy of the quarters intensified an
already awkward trip at the end of February when Samantha Power,
who had been forced to resign from the Obama campaign in 2008
after calling Hillary a “monster,” traveled with the secretary of state
to a U.N. Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva. Some months
before he died, Richard Holbrooke, the legendary special
representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, had brokered peace
between them, but now no one knew what would happen en route. “It
was uncomfortable, but everyone was extremely professional,” said
one official aboard.

For most of her thousands of hours in the air, Hillary changes out of
her trademark pantsuit (yellow is her favorite color for clothes and in
the décor of her homes) into a fleece top and sweats. Meals consist
largely of fruit and vegetables (she has a special taste for hot peppers)
and maybe a scotch or Bloody Mary. “Don’t bring me the dessert!”
she loudly tells the flight attendants only moments before sauntering
into the staff cabin, brownie already in hand: “I know—I’ve been
bad.” Occasional cupcakes with candles are also exempt because
Hillary is religious about observing staff birthdays. She resists

Palestinian leadership rejected that resolution, but this September
plans to ask the United Nations for recognition of its statehood with
the 1967 lines, a move strongly opposed by Israel.

Israel, for its part, has been campaigning against the flotilla and
perhaps doing more — some of the boats have suffered sabotage.
Israel says the Exodus is the wrong analogy; the flotilla is aimed at
delegitimizing Israel and killing its soldiers.

“The flotilla is entirely designed to attack Israel’s image around the
world,” said Yuli Edelstein, minister for public diplomacy. “We
know that there are representatives of different terror groups on their
way to join the flotilla.”

Israeli military officials have told newspapers that some flotilla
participants plan to pour sacks of sulfur on Israeli commandos and set
them afire. The flotilla organizers have denied it.

A government news release noted that Mr. Edelstein had participated
in a simulation exercise for the flotilla in which Israeli forces were
attacked. The description of the simulation indicates how the
government expects the harsh information war to play out: “As the
events were taking place, the media — with emphasis on the Internet,
Facebook and Twitter — were flooded with mendacious reports (by
private users, Hamas and others among Israel’s enemies).”
Mendacity has already reared its head. An Israeli actor put up a
YouTube clip saying that he was a gay activist rejected by the flotilla
because of his sexual orientation. The video was exposed as a fake.
Israeli officials, who had promoted the clip on Twitter and Facebook,
said they had been duped. But suspicions remained since the clip’s
production quality was high and officials had long used the talking
point that Hamas and other Islamist groups were intolerant of
homosexuality.

The Turkish group I.H.H., which helps sponsor the flotillas, has ties
to Hamas, and Israeli and Western concern that violence could occur

say, “Jeffrey Epstein left Bear of his own volition.” Epstein wanted
to strike out on his own, Cayne explains. But given the timing,
some questions remain. Then there’s Epstein’s own testimony,

opposition. Other critical voices in television and print
media later faced legal suits, regulatory harassment,
and withdrawal of advertising revenue until the own-
ers agreed to sell their holdings to business interests
that were on more friendly terms with the regime.’

A prominent theme that runs through authoritarian
media is the imperfect nature of electoral processes
in the leading democracies, especially the United
States. The goal is less to portray elections in Russia,

Venezuela, or |ran as paragons of democratic practice
than to muddy the waters—to make the case that
countries like the United States have no right to lec-
ture others on democracy, and that perhaps all elec-
tions are equally flawed. The Kremlin's chief propagan-
dist described the 2016 U.S. election as “so horribly
noxious that it only engenders disgust towards what is
still inexplicably called a ‘democracy.”*

A second important instrument in authoritarians’
election toolbox is the state itself. During his period
as Venezuela's president, Chavez became a master
at using state money and manpower to ensure voter
loyalty. In the 2012 election, the last before his death,
Chavez is estimated to have invested billions of dol-
lars in state resources, including giveaways of house-
hold goods to ordinary citizens, in a rather unsubtle
vote-buying campaign.

That election vividly illustrated the powerful interplay
of state media and state resources in undemocratic
settings, and it is worth examining in greater detail. Su-
perficially, it seemed reasonably consistent with dem-
ocratic standards. The voting itself took place without
serious violence or major complaints of irregularities.
But to a substantial degree, the results were shaped by
the regime's actions well before the ballots were cast.

Chavez had by that time secured an iron grip on the me-
dia. Through the state or political allies, he controlled six
of the eight national television stations and about half
of the country’s radio stations. In some regions, he com-
manded a virtual information monopoly. The opposition
was effectively shut out of the Chavez-aligned outlets,
earning mention only as cartoonish villains.

The incumbent benefited especially from a practice
whereby all radio and television stations are obliged to
preempt normal programming to accommodate the
president's speeches to the nation. During 2012, Chavez
took advantage of this tool to fill 100 hours of broadcast-
ing, 47 of them in the 90 days prior to the election. Aure-
lio Concheso, an analyst with Transparency Venezuela,

placed the value of this free airtime at $1.8 billion. Anoth-
er government mandate required radio and television
stations to broadcast 10 state messages of 30 seconds
each on a daily basis; the messages, not surprisingly,
dovetailed with the arguments of the Chavez campaign.
Concheso estimated the value of this free airtime at
$292 million. In addition, the government spent an es-
timated $200 million on advertising with private radio
and television stations. By contrast, the opposition had
access to five minutes of airtime a day, at a cost of $102
million. The opposition was thus limited to an incredible
4 percent of the airtime enjoyed by Chavez.

Meanwhile, according to Concheso, the state oil com-
pany spent some $20 billion on gifts of home durable
goods, apartments, and outright cash subsidies to
purchase the allegiance of Venezuelan voters and
underscore the message that without Chavez, this
largesse would dry up.

Finally, a measure of fear was introduced through a
campaign suggesting that although the balloting was
secret, the government had ways of ascertaining a
voter's choice. The threat had a special effect given
public memories of an episode in 2004, in which those
who signed a petition for a referendum to remove
Chavez from office were blacklisted and excluded
from government jobs, benefits, and contracts.

Favored tactics
The following are among the other tactics deployed by
modern authoritarians to ensure success at the polls:

1. Intimidating the opposition: Opposition leaders

are only occasionally targeted for assassination.
But they can face a variety of other cruel fates.
Wealthy businessman and opposition supporter
ikhail Khodorkovsky was dispatched to a Rus-
sian prison for 10 years for daring to challenge
Putin. In 2017, anticorruption campaigner Andrei
Navalny, widely regarded as the most serious
challenger to Putin, was effectively eliminated
from the 2018 presidential contest after being
convicted in a trumped-up embezzlement case.?
n Malaysia, opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim
has twice been convicted and jailed on sodomy
charges. Prominent political figures have also
been jailed in Belarus, Venezuela, lran, Ethiopia,
Turkey, and Egypt, among many others. Human
rights activists and bloggers are also subject to
harassment and persecution. They are frequent-
ly jailed on trumped-up charges of defamation,
tax fraud, or drug trafficking, among others.

Introduction

The Department of Justice and the United States
Postal Inspection Service are committed to ensuring
that victims of federal crime are treated fairly as their
case moves through the criminal justice system.

In order to provide victims with information on case
events, the Department of Justice has developed the
Victim Notification System (VNS). This brochure
provides information about VNS.

Victim Notification System (VNS)

VNS is a cooperative effort between the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBD, the United States
Postal Inspection Service (USPIS), the United States
Attorneys’ Offices, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons
(BOP).

This free, computer-based system provides important
information to victims. In many cases you will
receive letters generated through VNS containing
information about the events pertaining to your case
and/or any defendants in the case.

This information is also available in English and
Spanish on the Internet and through a toll-free
telephone number (Call Center). In cases with many
victims, you may receive only one letter and then be
directed to the Internet or Call Center for further
information.

VNS Information

Registration:

You will receive a Victim Identification Number
(VIN) and a Personal Identification Number (PIN)
that will allow you to access VNS on the Internet and
using your telephone. You may write those numbers
on the attached tear-off card to keep with you.

If you have chosen to participate in VNS, but have
not received these numbers, please contact either the
FBI, the USPIS, or U.S. Attorney’s Office handling
your case.

nse ~=- Your VIN and PIN numbers are
both required any time you
contact the Call Center or when
accessing VNS on the Internet.

VNS Internet Access:

© You may access information about the case via

the Internet at: http://www.Notify. USDOJ.Gov
‘You will be required to enter your VIN and
your PIN.

® The Web site, in some instances, may provide

additional information that is not available
through the Call Center.

(Refer to Common Questions, numbers 4, 5 & 6
below, for more information regarding the Internet.)

The VNS Call Center:

You may call 1-866-DOJ-4YOU (1-866-365-
4968) for current information. You will be
required to enter your VIN and your PIN.

By following the prompts, VNS will provide
custody information and notice of upcoming
court events.

The Call Center will include options to hear:

Q
Upcoming Events - information on future
court hearings

Historical Court Events - information on past
court hearings

Detailed Information on Each Defendant -
information regarding criminal charges filed,
the outcome of the charges, and the sentence
imposed by the Court; if the defendant is in the
custody of BOP, the custody location,
projected date of release from custody and
other release information.

VNS Notification:

‘You may also receive information about case events
by telephone, email, numeric pager, or fax. Please
note that in some rare instances, VNS may contact
you by phone which will require use of your PIN.

Common Questions

Below are some common questions about VNS. If at
any time you have a question about VNS that is not
answered here, please feel free to contact your local
FBI, USPIS, or U.S. Attorney’s Office.

Top 100
Private Cannabis Companies 2018

In this chapter, we present our current list of the Top 100 Private Cannabis Companies. Our determi-
nation to include companies on the list is subjective, and the list is intended to be a cross-section of the
types of companies in the cannabis industry. Our list comprises privately held companies, primarily
U.S. companies, companies we believe have a strong reputation or position in their market segments
and companies pursuing a line of business we consider promising. We intend to update our list period-
ically, and we expect it may change significantly over time.

Most companies on our list are in early stages of development, and many will need to raise capital to
succeed. Raising capital for early-stage companies in any industry is extremely challenging. Early-stage
cannabis companies seeking capital face the same challenges as early-stage companies in other indus-
tries but must also address challenges unique to the cannabis industry. Although we hope the compa-
nies on our list ultimately succeed, we expect some will go out of business for any number of reasons,
including lack of access to capital.

Inclusion in our list does not represent an investment recommendation or endorsement of any
particular company or product. We have made investments in and conducted investment banking and
other services for companies included in the 7op 100 Private Cannabis Companies 2018 list, and may
do so in the future. Readers should be aware that we may have a conflict of interest that could affect the
objectivity of our decision to include a company in the list. For additional disclosures and disclaimers,
see page 175.

emphasized that it conferred a broad [*86] right. !°° The reason for adopting such a broad right was that too often victims
of crime experience a secondary victimization at the hands of the criminal justice system. This provision is intended to direct
Government agencies and employees, whether they are in the executive or judiciary branch, to treat victims of crime with the
respect they deserve. !°° OLC's failure to consider the purposes underlying the CVRA is a glaring oversight.

OLC never attempts to explain why the CVRA's drafters would want victims to have a right to fair treatment once criminal
charges were filed but possess no such right before the filing of criminal charges. Clearly, many victims can and do suffer
secondary victimization during criminal investigations, such as when sexual assault victims are treated inappropriately by law
enforcement agents. !>7 It would contradict the purpose of preventing victim mistreatment in the criminal justice system to
artificially limit the right to fairness to the point at which charges are filed. The right to fairness logically applies at all stages of
the criminal justice process.

C. OLC'S INEFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO THE CVRA'S COVERAGE AND VENUE PROVISIONS

At the end of its memorandum, OLC finally discusses what it identifies as the two strongest arguments for construing the
CVRA as applying before charging: the coverage provision and the venue provision. OLC acknowledges, as it must, that the
CVRA's coverage extends to any federal employee engaged in the detection, investigation or prosecution of crime. '*8 Such
employees shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded, the rights afforded by the
statute. !°? Notably, this duty applies to individuals not just in the Justice Department (where all federal prosecutors are
located) but other agencies as well, such [*87] as environmental crimes investigators in the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA). !6°

This coverage provision would seem to answer any lingering question about whether the CVRA applies before charging. In
directing that federal employees engaged in the detection and investigation of crime must respect victims’ rights, Congress
wanted broad rights extending beyond just the prosecution of a case. As the district court concluded in the Epstein case, this
provision surely contemplates pre-charge application of the CVRA. 16!

OLC gamely maintains, however, that Congress was simply trying to provide that federal law enforcement agents should
provide rights to victims when a criminal case moves to its prosecution phase. OLC noted the uncontroversial point that law
enforcement agents often develop a relationship of trust with crime victims during the investigation that continues as they
assist crime victims in negotiating active criminal proceedings. !©* OLC then asserted:

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024050.txt,"e Investment Theme - Care Coordination: Today in healthcare, most conditions require the
involvement of multiple healthcare professionals, including primary care physicians,
specialists, nurses, assistants, and therapists, and the care they provide must be
managed closely with participation from the patients themselves and their family
members. Unfortunately, poor coordination and information sharing amongst
caregivers creates significant inefficiencies at the points of hand-off between providers,
leading to repeat tests, missed diagnoses, and expensive mistakes that diminish
outcomes, and in some cases put patients at substantial risk. TigerText (NLV-ID) has
developed a secure text messaging platform that can be used on any mobile phone that
allows healthcare professionals to rapidly communicate and exchange clinical data files
to improve and coordinate care.

e Investment Theme - Clinical Error Reduction: Administrative, medication and procedural
errors are responsible for billions of dollars of cost annually in the U.S. healthcare
system. Many of these problems can be reduced by bringing relevant information into
the right setting at the appropriate time. For example, ePocrates (Sprout IX, NASDAQ:
EPOC - Acquired by athenahealth for $293 million, 3.1x multiple) allows physicians to
quickly reference drug formulary, dosing and interaction information, thus reducing the
error rate in prescriptions.

Problem Area: Unnecessary Services & Missed Prevention Opportunities

e Investment Theme - Analytics & Data-Driven Personalization: Many conditions are currently
diagnosed on single or limited data points, measured in the hospital or physicians’

office, that may not accurately reflect (or detect) the patients’ condition. Examples
include diseases with episodic or fluctuating symptoms such as cardiac arrhythmias,
Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, depression and other behavioral health issues. iRhythm
Technologies (NLV-II) developed and markets an innovative, highly wearable, patch
technology capable of recording continuous electrocardiograms for up to 14 days. This
product has demonstrated a 5x improvement in diagnostic yield for cardiac arrhythmias
relative to 24 - 48 hour Holter monitoring.

The large scale deployment of electronic medical records (“EMRs”), healthcare
information exchanges, and diagnostic and monitoring technologies, is driving
exponential growth in professional health data around patient care and outcomes. At
the same time, patients are discussing and sharing their own health care experiences and
personal health data involving providers, therapeutics, and procedures on the internet.
These vast and rapidly growing professional and consumer oriented healthcare data sets
create an unprecedented repository of longitudinal data on populations of patients. By
mining these data sets using big-data techniques and technologies that are being
deployed successfully in other industries, it is possible to identify important findings
that have huge commercial value that might previously have never have been detected.
Specifically, the Fund Managers believe analytics applied to these data sets will allow
care gaps to be readily identified and addressed, and best practices to be frequently
revised, leading to a consistent iterative cycle of improvement. Treato (NLV-II) has
developed a social health intelligence platform (aka “Social Listening”) that identifies,
analyzes and aggregates medical user generated content spread widely across the web

some of his fellow judges, especially Warren Burger. Sparks would fly and Bazelon generally
ended up in dissent, but he had made his point.

Years later, in my first popular book, The Best Defense, I summarized what I had first seen in
Judge Bazelon’s chambers and had then experienced in several cases I had litigated as a practicing
lawyer. I called my summary “The Rules of the Justice Game:”

Rule I: Almost all criminal defendants are, in fact, guilty.

Rule II: All criminal defense lawyers, prosecutors and judges understand and believe Rule
ke

Rule III: It is easier to convict guilty defendants by violating the Constitution than by

complying with it, and in some cases it is impossible to convict guilty defendants
without violating the Constitution.

Rule IV: Almost all police lie about whether they violated the Constitution in order to
convict guilty defendants.

Rule V: All prosecutors, judges and defense attorneys are aware of Rule IV.

Rule VI: Many prosecutors implicitly encourage police to lie about whether they violated
the Constitution in order to convict guilty defendants.

Rule VII: All judges are aware of Rule VI.
Rule VIII: Most trial judges pretend to believe police officers who they know are lying.

Rule IX: All appellate judges are aware of Rule VII, yet many pretend to believe the trial
judges who pretend to believe the lying police officers.

Rule X: Most judges disbelieve defendants about whether their constitutional rights have
been violated, even if they are telling the truth.

Rule XI: Most judges and prosecutors would not knowingly convict a defendant who they
believe to be innocent of the crime charged (or a closely related crime).

Rule XII: Rule XI does not apply to members of organized crime, drug dealers, career
criminals, or potential informers.

Rule XIII: [Almost] Nobody really wants justice.
The seeds of my career as a criminal lawyer were planted deeply into fertile soil during my
clerkship. So were the seeds of my career as an academic who focused, early in my years at

Harvard, on the relationship between law and the social sciences, especially psychiatry and
psychology.

peace or the fiber-speed transformation of telecommunications or billion-user
financial grids. It’s thin air up at this level, honestly, by which I mean that at these
elevated heights you see the most ambitious athletes of human power at work: The
maniacal CEO, the egotistical statesman, the mad dictator. Hundreds of millions of
lives are in play; even more in some cases. By a “grand strategy” we mean the very
peak of this sort of consideration. It represents, in the world of global affairs, the
construction of a strategic idea that suggests how military, diplomacy, markets, and
politics might be harnessed, firmly, in service of a singular aim. Grand strategy is a
basic stance towards the world. If it works, it liberates creativity and national
energy. It sets a clear direction*‘. It protects against the steep price of surprise.
Grand strategy holds, in a single concept, the nature of their age and our plans to use
that nature for the aims - security, prosperity - that gird a nation’s life and decide
its future. Like it or not, we all live under the umbrella raised by grand strategic
choices.

“Containment” of the Cold War period, “Balance of Power” from Europe’s 19
Century Age of Revolutions, or the “Tributary Alliances” that shaped a thousand
years of Chinese power - these were all big, essential organizing grand strategic
concepts. They shaped security decisions for durable empires. Each balanced ideal
aims like freedom or the preservation of dynastic continuity against technological
revolution, economic crisis, ideologies and the numberless other forces that can
crack empires. Each idea reflected the demands of the age, and as a result each tells
us something about power in those eras.

The Chinese strategist General Liu Yazhou observed a few years ago in a widely
circulated essay, perhaps a bit too eagerly, “A major state can lose many battles, but
the only loss that is always fatal is to be defeated in strategy.”5> There’s something a
bit cold in that line, but it expresses a hard truth. Massiveness and deep
commitment to a particular, flawed view of the world can turn strength to weakness
in a heartbeat. In our connected age this sort of reversal can happen with a
particularly devastating speed. In the past, traditional measures of power - tanks,
airplanes, national wealth - declined or rose as a gradual process. It took years for
Genoa to fund and build an expeditionary force to gut Venice’s Adriatic designs.
Decades passed as Germany built her naval fleet. But in our age, such slower-moving
measures are of limited use. Network systems rise and fall with astonishing speed.
Once-successful firms in technology, companies like Wang or Fairchild
Semiconductor or MySpace, found themselves unseated in months, after years of
growth. New firms can emerge as if from nowhere and erase once cherished
balances, demolish once strong names. Google unseats Britannica. Ride-sharing
firms vaporize taxi medallion economics. “Change or die,” the old computer

more than just friends with a summer crush. “ You see... your problem is
that you don’t see what I am looking at right here in front of me, a
beautiful girl who is completely lost in a game that she has no control
over. Get out of it now, take my hand and follow me back to my home in
Australia.” I heard what he had said but I found it hard to comprehend
what he was actually talking about. “What?” I asked him with a look of
confusion on my face. “Your nobody’s property, you can do this. Marry
me.” His statements got more and more profound as he went on.
Repeating the question he got on one knee and proposed again “ Jenna, I
am in love with you and want to spend the rest of my life making you
happy. Please don’t go back to him. I know that | am the only one for you
and I will always treat you right. He paused for another second and
repeated his question “Jenna, will you please marry me?” My hands fell
into my face after that and without even letting myself think through the
answer, ! let my heart do all of the talking. Looking back up at him I said
“Yes!” | almost shouted the answer at him, as if saying it louder would
give the word more meaning. Wanting to believe him and everything that
he was saying felt like a vacation from all of the suffering and loneliness
that I had endured over a lifetime of abuse and degradation but knowing
what you want and getting it are two different things that rarely went
hand in hand...or so I thought. All 1 knew from the brief period I had
known this stranger was that he was offering me a life and love down an
unfamiliar path and it was a gamble to believe a complete stranger but
somehow I knew he was right. My heart was beating so loud I thought it
was going to jump right out of my chest. With the earnestly in my reply
he picked me up in his strong arms and took me back to the bed and
reiterated his words in a more physical sense this time. Never had I felt
loved like this before, so swept off my feet and unable to even think, eat,
or do anything for that matter which would involve leaving the hotel
room without him.

Everyday after school would be my Robbie waiting to take me back to
the hotel room for another night’s passionate rendezvous, but a few
nights after his proposal, he had another surprise in store. He didn’t just
want to get married someday. He wanted to get married now, this week
even. I walked into the fabric store and was attended too by several
seamstresses who were already be expecting my arrival. I was there to
design and have fun designing my own dream wedding dress. While I
was busy picking out fabrics and having measurements taken I would
look away for a moment only to catch his tender eyes staring in my
direction. Such adoration behind his looks...could it be real? I would
often ponder it to myself just hoping for the gamble I was taking to work

out. I still had to believe in something better than what I was accustomed
too and here he was right smack dab in front of me.

Giggling at all of the lace and frills they were trying to dress me up in,
looking more like an antique porcelain doll than anything else T closed
my eyes and pictured the day that I thought would never come, starting to
imagine the kind of dress I would like to wear I envisioned a simple
sleekness, a complimentary figure hugging gown with a small train but
long enough to distinct it as an actual wedding dress. After we settled on
what we were going to wear for the big day, we would next have to
decide where we would hold the ceremony. Not before celebrating the
entire week beforehand though. We started our honeymoon early
celebrating every night spending our time between my hotel room and
sending our heads spinning on the dance floor at many different clubs.
Only with each other in sight, the dance floor was ours, we were out to

my life’s direction but the other part of me knew I was already asking too
much of him.

Calling his office in New York I was transferred to Jeffrey’s personal
office. He picked up the phone on the third ring, pausing before I could
get any of the words to come out of my mouth but I mustered up my
courage eventually and gave him my prepared spiel. Beginning with how
much I had appreciated everything he has done for me up until this point.
T hoped he would be understanding but he just wanted me to hurry up and
get to the point. Trying to contagiously pass on my excitement through
the phone lines, I finally screamed out “I’m getting married! Can you
believe it?” No reply was given only a silence on the other end. Trying to
make some conversation ridding the uncomfortable silence, | went on to
tell him about Robbie and how I had fallen madly in love with him over

its terror attack on a Pan American airliner in the late 1980s. Or, as in South
Africa, that a change in nuclear policy might come from a change in régime in
Tehran. Yet realistically, we couldn’t count on either. And there was no doubt in
our minds that a nuclear Iran represented a hugely serious threat. If the Shi’ite
Muslim regime in Iran did get a nuclear weapon, Sunni Arab states like Egypt and
Saudi Arabia, and Turkey as well, would try to go nuclear. Neither they nor we
could assume that Iran was developing a bomb as a mere act of deterrence. We
couldn’t exclude the possibility that, especially in a crisis threatening the survival
of the ayatollahs’ rule, Iran would use the weapons it was developing. It could
even send a nuclear device in a container smuggled on board a commercial vessel
docking in one of Israel’s ports.

While few in Israel disputed the seriousness of the threat, a number of top
political and military figures had deep misgivings about military action. Given the
need for secrecy, most of our discussions took place within the so-called Group of
Eight, often also including the chief of staff and other top generals from the kirva.
Both Dan Meridor and Benny Begin, Menachem Begin’s son and a minister
without portfolio, were opposed to an Israeli attack from the start. They were
convinced that the implications for the region, and for our relations with the wider
world, were difficult to predict and potentially dire. Dan raised a further concern.
He feared an Israeli attack might actually intensify Iran’s effort to get a nuclear
bomb, only now with political cover, because it would argue it was acting in self-
defense. The view of those opposed to an Israeli strike was that we should rely on
American economic and political pressure to deal with the threat. And, if that
failed, on American military action.

In November 2010, the internal debate came to a head, at a meeting involving
the Group of Eight as well as the chief of staff, the head of military intelligence
and the commander of the air force. We convened in a villa that the Mossad kept
for clandestine foreign visitors, near the coastal road north of Tel Aviv. The
meeting began with a presentation by the generals of our attack plan. There was
still a core of ministers opposed: chiefly Dan Meridor and Benny Begin, but also
Boogie Ya’alon, a former Sayeret Matkal commander and chief of staff who
Minister of Strategic Affairs. But the confidence and detail with which the plan
was laid out, and the fact that Bibi, Lieberman and I were in favor of being
prepared to act, gave me the sense that a majority would back military action if it
became necessary. The proviso would be the need for the chief-of-staff, and ideally

Stevens, the assistant registrar of UMUC, who I spoke to at the base
in 2016, told me that the program in 2009 did not provide gradu-
ate courses in computer sciences. According to the program’s record,
while Snowden had enrolled as a student in the summer of 2009, he
received neither any credits nor a certificate.

In October 2009, Dell assigned Snowden a job in which he had
direct access to the NSA’s computers. He was now a system adminis-
trator, which is essentially a tech-savvy repairman. Dell was working
on a backup system code-named EPICSHELTER. For this contract,
Dell was transferring large chunks of data from the NSA’s main
computers in Maryland to backup drives in Japan so that the system
could be quickly restored if there was a communications interrup-
tion, Because most of the classified data was in its encrypted form, it
had little value to any outside party. Snowden’s job was to maintain
the proper functioning of computers, but as a system administrator
he also had privileges to call up unencrypted files. He sat in front of a
computer screen all day looking for any problems in the transferring
of files to backup servers.

© The work was highly repetitive and exceedingly dull. Snowden ©
found time to search for anomalies in the system, and he claimed
to have spotted a major flaw in the security system in late 2009. He
discovered that a rogue system administrator in Japan could steal
secret data without anyone else’s realizing that it had been stolen.
Snowden brought that to the attention of his superiors, as he later
said,

The emergence of a rogue system administrator was not that far-
fetched in 2009. Hacktivists such as Julian Assange had adopted the
battle cry “Sysadmins of the world, unite.” Instead of asking them
to “throw off their chains,” as Marx did, he asked them to send clas-
sified documents about secret government activity to the WikiLeaks
site. Snowden, as a “sys admin,” was aware he had the power to do
so. He recalled in Moscow in 2014, “I actually recommended they
[the NSA] move to two-man control for administrative access back
in 2009.” To make his point even clearer, he added, “A whistleblower
could use these things, but so could a spy.” Not without irony,
Snowden became that rogue system administrator some three years

that the state case is stil] pending. As such, the procedural posture of the state case does not
implicate the petite policy.

the policy “does not apply ... where the [state] prosecution, involved only 4 minor part of the

should federal proceedings take place,

Federalism and Prosecutorial Discretion. All of the above issues essentially ask whether
a federal prosecution can proceed. We understand, however, that you also ask whether a federal
prosecution skoudd proceed, even in the event that all of the elements of a federal offense could
be proven. On this issue, you raised two arguments: thal the conduct at issue here is traditional ly
a4 state concern because the activity is entirely local, and that the typical prosecution under federal

policy that a United States Attomey’s Office should not pursue a prosecution. We do not think

Simply, the commercial sexual exploitation of children is a federal concern, even when
the conduct is local, and tegardless of whether the defendant provided the child (the “pimp”) or

fraud, or coercion was used. Indeed, the point being made in that letter is that the Department’s
efforts are Properly focused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children and the
exploitation of adults through the use of force, fraud, or coercion, As such, there is no
inconsistency between the position taken in that letter and the federal prosecution of wholly local
instances of the commercial Sexual exploitation of children,

If Congress wanted to limit the reach of federal statutes only to those who profit from the
commercial sexual exploitation of children, or only to those who actually traffic children across
state lines, it could have done so. It did not. Finally, that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not
look precisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive, We can say with confidence
that this case is consistent in principle with other federal prosecutions nationwide. As such, Mr,
Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursve 4 prosecution even though it might
involve a novel application of a federal statute,

Conclusion. After carefully considering all the factual and legal issues taised, as well as
the arguments concerning the general propriety of a federal case against Mr. Epstein on these

system by an arrow on the surface of action, the manifold, of a dynamical system.
This field of arrows indicating directional and strength of motional tendencies is
called a vector field. A vector represents its location at the base of the arrow, its
velocity by the length of the arrow (called the modulus) and the direction of the
motion by the direction of the arrow. If we regard all moduli as equal to one, every
vector on the surface has the same length. The resulting graphs are called direction
fields. Looking at a stop-action photograph of any point on this surface, its
associated vector informs about where the system would take it over the next unit of
time. The whole surface can be marked by initial points, which the dynamical
systems move as they generate patterns of orbits of moving arrows in time. The
following two brain and behavioral experimental circumstances make this depiction
and its relevance to dynamical entropy more concrete.

We review in more detail the concrete and visualizable findings from
experiments requiring the quantification of characteristic patterns of motion in
animals and man. They can be embedded into a similar surface-like setting, which
might be called a behavioral manifold. For examples, my students from the past,
Martin Paulus and Mark Geyer, now Professors at the Medical School of the La
Jolla branch of the University of California studied the effects of psychotropic drugs
on the patterns made on the floor by rats of various genetic strains while they
wandered about, in exploratory behavior in a bounded space. Monitored by a video
camera placed above the ceiling less cages, the patterns made by the paths taken
by the rats over time were reconstructed as vectorial orbits on a behavioral
manifold. This manifold was then repeatedly partitioned, covered with, from just a
few large, in graded progression, to many smaller boxes, each partition composed
of rectangular lattices of a particular size. Units of time were also partitioned into
range of units from larger to smaller durations of observation. Differences in the
rat’s genetic strain as well as injections of stimulants, antidepressants or
antipsychotic drugs resulted in characteristic and discriminable path geometries
mapped onto the behavioral manifold as orbital patterns. Each path was encoded

as a sequence of size-dependent numbered boxes that were entered and occupied

and winter of 2012. Many of the documents he took off the NSANet
revealed operations not only of the NSA but also of the CIA and the
Pentagon. By taking them, he had come to a Rubicon from which
there would be no return. He later explained in an e-mail to Vanity
Fair from Moscow, “I crossed that line.”

As far as is known, Snowden was not sharing documents with any
other party prior to May 2013. He was not even yet in contact with
Poitras, Greenwald, or any other journalists. Presumably, Snowden
was collecting them on drives—despite the risks that possessing
such a collection of secrets might entail—for some future use.

Why would Snowden jeopardize his career and, if caught, his free-
dom by undertaking this illicit enterprise? He might by now have
had strong ideological objections to the NSA’s global surveillance. As
he said later in Moscow, “We're subverting our security standards
for the sake of surveillance.” Ordinarily, though, even ideologically
opposed employees don’t steal state secrets and risk imprisonment.
If they are disgruntled, they seek employment elsewhere. Certainly,
Snowden, with his three years’ experience working for Dell, would

® have little problem finding a job as an IT worker in the booming ®
civilian sector of computer technology. Instead, he sought to widen
his access to NSA documents. This behavior suggests that he might
have had another agenda. One possible clue to it is the first docu-
ment he took: the NSA exam. The answers to the questions in it
represented to him a form of tactical power. Those answers could
empower him to obtain a more important job in the NSA itself that
would allow him to burrow deeper into the executive structure of
the agency. Holding such a job would unlock the door to documents
containing the NSA’s sources stored in areas not available to Dell
contractors like himself.

His later actions demonstrated that he equated the possession of
such secrets with personal power. For example, after he arrived in
Moscow in 2013, he bragged to James Risen of the Times that he
had access to secrets that gave him great leverage over the NSA. He
told him specifically his access to “full lists” of the NSA’s agents and
operations in adversary countries could, if revealed, close down the
NSA’s capabilities to gather information in them.

Such a fascination with the power of government-held secrets

My Year of Clerking For Justice Goldberg

Justice Arthur Goldberg was a man of action. Before being nominated at age 54 to the Supreme
Court by President John F. Kennedy, Goldberg had accomplished an enormous amount. Unlike
most of the current justices, he would have been in the history books even had he never served on
the High Court.

Arthur Goldberg helped establish the profession of labor law. He represented the most important
labor unions in the country. He helped merge the American Federation of Labor (AFL) with the
Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). He helped rid unions of communist influence. He
argued some of the most significant cases before the Supreme Court and other courts, including
the Steel Seizure Case of 1951. He was, perhaps the most successful Secretary of Labor in
history, settling one strike after another and being recognized as a legendary mediator.

The Supreme Court is not a place of action, it is an institution of reaction—to cases and
controversies generated by others. It is a place of thoughtful, often solitary, meditation and
research. Justice Goldberg was used to working with many people. He was accustomed to crisis.
His phone had always rung. When he arrived at the Supreme Court, as he once summarized the
situation, “my phone never rings.” The High Court is the loneliest of institutions. As Justice
Brandeis once put it, “here we do our own work.” The Justices only occassionally interact: on
the bench, in the weekly, somewhat formal, conference; and in informal one-on-one meetings,
which were rare then and even rarer today. It is fair to say that Justice Goldberg was somewhat
lonely, often restless and craved the active life he had left behind.

This is not to say that Justice Goldberg was not a serious intellectual. He was. He was also one
of the smartest justices in history. He loved the Supreme Court. He loved the law. He loved
having intense discussions with his law clerks about jurisprudence and the role of the Supreme
Court. But he needed more than contemplation, deliberation and discussion. The “passive
virtues,” as Professor Alexander Bickel once characterized the Supreme Court’s role in not
making decisions, was a vice to Arthur Goldberg. He wanted to get things done. He too was an
unapologetic judicial activist. He came to the High Court with an agenda—a list of changes he
wanted to help engender.

I will never forget my first meeting with my new boss when I came to work in the Supreme Court
during the summer of 1963. He tossed a certiorari petition at me from across his desk and asked
me to read it in his presence. It was only a few pages long and I did. He then asked me, “What
do you see in it?” I said, “It’s just another pro se cert petition in a capital case.” He said, “No,
what you’re holding in your hand is the vehicle by which we can end capital punishment in the
United States.” Abolishing the death penalty was the first item on his “to do” list as a justice.

My major responsibility during the first part of my clerkship was to draft a memorandum
supporting Justice Goldberg’s views that the death penalty was cruel and unusual punishment in
violation of the Constitution. He knew we had no chance of getting the majority to support that
view—at least not yet—but he wanted to start a dialogue that would ultimately lead to the judicial
abolition of the death penalty. He decided to focus first on an interracial rape case involving an
African American defendant and a white victim, since almost no whites had been executed for

on what it means really to live.

A friend of mine who runs one of the leading technology firms told me of the
unnerving realization that the most important figures at the firm were under 25 -
and no senior person had much of an idea about what they were doing. This is an
inversion: Usually in a society the most power accrues to those with the most
experience, and judgment and perspective. Today, tremendous even decisive
influence clusters in the hands and machines of a young caste whose very fluency
with the norms of a revolutionary age blots out a whole set of important
connections, a group that instinctively feels networks but is deaf to the music of
philosophy, history and even tragedy that should inform the operation of so much
power. To love risk, to love creating and building - this is fine. Wonderful even. But
it’s also not enough.

“It happens that programming is a relatively easy craft to learn,” the MIT scientist
Joseph Weizenbaum observed in the 1970s, as computers emerged into academic
life. “Almost anyone with a reasonably ordered mind can become a good
programmer with just a little instruction and practice. And because programming is
almost immediately rewarding, that is because a computer very quickly begins to
behave somewhat in the way a programmer intends it to, programming is very
seductive.” The mistake, Weizenbaum warned, was to think that easy programming
of a machine was really a predictor of anything other than getting a machine to
follow commands. It didn’t mean easy programming of a complete operation. Or of
science. Or, godforbid, to think you could easily program the world. Programming,
he warned, “appeals most to those who do not yet have sufficient maturity to
tolerate long delays between an effort to achieve something and the concrete
appearance of success. Immature students are therefore easily misled into believing
that they have mastered a craft of immense power and of great importance when, in
fact, they have learned only the rudiments.”3! Tempting as it may be to call for our
world to be turned over to entrepreneurs or technocrats, to let their tools of wired
efficiency tear with a fast disruptive enthusiasm into our politics and economics, the
reality is that the world (thankfully) does not respond like a cold machine. That
delay between an effort to achieve something and its realization that Weizenbaum
mentioned, it’s the essence of being human. The delay is filled with worry, hope,
debate, exploration, error, success. In short, it’s a hitch that should never be ground
out of our system, no more by technology than by authoritarian or totalitarian or
fundamentalist doctrines that have ever promised instant solution to any probem.
“Just let the entrepreneuers do it” or “Just let the machinces do it,” is no more a
solution than “Just let the Nazis handle this,” could have been.

So this is our dilemma: Old, white-haired, network-blinded leaders (and young
figures who think like them despite their age) pull us from Washington and other

struck me from that first meeting as strong, cool-headed, highly intelligent and
intensely cerebral. Though we didn’t go into the details of the Iranian nuclear
threat, he did talk at some length about the implications for the region, and about
broader Middle Eastern security challenges. He displayed a grasp of the cultural
and political nuances of an increasingly diverse and complex world that was more
impressive than many of the other American political or military leaders whom I’d
met.

When he and I now returned to the issue of Iran, in the White House, he had an
undeniable command of the details of Iran’s nuclear program, and of the American
military options, should he choose to use them. He opened by summarizing the US
position. He emphasized that his and our objective was the same: the keep Iran
from developing a nuclear weapon. We were already cooperating to achieve that,
for instance through cyber-attacks to slow down the nuclear program. The
difference, he said, was that Israeli leaders seemed to feel an urgent need to reach a
decision on military action. In Obama’s view, such a move would be both
premature and potentially harmful to the coalition he’d helped assemble to exert
diplomatic and economic pressure on Iran.

Maybe you had to be an Israeli truly to understand our urgency about Iran. In
the early years of the state, the explanation we gave for our preoccupation with
security — our near-obsession, as some non-Israelis saw it — was that we were
surrounded by Arab countries pledged not just to defeat us, but erase us from the
map. Egypt or Syria, Jordan or Iraq, could afford to lose an Arab-Israeli war.
Israel’s first defeat, however, would be its last. That picture had changed
dramatically over the decades. We no longer had to worry about the prospect of
losing a war. The “qualitative edge” we possessed over all enemy armies in the
region ensured that. As Israel’s chief of staff, Prime Minister, and now Defense
Minister, I had made it a major priority to safeguard that advantage, not just
through our alliance with the US but with the remarkable domestic resources we
possessed in military engineering, manufacturing, design, invention and high-tech.
But the new-order challenge represented by Iran was not just theoretical or
academic. Though we had a policy of not commenting on on our own nuclear
status, it was widely assumed in the Arab world and internationally that Israel had,
at the very least, the capacity to manufacture nuclear weapons. But whatever
nuclear capability we might possess was for deterrence. Even when threatened
with conventional defeat, however briefly, in the Yom Kippur War of 1973, it is

to hand it over to them but they were sufficed at a quick glance. There
was no meet and greet, they went straight to the point. One agent picked
up a briefcase off the porch floor and opened it up taking out a stapled
stack of paper. Then that same agent asked me if I had ever known an
affiliate by the name of Mr. Jeffrey Epstein. All of the sudden my
stomach tangled in a familiar knot that I hadn’t felt in many years from a
past life that I was trying to forget about. I nodded in affirmation of their
question and said “It was a long time ago and he’s no longer an affiliate
of mine, but yes, I did know him once.” It was shameful enough to think
about let alone talk about with them for the first time since I had started
my entire life over. His next response left me nothing short of speechless.
The United States Attorney’s Office for the district of Florida was giving
me a notification of being an identified victim. Jeffrey was finally caught
for his atrocious acts of perversion on girls who.were barely old enough
to even comprehend “the birds and the bees” so to speak.

On June 30 2008, Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty for procurement of
minors to engage in and solicitation of prostitution. More than a dozen
girls had been named as victims of Jeffrey’s federal offense’s and without
ever stepping a day in court he was granted a plea bargain consenting to
charges that named him a registered pedophile for only two of the minor
girls. Getting away with even serving only twelve of the sentenced
eighteen months behind bars be that in the evening alone and in the
morning he was released during the day. Restricted to the confinement of
his lavish mansion in Palm Beach only to be with his original sex slaves
from over ten years ago, Nadia Marcinkova and Sarah Kellen, and
knowing Jeffrey all too well, they wouldn’t be the only ones there while
he was pulling his laughing stint of retribution. Even at nighttime the girls
were still allowed to visit him, accounting to nearly seventy times while
serving his time in incarceration.

No justice had been served for any of us victims. Denied the very
constitutional rights allegedly there to protect and serve us. We weren’t
allowed to have a voice in front of a jury and judge or even informed for
that matter. Instead we were handed this notification of being a victim but
told we were all too late to do anything about. To make matters worse
part of that plea bargain was that we had the option to sue him with the
lawyers he provided for us, and conveniently enough I found out later
they were also his lawyer’s old friends from the college days.

I felt my knees go weak and the anxiety churning in my stomach was
now making me feel sick. Taking the bundle of paperwork from the agent
who was now handing it to over me, I had to excuse myself before my
legs actually buckled. Closing the door behind me I couldn’t even find
the words to tell my husband what was going on. I rushed to the back of

the house and went out to the back yard where I wanted a minute to
compose myself and process the information I had just been told. Robbie
followed behind me but the stillness in my eyes convinced him to give
me that moment to compile my emotions.

A few moments later and I was ready to talk. Collapsing into his arms
with such anguish, he just held me until my sobs subsided and I was able
to tell him what actually happened. Starting with an apology, I began to
tell him how I was so sorry but my troubled past has come back to plague
our simply sweet lives and was just about to turn it all upside down. He
was so understanding from the beginning of all this, telling me that he
will always be behind every choice that I make in mending the sorrows of
my tormenting past and there he has been through all of the thick and
thins.

Deciding to call the lawyers on the victim suit provided for me was a
big decision but one I had to do to seek the unanswered questions from
my battered heart. The two women at the firm that I spoke to treated me
so wonderfully, like long term friends they counseled me not only in the
terms of a lawsuit towards Jeffrey but also in the matters of being
emotionally and sexually abused. I chose to proceed with the lawsuit at
least to make a statement to a man that tried to make a degrading
statement about me so long ago. Now it was my turn, I had the choice to
turn the tables on him hoping he would feel embarrassed and in the
spotlight for everyone’s entertainment where he had kept me for so many
years.

Winning my lawsuit against him was not enough to heal old wounds, I
never got the chance to stand up in front of a jury and tell them how
much pain I had endured and still endure throughout the many nightmares
I face when darkness hits and the silence of the sleeping household fills
my head with pictures of reliving my past with him or the others he sent
me too. Or did I even get to hear him confess his guilt and suffer the way
I did locked in confinement for many years? No, instead | got to see a
picture of Jeffrey with his arms around a very youthful looking teenager,
if even that, parading the streets of New York, the very way he had with
me and so many other girls long before.

As if it were a public display intended for not only his many victims to
see but also a spectacle for the public justice system, it was bold show of
insolence laughing in our faces while we all sat by not being able to do
anything to help these young girls from the streets still suffering his
perverted afflictions. Not much longer there was another story on Jeffrey
I saw in the papers of him and Prince Andrew having a stroll together in
Central Park. It instantly sparked my concerns for other girls in the very
same position I was in so long ago and he was obviously up to the same
old tricks, I had to do something now. Not being able to sit by any longer

103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *882

[*883] This is a stark contrast with European justice systems, but U.S. jurisdictions are not alone in shielding prosecution
decisions from judicial oversight. Aside from England and Wales, courts in other common law jurisdictions - notably Canada

and Australia - take roughly the same approach and defer to prosecutorial charging discretion. !76

5. Summary of Declination Oversight

Both private prosecution and review procedures provide a kind of redundancy that checks prosecutorial declination decisions,
and both can do so im service of public interests as well as victims’ private interests. Both options have some capacity to
challenge prosecutorial judgments affected by political or personal biases, institutional allegiances (especially between police
and local politicians), or other illicit sources of favor or disfavor. As one commentator put it in the English context, private
prosecution authority recognizes that victims possess some capacity to be independent assessors of the evidence as well as the
public interest. !*? Review procedures enable judges and supervisory [*884] officials to do much the same thing, without the
cost barriers for victims posed by private prosecutions. (Although it may well be that poorer victims are less likely even to
petition for review, especially if they lack legal counsel to press their review requests.)

Why, then, have U.S. jurisdictions so uniformly rejected both options? As noted, both racial politics and the power of common
law tradition are probable contributing reasons. '3° Another is the singular choice of most state justice systems to make
prosecutors locally elected officials, which does much to prevent kinds of over-and underenforcement disfavored by local
majorities. That, in turn, likely reduces pressure for reforms that would improve other safeguards against decisions not to
prosecute - especially decisions that cut against popular local preferences, which in many communities include rigorous

2016) (authorizing victims dissatisfied with public prosecutor to petition the court and granting courts the power to allow victim's attorney to
take over as private prosecutor).

87 See 12 RL Gen. Laws$§12-4-1, 12-4-2, 12-4-6, 12-12-1.3 (2017); Cronan ex rel. State v. Cronan, 774 A.2d 866, 871 (RI. 2001)
(approving private misdemeanor prosecution for assault under state statutes).

88 See State v. Martineau, 808 A.2d 51, 54 (N.H. 2002); see also State by Tucker v. Gratta, 133 A.2d 482, 482 (N.H. 1957) (holding that state
prosecutors retain power to dismiss private criminal complaints).

89 See, e.g., N.C. Gen. Stat.§$15A-303, 304 (2016); Moose, 313 S.E.2d at 512-13 (requiring that the public prosecutor remain in continuous
control of the case). Scattered marginal remnants of private enforcement may remain elsewhere, such as an Oklahoma statute providing that

prosecutions for adultery (a felony) may be commenced and carried on against either of the parties to the crime only by his or her own
husband or wife. Okla. Stat. tit. 2] § 871 (2017) (Prosecution for adultery can be commenced and carried on against either of the parties to
the crime only by his or her own husband or wife as the case may be, or by the husband or wife of the other party to the crime.).

°° The Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure, 1981, Cmnd. 8092, P 7.47 (UK); see also Gouriet v. Union of Post Office Workers [1978]
AC (HL) 435 at 477 (Eng. and Wales) (private prosecutions are a valuable constitutional safeguard against inertia or partiality on the part of
the authority); cf. Manikis, supra note 66, at 67, 71 (describing review as a means to correct prosecution errors).

independent review of the complaint checks and balances the district attorney's decision and further hedges against possibility of error.).

9% United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 461-64 (1996).

3 Arguments for strengthening the doctrine to make claims easier to pursue are common. See, e.g., Richard H. McAdams, Race and
Selective Prosecution: Discovering the Pitfalls of Armstrong, 73 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 605, 606 (1998) (discussing use of the equal protection
doctrine but challenging current precedent).

°4 Grand juries remain a fixture in the federal system and in roughly half the states. See Sara Sun Beale et al., Grand Jury Law and Practice §
1:5 (2d ed. 2017) (describing grand jury status and rules in states and noting states that have partially or wholly abolished grand juries);
Andrew D. Leipold, Why Grand Juries Do Not (and Cannot) Protect the Accused, 80 Cornell L. Rev. 260, 274-75 (1995) (noting difficulty of
getting data on grand jury screening and offering reasons why grand juries rarely reject requests for indictments). To extend the comparison,
public officials (judges) have a long track record of doing the same task that trial and grand juries do. That available substitute did not lead to
calls for juries’ abolition. Yet the availability of public prosecutors as replacements led to the U.S. jurisdictions to abolish private prosecutors.

I. Introduction

Federal courts should treat crime victims fairly in the criminal process. In a nod to that goal, the Advisory Committee on the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (Advisory Committee) has circulated for public comment proposed amendments to the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (the Rules) regarding crime victims’ rights. These amendments attempt to implement the
recently-enacted Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA), | which guarantees crime victims a series of rights, including the right to
be treated fairly. Unfortunately, the proposed amendments are mere tentative, half measures that do not begin to fully protect
crime victims.

This Article contends that the Advisory Committee should broaden its vision of the proper role for crime victims and
recommend far more expansive victim protections. In the CVRA, Congress articulated specific rights for crime victims, such as
the right to be notified of court hearings, to attend those hearings, and to speak at appropriate points in the process. * But along
with these specific rights came the sweeping requirement that crime victims be treated with fairness and with respect for the
victim's dignity and privacy. * This congressional command must not be ignored. In addition, entirely apart from any
congressional dictate, crime victims deserve fair treatment in the federal system. Acting for the federal judiciary, the Advisory
Committee should make certain that the Rules fully reflect victims’ interests rather than allow the initiative for protecting
victims to pass to other branches of government.

This Article proceeds in five parts. Following this Introduction, Part II reviews events leading to the recently circulated
amendments. The amendments were prompted by the CVRA - an act passed by Congress in 2004 to protect victims' rights
through the federal criminal process. To comply with the CVRA, the federal criminal rules had to be amended in many places,

' Pub. L. No. 108-405, § 102(a), 178 Stat. 2260, 2261-62 (codified as amended at /8 U.S.C. § 3771 (Supp. 2006)).

2 18 U.S.C. § 3771 (a)(2)-(4).
3 Id. § 3771 (a)(8).

in the tradition of Tom Lehrer, has a spoken piece of patter which goes: “I
just got back from the conspiracy convention. Have you been? It’ s fun.
Seven hundred conspiracy theorists all in one hotel, with the little name
tags, ‘Hello, my name is—none of your fucking business!’ Great
seminars— ‘Triangulation and You, ‘Paranoia for Profit,’ ‘Victoria’ s
Real Secret Was J. Edgar Hoover.’ In the lobby, | saw five people get off
the elevator—what, you think that’ s a coincidence? There was
entertainment, of course—a group of horny anti-government folk singers
called the Randy Weavers.”

Zimmerman was surprised to learn that there would actually be an
event such as the one that he thought he was making up. Although the
real conspiracy convention didn’ t have the seven hundred attendees he
had imagined, there were over 500, including 40% from out of state and
10% from other countries, including Canada, England, Australia, Denmark,
Austria and Ireland. Also taking place at the Santa Clara Convention Center
that same weekend as Conspiracy Con was the Charismatic Catholic

Convention. Dueling religions, together again.

sustainable profitability. These investments will be into private or small capitalization
public companies in situations where the Fund Managers believe that the key risk
inflection and the period of greatest value creation will be around regulatory approval
and demonstration of commercial attractiveness of the product. These investments will
focus on products where the level of clinical and regulatory risk is relatively low, and
where commercial penetration can be driven by smaller, highly targeted sales and
marketing activities. Biopharmaceutical companies at this stage have historically been
attractive acquisition targets, and have consistently demonstrated that they can access
public markets through IPOs in a broad range of market conditions. Examples of this
type of later stage investment in the New Leaf portfolio include Acadia Pharmaceuticals
(NLV-IIL NASDAQ: ACAD, exited at 2.5x), Phase III, focused on psychosis associated
with neurodegenerative diseases, Durata Therapeutics (NLV-II, private initially, now
public on NASDAQ: DRTX), Phase III, focused on a late stage antibiotic development
program spun out of Pfizer, and InterCept Pharmaceuticals (NLV-II, NASDAQ: ICPT,
exited at 3.2x), Phase III, focused on an orphan indication in liver disease.

e Investments in public companies at any stage, whose primary assets are product
programs or product platforms. Most of these investments will be focused on small
capitalization companies at the clinical or early commercialization stage. New Leaf’s
focus on investment opportunities in small capitalization public biotech companies
leverage the broad investment capabilities within the firm and benefit from the focused
efforts of a small team of investment professionals dedicated exclusively to public
market activities. As a result of this integrated approach, investments in public
companies often target companies the Fund Managers have tracked over a number of
years, some from the time when they were private companies. The dedicated public
market team proactively tracks and screens the aggregate universe of biotech
companies, with the goal of identifying compelling risk/reward investment
opportunities. The primary focus of the screening efforts is to identify high-quality
companies with attractive valuations that require financing to fund the company
through key development milestones. The Fund will generally look to source or
augment transformative, structured transactions in public companies, where a New Leaf
partner will have the opportunity to join the board of directors. An example of an
investment that resulted from New Leaf’s focus on public market opportunities includes
MEI Pharma (NLV-II, NASDAQ: MEIP), an investment the Fund Managers made to
recapitalize the company after it had acquired a lead asset, Pracinostat, and needed
capital to advance the program through clinical development. Pracinostat was an asset
that was well known to New Leaf, as members of the team had followed it closely for
several years while it was owned by a private company (S*Bio), and had made attempts
to acquire and spin out the asset in the past. In addition to sourcing opportunities, the
public market team assists the broader biopharmaceutical investment efforts by
managing the sale and exit of New Leaf’s larger positions in public securities, and by
providing real-time insight into evolving market sentiment to the biotechnology and
broader healthcare technology sectors that helps guide decisions around new
investments and exit decisions.

For a complete list of investments made by the Fund Managers in healthcare technology
companies see Appendices 1 and 4.

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029921.txt,"About Diana DeGette

Chief Deputy Whip Diana DeGette is a 8th term member of Congress, representing
Colorado’s 1st Congressional district. In her eight terms serving the Denver metro region,
Diana has established herself as a leader for progressive change on health care,
reproductive rights, food safety, consumer protection and the environment.

DeGette is the most senior legislator in Colorado’s House delegation, and in the 111th
Congress she held a large amount of power as the House Democratic chief deputy whip and
the vice chair of the influential House Energy and Commerce Committee.

With the Republicans taking control of the House in 2010, DeGette lost her vice chair
position, but she is still a chief deputy whip and the ranking member of the Energy and
Commerce Committee’s subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.

In January, 2011, Rep. DeGette was elected the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on
Oversight and Investigations.

DeGette is best known for championing increased federal funding for stem-cell research. In
2006, the congresswoman pushed President George W. Bush to issue the very first veto of
his presidency when she teamed up with then-Rep. Mike Castle (R-Del.) to pass the Stem
Cell Research Enhancement Act through a GOP-controlled Congress.

In summer 2008, DeGette published Sex, Science, and Stem Cells: Inside the Right Assault
on Reason, a book that condemns the politicization of science and argues that legislation

on issues like abortion, birth control and funding for education programs should be based
on science rather than religion. Too many of our elected officials are simply incapable of

thinking rationally about sex, she writes.

Diana is married to attorney Lino Lipinsky. They have two daughters and a dog.

'Females for JE': Disturbing log of telephone calls from schoolchildren found in sex den of Duke's billionaire friend 
By Stephen Wright < <http://wwvv.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=y &authornamef=Stephen+Wright>

Details of the disturbing lifestyle led by Jeffrey Epstein emerged last night after the Daily Mail uncovered logs of telephone 
messages left at his Florida child sex den. 
Schoolchildren were among hundreds of callers who apparently rang to arrange massages for the 58-year-old billionaire friend of 
Prince Andrew, who was later convicted of child sex offences. 
Ghislaine Maxwell, 49-year-old daughter of the disgraced media mogul Robert Maxwell, is named in several messages. 
Disturbing: Messages were found in Florida home of Jeffrey Epstein, left. The billionaire, 58, is a friend of Prince Andrew, right 
In one left for her or 'Sarah', a caller says she 'doesn't know at what time she must come this night for the massage'. 
Other messages for Epstein, the sources of which are not clear, contain such phrases as: 'She has females for Mr JE' and 'I have a 
female for him'. 
Another with sickening overtones comes from someone called Jeanluc for Epstein: 'He just did a good one — 18 years. (She spoke 
to me and said, I love Jeffrey)'. 
The long list of women is punctuated by regular references to Epstein's celebrity friends including the business magnate Donald 
Trump, film producer Harvey Weinstein and magician David Copperfield, referred to as 'Magic David'. 
The sheer volume of phone traffic shows the frequency of Epstein's massages, many of which were 'erotic' and allegedly 
involved the abused girls. 
The evidence is from documents confiscated by police during a criminal investigation into Epstein and seen yesterday by the 
Mail.

<image.png> 
Logs: Two of the answer phone messages. Miss Maxwell is asked, right, when a girl should give a massage 
One message left for Epstein reads: 'She is wondering if 2.30 ok cuz she needs to stay in school.' 
It was left in February 2005 — the same year that the mother of a 14-year-old girl alerted police to Epstein's abuse. 
Another note shows that 'Colleen' phoned to tell Epstein: 'Going into class — will be out in 45 min.' 
Last night the Daily Mail tried to contact the people whose names and telephone numbers are included in the logs. 
One girl named Jenny, who had left her number, hung up immediately when asked about Epstein. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030231 
A man listed only as Darren said: 'I have no comment to make on that.' 
Today, Prince Andrew was embroiled in further controversy as it was revealed Kazakhstan had asked for his help in recruiting 
investors to the country. 
The plea came after the former Soviet Republic's President's son-in-law had bought the Prince's former marital home for 
£3million above the asking price. 
Timur Kulibayev paid £15million for Sunninghill Park but it has remained empty and has been allowed to fall into disrepair. 
Last year the Prince told Hello! magazine: 'It was like any property deal between friends.' 
Yesterday he attempted to perform business as usual as he visited an East London school and met rail bosses in Canary Wharf. 
He steadfastly ignored questions from journalists asking whether he was an 'embarrassment to his country' and would resign 
from his trade ambassador role as he arrived for a briefing from business executives at the headquarters of the £15billion train project 
Crossrail. 
Prince Andrew managed to sell Sunninghill Park for £3million more than the asking price

Brigade” — struck wherever they could inflict the most terror, and death: at bus
stations, on buses, in shopping centers, restaurants and cafés. Over a 12-month
period, beginning with a bombing of Tel Aviv’s main bus station at the beginning
of January 2003, they murdered 145 men, women and children. It would not be
until two years’ later, with the West Bank fence in place and a range of other
security measures, that the attacks, and the deaths, were finally brought down
dramatically.

The Labor Party had finally left Arik Sharon’s coalition in late 2002. But in
Israel’s 2003 election — reverting to the old rules again, with a single vote for party
and Prime Minister — Arik and the Likud won resoundingly. They doubled their
Knesset seats, to 38. Labor, now with only 19 seats, against turned to Shimon
Peres, as interim party leader.

I didn’t miss the political limelight. But by mid-2004, with the first sign of a
major change in policy toward the Palestinians, I felt I had a contribution to make.
What first prompted me to dip my toes back into politics were the ever more
obvious signs throughout 2004 that Arik’s coalition, and his hold on the Likud,
were unraveling. Part of his problem was a steady drumbeat of corruption
allegations around what had become a kind of family political operation: Arik and
his two sons, Omri and Gilad. But Arik also seemed to be undergoing a welcome
political conversion, to the need for the more profound political “disengagement”
with the Palestinians which I’d long been advocating. He had endorsed the Bush
Administration’s “road map” for resuming the peace process. Yet with Yasir
Arafat ageing, ailing and even less inclined to consider the difficult decisions he
had shirked at Camp David, Arik went one, dramatic step further. He raised the
idea of unilaterally withdrawing Israeli forces and settlements from Gaza —
ensuring a showdown with the rank and file of the Likud, and other parties on the
right. His main Likud rival, very much back in front-line Israeli politics, was his
Finance Minister: Bibi Netanyahu. Though Bibi remained on board until the last
moment, he dramatically resigned for the cabinet in August 2005, a week before
the Gaza withdrawal, declaring: “I am not prepared to be a partner to a move
which ignores reality, and proceeds blindly toward turning the Gaza Strip into a
base for Islamic terrorism which will threaten the state.”

To this day, Bibi, along with many Israelis across the political spectrum, draws
a direct line between our pullout from Gaza, Hamas’s takeover and its violent
purging of Fatah’s old guard there, and the periodic wars we’ve had to fight since

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019252.txt,"BREAKING DOWN DEMOCRACY: Goals, Strategies, and Methods of Modern Authoritarians

alternative perspectives are permitted on a carefully
rationed basis. But dissenting opinions are invari-

ably subjected to relentless attack and ridicule, and
the dissidents themselves face a form of character
assassination in which their views are twisted to make
them appear foolish, extreme, unpatriotic, or immoral.

Christopher Walker, a vice president at the National
Endowment for Democracy who has written exten-
sively on modern authoritarianism, believes that con-
trol of information is the most important achievement
of today’s generation of autocrats:

| think modern authoritarians have been
adept at adjusting to the new environment.
They recognize that trying to control the
wealth of information out there is impossi-
ble, and therefore they don't try. There are

a number of countries which have found
effective ways to incorporate entertainment
and culture into their media offerings while
keeping domination over the political sphere.
They have thus defied the assumptions we
held 20 years ago when the internet was
emerging. The conventional wisdom then
was that the internet guaranteed media
diversity, and there is no way regimes could
keep the genie in the bottle. In fact, in many
countries authoritarians have kept the genie
in the bottle through managing the political
narrative and denying people access to key
information.’*

Walker's comments certainly apply to conditions in Rus-
sia. During the communist period, Soviet propaganda
was meant to justify both state socialism and Russia's
isolation from the global economic system and Western
culture. In Russia, China, and elsewhere, it is now pos-
sible for citizens to enjoy the latest international music,
fashion, and entertainment while hating the liberal
values that are systematically disparaged in the media.

What is tragic about all this is that Russians already
came through a decades-long period of propaganda
in which reality was twisted and lies circulated as a
conscious matter of national policy. Orwell and other
foes of totalitarian rule sought to describe the danger
that propaganda and censorship posed to knowl-
edge, reality, and independent thought. But instead of
things getting better after the demise of totalitarian-
ism, a newer and in some ways more insidious form of
information control has emerged, one which does not
so much try to persuade people that the government

line is the only correct line, but that facts do not exist
as such and nothing can be believed.

China: 21st-century censorship

The Chinese model of information control differs in
crucial ways from the propaganda methods favored by
Russia. Especially in its policies towards the internet,
China focuses its energies on preventing access to in-
formation or news on a wide and perpetually evolving
range of subjects that the ruling Chinese Communist
Party (CCP) regards as sensitive.

Under Xi Jinping, who took power in late 2012, the
government has been much more open in arguing for
the right of the political leadership to censor internet
content. He has, in fact, launched a campaign de-
signed to radically redraw the global rules on internet
freedom so as to enshrine the concept of “internet
sovereignty,” according to which individual countries
would “independently choose their own path of cyber
development” and “model of cyber regulation.

In late 2015, Xi also made the baffling statement,
“Freedom is what order is meant for, and order is

the guarantee of freedom.!* Over the next several
months, regulators moved to enforce the president's
vision for tighter CCP control over all news media and
imposed rules that further restricted the production
of independent news content by online outlets.!”

Perhaps most important have been the threats to the
livelihood and personal liberty of bloggers and online
commentators. In recent years, the state has pursued
a campaign of arrest, prosecution, and public humil-
iation directed against well-known microbloggers
and other media personalities, including a series of
televised “confessions.” The machinery of repression
was directed against those who had used their plat-
forms to criticize the leadership or its policies, and to
a disturbing extent, the effort has been successful in
silencing such criticism.

Among other recent developments in the CCP’s cen-
sorship drive:

¢ The authorities have punished journalists
for publishing news about the economy that
highlighted negative trends, and issued media
directives aimed at shaping coverage of econo-
my-related topics. The economy was the second
most censored topic in China in 2015, a year
that featured a dramatic stock-market crash and
slowing economic growth.!®

people are living and envy sets in (especially with raising inequality that is perfectly normal when financial 
returns of rich people are exponential and work returns are linear) 
3-They want change and risk electing completely wrong people (Italy 5stelle, France LePen might be next, 
Hungary, Greece already lost, Brexit and anti-trade another example)

presidential elections. Then if she does bad in 4 years she is out, but she could make the public understand 
that senate is key to show what a president can do. 
But again, I know 0.001% of what you or them understands about politics, I am however worried that europe

Bannon the European: He's opening the populist fort in Brussels 
The former Trump strategist arrives in Europe with The Movement. Objective: an alliance between 
right-wing leaders, from Salvini to Orban in view of the 2019 elections 
NEW YORK. The invasion of Europe has begun. Steve Bannon, 65, the American far-right guru who 
was Donald Trump's right-hand man in the White House — but let go last summer following the 
racist violence in Charlottesville — is preparing to march on Brussels. Launching, he told the Daily 
Beast himself, a new non-profit foundation called The Movement, (II Movimento), right in the heart 
of Europe and its institutions. Through which he hopes to coordinate the populist right in view of the 
European elections which will be held in spring 2019. 
Objective: to compete with George Soros, the American billionaire of Hungarian origin, benefactor of 
the Democratic party, who since 1984 with his Open Society has spent at least $32 billion in support 
of NGOs dealing with human rights. And for this he became the bogeyman of the populist right, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 019334 
accused of plots of all kinds: including that of wanting to replace Italians with immigrants in order to 
have labour at low cost. A mantra repeated in the past on Twitter also by the current Minister of the 
Interior Matteo Salvini. 
The ambition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site Breitbart — which in 
the European campaign preceded him since the platform had already opened bureaux in London and 
Rome — is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great populist international of which he 
has long since been dreaming. 
The Movement, in fact, intends to function as an extreme right-wing think tank: a source of strategic 
advice to channel the not-so-politically structured discontent of the most extreme European 
movements. Analysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and channeling 
funding. 
The aim is to create a populist alliance, a sort of super group that if victorious can conquer up to a 
third of the European Parliament in the elections next May. 
Indeed — putting the common policy of the Old Continent in the hands of Bannon and his own. The 
American strategist is very attached to the Freedom Caucus — the extreme right of the US Congress 
— and in 2014 he was at the top of the Cambridge Analytica company, which in 2016 used data 
stolen from Facebook to try to influence the presidential election from which Donald Trump emerged 
victor. It is not a mystery that for a long time he courts nationalists of the right from East to West. 
And he has already met, among others, the Hungarian Orban, the French Marine Le Pen and the 
former leader of the British separatists Nigel Farage. The latter reappeared, coincidentally, on Friday 
in Pennsylvania, USA, to a fundraiser in favor of the Republican congressman Lou Barletta. Without 
forgetting the Italians of Lega and 5 stars. Of them, he said: If it works in Italy, we can import the 
model anywhere. 
The Movement, which for now will count on a staff of 10 people, will be fully operational in 2019. In 
short, after the American midterm elections, where Bannon is fighting to influence the primaries 
supporting candidates potentially able to undermine the prospects of Republican establishment. But in 
the future the former spin doctor says he wants to spend more and more time in Europe. Also because 
the relationships with Trump have worsened after the revelations he made to Michael Wolff and 
published in the scandal book Fire and Fury. Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Paradise, 
Bannon says now paraphrasing the Satan of one of his favorite books, John Milton's Lost Paradise. 
Hell in this case would be the dear old Europe and its democratic values. The army of darkness is 
already among us.

out his friend’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

He watched with amusement Trump’s eccentric presidential campaign and brokered the
deal to have Paul Manafort replace Corey Lewandowski after Lewandowski fell out of
favor with Kushner. Then, as confounded as everyone else by the campaign’s continuing
successes, Barrack introduced the future president in warm and personal terms at the
Republican National Convention in July (at odds with its otherwise dark and belligerent
tone).

It was Trump’s perfect fantasy that his friend Tom—an organizational whiz fully aware
of his friend’s lack of interest in day-to-day management—would sign on to run the White
House. This was Trump’s instant and convenient solution to the unforeseen circumstance
of suddenly being president: to do it with his business mentor, confidant, investor, and
friend, someone whom acquaintances of the two men describe as “being one of the best
Donald handlers.” In the Trump circle this was called the “two amigos” plan. (Epstein,
who remained close to Barrack, had been whitewashed out of the Trump biography.)

Barrack, among the few people whose abilities Trump, a reflexive naysayer, didn’t
question, could, in Trump’s hopeful view, really get things running smoothly and let
Trump be Trump. It was, on Trump’s part, an uncharacteristic piece of self-awareness:
Donald Trump might not know what he didn’t know, but he knew Tom Barrack knew. He
would run the business and Trump would sell the product—making American great again.
#MAGA.

For Barrack, as for everybody around Trump, the election result was a kind of beyond-
belief lottery-winning circumstance—your implausible friend becoming president. But
Barrack, even after countless pleading and cajoling phone calls from Trump, finally had to
disappoint his friend, telling him “I’m just too rich.” He would never be able to untangle
his holdings and interests—including big investments in the Middle East—in a way that
would satisfy ethics watchdogs. Trump was unconcerned or in denial about his own
business conflicts, but Barrack saw nothing but hassle and cost for himself. Also, Barrack,
on his fourth marriage, had no appetite for having his colorful personal life—often, over
the years, conducted with Trump—become a public focus.

OOK Ok

Trump’s fallback was his son-in-law. On the campaign, after months of turmoil and
outlandishness (if not to Trump, to most others, including his family), Kushner had
stepped in and become his effective body man, hovering nearby, speaking only when
spoken to, but then always offering a calming and flattering view. Corey Lewandowski
called Jared the butler. Trump had come to believe that his son-in-law, in part because he
seemed to understand how to stay out of his way, was uniquely sagacious.

In defiance of law and tone, and everybody’s disbelieving looks, the president seemed

David Malament and Mark Hogarth of the University of California,
Irvine have proposed a form of space-time called the Kerr Metric. This
allows a machine to break the Turing limit, but has the drawback that as
it does so it falls through the event horizon and is sucked into the black
hole. We might discover new information but are now trapped inside the
event horizon unable to communicate it — a form of cosmic censorship.

Candidates for a hyper-computer that could fit inside a human
brain include mathematical curiosities which stretch the concept
of infinity. The easiest to understand is the Zeno machine. In a Zeno
machine a computer runs each successive step of a calculation in half the
time of the previous step. The computer can pack an infinite quantity of
computation into each finite time interval and can therefore outperform
a Turing machine. This theory fails at a practical level because we simply
cant build such a machine.

There are numerous weird suggestions for mathematical super-
Turing machines, and many are described on the Internet. They all fit
broadly within the two models above: modifications to space-time or
peculiar mathematical paradoxes. The inspiration for the true solution
to super-Turing thought may lay in there somewhere, but there are some
more plausible proposals to look at next.

Plausible Ideas

I have characterized the next set of ideas as plausible, but they may still
be highly controversial. My only criteria for plausibility are that the
mechanism must outperform a machine limited to counting numbers,
and it might fit inside our skulls. No black holes allowed.

One interesting proposal for a super-Turing machine that could
fit inside our skulls is the Adaptive Recurrent Neural Network, ‘ARNN’
proposed by Hava Siegelmann of the University of Massachusetts,
Amherst. An ARNN is a neural network with real number weights. As
you recall, real numbers are equivalent to the continuum infinity, a larger
infinity than that of counting numbers.

This is the infinity that defeats a Turing machine, and Siegelmann
harnesses it as the basis of her computing machine. She argues that,
although the machine cannot be programmed as it is impossible to write
real numbers down, once it is running, the weights diverge and real
numbers will be used within the network. These real numbers allow the
machine to compute using numbers that are not, themselves, computable

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016919.txt,"something much more significant than speculating at the time: He was laying the
foundations for the digital revolution. As a graduate student at MIT, he worked for
Vannevar Bush on the Differential Analyzer. This was one of the last great analog
computers, a room full of gears and shafts. Shannon’s frustration with the difficulty of
solving problems this way led him in 1937 to write what might be the best master’s thesis
ever. In it, he showed how electrical circuits could be designed to evaluate arbitrary
logical expressions, introducing the basis for universal digital logic.

After MIT, Shannon studied communications at Bell Labs. Analog telephone
calls degraded with distance; the farther they traveled, the worse they sounded. Rather
than continue to improve them incrementally, Shannon showed in 1948 that by
communicating with symbols rather than continuous quantities, the behavior is very
different. Converting speech waveforms to the binary values of 1 and 0 is an example,
but many other sets of symbols can be (and are) used in digital communications. What
matters is not the particular symbols but rather the ability to detect and correct errors.
Shannon found that if the noise is above a threshold (which depends on the system
design), then there are certain to be errors. But if the noise is below a threshold, then a
linear increase in the physical resources representing the symbol results in an exponential
decrease in the likelihood of making an error in correctly receiving the symbol. This
relationship was the first of what we’d now call a threshold theorem.

Such scaling falls off so quickly that the probability of an error can be so small as
to effectively never happen. Each symbol sent multiplies rather than adds to the
certainty, so that the probability of a mistake can go from 0.1 to 0.01 to 0.001, and so
forth. This exponential decrease in communication errors made possible an exponential
increase in the capacity of communication networks. And that eventually solved the
problem of where the knowledge in an AI system came from.

For many years, the fastest way to speed up a computation was to do nothing—
just wait for computers to get faster. In the same way, there were years of AI projects
that aimed to accumulate everyday knowledge by laboriously entering pieces of
information. That didn’t scale; it could progress only as fast as the number of people
doing the entering. But when phone calls, newspaper stories, and mail messages all
moved onto the Internet, everyone doing any of those things became a data generator.
The result was an exponential rather than a linear rate of knowledge accumulation.

John von Neumann also has a cameo in Zhe Human Use of Human Beings, for
game theory. What Wiener missed here was von Neumann’s seminal role in digitizing
computation. Whereas analog communication degraded with distance, analog computing
(like the Differential Analyzer) degraded with time, accumulating errors as it progressed.
Von Neumann presented in 1952 a result corresponding to Shannon’s for computation
(they had met at the Institute for Advanced Study, in Princeton), showing that it was
possible to compute reliably with an unreliable computing device by using symbols rather
than continuous quantities. This was, again, a scaling argument, with a linear increase in
the physical resources representing the symbol resulting in an exponential reduction in
the error rate as long as the noise was below a threshold. That’s what makes it possible
to have a billion transistors in a computer chip, with the last one as useful as the first one.
This relationship led to an exponential increase in computing performance, which solved
a second problem in AI: how to process exponentially increasing amounts of data.

The third problem that scaling solved for AI was coming up with the rules for

There is insufficient evidence that Mr. Epstein targeted minors, as required. The
evidentiary pattern does not even establish willful blindness since Mr. Epstein took steps to
ensure his visitors were over 18—and certainly took none to avoid knowing. But, even if the
government contends that it possesses evidence that could demonstrate that Mr. Epstein knew or
should have known or suspected that a small number of the masseuses were underage, that would
still not make this an appropriate case for federal, rather than state prosecution. The federal
statutes were not intended to supersede state prosecutions involving isolated instances of
underage sex. Instead, the federal statutes were intended for large-scale rings or for an
individual who was engaged, while using interstate facilities such as the Internet, with the willful
targeting of minors.

The government’s evidence, even when stretched to the limit, will not show a pattern of
targeting underage persons for illegal sexual activity. A federal prosecution should not become a
contest between the prosecution and defense over whether the defendant knew, suspected or
should have known whether a particular person was or was not over age. The history of cases
brought under this statute make crystal clear that knowledge of the defendant regarding the age
of the women is required—either by admission or by incontrovertible transcripts of
conversations (i.e. stings operations which require repeated acknowledgment of the defendant’s
awareness of the victims’ age). Even states with absolute liability about mistake regarding age
rarely prosecute cases where definitive proof is lacking (Palm Beach County rarely does and
when it does, it imposes house arrest sentences). This is a matter for the exercise of state
prosecutorial discretion and not federal mandatory minimum statutes that were not intended to
cover such conduct.

A third essential element of § 2422(b) is the requirement that the government prove that
the defendant actually believed that the person being persuaded (coerced, etc.) was a minor at the
time of the communication. See e.g., Offense Instruction 80, Eleventh Circuit Pattern Jury
Instructions-Criminal (2003) (“The defendant can be found guilty of that offense only if...the
defendant believed that such individual was less than (18) years of age...”); United States v.
Murrell, 368 F.3d 1283, 1286 (11™ Cir. 2004) (§ 2422(b) requires that the defendant knowingly
target a minor). Importantly, then, all the elements must be proven with respect to a specific
person. However, we are told that the majority of proof is no more than toll records, not
recorded conversations or Internet chat transcripts, but toll records and perhaps a memory of.
what was said years ago on a particular call for a particular request from a particular person
acting at Mr. Epstein’s direction.

Two final points bear special emphasis here. The statute, which according to Santos and
Cuellar must be narrowly construed, also requires that the inducement be to engage in
prostitution or sexual activity “for which [the defendant] can be charged.” 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b).
However, simple prostitution is not defined (or made punishable) in the U.S. Code, and state law
thus supplies the appropriate reference point. Under Florida law, “prostitution” entails the
“giving or receiving of the body for sexual activity for hire,” Fla. Stat. § 796.07(1)(a), and the
term “sexual activity” is limited to “oral, anal, or vaginal penetration by, or union with, the

affiliates.* These and other organizations maintain close ties to China’s diplomatic
missions in the United States and are often in contact with training or “cultural
exchange” companies that bring delegations of PRC experts and Communist Party

members to US cities and states for so-called study tours.

US and Chinese groups promoting exchanges and investment have often been a
valuable resource for American local leaders—see, for example, the Virginia Museum of
Fine Arts annual China Fest'* or the Chinese investment program in Greenville, South
Carolina'*—but there have been other instances in which American politicians working

with Chinese organizations have been drawn into schemes that cost them their jobs.

Perhaps the most telling case is that of four officials in Ypsilanti, Michigan, who, in
2017, accepted a trip to China that they had been told was paid for by the Wayne State
CSSA. The trip was eventually revealed as a boondoggle funded by a developer, Amy
Xue Foster, who hoped to build a $300 million “Chinatown” in the area.’ The four

officials, including the mayor, were fired.

This is not to suggest that shady Chinese nationals are always plotting to corrupt
otherwise innocent American leaders; US politicians have a long history of willingly
accepting free trips, gifts, and other favors from the PRC or its fronts. As other
sections of this study make clear, however, Beijing-directed activities such as the secret
purchase of American Chinese-language newspapers and radio stations, harassment of
local Chinese American dissidents, and the operation of CCP cells in local American
businesses and universities do require heightened vigilance by US sub-national
authorities, regardless of how much investment, how many tuition-paying students,

or how many tourists China is able to produce.

China Exchanges and Chinese Leverage

The over forty years of engagement with China has created for American cities

and states, as it has for American corporations and universities, deep interests and
traditions with regard to China. However, the local policies that have guided these
relationships are sometimes at odds with Washington’s policies, even our larger
national interest. Although the United States has pulled out of the Paris Agreement, the
seventeen governors who have joined the United States Climate Alliance, for example,
continue to work with Beijing, which many would agree is a very salutary thing. But
sometimes sub-national solidarity with China can become overexuberant, as it did

Libya, a last hurrah for the west

Gideon Rachman

March 28 2011 -- The war in Libya is about a lot more than
Muammer Gaddafi. Its outcome will reverberate around the Middle
East and will affect international politics for decades. A vital
principle is at stake.

The supporters of outside intervention believe that they are battling
not just to stop atrocities in Libya itself, but to lay down a marker for
the future. They want to show that the age when a dictator could
massacre his own citizens is coming to a close. Bernard Henri-Lévy,
a French philosopher who played an improbable role as a link
between the Libyan rebels and President Nicolas Sarkozy, has said:
“What is important in this affair is that the ‘duty to intervene’ has
been recognised.”

Nicholas Kristof, writing in The New York Times, makes a similar
point — “World powers have the right and obligation to intervene
when a dictator devours his people.” This idea was approved by the
UN in 2005 and, according to Mr Kristof, the Libyan intervention is
“putting teeth into that fledgling concept.”

It would be nice to believe that the doctrine of a “responsibility to
protect”, known colloquially as R2P, now has real bite. With rebel
troops advancing swiftly along the Libyan coast, the supporters of the
intervention will be feeling cheerful.

But the reality is that the Libyan war is more likely to mark a last
hurrah for liberal interventionism than a new dawn. For the brutal
truth is that the western powers that are the keenest promoters of the
idea will not have the economic strength or the public backing to
sustain many more overseas interventions. And the rising economic

Federal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations

individual provisions in this section of
the notice received numerous comments
and suggestions for improvement. The
vast majority of the comments about the
specific provisions are from
representatives of employers. Those
comments generally contend that the
provisions are overgeneralizations and
do not articulate the legal standard for
evaluating allegations of unlawful
conduct or indicate factual scenarios in
which certain employer conduct may be
lawful.

After reviewing all of the comments,
the Board has decided to revise one of
the examples of unlawful employer
conduct contained in the NPRM. The
Board concludes that the other
provisions, as proposed, are accurate
and informative and, as with the notice
as a whole, strike an appropriate
balance between being simultaneously
instructive and succinct.

Furthermore, the Board sees no reason
to add or subtract from the employer or
union illegal activity to make the two
sections contain an equal number of
paragraphs. The comment that argues
that no imbalance exists in the statute
is correct, but the majority of violations
under Section 8(b) concern union
conduct vis-a-vis employers, not
conduct that impairs employees’ rights.
The notice of rights is intended to
summarize employer and union
violations against employees;
accordingly, there is no need to alter the
list to include unlawful union activity
against employers.

i. No-Solicitation and No-Distribution
Rules

The Board received a few comments
that were critical of the proposed notice
language stating that an employer
cannot lawfully prohibit employees
from “soliciting for the union during
non-work time or distributing union
literature during non-work time, in non-
work areas.”’ The Service Employees
International Union comments that
“solicitation” has a narrow meaning and
involves asking someone to join the
union by signing an authorization card,
which is subject to the restrictions
suggested in the notice. The comment
submits that the notice should state that
an employer cannot prohibit employees
from “talking” about a union. The
comment suggests that ‘“‘talking” is both
more accurate and is easier for
employees to understand than
“soliciting.”

The remaining comments criticize the
provision for failing to note any
limitations on employees’ rights to
solicit and distribute, such as the
limited rights of off-duty employees,
and limitations in retail and health care

establishments. One comment, in
particular, suggests the notice should
advise healthcare employees that they
do not enjoy a protected right to solicit
in immediate patient care areas or
where their activity might disturb
patients. See Beth Israel Hosp. v. NLRB,
437 U.S. 483 (1978). The comment
proposes to include a qualification that
a hospital or other health care employer
may prohibit all solicitation in
immediate patient care areas or outside
those areas when necessary to avoid
disrupting health care operations or
disturbing patients. Another comment
suggests that the law in this area is so
complex that no meaningful but
succinct provision can be constructed,
and therefore recommends deleting it
entirely.

The Board disagrees with those
comments. The Board appreciates that
under case law, employees’ right to
engage in solicitation and distribution of
literature is qualified in certain settings
and accordingly that employers may, in
some situations, legally prohibit
solicitation or distribution of literature
even during employees’ nonworking
time. Given the variety of circumstances
in which the right to solicit and
distribute may be limited, however, the
Board has determined that limitations
on the size and format of the notice
preclude the inclusion of factual
situations in which an employer may
lawfully limit such activity. As stated
above, employees may contact the NLRB
with specific questions about the
lawfulness of their employers’ rules
governing solicitation and literature
distribution.

Turning to the suggestion that the
notice should be modified to remove the
reference to union solicitation in favor
of a reference only to the right to engage
in union talk, the Board agrees in part.
The Board distinguishes between
soliciting for a union, which generally
means encouraging a co-worker to
participate in supporting a union, and
union talk, which generally refers to
discussions about the advantages and
disadvantages of unionization. Scripps
Memorial Hosp., 347 NLRB 52 (2006).
The right to talk about terms and
conditions of employment, which
would necessarily include union talk, is
encompassed more specifically by the
“discussion’’ provision in the
affirmative rights section of the notice.
That provision indicates that employees
have the right to “‘discuss your terms
and conditions of employment or union
organizing with your co-workers or a
union.” In order to maintain
consistency and clarity throughout the
notice, the Board agrees that some
change is necessary to the solicitation

provision. Accordingly, the final notice
will state that it is illegal for an
employer to ‘‘prohibit you from talking
about or soliciting for a union during
non-work time, such as before or after
work or during break times; or from
distributing union literature during non-
work time, in non-work areas, such as
parking lots or break rooms.”

ii. Questioning Employees About Union
Activity

The Board received one comment
concerning this provision, suggesting
that it was confusing. The Board
believes the existing language is
sufficiently clear.

iii. Taking Adverse Action Against
Employees for Engaging in Union-
Related Activity

The Board did not receive any
specific comments regarding this
provision.

iv. Threats To Close

A few comments from employer
groups criticize the perceived
overgeneralization of this provision.
Those comments note that, as with
unlawful interrogation, a threat to close
is evaluated under a totality of
circumstances, and that an employer is
permitted to state the effects of
unionization on the company so long as
the statement is based on demonstrably
probable consequences of unionization.

The Board agrees that the law in this
general area is complex and that
predictions of plant closure based on
demonstrably probable consequences of
unionization may be lawful. NLRB v.
Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 618
(1969). However, the example in the
proposed notice is not such a
prediction; rather, the notice states that
it is unlawful for an employer to
“threaten to close your workplace if
workers choose a union to represent
them.” Such a statement, which clearly
indicates that the employer will close
the plant in retaliation against the
employees for choosing union
representation, is unlawful. Jd. at 618-
619. Thus, the Board finds it
unnecessary to modify or delete this
provision of the notice.

v. Promising Benefits

The Board received one comment
addressing this provision. The comment
argues that the provision is “troubling”
because it may be interpreted by a
reader to mean “anytime their employer
seeks to make such improvements it
discourages union support because
improved wages and benefits may
reduce employee’s interest in a union.”
The Board does not think such an

Q. And did you have any knowledge of why [Dershowitz] was visiting there?
A. No ma’am.

Q. And do you have any idea whether or not Mr. Dershowitz was also receiving
massages?

A. I don’t know, Ma’am.

Q. As to whether any of those women were ever associated with Mr. Dershowitz would it
be a correct statement that you have absolutely no knowledge?

A. I don’t know, sir.

Q. Okay. Were you in any way attempting in your response to Ms. Ezell to imply that
Mr. Dershowitz had a massage by one of these young ladies?

A. I don’t know, sir.

Q. You have no knowledge?
A. No, sir.

(Rodriguez Depo. Tr. at 279, 280, 385, 386.) To be sure, Rodriguez does testify that Prof.
Dershowtiz was at Epstein’s home when young females were present at the home — an allegation
which Dershowitz strenuously denies. However, Rodriguez did not testify that Prof. Dershowitz
saw, interacted with, or touched any of these females. Instead, when asked what Prof.
Dershowitz did “while those girls were at the house,” Rodriguez answered “He will read a book
with a glass of wine by the pool, stay inside.” (Id. at 426, 427.) When asked if Prof. Dershowitz
ever even spoke to any of the girls, or “even knew that they were there” Rodriguez answered “I
don’t know.” (Id. at 427.) This is consistent with the fact that Epstein’s home is very large and
has separate closed-off quarters where Epstein resided. Prof. Dershowitz never stepped into
these private quarters.

Jane Doe #3 also relies upon the September 8, 2009 deposition testimony of Mr. Juan
Alessi to “corroborate” Jane Doe #3’s sensational and false allegations regarding Prof.
Dershowitz. However, a more complete examination of that testimony reveals that Alessi did
not make any allegations of any wrong doing by Dershowitz. (See, DE 291-17, hereinafter

"
IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029510.txt,"know what that means. I said, as I look across the religions of the world, the common
features I see are: Number one: transcendence—as a religious experience, not the dogma,
not the ideology, not the institution—but transcendence, going beyond subject-object split.
Number two: the emergence of platonic values as a result of that experience, like the desire
to know the truth, goodness, beauty, harmony, love, compassion, joy, equanimity, gratitude
and humility, wonder, curiosity. It’s very human but it gets overshadowed by everyday
experience. And number three: a loss of the fear of death, because that happens to
experience, not to the consciousness in which that experience occurs. I think they didn’t
understand that, honestly, so they rephrased it as Do we need God? So I said, Listen,
before I even go there, can we have a conversation? So they were very gracious. We all got
together with the board or whatever and we had a conversation. I said, Honestly, God is a
very loaded term and if by God we mean some imagined deity or some dead white male in
the sky then it’s not something that we can even address because we don’t have that
conception of God as an imagined deity.

Matt: You mean that’s not something you personally can address?

Deepak: Yeah I can’t address it, nor can my partner. They said, Well if you make that clear
up front, then it’s fine, but we still want to maintain God in the title. So I was keen to have
this conversation because Michael and I have been going back and forth for 30 years now,
and I thought, Michael’s come to a very good place with me personally. So we agreed to the
title. But if you go to the Eastern wisdom traditions—Buddhism, Vedanta, Shaoism, all the
Eastern traditions—then God is pure consciousness, period. So the debate, you’re right, they
were talking about the mythical God and we were talking about that which is inconceivable
as consciousness but makes every concept possible.

So I can give you a background on that because monotheistic religions are at war all the time
amongst each other, and all of the problems in the world right now are a consequence of
that. But nobody talks about What is a religious or spiritual experience? Hundreds of
millions of people across the world don’t have that idea at all that the monotheistic religions
propose. In fact, if you go deep into the teachings of Buddhism, etc., the word God is not
mentioned. Only consciousness is mentioned. Vedanta, only consciousness is mentioned.
And it’s a very different take on consciousness. So, if you’ll allow me for a moment to
explain that. So when I was a kid, I grew up tn India with a father who was agnostic or
atheist, who was trained in England as a cardiologist. He went on to become a very famous
person. He discovered high altitude mountain sickness. When the Indian and Chinese army
were fighting in Tibet he was putting catheters in people’s hearts and measuring their
cardiac pressures. He described high altitude pulmonary edema and hypertension. My
mother was what you might call a Hindu. But even when she told us stories as kids and she
talked about all these mythical gods and goddesses, she emphasized the fact that these are
mythical, imaginary, symbolic expressions of deep aspirations in human consciousness to
understand reality. Now she was also, by the way, she wasn’t a very educated woman like

But that is the weakest line of attack. Edward Gibbon once described
history as being little better than a record of the “crimes, follies and
misfortunes of mankind.” Imperialism certainly added its quota to
these. But the question is whether it also provided, through Hegel’s
“cunning of reason,” the means to escape from them. Even Marx
justified British rule in India on these grounds. Ferguson, too, can
make a sound argument for such a proposition.

The most serious weakness in Ferguson’s presentation is his lack of
sympathy for the civilizations dismissed as “the rest,” which also
points to the most serious limitation of the revisionist case. The
“triumph of the West” that followed the collapse of communism in
Europe was clearly not the “end of history.” As Ferguson must know,
the main topic of discussion in international affairs nowadays
concerns the “rise” of China, and more generally Asia, as well as the
stirring of Islam.

Of course, the Chinese may prefer to talk about “restoration” rather
than “rise,” and point to a “harmonious” pluralism of the future. But
“rise” is how most people think of China’s recent history, and in
history the rise of some is usually associated with the decline of
others. In other words, we may be reverting to that cyclical pattern
that historians assumed to be axiomatic before the seemingly
irreversible rise of the West implanted in them a view of linear
progress toward greater reason and freedom.

Europe is plainly in decline, politically and culturally, though most
Europeans, blinded by their high living standards and the pretensions
of their impotent statesmen, are happy to dress this up as progress.
Chinese savings are underwriting much of the American civilizing
mission that Ferguson applauds. The pattern seems clear: the West is
losing dynamism, and the rest are gaining it.

The remainder of this century will show how this shift plays out. For
the moment, most of us have lost the historical plot. It is possible, for

Dear Mr. Epstein: 
Please allow me to introduce myself My name is Marlene Edme; I am the founder and President. .For above-
mentioned organization and Yair Fatal is the Project Director. The organization was founded in 2007 with the 
mission of providing free technical skills in the garment industry to the people in the Southeastern department 
of Haiti. Following the earthquake, the living and economic conditions are deplorable. More than ever, 
CEFOTAJ wants to double its effort to help the community of Jacmel out of desperation by providing the youth 
with valuable sustainable skills. With a trade under their belt, the youth will be more confident while seeking 
employment. 
We have obtained our 501 - C (3) in 2008 and have recently received the approval of the Haiti's Department of 
Planning to be a non-governmental organization (NGO). The organization's building that will house the 
school is currently under construction. 
Based on our research, we found that you are very committed to helping Haiti. The purpose of this 
correspondence is to solicit The Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation assistance with grant coordination and 
facilitation to help our organization get off the ground. With potential help from the international community, 
we believe that the project would be rewarding for the citizens of the city of Jacmel and in line with the 
requirements of the Haiti Reconstruction Plan and President Obama recent legislation of the Hope law.. 
Please find enclosed a copy of the project which provides detailed information about the curriculum for the 
different programs that the school will offer. We trust that you will find this to be an interesting project with

Federal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations

Statutory Authority, below, the Board
believes that it has been Congressionally
authorized to make this regulatory
decision in the interests of carrying out
the provisions of the Act.

Many comments argue that the Board
should heed the use of the word
“necessary” in Section 6. For instance,
the Portland Cement Association
comments that Section 6 requires the
Board to demonstrate that: (1) The
specific rule being proposed is, in fact,
necessary, and (2) the adoption of the
proposed rule will carry out one or more
specific provisions of the Act.?9 The
Board believes, for the reasons
expressed in subsection C, Factual
Support, below, that the requisite
showing of necessity has been made.
And, as explained below, the adoption
of the proposed rule is consistent with
Section 1 and will help effectuate
Sections 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the NLRA.

The Board, however, disagrees with
the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers
Association’s assertion based upon the
case of West Virginia State Board of
Education v. Barnette *° that the Board
needs to show “‘a grave and immediate
danger’’ before enacting a rule. First,
that case held that that very rigorous
standard of review is required only
where a First Amendment freedom is
alleged to have been infringed. The
Court further noted that where the First
Amendment is not implicated, the
government may regulate an area so
long as it has a “‘rational basis” for
doing so. As explained in subsection B,
Statutory Authority, below, this rule
infringes upon no First Amendment
interests, and consequently, the rule
should be judged on a standard similar
to the “rational basis” test laid out in
Barnette. It was in fact just such a
deferential standard which the Supreme
Court used to examine the Board’s
health care rule in AHA. There, the
Court found that even if it read Section
9 to find any ambiguity, it still would
have deferred to the Board’s “reasonable
interpretation of the statutory text,” and
found the Board authorized under
Sections 6 and 9 to enact the health care
bargaining unit rule at issue.41 No
“orave and immediate danger’ was
found to be required prior to the Board
enacting that rule. This ruling was also
consistent with the Supreme Court’s
earlier holdings in Thorpe and
Mourning, in which regulations
promulgated under broadly phrased
grants of authority needed to be only

39 See also comment of Americans for Limited
Government, citing to AFL-CIO v. Chao, 409 F.3d
377, 391 (D.C. Cir. 2005) for the same principle.

41499 U.S. at 614.

“reasonably related to the purposes of
the enabling legislation.” 42 For the
reasons shown below, that standard is
more than met in the present rule.

B. The Board’s Statutory Authority To
Issue This Rule

The National Labor Relations Act
does not directly address an employer’s
obligation to post a notice of its
employees’ rights arising under the Act
or the consequences an employer may
face for failing to do so. However, as
stated, NLRA Section 6 empowers the
Board to promulgate legislative rules “‘as
may be necessary to carry out the
provisions” of the Act. 29 U.S.C. 156. A
determination of necessity under
Section 6 made by the Board, as
administrator of the NLRA, is entitled to
deference. See Ragsdale v. Wolverine
World Wide, Inc., 535 U.S. 81, 86 (2002).

Furthermore, even in the absence of
express rulemaking authority, “the
power of an administrative agency to
administer a congressionally created
* * * program necessarily requires the
formulation of policy and the making of
rules to fill any gap left, implicitly or
explicitly, by Congress.”’ Morton v. Ruiz,
415 U.S. 199, 231 (1974). Under the
well-known test articulated by the
Supreme Court in Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v.
Natural Resources Defense Council,
Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), courts will
defer to the Board’s reasonable
interpretation of a gap left by Congress
in the NLRA.

An examination of the provisions of
the whole law demonstrate how the
notice-posting rule is a legitimate
exercise of both legislative rulemaking
authority under Section 6 and implied
gap-filling authority under Chevron, 467
U.S. at 843. Section 1 of the NLRA
explains that Congress deliberately
chose the means of “encouraging the
practice and procedure of collective
bargaining” and ‘protecting the exercise
of workers of full freedom of
association, self-organization, and
designation of representatives of their
own choosing” in order to combat the
substantial burdens on commerce
caused by certain employer and labor
union practices as well as by the
inherent “inequality of bargaining
power between employees * * * and
employers.” 29 U.S.C. 151.48 Section 7

42 Mourning, 411 U.S. at 369 (quoting Thorpe, 393
U.S. at 280-81).

43 These regulations are entirely compatible with
the national labor policy, as expressed in Section
1, “to eliminate the causes of certain substantial
obstructions to the free flow of commerce and to
mitigate and eliminate these obstructions when
they have occurred.” 29 U.S.C. 151 (fifth
paragraph). As explained below, the Board’s ability
to “eliminate” the causes of labor strife and
depressed wage rates, ‘““which have the intent or

therefore sets forth the core rights of
employees ‘“‘to self-organization’’; “to
form, join, or assist labor organizations”;
“to bargain collectively”; and “to engage
in other concerted activities’; as well as
the right “to refrain from any or all such
activities.” Id. § 157. Section 8 defines
and prohibits union and employer
“unfair labor practices” that infringe on
employees’ Section 7 rights, id. § 158,
and Section 10 authorizes the Board to
adjudicate unfair labor practice claims,
id. § 160, subject to the NLRA’s
procedural six-month statute of
limitations, see Zipes v. Trans World
Airlines, Inc., 455 U.S. 385, 395 n.11
(1982). Finally, Section 9 authorizes the
Board to conduct representation
elections and issue certifications. 29
U.S.C. 159.

Notably, the NLRA does not give the
Board or its General Counsel roving
investigatory powers. Although the
Board is specifically empowered to
“prevent” unfair labor practices, id.

§ 160(a), “[t]he Board may not act until
an unfair labor practice charge is filed
* * * alleging a violation of the Act.”
2 The Developing Labor Law 2683 John
E. Higgins, Jr. ed., 5th ed. 2006). In
addition, certification “procedures are
set in motion with the filing of a
representation petition.” Jd. at 2662. In
both instances, the initiating document
is filed by a private party. Id. at 2683
(citing 29 CFR 102.9); id. at 2662-63
(citing 29 U.S.C. 159(c)(1)(A), (B), and
(e)(1)).

Enforcement of the NLRA and
effectuation of Congress’s national labor
policy therefore depend on the
existence of outside actors who are not
only aware of their rights but also know
where they may seek to vindicate them
within appropriate timeframes. The
Department of Labor made a similar
finding in an analogous rulemaking
proceeding under the Fair Labor
Standards Act: “effective enforcement of
the [FLSA] depends to a great extent
upon knowledge on the part of covered
employees of the provisions of the act
and the applicability of such provisions
to them, and a greater degree of
compliance with the act has been
effected in situations where employees
are aware of their rights under the law.”’
14 FR 7516, 7516 (Dec. 16, 1949). Given
the direct relationship between
employees’ timely awareness of their
rights under the NLRA and the Board’s

necessary effect of burdening or obstructing
commerce,” id., depends on workers’ knowledge of
their rights and the protections provided by the
NLRB. The Board therefore rejects the argument of
the Manufacturer’s Association of South Central
Pennsylvania that both the notice-posting rule and
the Board’s general assertion of rulemaking
authority are inconsistent with Section 1.

it would go something like this. ............... 1 Donald doesn't really own very much, he rents out his name. he 
puts it on buildings projects etc. for a royalty or piece of the upside. he then claims the asset is  his  . its 
very much like hyatt hotels. it says Hyatt hotel on the front but it is owned by someone else. ( sometimes by 
Hyatt but not often). Hyatt receives 3 percent per year of revenue and a piece of the profits sometimes if the 
hotel is sold at a profit. . 
money launderers. need a name to purchase trophy properties. why? there is little suspicion if a 
famous wealthy person buys a property that is likely to show in the press. , it cant be jojo my driver, up 
front , so they approach wealthy people and tell them for 2 -5 million dollars for doing nothing at all. - just 
lend us your name . - and the person get the positive press. so and so bought the most expensive 
painting, sold the most expensive painting, house., diamond. etc. -ex the GANZ art collection was bought 
and sold by Joe Lewis. . all the publicity was the ganz family estate. selling etc. 
hypothetically, . someone approached trump and said can you buy the palm beach house. in your 
name. ( it was trump properties 11c ) , not sure who actually owns the 11c. ? Donald can get a loan from a 
bank , but it is guaranteed by, an entity controlled by R R has a bvi co. xitrans. that is owned by a family 
trust. ( cyprus ). R wife settles in oct after trump anounces candidacy. the Ilc agreement or the loan 
agreement allows Donald to get a few million for his name. . R in essence is the owner. . he was part of 
the panama papers release. he also sold the da vinci to mbs. . ? if you are a gangster , where and how can 
you invest money. answer not through the front door. 
Donald's financial disclosures are the same , he represents his  income  as the GROSS receipts of his 
clubs. , means nothing at all ZERO. no income as we no it. 
he lists his  assets ,and their VALUE - but not the corresponding loans, against it. so no net number 
, hence meaningless.

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031702.txt,"should pay their fair share - without ever defining what a “fair share is; with saying that
Romney wants the poor, elderly and sick to fend for themselves - without even
acknowledging that all these government programs are going bankrupt, their current
insolvency only papered over by deficit spending.

Similarly, Obama (or his surrogates) could hint to blacks that a Romney victory would lead
them back into chains and proclaim to women that their abortions and birth control would be
taken away. He could appeal to Hispanics that Romney would have them all arrested and
shipped to Mexico and unabashedly state that he will not enforce the current immigration
laws. He could espouse the furtherance of the incestuous relationship between governments
and unions - in which politicians ply the unions with public money, in exchange for which the
unions provide the politicians with votes, in exchange for which the politicians provide more
money and the unions provide more votes, etc., even though the money is gone.

Obama also knows that the electorate has changed - that whites will soon | | minority in
America (they're already a minority in California) and that the new immigrants to the US are
primarily from the Third World and do not share the traditional American values that attracted
immigrants in the 19th and 20th centuries. It is a different world, and a different America .
Obama is part of that different America , knows it, and knows how to tap into it. That is why
he won.

Obama also proved again that negative advertising works, invective sells, and harsh personal
attacks succeed. That Romney never engaged in such diatribes points to his essential
goodness as a person; his negative ads were simple facts, never personal abuse - facts
about high unemployment, lower take-home pay, a loss of American power and prestige
abroad, a lack of leadership, etc. As a politician, though, Romney failed because he did not
embrace the devil's bargain of making unsustainable promises.

It turned out that it was not possible for Romney and Ryan - people of substance, depth and
ideas - to compete with the shallow populism and platitudes of their opponents. Obama
mastered the politics of envy — of class warfare - never reaching out to Americans as such
but to individual groups, and cobbling together a winning majority from these minority
groups. If an Obama could not be defeated - with his record and his vision of America , in
which free stuff seduces voters - it is hard to envision any change in the future.

The road to Hillary Clinton in 2016 and to a European-socialist
economy - those very economies that are collapsing today in
Europe - is paved.

For Jews, mostly assimilated anyway and staunch Democrats, the results demonstrate again
that liberalism is their Torah. Almost 70% voted for a

president widely perceived by Israelis and most committed Jews as hostile to Israel . They
voted to secure Obama's future at America 's expense and at Israel 's expense - in effect,
preferring Obama to Netanyahu by a wide margin.

A dangerous time is ahead. Under present circumstances, it is

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021788.txt,"“In their mind that would be an adequate resolution,” Mr. Weinstein said. “Our view is
that is not enough of a punishment to fit the crime that occurred.”

The lurid details of the case have captivated wealthy circles in Palm Beach and New
York and transformed Mr. Epstein, who shuns publicity and whose business depends on
discretion, into a figure of public ridicule.

He said he has been trailed by stalkers and has become the target of lawsuits. In recent
months, he said, he received over 100 letters a week asking for money or jobs as a
masseuse. He recently received a package of gold-tinted condoms.

It has been a long, strange journey from Coney Island, where Mr. Epstein grew up in
middle-class surroundings. He taught briefly at Dalton, the Manhattan private school, and
then joined Bear Stearns, becoming a derivatives specialist. He struck out on his own in
the 1980s.

His business is something of a mystery. He says he manages money for billionaires, but
the only client he is willing to disclose is Leslie H. Wexner, the founder of Limited
Brands.

As Mr. Epstein explains it, he provides a specialized form of superelite financial advice.
He counsels people on everything from taxes and trusts to prenuptial agreements and
paternity suits, and even provides interior decorating tips for private jets. Industry sources
say he charges flat annual fees ranging from $25 million to more than $100 million.

As it became clear that he was headed for jail, Mr. Epstein has tried to put on a brave
face. “Your body can be confined, but not your mind,” he said in a recent interview by
phone.

But the strains were showing. “I am anxious,” he said in another recent interview,
referring to how inmates would treat him. “I make a great effort to treat people equally,
but I recognize that I might be perceived as one of the New York arrogant rich.”

Jail will certainly be a big change. Mr. Epstein is a man of precise, at times
unconventional, habits. He starts his mornings with a secret-ingredient bran muffin
prepared by his chef. He seems to have a germ phobia. He never wears a suit, preferring
monogrammed sweatsuits and jeans. And he rarely attends meetings — “I never have to
be anywhere,” he tells his pilots, when he cautions them to avoid flying through chancy
weather.

Looking back, Mr. Epstein admits that his behavior was inappropriate. “I am not
blameless,” he said. He said he has taken steps to make sure the same thing never
happens again.

For starters, Mr. Epstein has hired a full-time male masseur (the man happens to be a

former Ultimate Fighting champion). He also has organized what he calls a board of
directors of friends to counsel him on his behavior.

MEME. at 6, 8, 22, 45; Tab 7, MEE. 13; Tab SIN Tr. at 8; Tab 9, NNN Tr. at 5; and
Tab 10, J Tr. at 14-15 (excerpts from these transcripts are included below). Furthermore,
the women who visited Mr. Epstein’s home all visited voluntarily and many willingly returned
several times.

The State Attorney’s Office (the “SAO”) has vast experience prosecuting sex crimes and
conducted an exhaustive, 15-month investigation of Mr. Epstein. A Grand Jury has concluded
that Mr. Epstein was merely a local “John,” guilty of soliciting prostitution in violation of state
law. Notably, Florida law distinguishes soliciting from procuring and compelling prostitution if
minors are involved. Indeed, soliciting is a misdemeanor except for the commission of a third
subsequent offense, turning it into a felony. The SAO, therefore, sought and obtained an
indictment charging Mr. Epstein with felony solicitation of prostitution. Mr. Epstein is prepared
to plead guilty and accept a sentence for that offense—a sentence that, notably, is far more
severe than that meted out to other “Johns” convicted of violating Florida’s solicitation laws for
cases in which sexual activity was alleged.

Though CEOS points out its admirable goal of “protecting children,” a moniker that
engenders high emotions, the conduct alleged here involves women over 16, which is the age of
consent in 38 states and supplies the effective federal age of consent. The young women were by
no means the target of high-school trolling; they were individuals who, with friends, visited Mr.
Epstein’s house—a home full of friends and staff. The civil complaints filed against Mr. Epstein
reiterate the fact that the individuals who visited Mr. Epstein would visit with their friends. And
Mr. Epstein never spoke to or had any contact with these women before they arrived at his
house. And again, the State is handling this matter appropriately.

We respectfully submit that that should be the beginning and the end of this matter. As
you know, the Department’s Petite Policy precludes successive federal prosecutions after a State
has acted: “{A] state judgment of conviction, plea agreement [here held in abeyance solely as a
result of the federal investigation], or acquittal on the merits shall be a bar to any subsequent
federal prosecution for the same act or acts.” U.S.A.M. § 9-2.031A (emphasis added).
Consistent with that principle, and of particular relevance to this case, the Department itself just
recently observed the following:

[P]rostitution-related offenses have historically been prosecuted at the state or
local level. This allocation between state and Federal enforcement authority does
not imply that these crimes are less serious, but rather reflects important structural
allocations of responsibility between state and Federal governments.... [T]he
Department is not aware of any reasons why state and local authorities are not
currently able to pursue prostitution-related crimes such that Federal jurisdiction -
is necessary.

See Tab 11, November 9, 2007 Letter from Justice Department Principal Deputy Assistant
Attorney General Brian Benczkowski to the House Committee on the Judiciary, p. 8-9.

BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. In the Rodriguez deposition at one point, he
was asked a question and he responds with the name,
Larry Dershowitz. Do you recall that?

A. Oh, you mean Larry -- you didn't mean to say

Larry Dershowitz.

Q. His answer was Larry Dershowitz in the
deposition?

A. I don't recall that.

Q. Did you consider whether he was thinking

about Larry Summers * (ph)?

A. My recollection of the Rodriguez depo and,
you Know, there are two depos here, Alessi and
Rodriguez, was that -- that the identifiers with regard
to Dershowitz were famous criminal defense lawyer-type
which would fit Mr. Dershowitz, but not fit Mr. Summers.

Although cryptocurrencies cannot be spent without control of the corresponding private keys, care must be taken to
protect those private keys. Many bitcoin owners allow exchanges to custody their private keys, which leaves them
vulnerable:

— Ifhackers are able to access owners’ private keys, they can deplete owners’ digital wallets.
— As of August 2016, Reuters reported that a third of bitcoin exchanges had been hacked.!
— Ethereum’s recent Parity hack 1s the first time a coding error has resulted in a loss of funds.

Estimates vary but suggest that hackers have stolen at least several hundred million dollars of cryptocurrencies.

11. On the third occasion involving the Defendant, Donald J. Trump, the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson
was forced to engage in an unnatural lesbian sex act with her fellow minor and sex slave, Maria Doe
age 12, for the sexual enjoyment of Defendant Trump. After this sex act, both minors were forced
to orally copulate Defendant Trump by placing their mouths simultaneously on his erect penis until
he achieved sexual orgasm. After zipping up his pants, Defendant Trump physically pushed both
minors away while angrily berating them for the poor quality of their sexual performance.

12. On the fourth and final sexual encounter with the Defendant, Donald J. Trump, the Plaintiff,
Katie Johnson, was tied to a bed by Defendant Trump who then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff
Johnson. During the course of this savage sexual attack, Plaintiff Johnson loudly pleaded with
Defendant Trump to “please wear a condom. Defendant Trump responded by violently striking
Plaintiff Johnson in the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he
wanted as he refused to wear protection. After achieving sexual orgasm, the Defendant, Donald J.
Trump put his suit back on and when the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, in tears asked Defendant Trump
what would happen if he had impregnated her, Defendant Trump grabbed his wallet and threw
some money at her and screamed that she should use the money “to get a fucking abortion.

13. On the first occasion involving the Defendant, Jeffrey E. Epstein, the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson,
was forced to disrobe into her bra and panties and to give a full body massage to Defendant Epstein
while he was completely naked. During the massage, Defendant Epstein physically forced Plaintiff
Johnson to touch his erect penis with her bare hands and to clean up his ejaculated semen after he
achieved sexual orgasm.

14. On the second occasion involving the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson
was again forced to disrobe into her bra and panties while giving Defendant Epstein a full body
massage while he was completely naked. The Defendant, Donald J. Trump, was also present as he
was getting his own massage from another minor, Jane Doe, age 13, Defendant Epstein forced
Plaintiff Johnson to touch his erect penis by physically placing her bare hands upon his sex organ

and again forced Plaintiff Johnson to clean up his ejaculated semen after he achieved sexual orgasm.

practically ran the administration. They don’t need your help.”

“Take this H-1B visa issue. They really need these H-1B visas.”

Murdoch suggested that taking a liberal approach to H-1B visas might be hard to
square with his immigration promises. But Trump seemed unconcerned, assuring
Murdoch, “We’ll figure it out.”

“What a fucking idiot,” said Murdoch, shrugging, as he got off the phone.

OOK Ok

Ten days before Donald Trump’s inauguration as the forty-fifth president, a group of
young Trump staffers—the men in regulation Trump suits and ties, the women in the
Trump-favored look of high boots, short skirts, and shoulder-length hair—were watching
President Barack Obama give his farewell speech as it streamed on a laptop in the
transition offices.

“Mr. Trump said he’s never once listened to a whole Obama speech,” said one of the
young people authoritatively.

“They’re so boring,” said another.

While Obama bade his farewell, preparations for Trump’s first press conference since
the election, to be held the next day, were under way down the hall. The plan was to make
a substantial effort to show that the president-elect’s business conflicts would be addressed
in a formal and considered way.

Up until now, Trump’s view was that he’d been elected because of those conflicts—his
business savvy, connections, experience, and brand—not in spite of them, and that it was
ludicrous for anyone to think he could untangle himself even if he wanted to. Indeed, to
reporters and anyone else who would listen, Kellyanne Conway offered on Trump’s behalf
a Sself-pitying defense about how great his sacrifice had already been.

After fanning the flames of his intention to disregard rules regarding conflicts of
interest, now, in a bit of theater, he would take a generous new tack. Standing in the lobby
of Trump Towner next to a table stacked high with document folders and legal papers, he
would describe the vast efforts that had been made to do the impossible and how,
henceforth, he would be exclusively focused on the nation’s business.

But suddenly this turned out to be quite beside the point.

Fusion GPS, an opposition research company (founded by former journalists, it
provided information to private clients), had been retained by Democratic Party interests.
Fusion had hired Christopher Steele, a former British spy, in June 2016, to help investigate
Trump’s repeated brags about his relationship with Vladimir Putin and the nature of
Trump’s relationship with the Kremlin. With reports from Russian sources, many

more complex and troubling realities of the Harvard College program as it surely must operate in
practice. (I have no inside knowledge of how the Harvard College admissions process actually
works; my speculations derive from reading the newspapers and from having publicly debated
several Harvard officials on the Bakke issue.)

For example, Justice Powell was anything but clear about the degree to which an applicant’s race
may be considered in university admissions decisions. At different points in his opinion, he
articulates different formulations of the limits on explicit consideration of race in attempts to
produce a diverse student body. He says that race must be “simply one element—to be weighed
fairly against other elements—in the selection process”; that a school must place “all pertinent
elements of diversity...on the same footing, for consideration, although not necessarily according
them the same weight”; and that a school must “adhere to a policy of individual comparisons.”

Let us assume that Blank University seeks diversity by trying to include musicians, farm boys,
Oklahomans among its entering class, but that it does not instruct its admissions officers to aim
for a specified minimum number of musicians, farm boys and Oklahomans in each entering class.
May Blank University direct its admissions officers—either explicitly or implicitly—to make
certain that the number of blacks or Chicanos should not go beneath a certain approximate
percentage in the class? Would that put race on a different “footing” than the other elements of
diversity?

The answer to that question may well turn on whether one looks for legal guidance to the
description of the Harvard program as quoted in Mr. Justice Powell’s opinion, or to the real
world operation of the Harvard program as it probably works in practice. The following
description certainly implies that race is not treated differently from other elements of diversity:

“In Harvard College admissions the Committee has not set target-quotas for the number of blacks, or of
musicians, football players, physicists or Californians to be admitted in a given year. At the same time the
Committee is aware that if Harvard College is to provide a truly heterogeneous environment that reflects
the rich diversity of the United States, it cannot be provided without some attention to numbers. It would
not make sense, for example, to have 10 or 20 students out of 1,100 whose homes are west of the
Mississippi. Comparably, 10 or 20 black students could not begin to bring to their classmates and to each
other the variety of points of view, backgrounds and experiences of blacks in the United States. Their
small numbers might also create a sense of isolation among the black students themselves and thus make
it more difficult for them to develop and achieve their potential. Consequently, when making its decisions,
the Committee on Admissions is aware that there is some relationship between numbers and achieving the
benefits to be derived from a diverse student body, and between numbers and providing a reasonable
environment for those students admitted.

A closer look at the admissions program in practice might well reveal that the Harvard admissions
officers, though interested in assuring geographic, occupational and musical diversity, really pay
little or no attention to numbers: it would be no great crisis if one particular entering class at
Harvard College had few or even no violinists, Oklahomans, or farm boys. (Football quarterbacks
or basketball centers might be another thing altogether.) But these very same admissions officers
may well be under instructions—explicit or implicit—to pay close attention to the number of
blacks so as to assure that the proportion does not fall below a certain approximate floor.

There are two problems with X-ray imaging. Even with clever
mathematics, the dense bone in the skull blocks the rays so you don't get
much contrast, making it hard to distinguish normal brain matter from
something like a tumor. But the bigger concern is X-rays are a form of
ionizing radiation, and ionizing radiation causes cancer.

We are told to wear sun block to protect our skin from ultraviolet
light; X-rays are 100 times more potent and can doa great deal of damage.
Fortunately, the body repairs itself quite well in the presence of low levels
of radiation. The double part of the double helix in our DNA allows a
set of proteins in our cells to go around correcting errors when they
detect a mismatch between the two strands. But, now and again an X-ray
might make an irreparable fault in both copies. If enough of these faults
accumulate, they can lead to cancer or, if the errors are in reproductive
organs, birth defects. Doctors try to minimize the radiation we receive
and give us as few CAT scans as possible during our lifetime, especially
when we are young and have not yet had children.

MRI

X-rays dominated our ability to see into the human body until the
mid-1970s when Raymond Damadian came up with the idea of using
magnetism. Magnetic fields are not absorbed by bone and present
no danger as they do not damage DNA. Ironically, the technique was
originally known as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, ‘NMR, which patients
thought must be dangerous because of the word nuclear. The name was

Bannon the European: He's opening the populist fort in Brussels 
The former Trump strategist arrives in Europe with The Movement. Objective: an alliance between 
right-wing leaders, from Salvini to Orban in view of the 2019 elections 
NEW YORK. The invasion of Europe has begun. Steve Bannon, 65, the American far-right guru who 
was Donald Trump's right-hand man in the White House — but let go last summer following the racist 
violence in Charlottesville — is preparing to march on Brussels. Launching, he told the Daily Beast 
himself, a new non-profit foundation called The Movement, (II Movimento), right in the heart of 
Europe and its institutions. Through which he hopes to coordinate the populist right in view of the 
European elections which will be held in spring 2019. 
Objective: to compete with George Soros, the American billionaire of Hungarian origin, benefactor of 
the Democratic party, who since 1984 with his Open Society has spent at least $32 billion in support of 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 019308 
NGOs dealing with human rights. And for this he became the bogeyman of the populist right, accused 
of plots of all kinds: including that of wanting to replace Italians with immigrants in order to have 
labour at low cost. A mantra repeated in the past on Twitter also by the current Minister of the Interior 
Matteo Salvini. 
The ambition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site Breitbart — which in the 
European campaign preceded him since the platform had already opened bureaux in London and Rome 
— is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great populist international of which he has long 
since been dreaming. 
The Movement, in fact, intends to function as an extreme right-wing think tank: a source of strategic 
advice to channel the not-so-politically structured discontent of the most extreme European movements. 
Analysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and channeling funding. 
The aim is to create a populist alliance, a sort of super group that if victorious can conquer up to a 
third of the European Parliament in the elections next May. 
Indeed — putting the common policy of the Old Continent in the hands of Bannon and his own. The 
American strategist is very attached to the Freedom Caucus — the extreme right of the US Congress — 
and in 2014 he was at the top of the Cambridge Analytica company, which in 2016 used data stolen 
from Facebook to try to influence the presidential election from which Donald Trump emerged victor. 
It is not a mystery that for a long time he courts nationalists of the right from East to West. And he has 
already met, among others, the Hungarian Orban, the French Marine Le Pen and the former leader of 
the British separatists Nigel Farage. The latter reappeared, coincidentally, on Friday in Pennsylvania, 
USA, to a fundraiser in favor of the Republican congressman Lou Barletta. Without forgetting the 
Italians of Lega and 5 stars. Of them, he said: If it works in Italy, we can import the model anywhere. 
The Movement, which for now will count on a staff of 10 people, will be fully operational in 2019. In 
short, after the American midterm elections, where Bannon is fighting to influence the primaries 
supporting candidates potentially able to undermine the prospects of Republican establishment. But in 
the future the former spin doctor says he wants to spend more and more time in Europe. Also because 
the relationships with Trump have worsened after the revelations he made to Michael Wolff and 
published in the scandal book Fire and Fury. Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Paradise, 
Bannon says now paraphrasing the Satan of one of his favorite books, John Milton's Lost Paradise. Hell 
in this case would be the dear old Europe and its democratic values. The army of darkness is already 
among us.

obesity, non-communicable disease; greater longevity; and lower rates of infant mortality — effectively
stop any serious challenges to the systems being used and further developed.

By 2050, life styles and healthcare across the US and many other parts of the world are governed by Al
systems that have their roots in the early Al-consult technologies. The advice given to people, the
actions that are imposed on them, the way people are persuaded and encouraged to live their lives in
certain ways, are opaque, and are no longer under transparent direct human control. However, most
people live longer, healthier and happier lives as a result.

There remain several concerns:

e There remains some differentiation in health and well-being related quality of life within society. Some
communities and individuals opt out of Al-consult control, although their health-metrics are typically
very poor in comparison with the rest of society.

e Perhaps troublingly, there are some trends that are hard to make sense of. For instance, there seem to
be fewer cases of mental and physical disability than might be expected. However, with Al-consult
controlling healthcare (and health data) across the board, there are few ways for people to analyze and
study these possible trends.

e Lack of transparency can be a starting point for many adverse outcomes.

e Autonomous devices rely on collecting personal data for performing their tasks. But what happens
when a device starts to know more about its owner than the human itself? How do we ensure the
device does not act in ways that would not act in ways that the owner would not want it to? (Of course
the important question of making sure the data under consideration is protected and does not fall into
malicious hands is a whole other discussion, but let us table that for now.) The classic story of the
Target ads comes to mind, where a teenager was sent ads for pregnancy related products, however,
she had not told her family about the pregnancy.

e Systems might as above might move beyond such areas of health, and provide advice to people on both
their daily decisions and longer-term planning. Such systems might evolve to become personal
advocates who represent people to third parties. This would include both giving advice, and formulating
arguments to make to others, or in making those arguments directly as your representative. These
advocate bots will gradually be useful to a larger and larger fraction of the population, eventually being
useful even as corporate legal counsel and as advisers to CEOs. Strong systems and reliance will raise
reasonable alarms about Al control of people and society. How can we be sure that our these highly
relied upon systems are genuinely advocating for us rather than the interests of others?

DISCUSSION

How can we characterize potential high-threat areas and stay aware of these possibilities even if
these effects are insidious, and occur over long periods of time. What might be done to address
potential poor outcomes? How can people maintain skills, agency, and be empowered, and aware
over time with the expected growth and eventual ubiquity of Al systems that advise and guide?

Beying. Making the possibility of questioning him even more remote, he next went to Russia, a
country which has no extradition treaty with the United States. And Russia granted him asylum.
His escape left in its wake an incredibly-important unsolved mystery: how did a young analyst at
the NSA succeeded in penetrating all the layers of NSA security to pull off the largest theft of
secret documents in the history of American intelligence? Did he act alone? What happened to
documents? Was his arrival in Russia part of the plan?

As I had written several books on the vulnerability of intelligence services, this was a mystery--
a how-dunnit if you like-- that immediately intrigued me. After all, even if the perpetrator had
acted for the most salutary of reasons, the unauthorized transfer of state secrets to another
country is, by any definition, a form of espionage.

I decided to begin my investigation of this case in Hong Kong because it was the place to
which Snowden first fled after leaving Hawaii. Snowden had planned the trip for at least 4 weeks,
according to the travel plan he had filed at the NSA, I assumed he had a good reason for going
first to Hong Kong. But when I spoke to my sources in the intelligence community, they could
not explain Snowden’s choice of this semi-autonomous zone in China as his initial destination. It
would not protect him from the reach of US law since Hong Kong had an active extradition treaty
with the United States. Just a few months earlier, Hong Kong had made headlines by extraditing
Trent Martin, a fugitive wanted in America for insider-trading, who was arrested in Hong Kong
following an American request to detain him. Martin was then sent back to the United States to
stand trial.

Nor was Hong Kong particularly convenient to Hawaii. There were no non-stop flights to it from
Honolulu. Snowden’s flight took 8 hours and ten minutes just to Narita airport, Japan, where he
had to change planes. After a three hour wait at the airport, it took him five more hours to fly to
Hong Kong. Moreover, at the time he departed Honolulu, Snowden had not yet arranged for
any journalists to meet him in Hong Kong and, as far as US intelligence could determine, he had
no known appointments there. Even so, Snowden carried the digital copies he had made of the
top-secret NSA documents to Hong Kong. General Michael Hayden, who served both as the
head of the NSA and the CIA, told me. “It’s very mysterious why Snowden chose Hong Kong.”
Whatever reason he had for flying to Hong Kong, we can assume it was compelling enough for
him to take the risk that he would be arrested there after US authorities discovered the theft and
invoked the detention provision of its extradition treaty with Hong Kong. It was possible that
Snowden travelled there to see someone other than a journalist. But who?

Using my frequent travel miles, I bought a ticket on Japan Air Lines to Hong Kong. The route,
like that of Snowden’s route the previous year, had a stop-over in Narita Airport in Japan (where,
according to an intelligence source, Snowden was caught on the CCTV cameras waiting in the
transit lounge for his connection to the four and one half flight to Hong Kong).

Neither Donald nor Jared, no matter their domineering fathers, went into the world
with humility. Insecurity was soothed by entitlement. Both out-of-towners who were eager
to prove themselves or lay rightful claim in Manhattan (Kushner from New Jersey, Trump
from Queens), they were largely seen as overweening, smug, and arrogant. Each cultivated
a smooth affect, which could appear more comical than graceful. Neither, by choice nor
awareness, could seem to escape his privilege. “Some people who are very privileged are
aware of it and put it away; Kushner not only seemed in every gesture and word to
emphasize his privilege, but also not to be aware of it,’ said one New York media
executive who dealt with Kushner. Both men were never out of their circle of privilege.
The main challenge they set for themselves was to enter further into the privileged circle.
Social climbing was their work.

Jared’s focus was often on older men. Rupert Murdoch spent a surprising amount of
time with Jared, who sought advice from the older media mogul about the media business
—which the young man was determined to break into. Kushner paid long court to Ronald
Perelman, the billionaire financier and takeover artist, who later would host Jared and
Ivanka in his private shul on Jewish high holy days. And, of course, Kushner wooed
Trump himself, who became a fan of the young man and was uncharacteristically tolerant
about his daughter’s conversion to Orthodox Judaism when that became a necessary next
step toward marriage. Likewise, Trump as a young man had carefully cultivated a set of
older mentors, including Roy Cohn, the flamboyant lawyer and fixer who had served as
right-hand man to the red-baiting Senator Joe McCarthy.

And then there was the harsh fact that the world of Manhattan and particular its living
voice, the media, seemed to cruelly reject them. The media long ago turned on Donald
Trump as a wannabe and lightweight, and wrote him off for that ultimate sin—anyway, the
ultimate sin in media terms—of trying to curry favor with the media too much. His fame,
such as it was, was actually reverse fame—he was famous for being infamous. It was joke
fame.

To understand the media snub, and its many levels of irony, there is no better place to
look than the New York Observer, the Manhattan media and society weekly that Kushner
bought in 2006 for $10 million—by almost every estimate $10 million more than it was
worth.

How to Charge $546 for Six Liters of Saltwater
Nina Bernstein — New York Times

It is one of the most common components of emergency medicine: an intravenous bag of sterile saltwater.

Luckily for anyone who has ever needed an IV bag to replenish lost fluids or to receive medication, itis also one of the least
expensive. The average manufacturer’s price, according to government data, has fluctuated in recent years from 44 cents to

$1.

Yet there is nothing either cheap or simple about its ultimate cost, as | learned when | tried to trace the commercial path of IV
bags from the factory to the veins of more than 100 patients struck by a May 2012 outbreak of food poisoning in upstate New
York.

Some of the patients’ bills would later include markups of 100 to 200 times the manufacturer’s price, not counting separate
charges for “IV administration.” And on other bills, a bundled charge for “IV therapy” was almost 1,000 times the official cost
of the solution.

It is no secret that medical care in the United States is overpriced. But as the tale of the humble IV bag shows all too clearly, it
is secrecy that helps keep prices high: hidden in the underbrush of transactions among multiple buyers and sellers, and in
the hieroglyphics of hospital bills.

At every step from manufacturer to patient, there are confidential deals among the major players, including drug companies,
purchasing organizations and distributors, and insurers. These deals so obscure prices and profits that even participants
cannot say what the simplest component of care actually costs, let alone what it should cost.

And that leaves taxpayers and patients alike with an inflated bottom line and little or no way to challenge it.
APRICE IN FLUX

In the food-poisoning case, some of the stricken were affluent, and others barely made ends meet. Some had private
insurance; some were covered by government programs like Medicare and Medicaid; and some were uninsured.

In the end, those factors strongly (and sometimes perversely) affected overall charges for treatment, including how much
patients were expected to pay out of pocket. Butat the beginning, there was the cost of an IV bag of normal saline, one of
more than a billion units used in the United States each year.

“People are shocked when they hear that a bag of saline solution costs far less than their cup of coffee in the morning,” said
Deborah Spak, a spokeswoman for Baxter International, one of three global pharmaceutical companies that make nearly all
the IV solutions used in the United States.

It was a rare unguarded comment. Ms. Spak — like a spokesman for Hospira, another giant in the field — later insisted that
all information about saline solution prices was private.

In fact, manufacturers are required to report such prices annually to the federal government, which bases Medicare
payments on the average national price plus 6 percent. The limit for one liter of normal saline (a little more than a quart) went
to $1.07 this year from 46 cents in 2010, an increase manufacturers linked to the cost of raw materials, fuel and
transportation. That would seem to make it the rare medical item that is cheaper in the United States than in France, where
the price at a typical hospital in Paris last year was 3.62 euros, or $4.73. One-liter IV bags normally contain nine grams of
salt, less than two teaspoons. Much of it comes from a major Morton Salt operation in Rittman, Ohio, which uses a
subterranean salt deposit formed millions of years ago. The water is local to places like Round Lake, Ill., or Rocky Mount,
N.C., where Baxter and Hospira, respectively, run their biggest automated production plants under sterility standards set by
the Food and Drug Administration.

But even before the finished product is sold by the case or the truckload, the real cost of a bag of normal saline, like the true

identical.

Any American knows how loose the tie is between the actions of the U.S.
government and the diverse and often contradictory aims of its citizens. That is also true
of corporations. For-profit corporations nominally serve multiple constituencies,
including shareholders, senior executives, employees, and customers. These corporations
differ in how they balance their loyalties and often behave in ways that serve none of
their constituents. The “neurons” that carry their corporate thought are not just the
human employees or the technologies that connect them; they are also coded into the
policies, incentive structures, culture, and procedural habits of the corporation. The
emergent corporate goals do not always reflect the values of the people who implement
them. For instance, an oil company led and staffed by people who care about the
environment may have incentive structures or policies that cause it to compromise
environmental safety for the sake of corporate earnings. The components’ good
intentions are not a guarantee of the emergent system’s good behavior.

Governments and corporations, both built partly of humans, are naturally
motivated to at least appear to share the goals of the humans they depend upon. They
could not function without the people, so they need to keep them cooperative. When
such organizations appear to behave altruistically, this is often part of their motive. I
once complimented the CEO of a large corporation on the contribution his company
made toward a humanitarian relief effort. The CEO responded, without a trace of irony,
“Yes. We have decided to do more things like that to make our brand more likeable.”
Individuals who compose a hybrid superintelligence may occasionally exert a
“humanizing” influence—for example, an employee may break company policies to
accommodate the needs of another human. The employee may act out of true human
empathy, but we should not attribute any such empathy to the superintelligence itself.
These hybrid machines have goals, and their citizens/customers/employees are some of
the resources they use to accomplish them.

We are close to being able to build superintelligences out of pure information
technology, without human components. This is what people normally refer to as
“artificial intelligence,” or AI. It is reasonable to ask what the attitudes of the
hypothetical machine superintelligences will be toward humans. Will they, too, see
humans as useful resources and a good relationship with us as worth preserving? Will
they be constructed to have goals that are aligned with our own? Will a superintelligence
even see these questions as important? What are the “right questions” that we should be
asking? I believe that one of the most important 1s this: What relationship will various
superintelligences have to one another?

It is interesting to consider how the hybrid superintelligences currently deal with
conflicts among themselves. Today, much of the ultimate power rests in the nation
states, which claim authority over a patch of ground. Whether they are optimized to act
in the interests of their citizens or those of a despotic ruler, nation states assert priority
over other intelligences’ desires or goals within their geographic dominion. They claim a
monopoly on the use of force and recognize only other nation states as peers. They are
willing, if necessary, to demand great sacrifices of their citizens to enforce their authority,
even to the point of sacrificing their citizens’ lives.

But it seems that Epstein did work hard to untangle Wexner's
finances. And it appears he succeeded. “Jeffrey cleaned that up
right away,” 4 former associate of Epstein’s says.

The two men became all but inseparable.

“Very smart, with a combination of excellent judgment and
unusually high standards,” Wexner said of Epstein at the time.
“Also, he is always a most loyal friend.”

When Wexner wanted to break up with a woman he'd been
dating for several years — a woman who moved to Ohio and con-
verted to Judaism to make him happy — he dispatched Epstein
to do the dirty work.

When Wexner hired a decorator for his Ohio mansion and
wanted someone to verify the authenticity of several expensive
antiques, Epstein flew in his friend Stuart Pivar, the renowned
art collector and author. (According to Pivar, most of the antiques
were cheap imitations.) When Wexner traveled abroad, he'd
bring back trinkets and gifts for Epstein. When Wexner wanted
to see Cats, Epstein arranged to have the cast perform in his

mansion.

In Ohio, Wexner’s associates whispered about his relationship 7

with Jeffrey Epstein. In New York, they wondered about Epstein'’s 4

role in Wexner’s 1993 marriage to Abigail Koppel.

At thirty-one, Koppel was twenty-four years Wexner’s junior. ;

Of course, none of the supportive factors discussed above precludes further bouts of equity volatility.
As we highlighted at the beginning of the year, the historical probability of a 5% or greater correction
from current valuation levels was 96%. Yet these statistics alone do not justify underweighting
equities, since such pullbacks often occur after sizable equity rallies, as this year reminds us.

Moreover, such pullbacks are quite normal historically. After all, stocks have suffered a median of two
pullbacks of at least 5% and one of at least 10% per calendar year in the post-WWII period, leaving
both the frequency and magnitude of this year’s dips in line with past experience. Most importantly,
years that experienced a similar number of pullbacks as 2018 nonetheless ended with a median gain
of 6% and had 77% odds of a positive return.

Conclusion

Although we have painted a less alarmist view of recent market weakness, we are by no means
Pollyannaish. While bull markets do not die of old age, they do become more susceptible to ailments
over time. Yet as we survey the tug of war between the steady factors and the unsteady undertow,
we do not think the balance of risks is strong enough to topple the ongoing US expansion and the
continued growth of corporate earnings it supports.

That said, this viewpoint does not preclude further market volatility and the market may still make new
lows if the current downdraft persists. But history suggests the bull market is likely to continue until
about 5-6 months prior to the end of this economic expansion. Thus, it will take a significant increase
in the odds of an imminent recession to provide the trigger—that has been lacking thus far—to
tactically underweight equities. In the interim, we continue to recommend that clients maintain their
strategic allocation to US equities.

KIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP
8. ALL IDENTIFIED VICTIMS BE PUT IN SAME POSITION AS IF EPSTEIN
HAD BEEN TRIED.

Mr. Sloman’s Leiter:

e “The Agreement provides for a method of compensation for the victims such that they
would be placed in the same position as if Epstein had been convicted of one of the
enumerated offenses set forth in Title 18, United States Code Section, 2255.”

Id.
The Truth:

¢ Mr. Sloman continues to mischaracterize the highly irregular provisions of the Deferred
Prosecution Agreement. The SDFL did not merely attempt to preserve the compensation
rights of those it identified as victims; it attempted to create compensation rights for those
it identified, without imposing on them the burden of proving that they were in fact
victims under § 2255.

o In the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the SDFL required Mr. Epstein to waive
the right to contest lability under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 as to a list of individuals that
the SDFL would not disclose to Mr. Epstein until after he was sentenced and to
pay for an attorney to secure compensation under § 2255 for those undisclosed
individuals, or if they decided to sue Mr. Epstein.

oO § 2255 ordinarily provides individuals with a right to recover minimum guaranteed
damages of $150,000, without having to prove actual damages, only if: (1) they
were victims of an enumerated federal offense, including offenses under 18 U.S.C.
§§ 2422 and 2423, (2) they were minors at the time of the offense, and most
importantly (3) they were personally injured as a result of the offense.

o The defense has confirmed examples of women who testified that they were not
victims of Mr. Epstein and suffered no personal injury. These women were,
nevertheless, on the list of “victims” identified by the government. . In fact, when
confronted with the testimony of a women who denied both being a victim and
incurring personal injury, Ms. Villafana actually acknowledged such testimony.
To justify inclusion of that woman on the government’s list, however, Ms.
Villafana then challenged her own witness’s credibility.

e For this reason, it is false to state that these “identified” individuals are in the same
position that they would have been had Epstein been convicted at trial. Had there been a
trial, Mr. Epstein would have had a right to confront these individuals through cross-
examination. Any individual that did not establish that she was a minor victim of conduct
that satisfied each element of an enumerated statute under § 2255,or that she suffered
personal injury, would not qualify for any treatment under § 2255. However, under the
Deferred Prosecution Agreement, as an “identified individual” on the government’s list,

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016931.txt,"WILL COMPUTERS BECOME OUR OVERLORDS?
Venki Ramakrishnan

Venki Ramakrishnan is a scientist at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of
Molecular Biology, Cambridge University; recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry
(2009); current president of the Royal Society; and the author of Gene Machine: The
Race to Discover the Secrets of the Ribosome.

A former colleague of mine, Gérard Bricogne, used to joke that carbon-based intelligence
was simply a catalyst for the evolution of silicon-based intelligence. For quite a long
time, both Hollywood movies and scientific Jeremiahs have been predicting our eventual
capitulation to our computer overlords. We all await the singularity, which always seems
to be just over the horizon.

In a sense, computers have already taken over, facilitating virtually every aspect
of our lives—from banking, travel, and utilities to the most intimate personal
communication. I can see and talk to my grandson in New York for free. I remember
when I first saw the 1968 movie 200/: A Space Odyssey, the audience laughed at the
absurdly cheap cost of a picturephone call from space: $1.70, at a time when a long-
distance call within the U.S. was $3 per minute.

However, the convenience and power of computers is also something of a
Faustian bargain, for it comes with a loss of control. Computers prevent us from doing
things we want. Try getting on a flight if you arrive at the airport and the airline
computer systems are down, as happened not so long ago to British Airways at Heathrow.
The planes, pilots, and passengers were all there; even the air-traffic controls were
working. But no flights for that airline were allowed to take off. Computers also make
us do things we don’t want—by generating mailing lists and print labels to send us all
millions of pieces of unwanted mail, which we humans have to sort, deliver, and dispose
of.

But you ain’t seen nothing yet. In the past, we programmed computers using
algorithms we understood at least in principle. So when machines did amazing things
like beating world chess champion Garry Kasparov, we could say that the victorious
programs were designed with algorithms based on our own understanding—using, in this
instance, the experience and advice of top grandmasters. Machines were simply faster at
doing brute-force calculations, had prodigious amounts of memory, and were not prone to
errors. One article described Deep Blue’s victory not as that of a computer, which was
just a dumb machine, but as the victory of hundreds of programmers over Kasparov, a
single individual.

That way of programming is changing dramatically. After a long hiatus, the
power of machine learning has taken off. Much of the change came when programmers,
rather than trying to anticipate and code for every possible contingency, allowed
computers to train themselves on data, using deep neural networks based on models of
how our own brains learn. They use probabilistic methods to “learn” from large
quantities of data; computers can recognize patterns and come up with conclusions on
their own. A particularly powerful method is called reinforcement learning, by which the
computer learns, without prior input, which variables are important and how much to

An examination of the political reforms conducted by successive
governments in Jordan over the last decade suggests that, in most
cases, the king’s directives were ignored, diluted, and, at times,
directly opposed. This does not imply that the objectives of this class
and the monarch were always in contradiction, but suggests that the
rentier system has, over time and through entrenchment, created
monsters who will only acquiesce as long as the system perpetuates
the old policy of favors.

These groups are therefore more likely to pursue policies that are
antithetical to political reform, thus resulting in the gaps and
imbalances lamented by the king’s latest letter. These rentier systems
have already proven to be difficult to maintain and, in an Arab world
that is increasingly demanding better governance and greater
accountability, such ossified systems will come to pose significant
threats to stability, particularly in resource-poor countries such as
Jordan

Conclusion

After a decade of political reform efforts in Jordan, it does not appear
that the process has made any significant advances. In fact, as is clear
from some of the key indicators above, the process seems not only to
have stalled, but regressed as well. Reversals in civil liberties and
political rights caused Jordan to lose significant international
standing. In the annual Freedom House rankings, Jordan declined
from a rank of 4 in 2001 (partly free) on a scale of 1 to 7 (1 being
most free) to a rank of 6 (not free) in 2010. Corruption has also
become a major issue in the country in the last few years. From 2003
to 2007, the Jordanian Center for Strategic Studies asked citizens in
its annual poll to rate their priorities for the country. Over the four
year period, they consistently ranked corruption among their top
priorities; it came in a close second to poverty and unemployment.

"
IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028626.txt,"U.S. oil production has reached its highest level in two decades, while imports have fallen dramatically. A system built to
import oil and deliver it to coastal refineries has become ill-equipped to handle rising production in Texas, North Dakota and
Canada's Alberta province.

All of the pipes are pointed in the wrong direction, says Harold York, an oil researcher at Wood Mackenzie. We are turning
the last 70 years of oil-industry history in North America on its head, and we are turning it on its head in the next 10 to 15
years.

With oil prices persistently above $100 a barrel, companies drilling new wells don't want to forgo revenue while they wait
years for new pipelines. That leaves them with trucks, trains and barges to move an increasing amount of crude.

Oil delivered to refineries by trucks grew 38% from 2011 to 2012, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration,
while crude on barges grew 53% and rail deliveries quadrupled. Although alternatives are growing rapidly, pipelines and
oceangoing tankers remain the primary method for delivering crude to refineries.

In the Eagle Ford, a large four-year-old South Texas oil field, production has grown to more than 500,000 barrels a day, from
less than 1,000 in 2009, according to state statistics. Getting that torrent out of the sparsely populated region has required
modifications to the oil-delivery system.

For example, last year NuStar reversed a 16-inch pipeline built to carry crude imported from Africa and Europe northward
from the Port of Corpus Christi. Now, the pipeline flows south, taking delivery from hundreds of trucks that fill up at individual
wells. Some of the 175,000 barrels a day moving through the pipe is loaded onto barges at Corpus Christi and towed toward
refineries near Houston.

Earlier this year, Phillips 66 began putting some of this crude on ships for a 2,200-mile journey around Florida to its refinery
in Linden, N.J.

The heavy trucks moving Eagle Ford crude are causing headaches for residents and local officials, ripping up roads and
causing traffic tie-ups.

These are rural roads built for 10 cars an hour, and now it's 100 vehicles an hour, and 75 of them are 80,000-pound trucks,”
says Tom Voelkel, president of Dupre Logistics LLC. The Lafayette, La., company started hauling crude in Eagle Ford in
November 2011 and has more than 100 drivers full time in the region.

The Texas Legislature appropriated $450 million this year to repair and improve roads in oil-producing counties. It doesn't
even begin to reach where it needs to reach, says Daryl Fowler, the chief elected county official in Cuero, Texas, about a

hundred miles southeast of San Antonio.

We've seen a fourfold increase in congestion around here, he says. The roads are crumbling.

So again, we didn't get to depose him as an expert in

this matter. We didn't know that he was going to be called as

an expert. They're saying he's a lay opinion because he's a
private investigator, your Honor. The case law says otherwise.
He's been certified as an expert in these exact kind of cases.

We put those in our brief. So your Honor, he is really a wolf
in sheep's clothing. They're trying to put him on as a lay
opinion when he's really an expert witness in this case with

sufficient and sophisticated knowledge, that the jury will

recognize him as someone who has expertise in this area so,
your Honor, we believe he should be precluded from testifying.

He has no personal knowledge, it's simply his reliance, as we

understand it, on the one FOIA response letter.

So your Honor, with respect to the FOIA response

letter that's at issue that they are going to try to get into

hearsay document. It's highly prejudicial under 403. They say

that it meets self-authentication, but unlike the documents

that we showed, for example the 302 that have the seal on it,
it has none of those qualifications.

They cite to two cases, the Zamara case and the Gary

records that were produced by the government, not a FOIA

letter. So what they're trying to produce is a letter that

when that nation was still a Soviet Socialist Republic. Here he compares the dissidents
who brought down the Iron Curtain to the dissidents who are sounding the alarm about
rapid advances in artificial intelligence. He locates the roots of the current AI
dissidence, paradoxically, among such pioneers of the AI field as Wiener, Alan Turing,
and I. J. Good.

Jaan’s preoccupation is with existential risk, AI being among the most extreme of
many. In 2012, he co-founded the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk—an
interdisciplinary research institute that works to mitigate risks “associated with
emerging technologies and human activity” —at the University of Cambridge, along with
Philosopher Huw Price and Martin Rees, the Astronomer Royal.

He once described himself to me as “a convinced consequentialist” —convinced
enough to have given away much of his entrepreneurial wealth to the Future of Life
Institute (of which he is a co-founder), the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, and
other such organizations working on risk reduction. Max Tegmark has written about
him: “Tf you’re an intelligent life-form reading this text millions of years from now and
marveling at how life is flourishing, you may owe your existence to Jaan.”

On a recent visit to London, Jaan and I participated on an AI panel for the
Serpentine Gallery’s Marathon at London’s City Hall, under the aegis of Hans Ulrich
Obrist (another contributor to this volume). This being the art world, there was a
glamorous dinner party that night in a mansion filled with London’s beautiful people—
artists, fashion models, oligarchs, stars of stage and screen. After working the room in
his unaffected manner (“Hi, I’m Jaan”), he suddenly said, “Time for hip-hop dancing,”
dropped to the floor on one hand, and began demonstrating his spectacular moves to the
bemused A-listers. Then off he went into the dance-club subculture, which is apparently
how he ends every evening when he’s on the road. Who knew?

real concern” for Snowden that he targeted lists of the NSA’s penetrations in China. This
expansion of the whistle-blowing concept to adversaries was echoed by Russian President
Vladimir Putin. He complimented Snowden for having “uncovered illegal acts by the United
States around the globe,” Putin’s view implies a convenient global concept of whistle-blowing
that justified breaking US laws.

Even so, this whistle-blower interpretation of Snowden’s act has had immense international
resonance in the media. The Washington Post and Britain's Guardian, the newspapers that
initially published the purloined documents, won the 2014 Pulitzer Prize. The journalists, who
assisted Snowden in this enterprise, including Greenwald and Poitras, were awarded the 2014
Polk Award for national-security reporting. Former Congressman Ron Paul organized a clemency
petition in February for Snowden, stating: Thanks to one man's courageous actions, Americans
know about the truly egregious ways their government is spying on them, and his son, Senator
Rand Paul, who was a candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination in 2016, calling for a
Presidential pardon for Snowden.

Senator Paul’s concern fitted with the growing public apprehension over increasing intrusion
on its privacy. Snowden was correct, in my opinion, in describing the threat of a surveillance
state and the loss of privacy is certainly a legitimate public concern. “We actually buy cell phones
that are the equivalent of a network microphone that we carry around in our pockets voluntarily,”
he pointed out from Moscow.

Snowden is correct that the technology involved in the electronic equipment we all use in the
21* century has made mass surveillance part of our daily life. There can be little doubt that our
privacy has been largely eroded, if not entirely negated, by the widespread use of cell phones,
credit cards, social media and the search engines of the Internet. When we use smart phones, as
most Americans do today, our location is relayed to our telephone service provider every three
seconds. The phone companies collect and archive our phone usage “metadata,” which includes
whom we called and how long we spoke. When we use Google to search for anyone or anything
on the Internet, that activity is captured by Google, a company whose profits mainly come from
making available to advertisers the results of its surveillance and collection of its users’ searches.
When we use Gmail, the Google’s email service used by nearly one-billion senders and recipients,
we agree to allow Google to read the actual contents of our correspondence to find keywords in
them of interest to advertisers. When we use a credit card, the credit card company also retains
data about what we buy and where we go. When we travel in automobiles equipped with GPS,
every turn and stop is tracked and recorded. And when we are in public places with CCTV
cameras, our image is recorded and archived. When we use Facebook, Twitter, and other so-
called social media, as over two billion people do today, we allow these companies to collect,
retain and exploit its surveillance of our movements, associations with other people, and stated
preferences. When we use Amazon and other on-line stores, we allow them to track and archive
a great deal of our commercial activity. For Internet companies, such as Facebook, Twitter,

not such thing—defraud or deceive the PTL Partners! That was the last day the Texas
firm worked as part of our legal team.

We waited several months for the decision. Finally, it was released. The Court of Appeals ruled
that the conviction was valid but the 45 year sentence was not. In vacating the sentence, the
court established a powerful precedent against a judge using his own religious beliefs as a factor
in determining the degree of punishment. This is what they said about the role of religion in
sentencing:

Courts have held that sentences imposed on the basis of impermissible considerations,
such as a defendant's race or national origin, violate due process. [W]e believe that similar
principles apply when a judge impermissibly takes his own religious characteristics into
account in sentencing.

Courts... cannot sanction sentencing procedures that create the perception of the bench as
a pulpit from which judges announce their personal sense of religiosity and simultaneously
punish defendants for offending it. Whether or not the trial judge has a religion is
irrelevant for purposes of sentencing. Regrettably, we are left with the apprehension that
the imposition of a lengthy prison term here may have reflected the fact that the court's
own sense of religious propriety had somehow been betrayed.

The court vacated the sentence “with genuine reluctance” because they believed Bakker was
indeed guilty:

Yet, the fact remains that this case involves the explicit intrusion of personal religious
principles as the basis of a sentencing decision. [O]ur review of the sentencing transcript
reveals comments that are, in the end, too intemperate to be ignored. Because an
impermissible consideration was injected into the sentencing process, we must remand the
case [to a] different district judge to ensure that the ends of due process are achieved.

This was precisely the result we asked for: resentencing by a judge other that Maximum Bob,
who surely would have imposed the same sentence without referring to his religion. The new
judge eventually reduced the sentence to 8 years and Bakker was released after serving 4.5
years—quite a reduction from the 45 years originally imposed by Maximum Bob.

Following our victory in the Jim Bakker sentencing appeal, Tammy Faye Bakker declared the
judicial ruling “a great victory for Christianity.” I responded that “the fact that a Jewish lawyer
helped bring that about must show that it was a great victory for all Americans.” The New York
Times reported further on her reaction to our victory.

Tammy Faye Bakker says Mr. Dershowitz has singlehandedly restored her faith in
lawyers. Jim and J are really sold on him and think he's the greatest, she said. He
certainly is worthy of every penny he makes. (In fact, his bill was $20,000, contributed
largely by the Bakkers' backers.)

evolved for different purposes. As languages differ in their construction
they co-opt different bits of the brain. It is possible to see this using brain
imaging.

Dyslexics - and I am one — have difficulty in translating between
the realm of conceptual thought and written script. This translation is
subtly different for each language. Chinese speakers use their motor
cortex to process characters. Young children write out the characters
over and over, to memorize them, so the ‘muscle’ memory is highly
involved. French and Spanish children use the audio pathways, as most
of their language is phonetic, the motor part of writing is then an add-
on and does not process meaning. English children must use portions
of their visual cortex to process the meaning of words, as many words
have spelling quirks that have nothing to do with the sound of the words.
Some studies even suggest a child dyslexic in one language, because, for
example, their audio pathway is impaired, might not suffer the condition
in another language that relied on a visual or motor skill.

Can Objects Communicate?

The process of communication has many components, starting with
something capable of communicating. Communication usually -
perhaps always — is something that occurs between sentient beings. I
don't think of my computer as communicating with me, but rather think
of it as a medium for communication or a dumb machine. But colloquial
language around the subject is a little muddled. We all agree a lighthouse
does not communicate, even though it can signal danger, but what do
we mean when we say, “That song really spoke to me.” No one believes
the song is actually communicating, but some kind of communication
was made nonetheless. When we talk of communication do we mean the
agent or the message?

Stories

Humans enjoy communicating; we create works of art, music and
literature that transcend simple analysis. The COIN dynamic slide,
which we saw earlier detailing the strategic situation in Afghanistan,
would probably have been better communicated with a story. Humans,
unlike computers, do not cope well with large quantities of unrelated
information, and studies of memory and comprehension show we

REMEMBERING CAVALIER MAGAZINE 
]; Mrisman02 
1 
LAUNCHING A MAGAZINE 
My friend Michael Simmons, who has been the editor of National Lampoon and High 
Times, observes that cavalier hired fine scribes. A few examples: Thomas Pynchon, Philip Roth, 
William Saroyman, Isaac Asimov, Theodore Sturgeon. Cavalier was launched by Fawcett 
Publications in 1952. 
Men's magazine Cavalier (motto: For the American Male) was published the year 
before Playboy to whom it has often been compared, and back in the day tried to be seen as 
slightly hipper, more youthful and considered a bit more clever than its big name rival. Almost 
an anti-establishment Playboy. A slogan stated: Your dad bought Playboy, you 
bought Cavalier. 
I BECAME A COLUMNIST 
I was invited to write a column, named The Naked Emperor, for Cavalier, that was beginning 
to publish underground writers and artists. They paid me $1,000 a month. My first column was a 
report on an auction of two-inch squares from the hotel bedsheets slept on by the Beatles during 
their first trip to America. 
There were 300 screaming young girls, off on a fetishist's holiday. Obviously, there wouldn't be 
enough items to go around, but it was announced that the Beatles' unwashed towels and bed 
linens were to be cut into two-inch squares and sold for $1 each. The price included a notarized 
statement of authenticity. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024923 
My second column was about Lenny Bruce___titled Lenny the Lawyer, since he defended 
himself in trials He was arrested for obscene performances only because there were no blasphemy 
laws. I went to the bank and deposited my check, withdrawing half of it in cash, a $500 bill. 
Lenny was alone in his hotel room on Christmas Day when I presented it to him. And, with a 
large safety pin, Lenny attached the $500 bill to the outside breast pocket of his denim dungaree 
j acket. 
AFTER JFK ASSASSINATION 
In another column of mine, Jack Ruby and His Dirty Little Secret, it began, Lenny Bruce 
told me how all the night club comics used to Jack Ruby's tattoo of a lady's schmutzik (translate: 
pussy) in his armpit. If it wasn't a fact, I was quite willing to settle for an apocryphal allusion 
which nevertheless crystallized the entire personality of that alleged murderer who wanted so 
very much to be liked. 
I say alleged because upon Ruby's own death. Dallas District Attorney Henry Wade said he 
would dismiss the murder charge against him, a promise which has since been kept, although no 
such posthumous grace was ever officially bestowed on Lee Harvey Oswald. See, they grant you 
retroactive innocence only in the face of innumerable witnesses who were present at the actual 
event through the miracle of inadvertent televised coverage. 
Now Jack Ruby's dirty little secret has been forever sealed away in his armpit by the hymen of 
history. Oh yeah, and at Lenny's funeral, that safety pin was still attached on his jacket. 
JULES SIEGEL 
Two years before Lenny's death, with his permission I published his obituary in my own 
magazine, The Realist. Before the issue went to press, he called his mother and a few others to 
let them know it would only be a hoax. The point was that he couldn't get work and his work was 
his life so he might as well be dead. And if people regretted that they hadn't helped him, well, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024924 
now they could have a second chance because he was still alive. The obituary evoked inquiries 
from newspapers, wire services, foreign publications, radio and TV. 
What's the meaning of it? one editor asked me. There's a lot of excitement at the city 
desk. 
That is the meaning of it. 
A few years later, without my permission, Jules Siegel, the editor of a short-lived 
magazine, Cheetah, published a fake obituary of me. I thought it was funny. An Associated Press 
reporter called, and I explained that it was a hoax. 
Are you sure? he asked. 
Of course. I would tell you if I was dead. 
Siegel started writing for cavalier. His first assignment was a profile of Sterling Hayden, an actor 
best known in Dr, Stranglove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb. 
Journalist Adam Ellsworth described Siegel's Goodbye Surfing, Hello God with his most 
famous example of rock journalism, but his most revolutionary was his article, The Big Beat. 
It appeared in the Playboy-esque Cavalier magazine in 1965 and was one of the earliest writings 
he'd ever seen on the development of rock and roll, from slaves singing in chains on their way to 
America to Bob Dylan going electric at the Newport Folk Festival. 
Then Jules' friend, Arthur Kretchmer, became Cavalier's managing editor. When the editorial 
director later resigned, Kretchmer said, there was a 24-hour hiatus before the new editor 
arrived. Siegel and Kretchmer had been discussing the possibility of publishing an issue on rock 
and roll, so to make it happen, Kretchmer went into the office at night and retyped the magazine's 
schedule to include their ideas. 
When the new editorial started, Kretchmer handed him the schedules and said, Here's what 
we're working on. The new editorial director suspected nothing and the rock and roll issue went 
ahead. Once the laughter died down, Jules talked for a good 25 minutes about 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024925 
some of the ups and downs of his writing career and how hard it is to make a 
living as any kind of a writer, let alone a rock journalist. and the people who 
created it, seriously. 
Now everybody writes about rock and roll that way. Jules was one of the 
people who did it first. Goodbye Surfing, Hello God! is Jules's most famous 
example of rock journalism, but I think his most revolutionary is his article 
The Big Beat. It appeared in the Playboy-esque Cavalier magazine in 1965 
and is one of the earliest writings I've ever seen on the development of rock 
and roll, from slaves singing in chains on their way to America to Bob Dylan 
going electric at the Newport Folk Festival. 
Jules Siegel died of a heart attack on November 17, 2012 at the age of 77. 
He was a brilliant author, but neither Rolling Stone nor the New York 
Times honored him with an obituary. Not even a fake one. 
COMIC STRIPS 
Art Spiegelman tells me his work at Cavalier 50 years ago: 
I was first invited into the mag to do two full-color comix pages in 1969 (when being printed in color 
was a Very Big Deal for me as was Getting Paid more than 25 bucks for a drawing), somehow in 
proximity to a big article on underground comix. It was around the time Vaughn Bode was made a 
regular contributor to the magazine, They were running some Crumb Fritz the Cat pages. All thanx 
to their hip, laid back and kind editor, Alan LeMond. 
I also did some gag cartoons, short strips and occasional illustrations for Cavalier (one especially 
bad drawing for a story by Bruce Jay Friedman, I recall). My work in 1969, as an apprentice 
underground cartoonist taking too many drugs was really, really awful so I'm grateful for the editor's 
hip and laid-back kindness. But, hey, I was proud to be in a mag that published pieces by Pynchon, 
Manny Farber and you.

By the time I'd gotten incrementally better as a cartoonist in the first half of the 1970s I was regularly 
doing illustrations for soft-core fiction stories in Cavalier's low-rent sister 
mags, Dude, Gent and Nugget (even wrote a story or two there and got several of my San Francisco 
comix cronies (Spain Rodriguez, Bill Griffith and Justin Greene) illustration gigs with Alan for those 
mags as well.

[Note in Wikipedia: Maus is a graphic novel by American cartoonist Art Spiegelman, 
serialized from 1980 to 1991. It depicts Spiegelman interviewing his father about his experiences 
as a Polish Jew and Holocaust survivor. The work employs postmodemist techniques and 
represents Jews as mice, Germans as cats, and Poles as pigs. In 1992, Maus won a Pulitzer Prize.] 
COMIING AND GOING 
I wrote some movie reviews for Cavalier. I recall that Midnight Cowboy was 50 years ago. I 
always went to two screenings. The first one I would go stoned with magic mushrooms. The 
second one I took notes. However, I got fired by Cavalier. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024927 
They declined to publish a particular column--my review of MASH as though it were a Busby 
Berkeley musical called Gook Killers of 1970-- ostensibly on the grounds of bad taste, but I 
learned that three wholesalers had told the publisher they were pressured by the FBI and would 
refuse to distribute Cavalier if my name appeared in it. 
On top of that, my name was on a list of sixty-five radical campus speakers, released by the 
House Internal Security Committee. The blacklist was published in the New York Times, and 
picked up by newspapers across the country. It might have been a coincidence, but my campus-
speaking engagement-bookings stopped abruptly. It felt just like a film. 
OH, WELL 
It was over for me, but it had been fun___like the issue with only the one large red headline 
on the Cavalier cover: BEAT 'EM SENSELESS FIRST___THE FREE SPEECH 
CONTROVERSY, BY PAUL KRASSNER . . . Ironically, I wrote, it is this concept of the 
total education experience on campus which I believe to be the basic significance of the much-
misunderstood free-speech imbroglio at the University of California in Berkeley. 
The sit-in lasted till 3 a.m. Next day, October 1, 1964, ten tables were manned again, and 
a campus policeman approached one of the tables (manned by the Congress of Racial Equality) 
where a dozen persons were seated. One was singled out and placed under arrest. But before you 
could say nonviolent demonstration, the police car was surrounded, its captors reaching as many 
as 3,000 students. During the late evening, bored fraternity men gathered and tossed lighted 
cigarettes and eggs on those sitting in the plaza. The demonstrators responded with silence. 
Next day, 450 police assembled on campus to remove the cop car and its arrested inhabitant, 
but an agreement to negotiate was reached and the demonstrators dispersed. One of the folk songs 
to come out of the Free Speech Movement incidentally, was If I Negotiate With You, to the tune 
of the Beatles' If IFell in Love With You. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024928 
Over the next couple of months there was a series of sit-ins and attempted negotiations, and 
then, on December 2, the infamous Sproul Hall sit-in. It took twelve hours for 800 students to be 
arrested by some 600 instructors of a new course called Introductory Police Brutality. These were 
from the lab notes student took. 
There was a freshman co-ed at Berkeley who___long after she had forgotten what some 
professor spouted during an official lecture about Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment___would 
remember, with perhaps a twinge of frightened pride, learning from a fellow demonstrator that if 
she planned to go limp when the police arrested her, it would be an act of practical feminine 
foresight to remove the earrings from her pierced lobes in advance. 
So, now in 2019, fighting over free speech has been happening heavily at Berkeley campus again. 
Meanwhile, Trump grabbed a pussy on the Statue of Liberty. Cavalier, anyone?

Fiscal Year 2014 Budget issued
On April 10 th , President Obama issued his Fiscal Year 2014 budget. Shortly thereafter, the Treasury
Department issued its “Green Book,” which explains the tax provisions in the budget. Although most of
these provisions are familiar and have appeared in previous budgets, a few were new. Here is a selected
overview of some of these provisions, most of which would apply (assuming Congress enacts them) as of
2014:
• Limit the value of certain tax benefits. As in previous budgets, the current budget proposes to limit
the value of various tax benefits so that they only reduce or shelter income that would be taxed at 28%
or less. In other words, taxpayers with income that would be taxed at the 33%, 35% or 39.6% rate
would see tax benefits curtailed, including ALL itemized deductions (these include deductions for
mortgage interest, charitable contributions and state and local taxes), tax-exempt municipal bond
interest, employer and employee contributions to employer-sponsored health insurance, employee
contributions to retirement plans such as 401(k)s, contributions to health savings accounts and Archer
medical savings accounts, interest on education loans and certain higher education expenses. Because
an affected taxpayer’s pre-tax contribution to her retirement account would be taxed, the account’s
“basis” would be increased accordingly.
Comments. This proposal is not new, but the basis adjustment for retirement accounts is an equitable
provision that was previously missing. Also, because the proposal would apply to income that is taxed
at 33%, 35% or 39.6%, it would increase taxes on some of those President Obama has previously
pledged to insulate from higher taxes – namely, individuals with income under $200,000 or married
couples filing jointly with income under $250,000. That is, in 2013, the 33% tax rate applies to taxable
income in excess of $183,250 (single taxpayers), $203,150 (head of household) and $223,050 (married
filing jointly).
• The “Buffett Rule.” To limit the advantage that high-income taxpayers enjoy from the preferential low
rates on dividends and long-term capital gains, the budget proposes the “Fair Share Tax” (FST), a new
minimum tax designed to ensure that taxpayers pay at least 30% on their adjusted gross income (AGI)
(a credit for charitable contributions would be allowed). Translated, this means that if the taxpayer’s
“regular” taxes (including certain credits, the alternative minimum tax and the new 3.8% surtax on net
investment income) and payroll taxes didn’t reach 30%, the FST would make up the difference. The
FST would be phased in starting at $1 million of AGI, and would be fully phased in at $2 million of AGI
(these thresholds would be indexed for inflation as of 2015).
Comments. Taxpayers who already pay an aggregate 30% in regular and payroll taxes would not be
subject to the FST – but those who chiefly have income from qualified dividends and long-term capital
gains (and therefore have lower than a 30% effective rate) would see a significant tax increase.
• Restore the 2009 transfer tax parameters. Beginning in 2018, the transfer tax provisions that were in
effect in 2009 would be restored. The top transfer tax rate would thus be 45% instead of 40%; the
estate tax exclusion and generation-skipping transfer tax (GST) exemption would be $3.5 million, and
the gift tax exclusion would be $1 million (these amounts would not be indexed for inflation). In
computing gift or estate tax liability with respect to these reduced exclusions, taxpayers would not be
affected by “clawback.” That is, they wouldn’t be subject to additional tax if they had taken advantage of
the previous (higher) exclusion amounts (in 2013, the applicable exclusion amount (AEA) against gift
and estate tax is $5.25 million, and is indexed for inflation; the GST exemption equals the AEA).
“Portability,” which allows a surviving spouse to effectively “inherit” the deceased spouse’s unused AEA,
would continue.
Comments. Despite President Obama’s urging to the contrary, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of
2012 (ATRA), enacted on January 2, 2013, made permanent most of the transfer tax provisions that
were in effect in 2011 and 2012: a $5 million exclusion amount, indexed for inflation, against gift and
estate taxes and GST, and portability. (ATRA increased the top transfer tax rate from 35% to 40%.) In
other words, Congress just “permanently” stabilized transfer taxes, and is probably not eager to revisit
them anytime soon. Yet the budget proposes relitigating the issue, and reverting to the 2009 regime –
but not until 2018. Perhaps this is more protest than blueprint.
• Require consistent basis for transfer tax and income tax. The basis of inherited property would
have to equal the property’s estate tax value, and the basis of property received by lifetime gift would
have to equal the donor’s basis. Although these are, in fact, generally the current rules, the proposal
would require executors of estates and donors of lifetime gifts to report the property’s value and basis to
both the recipient and the IRS.
• Require a minimum term for Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts (GRATs). To limit the effectiveness
of GRATs, which are designed to pass potential appreciation at little or no gift-tax “cost, GRATs would
be required to have: 1) a minimum term of 10 years and a maximum term of the annuitant’s life
expectancy plus 10 years; 2) at least some gift at the trust’s creation (i.e., no more “zeroed-out” GRATs);
and 3) no declining annuity during the trust’s term.
• Limit the duration of the GST exemption. A trust that is protected from generation-skipping transfer
tax would lose that protection after 90 years, when GST would again apply to the trust.
• Coordinate income and transfer tax rules regarding grantor trusts. The grantor of a “grantor trust”
is responsible for paying the trust’s income taxes. Such trusts are often includible in the grantor’s estate
(as in a “revocable trust” or a GRAT). A trust that is not includible in the grantor’s estate but for which
the grantor is responsible for paying the income taxes is a “defective” grantor trust. Transactions
between the grantor and his grantor trust are not recognized for income tax purposes, so that if, for
example, the grantor sells appreciated property to a defective grantor trust in exchange for an interest-
Tax Topics 04/29/13 2
bearing note – known as a “sale to a defective grantor trust” – the sale does not trigger capital gains
taxes and the grantor is not taxable on the trust’s interest payments to him. Such transactions can pass
significant potential appreciation to the grantor’s heirs free of gift tax and generation-skipping transfer
tax.
To eliminate this planning technique, the proposal provides that if the deemed income tax owner of a
trust (this could be the grantor or a beneficiary) “engages in a transaction with that trust that constitutes
a sale, exchange, or comparable transaction,” then the portion of the trust attributable to this transaction
(along with income or appreciation on the property): 1) would be includible in the deemed owner’s
estate; 2) would be subject to gift tax if the deemed owner ceased to own the trust during life; and 3)
would be treated as a gift from the deemed owner if, during the owner’s life, distributions were made
from the trust to another person. Any gift or estate tax triggered by the proposal would be payable from
the trust. The proposal would not apply to trusts that are already includible in the grantor’s estate, “rabbi
trusts” (non-qualified deferred compensation plans that are subject to claims of the grantor’s creditors) or
trusts that are grantor trusts solely because the trust’s income can be used to pay insurance premiums
on the life of the grantor or the grantor’s spouse (i.e., insurance trusts that are designed to remove
insurance proceeds from an insured’s estate).
Comments. Last year was the first appearance of this proposal to unify income and transfer tax rules
for grantor trusts. It was so broadly worded that it would have caught existing trusts, such as insurance
trusts. This new iteration simply targets sales to defective grantor trusts.
• Extend the lien on estate tax deferrals. The tax law allows the estate tax on certain closely held
business interests to be deferred for up to 15+ years from the decedent’s death. Another provision of
the tax law imposes what is generally a ten-year lien on the estate’s assets to ensure payment of the
estate tax. Because that lien can expire before the estate tax is paid, it may be difficult for the IRS to
collect those tax dollars. The proposal would extend the lien through the permitted deferral period.
• Clarify the GST treatment of “HEETs.” Donors can make direct payments of tuition and medical
expenses free of gift tax. If that donor is a grandparent, for example, such payments are also free of
generation-skipping transfer tax. Specifically, the tax law provides that the GST will not apply to “any
transfer which, if made inter vivos by an individual [i.e., during the donor’s life], would not be treated as a
taxable gift” because it is a direct payment for tuition or medical expenses. This language has been
read to mean the following: GST will not apply to a trust’s direct payments for, say, a grandchildbeneficiary’s
tuition or medical expenses, even though the trust is otherwise subject to GST.
Some planners have taken this understanding a step further with “HEETs,” or Health and Education
Exclusion Trusts. These trusts purportedly are fully protected from GST, despite not having any GST
exemption allocated to them. That is, because charity has an ongoing “substantial” income interest in
the HEET (say, 10%), gifts into the trust are not subject to GST, and GST won’t apply when one
generational level of beneficiaries dies off. In addition, trust distributions on behalf of beneficiaries such
as grandchildren can only be made for tuition or medical expenses, and are therefore GST-exempt. The
proposal says that it would “clarify” that this GST exclusion for direct payments of tuition or medical
expenses only applies to payments made by a living donor, and not from a trust. The proposal would
apply to trusts created after the bill proposing this change is introduced in Congress, and to transfers
after that date made to pre-existing trusts.
Comments. The desire to clarify this special exclusion reflects the perception that HEETs are
abusive, given the proposal’s recommended effective date (introduction, rather than enactment, of
legislation). Despite this perception, however, it is worth noting that trusts that typically take advantage
Tax Topics 04/29/13 3
of direct payments for tuition and medical expenses are subject to GST but for this special exclusion.
Also, although HEETs have been written about in planning publications, it is unclear how often they are
actually implemented: donors who use their GST exemption for multi-generational trusts often feel that
they’ve done “enough” for those lower generations, and may lack the charitable intent necessary for the
HEET to work. In addition, given life’s uncertainties, trust creators may be reluctant to limit trust
distributions to tuition and medical expenses only.
• Tax “carried” (profits) interests as ordinary income. In exchange for their services on behalf of
hedge funds and private equity funds, managers of these entities are often compensated with what are
called “carried interests,” or profits from the entity. Because these profits interests are structured as
partnership interests, they pass through long-term capital gain to the partners/managers, and are
therefore taxed at preferential rates. The proposal would not recharacterize the treatment of a partner’s
investment in the entity, but would tax as ordinary income what is viewed as compensation for the
partner’s investment management services for the partnership. Thus, a partner’s share of income in an
“investment services partnership interest” (ISPI), regardless of how the income is characterized at the
partnership level, would be taxed as ordinary income, and would also be subject to self-employment tax.
An ISPI is an interest in future profits of an “investment partnership”; an investment partnership is one in
which substantially all of the entity’s assets are investment-type assets, such as certain securities, real
estate, interests in partnerships, commodities, cash or cash equivalents, or derivative contracts related
to those assets.
• Tighten up conservation easements. Donors of conservation easements typically get a charitable
deduction for the permanent restrictions they put on property that will be used exclusively for
conservation purposes. Recent court decisions have upheld large deductions for easements preserving
recreational amenities, including golf courses, surrounded by upscale homes. These contributions have
raised concerns that the deductions claimed are excessive and seem to promote private interests rather
than bona fide conservation activities. The proposal would prohibit a deduction for a conservation
easement on a golf course. A second proposal would address historic preservation easements, and
would disallow a deduction for restricting the “upward development” of an historic building, since such
development is typically already restricted under local ordinances. In addition, conservation easements
on buildings listed in the National Register would need to comply with the same (more stringent) rules
applicable to buildings in a registered historic district.
• Limit protracted payout for non-spouse beneficiaries of IRAs and retirement plans. Under current
law, a non-spouse beneficiary of an IRA or a retirement plan (such as a 401(k)) must begin taking
“required minimum distributions” (RMDs) from the account the year after the account owner’s death, but
can spread those distributions out over her life expectancy. Thus, if widowed Mom names Child as
beneficiary of her IRA, for example, and Child is 40 when Mom dies, Child’s RMDs can last over 40
years, assuming those are the only distributions Child takes from the account. The proposal would
change this rule, and in general would require that non-spouse beneficiaries withdraw the balance of the
retirement account within five years after the owner’s death. (Certain exceptions would apply for
“eligible” beneficiaries, such as those who are disabled, chronically ill or a child under the age of
majority.) The reason for the proposed change is that retirement accounts were intended to benefit
owners and their spouses, and not heirs such as children and grandchildren.
Comments. It is not surprising to see this proposal, as last year, something similar was in a highway
bill, but was then pulled. Given the need for revenue, limiting the generous protracted payouts currently
permitted for non-spouse beneficiaries seems like low-hanging fruit. If enacted, the proposal would
potentially make it less attractive for owners of substantial traditional IRAs to convert that IRA into a Roth
Tax Topics 04/29/13 4
IRA, so as to provide, say, children and grandchildren with long-term income-tax free annuities.
Nevertheless, even if those beneficiaries had to take the balance of the Roth IRA within five years of the
owner's death, they still would be receiving income-tax free dollars – something that would not be the
case if they had simply “inherited” a traditional IRA with its built-in income tax liability. In other words, by
converting a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA, the owner is accomplishing something akin to what happens
with a defective grantor trust (see above): relieving the beneficiaries of an income tax liability they would
otherwise have to pay.
• Limit the size of retirement benefits. Under current law, there are limits as to how much individuals
can accrue under a defined benefit plan (such as a pension plan), or how much they can contribute to
IRAs and various defined contribution plans, such as 401(k)s. There are no limits, however, as to how
much individuals can accumulate in these tax-preferred accounts. Because of this, the proposal
explains, individuals can accumulate more than is needed to fund “reasonable levels of consumption in
retirement…well beyond the level of accumulation that justifies tax-advantaged treatment of retirement
savings accounts.” The proposal would therefore cap the size of a taxpayer’s various retirement
accounts by barring additional contributions (or accruals) if, in total, the accounts exceeded what was
necessary to provide the maximum annuity permitted for a defined benefit plan: currently $205,000 per
year for a hypothetical 62 year-old and her spouse (this equates to accumulations of about $3.4 million).
When a taxpayer’s accounts hit that ceiling, they could still grow through investment returns, but
additions to the accounts would only be allowed if the maximum permitted annuity increased, or the
taxpayer’s investment returns for a given year were less than the actuarial assumptions underlying the
annuity. If an addition put a taxpayer’s accounts over the ceiling, the taxpayer would include that excess
in income, and have a grace period to withdraw it; if the taxpayer did not withdraw the excess, then that
amount and attributable earnings would be subject to income tax when distributed, even if the
distribution was from a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k).
Comments. This new proposal seems to be a reaction to this fall's presidential elections and the
significant retirement accounts of one of the contenders. Nevertheless, it is not an excise tax to whittle
down significant accounts, but a prohibition on additional contributions (or accruals). As Treasury
Secretary Lew has pointed out, we’re not saying you can’t save for retirement, we’re just saying that
such large amounts shouldn’t be tax-preferred. Still, will Congress really be inclined to limit how much
taxpayers can accumulate in their retirement accounts, especially when a rising interest rate
environment would make the permitted accumulation smaller? Although anything is possible,
particularly if tax reform really comes about, Congressional sentiment might be against what could be
viewed as “penalizing” successful savers.
• Replace Consumer Price Index (CPI) with Chained CPI. Every year, the IRS issues inflation-adjusted
numbers for a variety of provisions, such as the income thresholds for the individual income tax rate
brackets, personal exemptions, and income thresholds and phase-out ranges for various deductions,
exclusions and tax credits. The proposal states that the CPI overstates the effects of inflation because it
doesn’t fully reflect consumer reaction to price changes (as in, if prices go up, consumers will buy
something cheaper). A “chained” CPI would “account more fully for this substitution effect” and better
reflect changes in the cost of living. The proposal would take effect as of 2015.
Comments. Just as the proposal to limit tax benefits for income that would be taxed at higher than 28%
would raise taxes on some of those President Obama has previously pledged to protect (see above), a
chained CPI would also raise taxes for everyone, in that tax brackets (and other tax benefits, such as
personal exemptions) would increase more slowly. Similarly, a chained CPI would reduce cost-of-living
increases for Social Security recipients – again something that would affect those the President has
pledged to protect. Although this proposal represents an attempt at balance, Republicans and
Democrats generally seem to dislike it, but for different reasons.
Tax Topics 04/29/13 5
Legislative prospects? Where these proposals go may be a function of what happens with possible tax
reform – and the prospects of that are…unknown. Rep. Dave Camp (R-MI), Chairman of the House Ways &
Means Committee has been holding hearings, and issuing a number of legislative proposals that are
designed to elicit comments and prod tax reform. Sen. Max Baucus (D-MT), Chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee, has also been pursuing tax reform, but has recently announced his retirement. Does
that put him in a better or worse position to achieve this goal? Time will tell. But trying to reconcile the
Republican desire for lower rates and a broader tax base with the Democratic desire for higher taxes on
those they feel can best afford them will not be easy. Considering the country’s pressing fiscal needs,
however, it’s hard to imagine that tax revenues won’t have to go up at some point. The question is how, and
whose ox gets gored.

Friends for three decades, Trump whisperer says he is
‘stunned’ by president’s rhetoric

Billionaire Thomas J. Barrack Jr. has done what few others in Trump’s orbit have
done: He told the president, in effect, that he was wrong. In my opinion, he’s better
than this,” Barrack said.

Trump’s relationship with Barrack is one of the most important, if little understood, of
the president’s life, offering a case study of what it takes to remain close to him in a
time of such turmoil.

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016262.txt,"WHAT CAN WE DO?
Daniel C. Dennett

Daniel C. Dennett is University Professor and Austin B. Fletcher Professor of
Philosophy and director of the Center for Cognitive Studies at Tufts University. He is the
author of a dozen books, including Consciousness Explained and, most recently, From
Bacteria to Bach and Back: The Evolution of Minds.

Many have reflected on the irony of reading a great book when you are too young to
appreciate it. Consigning a classic to the a/ready read stack and thereby insulating
yourself against any further influence while gleaning only a few ill-understood ideas from
it is a recipe for neglect that is seldom benign. This struck me with particular force when
I reread Zhe Human Use of Human Beings more than sixty years after my juvenile
encounter. We should all make it a regular practice to reread books from our youth,
where we are apt to discover clear previews of some of our own later “discoveries” and
“inventions,” along with a wealth of insights to which we were bound to be impervious
until our minds had been torn and tattered, exercised and enlarged by confrontations with
life’s problems.

Writing at a time when vacuum tubes were still the primary electronic building
blocks and there were only a few actual computers in operation, Norbert Wiener
imagined the future we now contend with in impressive detail and with few clear
mistakes. Alan Turing’s famous 1950 article “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,”
in the philosophy journal Mind, foresaw the development of AI, and so did Wiener, but
Wiener saw farther and deeper, recognizing that AI would not just imitate—and
replace—human beings in many intelligent activities but change human beings in the
process.

We are but whirlpools in a river of ever-flowing water. We are not stuff that abides, but
patterns that perpetuate themselves. (p. 96)

When that was written, it could be comfortably dismissed as yet another bit of
Heraclitean overstatement. Yeah, yeah, you can never step in the same river twice. But
it contains the seeds of the revolution in outlook. Today we know how to think about
complex adaptive systems, strange attractors, extended minds, and homeostasis, a change
in perspective that promises to erase the “explanatory gap”® between mind and
mechanism, spirit and matter, a gap that is still ardently defended by latter-day Cartesians
who cannot bear the thought that we—we ourse/ves—are self-perpetuating patterns of
information-bearing matter, not “stuff that abides.” Those patterns are remarkably
resilient and self-restoring but at the same time protean, opportunistic, selfish exploiters
of whatever new is available to harness in their quest for perpetuation. And here is where
things get dicey, as Wiener recognized. When attractive opportunities abound, we are apt
to be willing to pay a little and accept some small, even trivial, cost-of-doing-business for
access to new powers. And pretty soon we become so dependent on our new tools that
we lose the ability to thrive without them. Options become obligatory.

354-61 (1983).

On confronting dogma, I of course agree — though in my opinion the secular religions — nationalist fanaticism, etc. —

But I don't see why that should extend to ridicule. That includes astrologists. Astronomers can refute astrology, while 
recognizing that perfectly honest and deluded people may believe it and should be treated with respect, while their 
beliefs are confronted with evidence. I also don't see why we should ridicule religious dogma, just as I don't think we 
should ridicule the much more pernicious secular dogmas. Rather, we should respond to irrational belief with 
argument and evidence, while recognizing that their advocates (like most of the intellectual world in the case of 
secular dogma) are people who we should be responding to but without ridiculing them. It may be hard 
sometimes. For example, when the icon and founding father of sober non-sentimental Realism in International Affairs 
informs us that the US, unlike other countries, has a transcendental purpose, and the fact that it constantly acts in 
contradiction to its purpose doesn't matter because the facts are just abuse of history while real history is the 
evidence of history as our minds reflect it, then it's hard to avoid ridicule. But we should. There's no point ridiculing

However, new evidence developed by the Department of Justice on other offenses not covered by the
agreement, including allegations by additional victims who come forward, could lead to new charges.
There is no statute of limitations in the federal sex-trafficking law, which was also enacted by the state of
Florida in 2002. Because his predatory habits stretch back many years and involved dozens of young-
looking girls, there may well be more evidence to uncover. (Several young women who claim to be
Epstein victims have recently contacted a Ft. Lauderdale lawyer, but to date no new civil complaints
have been filed.)

* Conchita Sarnoff: The Billionaire Pedphile's Sex Den

* Billionaire Pedophile Goes Free

These new developments come one week after the publication of two articles in The Daily Beast about
Epstein’s pattern of sexual contact with underage girls, which Palm Beach police began investigating in
2005 and the U.S. Attorney’s office then settled in a 2007 plea deal. The first article quoted a deposition
by then-Palm Beach Chief of Police Michael Reiter, in which he stated that Epstein, a billionaire with
many powerful friends, had received special treatment in both his plea deal and the terms of his
incarceration. Although federal investigators at one point produced a draft 53-page indictment against
Epstein, he was eventually allowed to plead guilty to only two relatively minor state charges and receive
a short term of incarceration: 13 months in the county jail, during which he went to the office every day,
and one year of community control, during which he traveled frequently to New York and his private
island in the Virgin Islands.

The Daily Beast has now discovered another instance in which Epstein apparently received special
consideration: As a convicted sex offender, he is required by law to undergo an impartial psychological
evaluation prior to sentencing and to receive psychiatric treatment during and after incarceration. This is
because child molesters tend to be repeat offenders with high rates of recidivism. According to a source
in law enforcement, however, Epstein was allowed to submit a report by his private psychologist, Dr.
Stephen Alexander of Palm Beach, Florida, whose phone has since been disconnected with no
forwarding information.

The Daily Beast’s second article provided details about Epstein’s systematic abuse of underage girls at
his Palm Beach mansion, where members of his staff allegedly recruited and paid a parade of teenagers,
most of them 16 or younger, to perform daily massages that devolved into masturbation, groping, and
sometimes full-blown sexual contact. It also revealed a monetary relationship between Epstein and Jean
Luc Brunel, a frequent visitor to whom he gave $1 million around the same time that Brunel was starting
his MC2 modeling agency. Some of the young girls MC2 recruited from overseas—often from Eastern
Europe and South America—are known to have been passengers on Epstein’s private jets.

The U.S. Attorney General’s Office in Florida says that it is against policy to confirm or deny the
existence of an investigation. Jeffrey Epstein’s lawyer, Jack Goldberger, says he has no knowledge of an
ongoing probe, and he told The Daily Beast, Jeffrey Epstein has fully complied with all state and federal
requirements that arise from the prior proceedings in Palm Beach. There are no pending civil lawsuits.
There are not and should not be any pending criminal investigations, given Mr. Epstein’s complete
fulfillment of all the terms of his non-prosecution agreement with the federal government.

Conchita Sarnoff has developed multimedia communication programs for Fortune 500 companies and
has produced three current-events debate TV programs, The Americas Forum, From Beirut to Kabul, and
a segment for The Oppenheimer Report. She is writing a book about child trafficking in America.

depend on the willingness of the military to allow an open political
process to take place.

The Syrian government’s response to the Arab world’s turbulent
spring, by contrast, has been both violent and vacillating. Its initial
response was to characterize the protests across the country as the
result of a global conspiracy fomented by a clutch of unlikely allies,
including the US, Israel, and Arab enemies in Lebanon, Saudi Arabia,
and Qatar, working with former regime officials and homegrown
Salafists, or fundamentalists. Then President Assad tried to defuse the
opposition by receiving protest delegations and announcing the
lifting of long-standing emergency laws, apparently acknowledging
the existence of legitimate grievances. But this proved no more than a
gesture. In effect the government’s response has been contradictory to
the point of incoherence: as the Brussels-based International Crisis
Group points out in a report released on May 3:

The regime has lifted the emergency law but has since allowed the
security services to conduct business as usual, thereby illustrating just
how meaningless the concept of legality was in the first place. It
authorises demonstrations even as it claims they no longer are
justified and then labels them as treasonous. It speaks of reforming
the media and, in the same breath, dismisses those who stray from the
official line. It insists on ignoring the most outrageous symbols of
corruption. Finally, and although it has engaged in numerous bilateral
talks with local representatives, it resists convening a national
dialogue, which might represent the last, slim chance for a peaceful
way forward.

Over seven hundred people have been killed so far, more than a
hundred of them in the southwestern city of Deraa, near the Jordanian
border, where the Omari mosque—a center of resistance—has been
closed to worshipers after being shelled by tanks and taken over by
snipers. Some ten thousand people are now said to have been

aid tell him you’re 18 because if you’re not, he won’t let you in his house.
So I said I was 18. As I was giving him a massage, he was like how old are you.
And then I was like 18. But I kind of said it really fast because I didn’t want to make

it sound like I was lying or anything. EM at 38-39.

Thus, consistent with the guidance provided in Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978), the
search warrant affidavit in this case reveals knowing and reckless falsehoods and omitted material
information. This is precisely the type the United States Supreme Court sought to guard against.

The age of the alleged victims, and of Mr. Epstein’s intent in that regard, is an element of the
crimes that must be proven in order to sustain a conviction. In particular, § 2422(b) requires that the
defendant specifically intended to target a minor. See, e.g., United States v. Murrell, 368 F.3d 1286
qi Cir. 2004) (“[T]o prove an attempt the government must first prove that [defendant], using the
internet, acted with a specific intent to persuade, induce, entice, or coerce a minor to engage in
unlawful sex.”) (Emphasis added). Section 2422(b) expressly requires that the crime be committed
“knowingly,” and that requisite mental element applies as to each element of the crime. United
States v. XCitement Video, Inc., 513 U.S. 64, 68-69 (1994); United States v. Meek, 366 F.3d 705,
718 (9 Cir. 2004); United States v. Root, 296 F.3d 1222, 1227 (11™ Cir. 2002); United States v.
Bailey, 228 F.3d 637, 638-639 (6 Cir. 2000). How, then, could the USAO “plausibly argue” that a
misrepresentation about an element of the crime could be viewed as “not material”? If the elements
of the alleged crime are not met, there is no probable cause to sustain the search warrant in the first
instance. If the elements are not met, there is no federal crime. That is material.

Moreover, it is clear from the plaint text of the statute that the statutorily proscribed act
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §2422(b) is the actual use of a facility of interstate commerce to persuade,
entice, induce, or coerce. “The underlying criminal conduct Congress expressly proscribed in passing
§2422(b) is the persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion of the minor rather than the sex act
itself. That is, ifa person persuaded a minor to engage in sexual conduct (e.g., with himself or a third
party) without then committing any sex act himself, he would nevertheless violate §2422(b).” United
States v. Murrell, 368 F.3d 1283, 1286 (11 Cir. 2004). See also, United States v. Bailey, 228 F.3d
637, 639 (6 Cir. 2000) (“Congress has made a clear choice to criminalize persuasion and the
attempt to persuade, not the performance of the sexual acts themselves.”). Thus, if there has been
sexual misconduct (which we deny) without the requisite persuasion, there is no violation of this
federal law.

The investigation and testimony in this case makes clear that Mr. Epstein did not use any
facility of interstate commerce to commit any act forbidden by 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b)—to persuade,
induce, entice, coerce—nor did he direct any of his assistants to do so. Indeed, by way of example,

as Clear on this point at her deposition during which she repeatedly testified that
nobody—not Mr. Epstein or any of his assistants—ever used the Internet or phone in any way to try
to persuade her to engage in sexual activity with Mr. Epstein ME (deposition) at 31-32.
Nonetheless, even assuming, arguendo, that persuasion to engage in sexual conduct occurred over

support for those who have actually helped to keep the peace and
have the potential to go on doing so. The opprobrium attached to
ignoring or dismissing the goal of global zero has no influence on the
Irans and North Koreas, but it does have an influence on us. It makes
it easy, for example, for reflexively anti-nuclear voices in the
Congress and the Obama administration (some have migrated from
the former to the latter) to oppose even modest updating of our
nuclear weapons and to make technical improvements taboo.
Thoughtful proponents of global zero should admit that this is
dangerous nonsense. They should, at a minimum, campaign with
equal vigor for the modernization of our existing, shrinking nuclear
arsenal.

Unfortunately, fixing on zero as the urgent issue before us obscures
the real challenge: keeping nuclear weapons out of the hands of
countries or organizations that might use them offensively. Seen from
this viewpoint, the two most decisive acts against the proliferation of
nuclear weapons were the Israeli attacks on Iraq’s weapons program
in 1981 and Syria’s in 2008. The 1981 attack was widely, if
hypocritically, condemned. The destruction of the Syrian facility was
downplayed on all sides; and while the US had opposed it, it had the
good sense to keep quiet after the fact.

There is much that we can do to slow the proliferation of nuclear
weapons. Tougher sanctions against the Iranian regime, especially if
they produced nationwide shortages of fuel for automobiles and made
it more difficult to obtain outside technology, money, and expertise,
would be a good place to start. How about sanctions to be applied to
any individual who assists nuclear proliferators? Or serious sanctions
against companies—and their executives—who provide material
support? The more effective they became, the louder the message to
others who might be tempted to seek weapons of their own. Why did
the “international community,” which passes endless motions against

success. can you imagine the attacks if wages went up , but the blacks and hispanics 
were still without work. He needs to be given TIME . the first play has worked. 
he believes in a winning game strategy, you can't judge it because he hasn't scored a 
touchdown from way in his own backfield. ( ball given to him by obama on his own 10 
yard line ) he has moved the ball way up the field. and the dems can see the 
touchdown coming. yes there have been some fumbles along the way, no question. and 
some have been taken off the field. but the horror and the dems faces is they see the 
team has progressed in spite of all the yellow flags and cries of foul. There ( sic 
) defense is maxine waters and nancy pelosi ) donalds offense is pompeo mattis and 
kelly. they don't have to like the quarterback they just have to win,

Mr. John Roth
June 19, 2008
Page 5

A full and fair review of the facts here is critical to this analysis. Yet, it is clear that CEOS
did not conduct such a review. In his recent letter to Jay Lefkowitz, First Assistant United States
Attorney (“FAUSA”) Jeffrey Sloman confirmed our understanding that the USAO was to have
“facilitated” an “independent de novo review of the investigation” by the Department. (May 19,
2008 Sloman letter at p. 5). Yet, the CEOS review was not complete, and by its own terms not de
novo.

As CEOS itself noted, “our review of this case is limited both factually and legally. We have
not looked at the entire universe of facts in this case. It is not the role of the Criminal Division to
conduct a complete factual inquiry from scratch.” (CEOS letter at p. 1). Indeed, entire subject areas
relevant to the inquiry were not considered at all by CEOS. In essence, CEOS was only in a position
to make the most cursory possible review, an “abuse of discretion” review, without considering the
facts at the necessary level of detail, and without taking into account the many and varied issues of
misconduct we have raised in this case. As the CEOS letter indicates, “we did not review the facts,
circumstances, or terms included in the plea offer nor any allegations that individuals involved in the
investigation engaged in misconduct.” (CEOS letter at p. 2). All of this begs the question — if it is
not CEOS’ role to “conduct a complete factual inquiry,” and CEOS did not consider any of the
allegations of misconduct here, which at the very least have created a strong appearance of
impropriety, and, at worst evidence an intent and effort to unfairly prejudice Mr. Epstein to the
financial benefit of the friends and colleagues of the prosecution team in the USAO, then where and
when can justice ever hope to be served in this case? This is a prosecution burden that cannot, and
should not, be brushed aside.

We contend the limited nature of the CEOS review deeply affected its conclusions. For
example, CEOS most likely did not review original documents, such as transcripts, and instead relied
on the summaries of federal prosecutors and FBI agents, against whom we have raised serious
concerns regarding misconduct. If the summary memos from the USAO are as flawed as other
USAO communications have been, and which we have been able to show are misleading and
inaccurate, the CEOS abuse of discretion review is likely flawed as well. Moreover, although the
USAO expected, and personally promised to us, an independent review, FAUSA Sloman’s letter also
makes clear that our pivotal legal challenge to the use of 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b) had already “been
previously raised and thoroughly considered and rejected by .. . CEOS prior to” the recent CEOS
review. (May 19, 2008 Sloman letter at p. 5). The fact that CEOS had to evaluate its own decision
with respect to some of the allegations against Mr. Epstein prevents its subsequent review and
opinion from being truly independent.

Following this most recent CEOS review “limited both factually and legally,” and with no
citation to any case law relative to the statutes in question, CEOS concludes merely, “federal
prosecution in this case would not be improper or inappropriate (CEOS letter at p. 5);” in essence,
that the United States Attorney could bring this case in the exercise of his federal discretion should
he so choose (“we conclude that U.S. Attorney Acosta could properly use his discretion to authorize |
prosecution in this case.”). (CEOS letter at p. 2). However, CEOS drew the conclusion that the |

While real estate allocations account for a small

significant relative growth in allocations, particularly

Home market real estate is attractive for liability

The increase in home market allocations is mirrored
in sovereign appetite for income-generating real

increased allocations shown in figure 18), matching
home currency-denominated liabilities at higher yields
than domestic fixed income. Consequently, the tilt to
real estate in home markets is substantially funded
from lower allocations to fixed income (figure 19).
Home market allocations also benefited from the

particularly in respect of greenfield or residential

greatest among Western and Asian sovereigns (4.9%
and 3.1% of assets respectively), due to the depth
of high-quality domestic real estate markets. Home

there was a view that proximity facilitated oversight

not only born from what looks like Franklin Scandal compromises, but it is this contract that seems
intent on implementing bioterrorism as the new form of explosive terrorism.

(Note that both members of this family were awarded BILLION dollar contracts; that's quite
exceptional, no?)

As for terrorism as an US industry, it's hardly better seen than through the following which is
information of course we all know:

We note that in-between Bush #41's 9/11/1990 speech(with Dick Cheney as his Secretary of
Defense) and the 9/11/2001 attack on the WTC were little more than Clinton's 8 years in the White
House. We look also to The American Deep State by Peter Dale Scott for evidence of ties between
the actions of the Clinton administration and (1) the 1993 attack on the WTC and (2) the 1998 attack
on the US embassy in Nairobi, Kenya which demonstrate that the Clinton administration in no
uncertain terms sponsored terrorism:

(Writes Scott) The homicidal crime suggested by Fenton's meticulous research is one both difficult
and painful to contemplate. It has to be considered in the light of the earlier instances of protection
we have surveyed:

1. the protection given to Salameh and Abouhalima in the 1990 Kahane murder, leaving them free to
participate in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing;

2. the failure for two or three years to process Ali Mohamed's documents seized in 1990, which could
have prevented the 1993 World Trade Center bombing;

3. the release of Ali Mohamed from Royal Canadian Mounted Police detention in 1993, leaving him
free to participate in the 1998 Nairobi Embassy bombing;

4. the treatment of Ali Mohamed as an unindicted coconspirator in the 1993 WTC bombing case
and Landmarks case, leaving him free to participate in the 1998 Nairobi Embassy bombing.

(pp. 76-77, The American Deep State)

Scott had earlier examined these attacks in especial connection to the September 11, 2001 attack
on the WTC:

(Writes Scott) For indeed it is certain that on various occasions U.S. agencies have intervened,
letting al-Qaeda terrorists proceed with their plots. This alarming statement will be dismissed by
some as conspiracy theory. Yet in this chapter, | will show that this claim doesn't to arise from

the wrong side in Tunisia. But the president’s instinct to save
Benghazi and to oust Ivory Coast’s usurper was right.

Sarkozy has intuited three things. First, the democratization of the
Arab world is the most important European strategic challenge of the
decade. Second, it was time “to take the training wheels off,” in the
words of Constanze Stelzenmiiller of the German Marshall Fund, and
have Europe rather than an overextended America lead in Libya.
Third, the U.N. cannot always be an umbrella that folds when it rains.
If its “responsibility to protect” means anything, it must be when an
Arab tyrant promises to slaughter his people.

We stand at a high point in French postwar diplomacy and a nadir in
German. There were strong arguments on either side of a Libyan
intervention, but with a massacre looming in Benghazi, Germany had
to stand with its allies. Angela Merkel has proved herself more a
maneuverer than a leader. Germany often conveys the sense that it
now resents the agents of its postwar rehabilitation — the European
Union and NATO.

I don’t think Germany believes its future lies with the BRIC
countries, as the U.N. Libya vote suggested. I do think Germany has
entered a new era of ambivalence and nationalist calculation.

That means several things. European integration is on hold, and as
long it’s on hold the future of the euro is at risk. The German-French
alliance will remain under strain. Obama should look to Sarkozy, not
Merkel, for strategic support.

A last thought. This restless French leader is at his best with his back
to the wall. He’s shown that. The same quality means it would be
foolish to count him out next year.

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031919.txt,"All nations have ideological divisions, but the Palestinians are
divided over the fundamental question of the Palestinian nation's
identity. Fatah sees itself as part of a secular Arab world that is on the
defensive. Hamas envisions the Palestinian nation as an Islamic state
forming in the context of a region-wide Islamist rising. Neither is in a
position to speak authoritatively for the Palestinian people, and the
things that divide them cut to the heart of the nation. As important,
each has a different view of its future relations with Israel. Fatah has
accepted, in practice, the idea of Israel's permanence as a state and
the need of the Palestinians to accommodate themselves to the reality.
Hamas has rejected it.

The U.N. decision raises the stakes in this debate within the
Palestinian nation that could lead to intense conflict. As vicious as
the battle between Hamas and Fatah has been, an uneasy truce has
existed over recent years. Now, there could emerge an internationally
legitimized state, and control of that state will matter more than ever
before. Whoever controls the state defines what the Palestinians are,
and it becomes increasingly difficult to suspend the argument for a
temporary truce. Rather than settling anything, or putting Israel on
the defensive, the vote will compel a Palestinian crisis.

Fatah has an advantage in any vote on Palestinian statehood: It enjoys
far more international support than Hamas does. Europeans and
Americans see it as friendly to their interests and less hostile to Israel.
The Saudis and others may distrust Fatah from past conflicts, but in
the end they fear radical Islamists and Iran and so require American
support at a time when the Americans have tired of playing in what
some Americans call the sandbox. However reluctantly, while
aiding Hamas, the Saudis are more comfortable with Fatah. And of
course, the embattled Arabist regimes, whatever tactical shifts there
may have been, spring from the same soil as Fatah. While Fatah is the
preferred Palestinian partner for many, Hamas can also use that

The Vietnam War

During the height of the conflict over the Vietnam War, I represented numerous defendants,
protestors and civil disobedients. I also advised lawyers who were suing the government in an
effort to stop what they believe was an illegal war. The faculty of Harvard Law School was
divided over the morality, legality and effectiveness of the war, and there were interesting
discussions in the faculty lunch room involving such luminaries as Archibald Cox, Erwin
Griswold, Abram Chayes and Paul Freund. I decided that these discussions should be shared with
our students, and so I organized the first law school class on the Vietnam War. The debate over
the war was a teaching moment and we had to take advantage of it. I prepared a set of legal
materials and invited professors with different views to share their perspectives with the students.
The course was a remarkable success. Students attended in droves, and the media covered the
lectures. The New York Times story was headlined “400 Enroll in a Harvard Course on ‘Law
and the Lawyer’ in the Vietnam War.” It reported that:

According to Prof. Alan M. Dershowitz, who conceived the course, more than a dozen
professors have volunteered as teachers, including Prof. Derek C. Bok, the dean-designate
of the law school.

Professor Dershowitz said that the participating professors “reflect every view.”

However, he said that he “majority,” including himself, were signers of a statement
released last week in which 500 of the nation’s law teachers called upon the legal
profession to oppose the Johnson Administration’s Vietnam war policy.

Professor Dershowitz said he understood that the course would be the first of its kind
offered in any law school in the United States. “It is our hope,” he said, “that this will be a
pilot and a model for other law schools throughout the country.”

Dr. Dershowitz said that the idea for the course grew out of the fact that “much student
and faculty energy was being devoted to thinking about and writing about Vietnam, and
the legal issues growing out of it.”

He said the course would not be “biased or political,” but would “look at these issues in a
detached, lawyer-like, scholarly way.”...

Mr. Dershowitz, whose specialty is criminal law, said he became involved in planning the
course because “I’m very interested in legal education, and terribly concerned about law
schools being at the center of contemporary issues.”

“Can you imagine a law school which is supposed to be dealing with the major issues of
the day not teaching a course relating in some manner to the Vietnam War, which is the
critical social issue of our time?”

As evidence of the courses appeal, Professor Dershowitz said that the 400 registrations
represented the largest enrollment for any course at the school, which has about 1,500
students.

15. I visited and traveled with Jeffrey Epstein from 1999
through the summer of 2002, and during that time I stayed
with him for sexual activities at each of his houses (or man-
sions) in locations including New York City, New York; the
area of Santa Fe, New Mexico; Palm Beach, Florida; an
island in the U.S. Virgin Islands; and Paris, France. I had sex
with him often in these places and also with the various peo-
ple he demanded that I have sex with. Epstein paid me for
many of these sexual encounters. Looking back, I realize that
my only purposes for Epstein, Maxwell, and their friends
was to be used for sex.

16. To illustrate my connection to these places, I include
four photographs taken of me in New Mexico [see insert page 3
for one of the photographs mentioned]. The first one is a
museum in Santa Fe, New Mexico. We had gone sightseeing for
the day. Epstein took this picture of me. I was approximately 17
at the time, judging from the looks of it. At the end of the day
we returned to Epstein’s Zorro Ranch. The second picture is me
on one of Epstein’s horses on the ranch in New Mexico. The
following two are from wintertime in New Mexico. —

17. When I was with him, Epstein had sex with underage
girls on a daily basis. His interest in this kind of sex was
obvious to the people around him. The activities were so
obvious and bold that anyone spending any significant time
at one of Epstein’s residences would have clearly been aware
of what was going on.

18. Epstein’s code word for sexual encounters was that it
was a “massage.” At times the interaction between Epstein
and the girls would start in the massage room setting, but it
was always a sexual encounter and never just a massage.

Prior to the Initial Listing, if KUE proposes to issue for cash any Units or securities convertible into Units,
then KUE is required to offer to each Investor that is an accredited investor (as such term is defined in
Regulation D) or is otherwise legally eligible to participate in the offering the right to purchase a pro rata
portion of such securities. This purchase right does not apply to (i) the first 1.5 miilion Units (including
such number of Units issued at the first closing of this offering) issued by KUE to Investors through March
31, 2007, (ii) any public offering of Units or other securities by KUE; (ii} any issuance of Units in
connection with a merger, consolidation, transfer of assets or other business combination involving KUE
{or its subsidiaries or joint ventures); {iv) any issuance of Units pursuant to any unit option plan, restricted
unit plan or other benefit plan, the terms of which are approved by the General Partner, provided that the
aggregate amount cf all Units issued pursuant to this clause (iv) (which does not include any Profits
Participation LP Units) shall not exceed 10% of all Units outstanding on a fully diluted basis on the date of
such issuance without the approval of the Independent Committee and shall in no event exceed 20% of
all Units outstanding on a fully diluted basis on the date of such issuance; (v) any issuance of Units in
connection with any loan transaction and/or equipment lease, the terms of which are approved by the
General Partner; (vi) any issuance of Units pursuant to any transactions, the terms of which are approved
by the General Partner primarily for the purpose of (a) joint veniures or strategic alliances, (b)
development, production or distribution of the products or services of KUE, its subsidiaries or joint
ventures, (c} purchase or licensing of technology, or (d) any other transactions that are primarily for
purposes other than raising capital, or (vii) any issuance of Units upon conversion or exercise of any Units
issued in compliance with this co-invest right provision; or (viii) any issuance of Units in connection with
Unit splits or Unit dividends or reclassifications.

Prior to the initial Listing, Investors have substantially equivalent rights with respect to issuances of
securities by the General Partner (with the additional exemption on the issuance of up to 10,000
additional Class B Shares to the Principals or any of their Affiliates).

14.19. Tag-Along Right

A “Tag-Along Transfer” means a sale or other transfer for economic value of the Common LP Units held
by KUE LLC and its affiliates (and, unless otherwise approved by the Board of Directors and the
Independent Committee of the General Partner, a corresponding percentage of Class A Shares held by
KUE LLC) to a Person that is not KUE LLC or an affiliate (KUE LLC Entity”).

Unless an Initial Listing occurred, a Tag-Along Transfer may not be consummated unless the proposed
purchaser offers to each Investor the opportunity fo include a pro rata portion of such Investor’s Units in
the Tag-Along Transfer (at the same consideration per Unit received by the KUE LLC Entity}. If the total
number of Units and corresponding Class A Shares proposed to be sold to the proposed purchaser
exceeds the number of Units and corresponding Class A Shares which the proposed purchaser is willing
to purchase, the number of Units and corresponding Class A Shares to be sold will be reduced pro rata
based on the total number of Units held by the transferor{s} initiating the Tag-Along Transfer and each
participating Investor.

Following the Initial Listing, the tag-along right will continue for certain Investors with respect to transfers
for value of the Units (or units of the listed entity as the case may be) by the Principals or their affiliates to
non-affiliates (excluding transfers on a recognized international securities exchange) above the following

the source of that honest belief was? Identify any
source that attributed to Virginia Roberts the
statement that Bill Clinton was with her at an orgy
on Jeffrey's island.

A. We can provide you about, | think, 20
newspaper articles and blogs which certainly raise
the implication that Bill Clinton had improperly
participated in sexual activities on the island
either as an observer or as a participant. The
issue was raised on Sean Hannity's program. The
headlines in various British media had suggested
that.

It's my belief that Virginia Roberts
intended to convey that impression when she was
trying to sell her story to various media, which she
successfully sold her story to in Britain, that she
wanted to keep that open as a possibility.

And then when I firmly declared, based on
my research, that Bill Clinton had almost certainly
never been on that island, she then made a firm
statement that she -- which was a -- which was a
perjurious statement, a firm perjurious statement
saying that although Bill Clinton had been with her
on the island and had had dinner with her, the
perjurious statement was that Bill Clinton had been

Clinton on orgy island, things of that kind. I
would be happy to provide them for you. I don't
have them on the top of my head.

Q. There's a big difference between saying
that Bill Clinton was on Jeffrey's island and saying
that Bill Clinton was at an orgy on Jeffrey's
island, isn't there?

MR. SCOTT: Objection --
BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. Do you recognize a distinction between
those statements?

MR. SCOTT: Form.

A. I don't think that distinction was clearly
drawn by the media.

BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. I'm asking whether you recognize the
distinction?

A. Oh, I-- I certainly recognize a
distinction.

Q. Oh, so --

A. Let me finish. I certainly recognize a
distinction between Bill Clinton being on the
island, which I believe she perjuriously put in her
affidavit, and Bill Clinton participating actively
in an orgy. [also think it's a continuum.

on the istand with her.

The lie was that she described in great
detail a dinner with Bill Clinton and two underaged
Russian women who were offered to Bill Clinton for
sex but that Bill Clinton tumed down.

So she then put in her affidavit that
although -- perjuriously, although she had seen Bill
Clinton on that island, she then stated that she had
not had sex with Bill Clinton. To my knowledge,
that was -- to my knowledge at least, that was the
first time she stated that -- that she not had sex
with Bill Clinton, She had certainly implied, or at
least some of the media had inferred from her
statements that she may very well have observed Bill
Clinton in a sexually compromising position.

So, when | made that statement to Don
Lemon, I had a firm belief, based on reading
newspaper accounts and blogs, that it was true.

Q. Can you identify a single newspaper that
attributed to Virginia Roberts the statement that
Bill Clinton was with her at an orgy on Jeffrey's
island?

A. I think there -- I don't have them in my
head right now. But I do recall reading headlines
that talked about things like, sex slave places

And there is the possibility, which I
don't personally believe to be true, that he was on
the island. There was the possibility, which I
don't believe to be true, that he was on the island
when orgies were taking place. There was the
possibility that he was on the island and observed
an orgy, and there was the possibility that he was
on the island and participated in an orgy.

Newspapers picked up those stories. I'l
give you an example of a newspaper that actually
said that that she had placed or that ] was on the
island and -- that I participated in an orgy along
with Stephen Hawkings [sic.], the famous physicist
from Cambridge University, that was a newspaper
published in the Virgin Islands, which falsely
claimed that I was at an orgy with Stephen Hawkings.

So, many newspapers were suggesting,
implying, and I inferred from reading those
newspapers that that's what she had said to the
media.

If I was wrong about that based on
subsequent information, | apologize. But 1
certainly, at the time I said it, believed it and
made the statement in good faith in the belief that
it was an honest statement.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013021.txt,"5.4 Interpretation and Application of the Integrative Diagram 105

something the integrative diagram doesn’t touch at all. This brings us again to the network of
ideas we’ve discussed under the name of cognitive synergy, to be discussed later on.

It might be possible to make something similar to the integrative diagram on the level of
dynamics rather than structures, complementing the structural integrative diagram given here;
but this would seem significantly more challenging, because we lack a standard set of tools for
depicting system dynamics. Most cognitive theorists and AGI architects describe their structural
ideas using boxes-and-lines diagrams of some sort, but there is no standard method for depicting
complex system dynamics. So to make a dynamical analogue to the integrative diagram, via
a similar integrative methodology, one would first need to create appropriate diagrammatic
formalizations of the dynamics of the various cognitive theories being integrated — a fascinating
but onerous task.

When we first set out to make an integrated cognitive architecture diagram, via combining
the complementary insights of various cognitive science and AGI theorists, we weren’t sure how
well it would work. But now we feel the experiment was generally a success — the resultant
integrated architecture seems sensible and coherent, and reasonably complete. It doesn’t come
close to telling you everything you need to know to understand or implement a human-like
mind — but it tells you the various processes and structures you need to deal with, and which of
their interrelations are most critical. And, perhaps just as importantly, it gives a concrete way
of understanding the insights of a specific but fairly diverse set of cognitive science and AGI
theorists as complementary rather than contradictory. In a CogPrime context, it provides a
way of tying in the specific structures and dynamics involved in CogPrime, with a more generic
portrayal of the structures and dynamics of human-like intelligence.

Obama aides knew of possible White House tie to  
Cartagena scandal  
As nearly two dozen Secret Service agents and members of the military were 
punished or fired following a 2012 prostitution scandal in Colombia, Obama 
administration officials repeatedly denied that anyone from the White House was 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028880 
involved. 
But new details drawn from government documents and interviews show that senior 
White House aides were given information at the time suggesting that a prostitute was 
an overnight guest in the hotel room of a presidential advance-team member — yet 
that information was never thoroughly investigated or publicly acknowledged.

lines when the General Theory was published, reconstructed them back to 1870 for
the U.S. economy. Piketty and Zucman incorporate this research and others. They
have acted as editors only. As a layman, I would hardly be qualified to find and
interpret original sources. Even most economists might lack that specialty. I simply
trust Picketty and Zucman. They will have compounded misreadings and editors’
bias in those sources by adding their own, and I will have added mine. They and I
have plenty. Editing is bias by definition. But we can’t do without it. We manage as

best we can.

To make sure, I also test Mill’s idea on stock market data from the same nations and
periods. Here my source was the Global Financial Data website marketed by
Bloomberg. Market cap corresponds to capital, dividend yield to consumption and
total return to output. Charts and tables show free growth as essentially all of

growth in stock markets too.

Now try a first look at the charts and tables. The lollipop-shaped Greek letter @
(phi) is something | call the free growth index. It reads 1 in years when growth is
explained as Mill described, 0 in years when belt-tightening was the explanation,
and something in between when there was both. The free growth index will be
explained in chapters 4 and 5. The charts can be messy, and the data jumps around.
There are spikes, both up and down, which tend to disappear in the charts which
screen out small absolute values of the denominator (capital acceleration). But the
free growth index clearly jumps around 1, not zero, both before or after the
screening. It is as often above 1 as below. That means that growth is as likely to
coincide with belt-loosening as belt-tightening. My free website

FreeGrowth&OtherSurprises.org shows how everything was calculated.

Economists will not be as surprised as they might have been a century ago. Growth

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016276.txt,"THE UNITY OF INTELLIGENCE
Frank Wilczek

Frank Wilczek is Herman Feshbach Professor of Physics at MIT, recipient of the 2004
Nobel Prize in physics, and the author of A Beautiful Question: Finding Nature’s Deep
Design.

I. A Simple Answer to Contentious Questions:

e Can an artificial intelligence be conscious?

e Can an artificial intelligence be creative?

e Can an artificial intelligence be evil?
Those questions are often posed today, both in popular media and in scientifically
informed debates. But the discussions never seem to converge. Here I’ll begin by
answering them as follows:

Based on physiological psychology, neurobiology, and physics, it would be very
surprising if the answers were not Yes, Yes, and Yes. The reason is simple, yet
profound: Evidence from those fields makes it overwhelmingly likely that there is no
sharp divide between natural and artificial intelligence.

In his 1994 book of that title, the renowned biologist Francis Crick proposed an
“astonishing hypothesis”: that mind emerges from matter. He famously claimed that
mind, in all its aspects, 1s “no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells
and their associated molecules.”

The “astonishing hypothesis” is in fact the foundation of modern neuroscience.
People try to understand how minds work by understanding how brains function; and
they try to understand how brains function by studying how information is encoded in
electrical and chemical signals, transformed by physical processes, and used to control
behavior. In that scientific endeavor, they make no allowance for extraphysical behavior.
So far, in thousands of exquisite experiments, that strategy has never failed. It has never
proved necessary to allow for the influence of consciousness or creativity unmoored from
brain activity to explain any observed fact of psychophysics or neurobiology. No one has
ever stumbled upon a power of mind which is separate from conventional physical events
in biological organisms. While there are many things we do not understand about brains,
and about minds, the “astonishing hypothesis” has held intact.

If we broaden our view beyond neurobiology to consider the whole range of
scientific experimentation, the case becomes still more compelling. In modern physics,
the foci of interest are often extremely delicate phenomena. To investigate them,
experimenters must take many precautions against contamination by “noise.” They often
find it necessary to construct elaborate shielding against stray electric and magnetic
fields; to compensate for tiny vibrations due to micro-earthquakes or passing cars; to
work at extremely low temperatures and in high vacuum, and so forth. But there’s a
notable exception: They have never found it necessary to make allowances for what
people nearby (or, for that matter, far away) are thinking. No “thought waves,” separate
from known physical processes yet capable of influencing physical events, seem to exist.

That conclusion, taken at face value, erases the distinction between natural and
artificial intelligence. It implies that if we were to duplicate, or accurately simulate, the
physical processes occurring in a brain—as, in principle, we can—and wire up its input

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014028.txt,"developer and enterprise administrator for a large financial institution in Atlanta, Georgia. Part of my job
is supporting the large complex document captures systems that I help build. Due to the importance of
these systems I am expected to be reachable 24/7/365. That is good for job security, but can be bad for
my family life. I have four beautiful children and I strive to be a true “hands-on” dad who is present in
my family’s daily lives. So armed with your book and a fresh (ocean air) perspective, I set out to put
many of the 4HWW principles into practice.

First, I worked on changing my e-mail habits. I took a hard look at my inbox and used several of the
techniques outlined in the 4HWW to eliminate all the waste and noise. I formed new habits around
batching my e-mail sessions and it didn’t take long to achieve a zero inbox using the “trusted trio” folder
method. I also applied the less is more philosophy to composing my e-mails. I went to great lengths to
ensure I am as clear and concise as possible. Only communicating exactly what is needed to the right
audience and not to the world. By eliminating all the noise and fat from my e-mail diet it became much

29

more clear what “actions” or “to-do’s” were important.

Meetings and conference calls were the next area of attack. I scrutinized each meeting invite and
began declining requests left and right. Most of the time I would claim I had too much going on to
attend. I started asking for the minutes of the meeting or for someone to IM me if they had a specific
question I needed to answer. When I do attend a meeting it is almost always via a conference call. Due
to conference room restrictions and geographic challenges in our company most of our meetings are
done virtually anyway.

Less wasted time meant more time to focus on work and tasks that really mattered. I felt like I was
doing less but getting more things done and with better results. The right people were starting to notice
and the perception of my ability to get the job done had never been better. I was making my management
look good, and when that happens they stop asking questions or micromanaging daily activities. I kept
proving to them I can do it without interference. Now was the time to make the push for what I really
wanted and that was to go virtual!

Going virtual was actually very easy. I had a solid foundation with my manager and others in the
chain of command. Almost all of my daily work was already remote-ready. At home, I have a great
dedicated office in our finished basement. It is situated well away from the rest of the house and is
mostly free of distractions. I have my own bathroom with shower and I even have a mini-fridge and
microwave. I dare say that my home office rivals the amenities of the top executives at my company.
Most of all, I have a wife and family that totally understand and respect the rules I set for myself to
continue this success.

At first, I worked one or two days a week from home, but it didn’t take long before I found myself
working four out of five days a week from home. When the Southeast was hit by the gas shortage and
the price of gas nationwide was cresting $4 a gallon, the company made working from home even more
accepted and official. I became an overnight model for others to follow. As people around me were in a
panic as to how to get to work when no gas could be found, I was happily working away at home just
business as usual.

At this point, things were working better than I ever expected. Using my 4HWW skills I now had
more time to be that hands-on dad I wanted to be. I became a regular up at the elementary school. I eat
lunch in the cafeteria with my girls, especially on fried chicken day! I participate in a program called
D.E.A.R. which stands for Drop Everything and Read, where a few times a month I come in and read to
each class. I drive my kids to school and I get to see them when they come home. For my entire family, I
am present in their everyday lives, and can’t put a price on that. I felt like I had achieved my goal. That
was that. So I thought...

Other things started to happen. Without conscientiously knowing it, people around me at the school or
church had a weird respect for me. I say weird because people literally mistook me as a doctor or just
some sort of self-made millionaire. I am not kidding. There is this one guy who still calls me “Doc.” I
guess the reason for this is because most people still cling to the old stereotypes of what they think it is

simultaneously EEG leads which demonstrated focal increases in epileptic patients
(Inouye et al, 1991; 1992). An entropy derived from the quantification of the failures
in temporal forecasting of EEG signals increased in the fronto-temporal region with

drug treatment in patients with Alzheimer’s syndrome (Pezard et al, 1998).

With respect to their implications for the clinical neurosciences, changes in
dynamical entropy in behavior of brain dynamical systems has been regarded in two
general ways: (1) Since representation of information requires the resolution of
relevant ambiguity, a nonrelevant and global reduction in the dynamical entropy of a
brain system (Stage IV sleep EEG slow waves, neuronal fixed point or regularly
periodic activity, extrapyramidal motor tremor, fixed paranoid or obsessional
mentation, the actions of some anxiolytics and antipsychotics ) reduces its potential
for information encoding and transport. In contrast, “arousal” induced increases in
the measures of entropy in brain wave and neuronal discharge patterns (pre-task
warning signals, motivating conditions, stimulant drugs) are associated with
improved psychophysical receptive and discrimination functions, learning rates and
memory. (2) Regarding as potentially pathophysiological both of the two extremes
of entropy generation, fixed point and periodic behavior as the lowest and fair coin
flipping, “Bernoulli” randomness as the highest, another descriptor, “complexity” is
defined as maximal (optimal) midway through the entropy range, making a new kind

of parabolic entropy curve (Bennett, 1986; Crutchfield and Young, 1989a).

In analogy with an optimal amalgam of periodic rotations and coin flips, in
higher dimension, the most meaningful maximum complexity of real, nonuniformly
expansive processes may derive from a multiplicity of measure invariants,
symmetries, of the system such as the growth rate of unstable periodic orbits,
divergence of the tail of a density distribution and specifiable linguistic variables
such as word length and redundancy. The more symmetries, the more potential for
complicated information encoding and transport with the maximum complexity
located midrange in each one. We have pursued the hypothesis that entropy is a
conserved property in the healthy brain and that complementarity in other statistical

measure mechanisms make that possible. For example, in uniformly expansive,

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026400.txt,"Exactly. I looked up the statistics, black kids in the US have slower cognitive development (and never catch
up), which the study of course attributed to social factors without any evidence, and they had faster motor
development! I suspect this means their brains are slower at learning high-level concepts, because the low-
level structures are optimized for a shorter time. But they will keep the lead in motor development, because it
is easier to learn, and they have more time and attention to practice once they get the structures in place.

It could also be that they have an additional set of learning directives in place that adapts them better to a
more hunting/running style of life, whereas the Europeans had to adapt for identifying long-term seasonal
patterns, delayed gratification for agriculture etc.

and CONCEPTS could be layer to layer communicaiton. . are gender differences also a matter of time ,
and structure of interactions. .

I suspect gender differences are mostly motivational, i.e. we have a reward system for all the different social
and cognitive needs, which makes us receive different kinds of pleasure and pain, thereby pay attention and
learn. You cannot learn what does not attract your attention. Women tend to find abstract systems, conflicts
and mechanisms intrinsically boring. Most women in computer science do not write programs because they
enjoy solving puzzles, but because they want to help people, get approval etc. There are almost no women in
math, because it does not help people or yield social attention.

Men tend to find elaborate social relations boring. If there is no pleasure in observing and empathizing with
people, one will not have good social cognition.

IQ is not the only meaningful difference. Chinese pay an inordinate amount of attention to authority. I suspect
historically., the authorities tended to kill them a lot if they did not. Jews tend be intellectually independent
and anti-authoritarian, which might make them creative and inventive in ways that are hard to find in Asia.

At the moment, I think speed/quality of brain development plus motivational system are the key to
understanding both mind and individual differences. Important part of human language might be the result in
a motivational need to discover/invent grammatical structure, which as a side effect makes us interested in
music.

It would mean that Chomsky’s life long hypothesis, that people have a special circuit for grammatical
language, is wrong. They might be GENERAL learners, just like Gorillas, but with a strong motivational urge
to build grammatical structure, which the brain simply invents (there are only a few ways in which a natural
language can work). That is much easier to wire into a brain than a specific circuit.

imy self believe that african music, westrn music , chinese music are a window into the the structure of
those layers. . western rigid, african primitve , chinese nature based,. I belive that synphoic movments
best describe your layering. | they open with a basic simple melody, , after it is learned , it is repeated and 
developed , inverted, distorted, related, etc. the development stage take a long time. then there is a
recapitlaltion of the whole. and its inter and intra actions. . african musci has lots of beats. and little
development. - no accident, it mirrors their learning process.

Interesting question if music is somehow indicative of genetically defined prefs, but I am not sure. It could be
path effects, starting in culture.

EMAIL ADDRESSES: 
RE: FBI Request No 1203982-001/ DOJ OIP Appeal AP-2013-01397 (Jeffrey 
Epstein) 
Dear Ms. Pustay and Mr. O'Neill: 
On March 29, 2013, the OIP determined that the FBI could not rely on 5 U.S.C. § 
552(b)(7)(A) as a basis to withhold all records of past investigations regarding Mr. Epstein's 
prior FBI FOIA request. On April 25, 2013, the FBI reopened the above-numbered FOIA 
request and stated that it had started its processing and searching for responsive records. On 
June 24, 2013, the FBI was informed that Mr. Epstein would pay the costs of copying. At 
present, 27 1/2 months after the FBI started to process Mr. Epstein's FOIA request, Mr. Epstein 
has received just two batches, the first numbering 372 pages (including redactions) that was 
produced on December 16, 2014, and the second batch numbering 336 pages that was 
produced 5 1/2 months later on May 29, 2015, out of a file that exceeds 12,000 pages. The 
processing of a third batch of documents will not begin until, at earliest, October, 2015, see 
infra. At this pace, the FBI will not complete the processing Mr. Epstein's file until 2025. A 
citizen should not have to wait over a decade for an agency to meet its FOIA obligations. As 
documented below — and within the May 1, 2015, and August 13, 2015, letters to Mr. Dennis 
Argall, FBI FOIPA Public Liaison Officer, each of which are attached — the FBI has declined to 
meet its statutory obligations in providing Freedom of Information Act mandated disclosures 
relating to the above-numbered request without unreasonable delay. Accordingly, I appeal to the 
01P to require the FBI to comply with its March 29, 2013, determination in a reasonably prompt 
manner. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031447 
I spoke with Mr. Argall by telephone on August 12, 2015, and inquired as to when I 
could expect a third interim production. He informed me that the FBI reviewer assigned to the 
Epstein file had not commenced the processing of any additional materials in the 2 months 
following the May 29 production and, further, that any such review was not currently scheduled 
and would not begin until, at earliest, October 2015. Given the lengthy delays due which 
include second level FOIA reviews conducted in Southern Florida by either the USAO or FBI, it 
predictably will take, at the very minimum, 5 1/2 months from the prior production in May until a 
third batch would be provided (not the 60-90 days I had repeatedly been told was the ordinary 
delay between separate 500 page productions on large files such as Mr. Epstein's). At this pace 
— a production offewer than 500 pages out of the still unprocessed 11,000 pages each 5 1/2 
months — the remaining 22 batches will not be produced for ten more years. Mr. Argall also 
advised that the reviewer assigned to the request was processing other files and that, in essence, 
other than communicating with me (which Mr. Argall has done on a regular basis), he could not 
suggest a way to expedite the pace other than by my advising Mr. Epstein to relinquish his FOIA 
rights to the review of his entire file. 
The FBI response to the above-numbered FOIA request has been utterly incompatible 
with the language of the FOIA, which states that [u]pon any determination by an agency to 
comply with a request for records, the records shall be made promptly available to such person 
making such request, 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(C)(i)(emphasis added), and with court opinions 
defining the FOIA basic policy as focusing on citizens' right to be informed about 'what their 
government is up to, Dep't of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 
749, 773 (1989). Additionally, the FBI's delays in this matter violate the policy of President 
Obama, announced on January 21, 2009, which directed each agency to act promptly and 
make timely disclosures of information. Even further, the Attorney General in a Memorandum 
for the Heads of Executive Della'____tinents and Agencies dated March 19, 2009, stressed that FOIA 
professionals should be mindful of their obligation to work 'in a spirit of cooperation' with 
FOIA requesters, that unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles have no place in the 'new era of open 
Government,' and that timely disclosure of information is an essential component of 
transparency [and] long delays should not be viewed as an inevitable and insurmountable 
consequence of high demand. (emphasis added). The pace of disclosure where Mr. Epstein has 
received less than 1,000 of over 12,000 pages in the over 28 months since the OIP required the 
FBI to process his FOIA request is in stark conflict with the mandates of both the President and 
the Attorney General. More is required than for Mr. Epstein to simply wait, year after year, for 
the FBI to comply with its FOIA obligations. 
In a recent opinion, Clemente v. FBI, 71 F.Supp.3d 262 (D.D.C. 2014), Judge Hogan found that 
the FBI is not 'deluged with [a] volume of requests . . vastly in excess of that anticipated by 
Congress,' that the FBI has not shown exceptional circumstance or sufficient progress in 
reducing its backlog to warrant an Open America stay, and that although the plaintiff's request 
that the FBI process 5,000 pages a month is higher than the rate would be in an ordinary 
case, . . . the FBI has successfully processed documents at that rate in other cases. Mr. Epstein 
acknowledges the differences between his case and that of plaintiff Clemente, however, an 
agreement that his file be processed at even 10% of the 5,000 pages a month ordered in the 
Clemente case would speed up the production of his FOIA file by many multiples given that Mr. 
2 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031448 
I would request that you intervene in this matter and require that the FBI agree to a 
procedure that expedites the production of the 12,000 page file. I would also request a 
conference with you and/or with the specific individuals who will be responsible for discharging 
the FBI's FOIA responsibilities as to the pending Epstein request for FOTA materials so that I 
can be assured that the FBI will be discharging its legal obligations without continued unlawful 
and inexplicable delay.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014000.txt,"2. Attention is necessary for not only productivity but appreciation.
Therefore:

Too many choices = less or no productivity
Too many choices = less or no appreciation

Too many choices = sense of overwhelm
What to do? There are six basic rules or formulas that can be used:

1. Set rules for yourself so you can automate as much decision making as possible [see the rules I
use to outsource my e-mail to Canada, included at the end of this section, as an example of this].

2. Don’t provoke deliberation before you can take action.

One simple example: Don’t scan the inbox on Friday evening or over the weekend if you might
encounter work problems that can’t be addressed until Monday.

3. Don’t postpone decisions just to avoid uncomfortable conversations.

If an acquaintance asks you if you want to come to their house for dinner next week, and you know you
won't, don’t say, “I’m not sure. Pll let you know next week.” Instead, use something soft but conclusive
like, “Next week? I’m pretty sure I have another commitment on Thursday, but thank you for the invite.
Just so I don’t leave you hanging, let’s assume I can’t make it, but can I let you know if that changes?”
Decision made. Move on.

4. Learn to make nonfatal or reversible decisions as quickly as possible.

Set time limits (I won’t consider options for more than 20 minutes), option limits (?1l consider no more
than three options), or finance thresholds (Example: If it costs less than $100 [or the potential damage is
less than $100], P’ll let a virtual assistant make the judgment call).

I wrote most of this post after landing at the monster that is ATL airport in Atlanta. I could have
considered half a dozen types of ground transportation in 15 minutes and saved 30-40%, but I grabbed a
taxi instead. To use illustrative numbers: I didn’t want to sacrifice 10 attention units of my remaining 50
of 100 total potential units, since those 10 units couldn’t then be spent on this article. I had about eight
hours before bedtime due to time zone differences—plenty of time—but scarce usable attention after an
all-nighter of fun and the cross-country flight. Fast decisions preserve usable attention for what
matters.

5. Don’t strive for variation—and thus increase option consideration—when it’s not needed.
Routine enables innovation where it’s most valuable.

In working with athletes, for example, it’s clear that those who maintain the lowest bodyfat percentage
eat the same foods over and over with little variation. I’ve eaten the same “slow-carb” breakfast and

lunch for nearly two years,®8 putting variation only into meals that I focus on for enjoyment: dinner and
all meals on Saturdays. This same routine-variation distinction can be found in exercise vs. recreation.
For fat loss and muscle gain (even as much as 34 pounds in four weeks), I’ve followed the same time —
minimal exercise protocol with occasional experiments since 1996. For recreation, however, where the
focus is enjoyment and not efficacy, I tend to try something new each weekend, whether climbing at
Mission Cliffs in San Francisco or mountain biking from tasting to tasting in Napa.

The Chinese Puzzle

The first [false assumption] is that China is an enemy of the
United States. It’s not.

—EDWARD SNOWDEN, Hong Kong, 2013

OC N AUGUST 11, 2014, in the Atlantic Ocean, an event took place
of enormous concern to U.S. intelligence. A Chinese Jin-class
submarine launched an intercontinental ballistic missile. The missile
released twelve independently targeted reentry vehicles, each simu-
lating a nuclear warhead. Some forty-four hundred miles away, in
China’s test range in the Xinjiang desert, each of the twelve simu-
lated nuclear warheads hit its target within a twelve-inch radius.

The test firing, which was closely monitored by the NSA, was a
strategic game changer. It meant that a single Jin-class submarine,
which carried twelve such missiles and 144 nuclear warheads, could
destroy every city of strategic importance in the United States. U.S.
intelligence further reported that China would soon use stealth
technology to make it more difficult to detect newer submarines and
give “China its first credible sea-based nuclear deterrent” against an
American attack.

By 2015, as its test in the Atlantic had foreshadowed, China had
armed its land-based as well as sea-based missiles with multiple

e Set global target for total federal health expenditures after 2020
(Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, exchange subsidies, employer health
exclusion), and review costs every two years. Keep federal health
expenditure growth to one percentage points above GDP growth.

e If costs have grown faster than targets (on average of previous 5 years),
require President to submit and Congress to consider reforms to lower
spending, such as:

— Increase premiums (or further increase cost-sharing)

Overhaul the fee-for-service system
— Develop a premium support system for Medicare

Add a robust public option and/or all-payer system in the exchange

— Further expand authority of the Independent Payment Advisory

invading units with their traditional welcome, showering them with rice. But for
anew Shiite militia calling itself Hizbollah — formed after the invasion and
inspired by the Ayatollah Khomeini’s revolution in Iran — our continuing
military presence was anathema. In November 1983, Hizbollah signalled its
intentions when a truck bomber drove into a building being used as our military
headquarters in the south Lebanese city of Tyre, killing more than 60 people.

Yet the election ended up as a near-tie. Peres did lead Labor back into top
spot for the first time since Begin’s victory in 1977. But he got only 44 seats, to
the Likud’s 41. After weeks of horse-trading with smaller parties, he could not
form a government. Neither could Shamir. The result, for the first time in
peacetime, was a national-unity coalition, including both main parties. Peres
would be Prime Minister for the first two years, and Shamir the final two. But
the stipulation of most relevance to me was that one man would be the Defence
Minister throughout the four years: Yitzhak Rabin.

My relationship with Rabin went back much further than with Misha. I'd
first met him when I was a sayeret soldier. I’d interacted with him more as
sayeret commander, and of course during Entebbe. Now, we began to work
even more closely, and the main challenge in his early months as Defense
Minister was what to do about our troops in Lebanon. We had gradually been
pulling back. We were more or less on the 40-kilometer line which Sharon had
claimed was the point of the invasion. But even this was costing us lives, with
no obvious benefit from controlling a large slab of territory on which nearly
half-a-million Lebanese lived. A decision was now reached to shrink our
“security zone” further, pulling back to the Litani River. It meandered about 25
kilometers north of the border, and in some areas was even closer to Israel.

I argued strongly in favor of getting out altogether. I accepted that the
“Litani line” might help impede cross-border raids. But especially since the
remaining Palestinian fighters and Hizbollah were acquiring newer Katyushas,
with a range of up to 20 kilometers, they could fire rockets over the security
zone. My deeper concern was that we intended to hold the area with between
1,000 and 1,500 Israeli troops in open alliance with a local Maronite Christian
militia, called the South Lebanon Army. This would rule out any hope of
working out security arrangements with the non-Christian majority in the south.
I tried to persuade Rabin we should withdraw all the Israeli soldiers and
coordinate security arrangements with the equivalent of a local civil-defense
guard. I suggested four separate militias drawn from the local population —

“Because victims of sexual crimes are likely to suffer a ‘depth and range of emotion and
psychological disturbance. ..not felt by the victims felt by most other crimes’ we remind
lawyers and judges that the mere fact that such victims sought counseling may not be used
for impeachment purposes.”

Notwithstanding this warning, it seems quite likely that at least some rape victims would decline
to press charges if they knew that their treatment records could be rummaged through by defense
lawyers eager to discredit them.

The feminist lawyer, who successfully argued the appeal, had mixed feelings about the results,
acknowledging that she “had hurt the cause,” and that her victory for her client was “a step back
for women.” But she understood that her responsibility in this case was to this defendant, rather
than to future rape victims who she cared deeply about but who were not her clients. She did her
job, and she did it well.

This is another example of the “no free lunch” doctrine, in which doubts were resolved in favor of
defendants and against the victims of rape.

A key problem posed by Searle's Chinese Room is whether you can
know everything about a situation from just looking at the inputs and
outputs. This is very similar to the restriction posed by the Turing Test.
In that case if we were to trace the wire from our computer terminal
to the other room we would either find a human typing messages or a
large box covered in flashing lights. This would definitively answer the
question whether we were talking to a man or a machine. Similarly, if
we opened the door to the Chinese Room we would immediately know
whether there was a real Chinese speaker in there or not. But opening
the door on both tests misses the point. The question asks, “if the inputs
and outputs are the same does it matter what is really going on inside a
closed system?”

Black Boxes

Experiments involving closed systems are known as Black Box
experiments. They presume you can learn everything about the inner
workings of a box simply by probing it from the outside. Young electronic
engineers are often given black boxes as a test. Electronic components
hidden in the box are connected to three external terminals on the
outside. The student is asked to deduce what is in the box using only
an electric meter to probe those terminals. Here are a few examples of
the possible contents of a black box. They would all show up identically
on the student’s meter. Although internally different they are externally
identical. Even my ‘silly fourth choice with a cat in the box does not give

Slowing economy could increase pressure on
Big Tech

Sara Fischer, David McCabe, Courtenay Brown5 hours ago

A potential recession, combined with increasing regulatory threats for some of the biggest
tech companies, foreshadows a difficult 2019 for Silicon Valley.

Why it matters: The biggest tech companies have already raked tn billions of dollars in
profits and benefited from major tax cuts that aren't going to be repeated, so next year isn't
likely to be better for them financially. They've also been dogged by scandals that have left
many questioning their positive role in society, and if on top of that the economy starts to
slip, 2019 could be worse.

People look for scapegoats in a bad economy. And with big tech already on its heels, a
downturn probably would feed arguments that the largest internet companies are too big
and need to be reined in.

— Paul Gallant, an analyst with Cowen Washington Research Group

Big Tech is closing out a contentious year in Washington, and potential regulation will
continue to haunt it well into 2019.

° Google CEO Sundar Pichai has agreed to testify before Congress, and will likely be
asked about whether the company is being transparent about its data privacy practices and
any potential bias. By the year's end, the CEOs of Twitter, Google and Facebook will have
been called to testified in front of Congress for the first time ever during 2018.

° Lawmakers in the United States are pushing for a federal privacy law with an urgency
likely to be exacerbated by more breaches like the one Marriott disclosed last Friday.

° The Federal Trade Commission still has an open investigation into whether
Facebook’s conduct violated a previous settlement with the agency. Margrethe Vestager,

The resulting one-sided report, which violated all the rules of an organization that had long
claimed to be a neutral advocate for universal human rights in the spirit of Eleanor Roosevelt, was
according to Guild old-timers, designed as a litmus test for its Jewish members:

“Basically ... you had a situation where a bunch of Third World types wanted to ensure
that the Jews in the guild — and the Jews were almost certainly a majority — would be
forced to eat crow, to choose sides. The guild changed dramatically in the late 1960s and
early 1970s, when the veterans of the early days were displaced by the veterans of campus
unrest who had gone from SDS to law schools around the country. They’re angry, and
rigid, and there’s no better test of their control of the guild than forcing the old-timers to
grovel, and there’s no better evidence of their own militance — if they’re Jews — than
toadying up to the PLO. Endorsing the PLO has become a litmus test for Jewish
radicals.”

I decided to devise a litmus test of my own to challenge the bona fides of the Guild’s claim that it
was still a neutral human rights organization. I called Professor John Quigley, the national vice-
president of the guild. After learning that the guild had decided to send an observer to a trial of
an alleged terrorist in Israel, I requested that the guild also send an observer to the Soviet trial of
Anatoly Shcharansky. It was the belief of several experts on Soviet law that a request by the
guild to send an observer to the Shcharansky trial could have had a unique impact on Soviet
actions, since the Soviet Union has a close relationship with the International Association of
Democratic Layers and its constituent members. Professor Quigley was extremely candid in his
response to my request. He told me that he doubted the guild would be willing to send an
observer to a Soviet trial, since the “reality” of the situation is that a considerable number of the
guild members approve of the Soviet Union and would not want to criticize a Soviet judicial
proceeding. In his written response, claiming that the guild could not act on my request in time
for the Shcharansky trial, he put it somewhat differently:

“The problem is that we do not approach matters such as this purely from a human-rights
perspective. We regard it as well from the standpoint of the importance of focusing
attention on human-rights violations in a particular country. With respect to the U.S.S.R.,
we have not had discussion or come to any decision about the appropriateness of focusing
on human-rights issues there.”

The only conclusion one can reasonably draw from the guild’s reluctance to send observers to the
Soviet Union, coupled with its willingness to send observers to Israel, is that the guild is as
unwilling to criticize Communist countries as it is eager to criticize Israel and other Western
democracies.

In my article I put the choice to the Guild:
“Tf the guild decides to continue its foray into international politics, it will have to make a
choice: either to perpetuate its double standard on human rights, which will surely
alienate much of its support here at home for its domestic programs; or to report honestly

on human rights throughout the world, which will surely alienate the PLO and the Soviet
Union.”

Nobody and no amount of external assistance can help the Syrian
protesters overcome their differences (as a Lebanese citizen, trust me
on this one). But the sooner they speak with one voice, organize their
ranks from within, and show the world that they are a mature and
capable group able to turn Syria into a responsible democracy, the
closer they will be to fulfilling their dream of toppling the Assad
regime.

Their unity and organization are indeed more powerful than NATO’s
bombs and more effective than the West’s sanctions. The lessons of
Libya, Egypt, and Tunisia are clear: With unity comes historic
opportunity.

Posh Palm Beach is no hotbed of crime, and in his first year on the job, a resident confined to his home with a
sick child thanked Reiter for delivering a few Cokes to the house. Reiter refused payment for the beverages.
Another resident thanked Reiter for shutting off his car's headlights in his driveway, saying a valet must have
been at fault.

Reiter worked everything from road patrol to organized crime, vice and narcotics. And he's no novice at
investigations involving the island's rich and famous. He was the lead detective probing the drug overdose
death of David Kennedy in 1984. He also was one of the officers who worked the investigation of William
Kennedy Smith, who was charged in 1991 — and later acquitted — with raping a woman at the Kennedy
family compound in Palm Beach.

Reiter, who has a master's degree in human resource development from Palm Beach Atlantic University, also
has attended the FBI National Academy in Quantico, Va., and management courses at Harvard. He's been
active in countywide interagency law enforcement organizations and has a top secret national security
clearance.

He has a perspective that's broader than just addressing the needs of the town,” said Town Manager Peter
Elwell, who promoted Reiter from assistant chief to chief in March 2001. Reiter makes more than $144,000 as
the town's top cop. Elwell thinks he's worth it.

He's very businesslike, very straightforward. He's not easily agitated or flamboyant. He's about the work,
Elwell said. I think that his service as chief has been outstanding in five-plus years.

4.5.12 Knowledge Representation, Action Selection and Planning in
Psi

In addition to the basic motivation/emotion architecture of Psi, which has been adopted (with
some minor changes) for use in CogPrime, Psi has a number of other aspects that are somewhat
different from their CogPrime analogues.

First of all, on the micro level, Psi represents knowledge using structures called “quads.” Each
quad is a cluster of 5 neurons containing a core neuron, and four other neurons representing
before/after and part-of/has-part relationships in regard to that core neuron. Quads are natu-
rally assembled into spatiotemporal hierarchies, though they are not required to form part of
such a structure.

Psi stores knowledge using quads arranged in three networks, which are conceptually similar
to the networks in Albus’s 4D/RCS and Arel’s DeSTIN architectures:

e A sensory network, which stores declarative knowledge: schemas representing images, ob-
jects, events and situations as hierarchical structures.

e A motor network, which contains procedural knowledge by way of hierarchical behavior
programs

e A motivational network handling demands

Perception in Psi, which is centered in the sensory network, follows principles similar to
DeSTIN (which are shared also by other systems), for instance the principle of perception as
prediction. Psi’s “HyPercept” mechanism performs hypothesis-based perception: it attempts to
predict what is there to be perceived and then attempts to verify these predictions using sen-
sation and memory. Furthermore HyPercept is intimately coupled with actions in the external
world, according to the concept of “Neisser’s perceptual cycle,” the cycle between exploration
and representation of reality. Perceptually acquired information is translated into schemas ca-
pable of guiding behaviors, and these are enacted (sometimes affecting the world in significant
ways) and in the process used to guide further perception. Imaginary perceptions are handled
via a “mental stage” analogous to CogPrime’s internal simulation world.

Action selection in Psi works based on what are called “triplets,” each of which consists of

e asensor schema (pre-conditions, “condition schema”; like CogPrime’s “context”)
e a subsequent motor schema (action, effector; like CogPrime’s “procedure”)
e a final sensor schema (post-conditions, expectations; like an CogPrime predicate or goal)

What distinguishes these triplets from classic production rules as used in (say) Soar and
ACT-R is that the triplets may be partial (some of the three elements may be missing) and
may be uncertain. However, there seems no fundamental difference between these triplets and
CogPrime’s concept /procedure/goal triplets, at a high level; the difference lies in the underlying
knowledge representation used for the schemata, and the probabilistic logic used to represent
the implication.

The work of figuring out what schema to execute to achieve the chosen goal in the current
context is done in Psi using a combination of processes called the “Rasmussen ladder” (named

between net income and gross realized income can mislead. Piketty is right about

the data, but wrong about its interpretation.

Depreciation Theory

This is the explanation I promised when | said that depreciation is essentially like
amortization. Accounting tends to practice straight-line depreciation over standard
depreciation periods. A well-known refinement, allowed but not much practiced in
business, is called current cost accounting. The idea is to correct distortions due to
past inflation. The problem is that books reflect long-term assets and their
depreciation at original cost at date of booking. Current cost accounting adjusts both
to the equivalent in current dollars. It shows both net worth and depreciation as
higher if prices inflated since booking, or lower if prices deflated. That seems to

make sense.

A further adjustment called replacement cost accounting does the same, but also
replaces linear depreciation with a curve believed more realistic. National accounts
adopt this method. It is sound in principle. But they shape the curve in the wrong
direction. They rely on records of actual sales of plant to model depreciation as

steep initially and slower later. I suggest that this record is misleading.

My starting point is that value of any capital is discounted cash flow. To keep things
simple at first, suppose that cash flow in constant dollars is expected to hold steady

for fifty years before asset life ends. Also suppose a constant time discount rate.

Present value at the outset is fifty years of discounted cash flow. At the beginning of
the second year, it is 49 years present value of the same cash flow at the same

discount rate. All that has been lost is present value of the 50 and most-discounted
year. At the start of the third year, capital has dropped again by present value of the

49th and second-most discounted year. So it continues until the end as the discount

ODYSSEY Program

The ODYSSEY Phase 3 program is one of the most comprehensive clinical trial programs ever conducted for
an investigational LDL cholesterol lowering therapy. The program includes 14 global Phase 3 trials evaluating
more than 23,500 patients. The primary efficacy end point in all of the studies was the mean percent reduction
from baseline in LDL cholesterol at week 24 compared to placebo (maximally tolerated statin therapy); all of
the completed studies met their primary endpoint. A significantly higher proportion of patients achieved LDL
cholesterol of less than 70 mg/dL in the Praluent group as compared to placebo at both week 12 and week 24.
The ongoing ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial will prospectively evaluate the cardiovascular benefits of Praluent
in approximately 18,000 patients.

DOMINQUE STRAUSS-KAHN ARRESTED, NOT BECAUSE HE RAPED A MAID, BUT 
BECAUSE HE HAD EVIDENCE US HAS NO GOLD IN FORT KNOX. 
Posted by admin on Jun 3, 2011 in News I 0 comments 
V.4110. 
A startling story published by the European Union Times, could be the one of the worlds biggest conspiracy theories, a plot for a movie or a 
frightening scenario for the U.S. and world economy. 
Dominique Strauss Kahn 
According to the on-line publication a new report prepared for Russian Prime Minister Putin by the FederalSecurity Service(FSB) says that 
former International Monetary Fund (IMF) ChiefDominique Strauss-Kahnwas charged and jailed in the US forsex crimeson May 14 after his 
discovery that all of thegoldheld in theUnited States Bullion Depositorylocated at Fort Knox was missing and/or unaccounted for. 
According to this FSBsecretreport, Strauss-Kahn had become increasingly concerned earlier this month after the United States began stalling 
its pledged delivery to the IMF of191.3 tons of goldagreed to under theSecond Amendmentof the Articles of Agreement signed by the 
Executive Board in April 1978 that were to be sold to fund what are called Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) as an alternative to what are called 
reserve currencies. 
This FSB report says that when Strauss-Kahn raised his concerns with Americangovernment officials close to President Obama he was 
contacted by rogue elements within the CIA who provided him firm evidence that all of thegoldreported to be held by the US was gone. 
Upon Strauss-Kahn receiving the CIA evidence, the report said, he made immediate arrangements to leave the US for Paris, but when 
contacted by agents working for Frances General Directorate for External Security (DGSE) that American authorities were seeking his 
capture he fled to New York CitysJFK airportfollowing these agents directive not to take his cell-phone because US police could track his 
exact location. 
Once Strauss-Kahn safely boarded anAir France flightto Paris, the FSB report says, he made a fatal mistake by calling the hotel from a phone 
on the plane and asking them to forwarded the cell-phone he had been told to leave behind to his French residence, after which US agents 
were able to track and apprehend him. 
Within the past fortnight, the report continues, Strauss-Kahn reached out to his close friend and top Egyptian banker Mahmoud Abdel Salam 
Omar to retrieve from the US the evidence given to him by the CIA. Omar, however, and exactly like Strauss-Kahn before him, has been 
chargedby the US with a sex crime against aluxury hotelmaid, a charge the FSB labels as beyond belief as Omar is 74-years-old and a devout 
Muslim. 
In an astounding move puzzling many in Moscow, Putin after reading thissecretFSB report ordered posted to the Kremlins official website a 
defense of Strauss-Khan becoming thefirst world leader to state that the former IMF chief was a victim of a US conspiracy. 
One of the United States top Congressman, and 2012 Presidential candidate, Ron Paul has long stated his belief that the US government has 
lied about itsgoldreserves held at Fort Knox. And in 2010 put forward a bill force an audit of them, .The bill was defeated,but which was 
subsequently defeated by Obama regime forces. 
When directly asked by reporters if he believed there was nogoldin Fort Knox or the Federal Reserve, Congressman Paul gave the incredible 
reply, I think it is a possibility. 
Also interesting to note is that barely 3 days after the arrest of Strauss-Kahn, Congressman Paul made a new call for the US to sell 
itsgoldreserves by stating, Given the high price it is now, and the tremendous debt problem we now have, by all means, sell at the peak. 
Reports emanating from the US for years, however, suggest there is nogoldto sell. 
New reports coming from the United States show his determination not to go down without a fight as he has hired what is described as a 
crack team of former CIA spies, private investigators and media advisers to defend him.

A Diamond Ring Parable

I like a picture of a diamond ring to show something about psychic value and yield,
and even about what output and exhaust in consumption are. The ring brings
psychic yield to its wearer. If it didn’t, it would have no value. Its yield is each
psychic satisfaction, and its value sums all time-discounted prospective ones
together. Value therefore drops just a little as each yield is finally realized. It is as
with apples dropping from a tree. Yet the ring is inert. It ostensibly produces
nothing. It also keeps all its value as a ring from day to day. Then where does the
outflow of the value in the exhaust come from? How can value go out if none was
deducted and none produced? In the tree, we can see the apples growing and falling.

The answer is that some value was produced in the ring, and some deducted too.

What we didn’t notice was the constant shortening of remaining discount periods.
As each day passes, each future yield comes one day closer. These are the apples
slowly ripening on the tree. Present value of each rises because the discount period
covers less time. This creation of value is output by definition, even though nothing
has moved but the hands of the clock. As the discount period reaches zero, the
expected yield eventuates to explain the taste satisfaction. These yields are the
apples falling to be eaten. The ring holds its value intact because the exhaust of
value it surrendered has exactly offset the output of replacement value as time alone

shortens discount periods. Yet not an atom stirred.

The whole point is that the value of the ring or anything else is discounted present
value of foreseen satisfactions. They are discounted because there is such a thing as
“time preference”; we value satisfactions now over foreseen ones later. This is not
quite the same as the difference between birds in the hand and birds in the bush.

That says that we value certainties over probabilities. Time preference also values

Preface
My father always told me that I would be a teacher. He didn’t mean
it in a nice way. My father talked in riddles. As the only child in the
house, I had plenty of time and opportunity to figure out what he was
really saying. This was it: I am afraid that like me, the best you will be
able to do in life is to be a civil service worker. He was also saying: If he
had realized he was going to be a civil service worker, at least he could
have been a teacher, which he might have enjoyed. He wasn’t really
talking about me at all.
I never had any intention of being a teacher. I didn’t particularly
like school and later, when I became a professor, the part of the job I
disliked the most was the teaching. One might wonder how I wound
up being a professor if I disliked teaching, and one might wonder why
I am writing a book about teaching if I dislike teaching. One also might
wonder whether I still dislike teaching. Yes. And no. It depends on what
one means by teaching, which is, after all, what this book is about.
The other day my 3-year-old grandson Milo told me he was going
to teach me how to throw rocks. It seemed an odd idea. What could he
mean by this? To Milo, “teach” means to tell someone what to do and
how to do it and then have the person do it too. Teach is part of tell
plus imitate for Milo. Milo is 3. It is not too surprising that this is what
teach means to him. It is a little surprising that he thinks he should
be his grandfather’s teacher, but that is another issue. But it is really
no shock that Milo thinks this is what teach means. It is what nearly
everyone thinks teach means. The commonly accepted usage of teach
is tell and then have the person who was told, do what he was told.
This certainly is not what teach ought to mean, or more important, is
not what good teaching is. And, every good teacher knows this. The
problem is that the system that employs teachers doesn’t know it and
more or less insists that Milo’s definition be the one that is followed.
Actually, I am being too generous here. Milo’s view, namely, that
after he tells me, I will do what he has said, is a better definition of
ix
x
Preface
teaching than the one actually employed commonly today. Milo at
least thinks that the end result will be the student doing something
that the teacher did. In school, teach usually means helping the student
to know something that the teacher told him. Milo doesn’t know
about that definition of teaching yet since he hasn’t been to school,
but, unfortunately, he soon will.
I have been thinking about teaching for more than 50 years. First
I thought about it when my father said that was what I was going to
be. Then I thought about it as I watched my teachers teach me and, no
less important, watched my father teach me.
My father eventually retired from his civil service job and became
a junior high school teacher in Harlem. He loved his new job and, I
have to assume, became a good teacher. I say it that way because he
was certainly not a good teacher for me, at least not when he thought
he was trying to teach me. I remember him trying to teach me algebra
and it making no sense to me whatever. I remember him teaching me
sports and I mostly think of him as being totally frustrated with my
inability to perform as well as he had hoped. (Being a jock was a big
thing to my father.)
I did fine in algebra without his help and, in fact, became a math
major in college. But, as I look back at it, my father was my first and
best teacher. Why do I say this after all the bad things I have just said?
Because my father was at his best when he wasn’t teaching but was
just saying what was on his mind and arguing. He often talked about
history because he liked history. And when he talked about history
and I asked questions, he became a good Socratic teacher. He forced
me to think and question in our discussions. The conversations were
often very heated but also were a highlight of my intellectual life at
that time. My father didn’t teach me anything except how to think.
That’s better than algebra, actually. For this I am grateful.
So, I thought about teaching then and I thought about it again
when I went to college. As part of my father’s conversations with
me about life, he talked a great deal about his own experiences. His
mother sent him to New York City to live with his aunt in Brooklyn
and to go to college. He was 15 and had, until that time, spent his
entire life on a farm/hotel run by his parents in upstate New York.
He was unprepared for the city, had no money, missed his family,
and had no idea why he wanted to go to college at all. Did I mention
that he was 15? He had graduated first in his class (a class of 16, I
Preface
xi
think) and had skipped a few grades on the way. Suddenly he found
himself at New York University, which in those days was located in
the Bronx.
This is what he remembered most about college in 1923: Apart
from the poverty stories, the “how hard he had to work to support
himself” stories, the stories about watching the Yankees from the elevated
train and wishing he could go to a game, he remembered that
teachers lectured, that you had to memorize what they told you and
then tell it back to them on a test. He thought college was stupid, but
he assured me (in 1960) that college surely had changed by now and
that teachers wouldn’t still be doing this. Oh yeah? In 1962, when I
entered college, they were doing exactly that. And, in 2000, when I
retired from 32 years of professoring, not that much had changed.
So I was thinking about teaching before I got to college and I was
thinking about it while I was a professor and I am thinking about it
now that I have, for the most part, finished teaching. To make sure I
have been thinking about it correctly, I asked former Ph.D. students of
mine, (now tenured professors mostly and some industry executives)
what they had learned from me while they were spending 4–7 years
studying with me. I thought their answers might help me think about
teaching in a new way. I sent an e-mail to maybe 20 former students
whose e-mail addresses I happened to have, and most responded. Here
are some excerpts.
1. I remember quite specifically a homework presentation I
made in your class. When I presented it in class, I was a junior
in college, and all the other students in that class were grad
students. When I was done you smiled at everyone (a rare
event) and said, “Anyone care to follow that act?” Your clearly
heartfelt endorsement of my little research product was a key
moment in my coming to trust my own ideas. I just submitted
a $16.7 million proposal to NIH that would create the first allcomputational
genome center. The kind of chutzpah embodied
in that proposal is one consequence of my experience with you.
2. The way you assigned me to a project—you sent me to each
existing project for 2 weeks until I hit on a project with a good
fit (I was enthusiastic and coherent talking about it). I used this
technique when I was assigning people at Accenture.
xii
Preface
3. You taught me to teach by telling students stories that are
meaningful to you. I think to be a real teacher you have to let
yourself be vulnerable. So the students can see that you are a
human with feelings and fears and goals. And then being able
to say to the students: This is the way I do it; it fits who I am; it
helps me be successful; and don’t let anyone tell you that you
can’t do something.
4. You taught me that not everyone will like you no matter what
you do and no matter how hard you try. I came back from a
Deloitte course evaluation, and the deans just hated me. Instead
of being upset with me, you assured me that you have to just say
what you believe, and some people won’t like you, and oh well.
5. You taught me to start by collecting data. I recall watching
most of your papers start by collection of data. I recall watching
your criticisms of work that was just abstraction on abstraction,
with no data at its roots.
6. You once told me to imagine that my mother was my
audience—if I could explain it to my mother, I could explain it
to anyone. Incredibly, this seems to work for every audience out
there. So I’ve passed that tip along to my students and it seems to
work for them too.
7. I remember that you used to tell us we need to be excited to
get up and go to work in the morning, that that was the most
important thing. For some people, it’s because of the people
you will be with. For some, it is because of the passion about
whatever it is. But, in general, I still give people that advice (and
it is advice I’ve also been giving my own kids). You have to love
what you are doing.
This is just a sample but it reflects what these former students, now
all in their 40s and 50s, remember about what I taught them. Hadn’t
they learned any facts from me? Didn’t I teach them some real stuff?
Some said in passing that they had learned the actual content of the
subjects I taught as well, but that that wasn’t as important to them as
the things they chose to write about. Why not?
Preface
xiii
There are two important answers to this question and those answers
are what this book is really about. My father offered these same
answers to me, not explicitly by any means, when I thought about the
good and bad of having him as my teacher. When he tried to teach me
facts, I learned nothing much. When he engaged my mind, I learned a
lot. As a professor I never forgot this lesson. I rarely tried to teach facts,
upsetting many a student along the way. I just argued with them, or
encouraged them. I never told them much, except maybe some good
stories.
So here are the answers:
The first is:
Teaching isn’t what outsiders to the profession think it is.
The profession I am referring to here is, of course, the teaching
profession.
The second is:
Learning isn’t what outsiders to the profession think it is.
In this case, the profession I am referring to is not teaching at all.
Let’s start with teaching.
A professor friend of mine once asked her class what they thought
a professor’s biggest fear was while teaching a class. They all agreed
it was not knowing the answer to a question a student might ask.
When she told this story to a group of professors, they all laughed
out loud.
Why am I telling this story? Because a student’s view of teaching
varies greatly from a teacher’s view. No teacher worries about not
knowing the right answer to something a student will ask. You can
always fake it (say—What do you think? or, Class, can you help here?) if
you think it is important, but answers don’t matter very much. Teachers
are not supposed to be encyclopedias. They are supposed to be
something else. The question is: What?
My students’ responses above give a hint. Teachers are supposed
to be people who help students find their interests in life, think about
xiv
Preface
how to make decisions, understand how to approach a problem, or
otherwise live sensibly. Teachers are never shocked to be asked to provide
personal or professional advice to a student having a problem—
any problem. If one takes one’s job seriously, teaching means being
available to help. But this important advisory job is confused by lesson
plans, and class hours, and lectures, none of which matter very much.
Why do I say that these things don’t matter very much? This is the
essence of what this book is about—the move from content-based instruction
to cognitive-based learning, assisted by good teaching. This
means we will have to define this “new” kind of learning (it’s not really
new, of course, just new to schools) and the “new” kind of teaching
that is a natural consequence of using this new learning method.
Most teachers understand and appreciate that delivering the required
material is not their real job, at least it is not the reason they
signed on in the first place. The employers of teachers, on the other
hand—administrators, governments, department heads, and so on—
expect certain material to be covered. Exciting students is not on their
worry list. This is a big problem for teachers and for students, and one
that we will address here.
But my more serious concern is our conception of learning, not
teaching. Teaching follows one’s conception of learning so getting
learning right is of prime importance. When I said earlier that outsiders
to the learning profession wouldn’t get the real point, I was being
ironic. There is no learning profession. Why not?
In 1989, I moved from Yale to Northwestern to establish a new
institute, funded by Andersen Consulting, devoted to issues of changing
training and education by the use of new technologies. I needed a
name for the institute and came up with The Institute for the Learning
Sciences. I made up the term learning sciences. There was no such field
in academia. Most people thought I meant we were planning to work
on how people learned science. The only academic fields that “studied”
learning were psychology and education. Psychology, being an
experimental field, allows faculty to work only on experiments about
learning that provide data in a controlled environment. Education
faculty study how schools work and very rarely think about learning
outside of the school context or in a way different from the paradigm
already extant in schools. I wanted to create a learning profession. In
1989, there certainly didn’t seem to be one.
Preface
xv
Today this is less true. Cognitive science, a field I also had a big
part in creating, has become more important in the academic world.
Training, and e-learning, the first new field to come about as a result
of our work at my new institute (for better or for worse, I am not too
fond of most e-learning work) have become more important to think
about within the academic context, in part because online courses are
seen as potential revenue producers.
So, while there is still no learning profession per se, there is much
interest in what learning is about. This book is meant to address the
issue of what learning really is, in or out of school, and to answer the
question: How does learning really work? The questions that follow
from the answer to that question are:
• What kinds of learning situations occur naturally?
• How can we focus education (and training and
e-learning) on those types of situations in a new
paradigm?
• What would teaching look like in this new paradigm?
• If what we know about how learning works is antithetical
to how school works, then what can we do?
Answering these questions is one goal of this book.
Another goal of this book is to think seriously about what it means
to teach. Typically, we look at teaching in precisely the way that our
system forces us to look at it. There are subjects and there are experts,
and experts talk about their subjects to students who listen to what
they have to say. This idea is not only archaic—it is wrong. In the history
of humankind, teaching could never have looked this way.
Until recently, teaching always meant apprenticeship. We are set
up to be apprentices, to learn by doing with help from a mentor. We
have done this since the beginning of time. When learning became
academic in nature, when students were expected to become scholars,
all this changed—and it didn’t change for the better. Teaching started
to mean talking, and talking is a terrible way to teach. People aren’t
really that good at listening, after all. Small children don’t listen to
their parents. They may copy their parents. They can be corrected by
their parents. They may be impeded from doing something by their
parents. But listen? Not really. We listen in order to be entertained, not
in order to learn.

Preface
This lack of understanding about what learning really is like, and
what teaching must be like in order to be useful, has caused us to set
up school in a way that really does not work very well. When students
complain about school, when politicians say school isn’t working, we
understand that there is a problem. But we don’t understand what
the problem is. We think we can fix schools by making them more
friendly, or safer, or paying teachers better, or having students have
more say, or obsessing about test scores, but none of this is the case.
The problem with schools lies in our conception of the role of
school. We see school as a place to study academics, to become a
scholar, when in fact very few students actually want to become scholars
or study academics.
As a society we have gotten caught up in a conception of school
from the late 1800s that has failed to change in any significant way,
despite the fact that universal education has made the system unstable.
Universities dominate the discussion, and everyone listens to
what academics have to say because they don’t see the alternative or
know whom else to listen to. But, if we understand how learning actually
works, and how teaching actually should work, the alternative
becomes much clearer.
It is establishing that clarity that is my goal in this book.
CHAPTER 1
Cognitive Process-Based Education
Education is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember
from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be
taught.
—Oscar Wilde
Learning begins with a goal. However, when we think about education
and school, we often forget this. Someone, somewhere, decides that a
student must learn about Napoleon, but fails to ask how such learning
might conform to a goal that the student consciously holds. We don’t
forget this when we try to teach a child to walk or talk, because we
know that the child does want to learn to do these things. When we
teach a child to hit a baseball, we usually determine beforehand that
the child wants to learn to do this. But, we forget this simple idea of
goal-directed learning as soon as we design curricula for schools. Who
cares if the child wants to learn long division? Make the child learn it.
It is very important. Full speed ahead!
Somewhere along the way, many students get lost. They may get
lost in high school, or in college, or in job training. But somewhere
they learn to shut off their natural learning instincts, the ones that
drive them to improve because they really want to accomplish something.
Instead they try hard to do what they were told to do—they
study, they pass tests, and eventually their love of learning is gone.
The feedback that they previously have gotten from accomplishing a
real goal, one that they truly had held, has been replaced by pleasing
the teacher, or getting a good grade, or progress in their goal of getting
into a “good college.”
Designers (and teachers) of courses must contend with this truth:
The students that you have may not want to learn what it is that you
want to teach.
What to do?
1
2 Teaching Minds
First, we must establish whether students can learn whatever it
is that you want to teach. I always wanted to teach my daughter to
throw a ball properly. She threw a football astonishingly well at the
age of 6. But, she never got it about how to throw a softball. I don’t
know why. She just couldn’t learn to do it right. She can’t do math
either. Believe me, I tried.
Second, we must determine whether what you want to teach can
be taught. Not everything can be taught. It is hard to learn to be a
nice guy if you are inclined to be nasty. You can learn to be nicer, or
at least to fake it, perhaps, but certain things are hard to learn after
a certain age. You can teach a 2-year-old to be nice—a 22-year-old is
another story.
Third, we must figure out what method of learning actually would
teach what we want to teach. This is an important question that is
made more important, in part, by the fact that the learning methods
available in schools tend to be of a certain type. The things that
schools desire to teach are of a type that conforms to the available
methodologies for teaching. Content that lies outside the range of the
currently available methodologies typically is not considered something
worth teaching.
Fourth, we must decide whether a selected learning methodology
actually will work, given the time constraints and abilities of the students,
and other constraints that actually exist. This is, of course, the
real problem in education. It is easy to say that students would learn
better if they had real experiences to draw upon. This isn’t that hard to
figure out. What is hard is implementing this idea within the time constraints
of the school day and the other demands of the school year.
Fifth, we must determine a way that will make what you want to
teach fit more closely with real-life goals that your students actually
may have. By real-life goals I mean things like walking and talking
(and later driving). Why is it that teachers, or more accurately school
systems and governments, want to teach things that are not in accord
with a student’s real interest? While we argue about how best to
teach algebra, no one ever asks what to do if a student doesn’t want to
learn algebra. The question is so weird; the possibility that you could
skip algebra because it doesn’t interest you is so remote that we don’t
even think about this in any way. What is the real cause of this problem?
Why can’t we just let students learn what interests them? Are the
people who run schools simply out of touch with how learning really
works or how actual students behave when faced with something they
Cognitive Process-Based Education 3
don’t want to learn, or is something else more complex going on?
I will summarize these five issues as follows:
ABILITY
POSSIBILITY
METHODOLOGY
CONSTRAINTS
GOAL ALIGNMENT
School is subject-based and, further, those subjects are predefined and
agreed upon by those in charge. Without giving a history of how this
state of affairs came to be, 1 or why it is an issue, it is first necessary to
note that it is the case. I say this because when we were students in
school, we accepted the fact that school was the way it was, and we
assumed that it was the way it was supposed to be. We may not think
each subject we learn is valuable or interesting, and perhaps we long
to learn different subjects, but never do we hear people suggest that
there shouldn’t be subjects in school at all. This is a very difficult idea
to swallow. There have always been subjects. What else would there
be? What would it mean to not have subjects?
Answering this question is the aim of this book. We need to understand
what goes on in schools and what might be preferable. The issue
really is not schooling at all. The real issue is how learning actually
takes place in the human mind.
Ask a student how he is doing in school and he will tell you the
subjects he likes. I like English but I am bad at math, he might say. This
is such a normal sentiment among students that we never think about
how weird a sentiment it really is. We don’t ask: How are you doing at
life? We could ask that of a teenager and she might say: I am good at
dating but bad at driving.
But, actually, you would never hear teenagers say something like
that. This is weird because, in general, dating and driving are much
more important subjects in a teenager’s world than English and math.
But they don’t talk about whether they are good at it or bad at it in
the same way.
They continue to practice and get better at those things because
they care about them. Saying, I am bad at math, means, in essence,
. . . and I don’t care and have stopped trying because I don’t see the point.
Saying, I am good at English, typically means, I am getting a good grade
in English. This state of affairs defines the main problem in education:
4 Teaching Minds
There are subjects that are school subjects and there are subjects
that are life subjects and teenagers can tell the difference. They
work harder at the life subjects.
And, what is the difference between these two kinds of subjects? Goals.
It is as simple as that.
Instead of simply saying what is wrong with schools and what
teenagers are really like in school, I want to take a different tack.
Some teenagers wake up in the morning wanting to learn history
or algebra but they are a very small minority of the school population.
There is no minority, however, when it comes to dating or driving for
teenagers. They all want to do these things. So the question I want to
ask is:
Are there other things that all teenagers want to do and are those
things connected in some way with learning?
Or, to put this another way, if school had been designed around
something other than subjects, what would it have been designed
around? Driving and dating, which we know are winners in a teenager’s
world, could be seen as subjects, or they could be seen as instances
of something else, and that something else might be something
important to learn.
Students everywhere might want to learn whatever that is and they
would work hard to learn it. If we can turn the question around in that
way, maybe we can design better learning situations for everybody.
So, the question is:
What are driving and dating instances of, with respect to learning?
Or, to address this from the cognitive science point of view:
What is it that students are doing when they learn to drive
and date that they might be getting better at while doing those
things?
Can we view whatever it is they are getting better at as an example
of the kinds of things we should want to teach and that students
should want to learn? Answering these questions will allow us to
Cognitive Process-Based Education 5
look at education in a new way. We need to think about how people
actually learn, regardless of the subject, in order to address them.
Let’s think about dating, then. I was never any good at it as a kid.
I know how the non-cool guys feel. But, later on, much later on, I got
very good at it. So, I must have learned something. What?
What was I bad at as a kid? Meeting girls, for one thing. Other kids
could do it easily. I always needed to be fixed up.
Talking to girls, for another. I hardly knew any girls. I went to an
all-boys high school. I was 16 when I went to college and the other
freshmen were 18, so that didn’t help either. In other words, I had no
confidence.
But mostly, I had no idea what to say to a girl. What did they talk
about?
And, one more thing. I really didn’t get the point. I didn’t know
why one wanted to go out with girls anyway. I mean I eventually got
the idea, at least I think I did.
Why am I saying it this way? I am trying to get an insight into the
learning process and I am a fine example. I didn’t know how to do it
and then I did. I didn’t get the point and then I did, sort of. So I must
have learned something between the ages of 16 and 60. What?
Here are some things I learned:
• Human relationships are important, but they aren’t easy
to establish or maintain. They require work.
• The work involves, among other things, learning how to
listen and respond to the needs of another human being.
It involves subjugating one’s own interests from time to
time for the interests of another.
• Girls, and later women, feel good. Being with someone
who loves you feels good. Learning to love feels good.
More than feeling good, these things are critical for
staying alive. This is not so obvious when you are
surrounded by love from your family. But eventually you
are alone, and alone is not so much fun.
As this is not a chapter on love, I will stop there. Suffice it to say
that I learned how to meet girls, how to gain their interest, and how to
form relationships with them. I also learned why I wanted to do that.
Now let’s see what we have learned about learning from my little
diversion into teenage angst.
6 Teaching Minds
We have learned that learning about how other people behave is
very important.
We have learned that learning about one’s own emotions and
feelings is very important.
We have learned that building confidence is very important.
We have learned that learning to listen is very important.
We also have learned that learning how to express oneself is very
important.
Now let’s go back to discussing learning.
Why is it that teenagers are more interested in thinking about dating
than they are in thinking about algebra? Why is it that they don’t
rate themselves on their success in dating in the same way as they do
when they are discussing how they are doing in science?
What do teenagers know about learning that their school doesn’t
know?
This is it:
Teenagers know that the issues I have mentioned above will be
important for them for the rest of their lives in a large variety of
arenas, not just dating.
No matter what they do in life they will need to form relationships,
assess their own abilities, gain confidence through practice, learn to
listen, learn to love, try things out and see how well they work, and
learn why they do what they do. To put this another way:
Dating is way more important than algebra and every teenager
knows it.
Dating is much more important not because teenagers have raging
hormones and they crave sex, as this phenomenon often is described.
It is important because what they learn while dating serves them in
many areas in life and relates strongly to who they will be and how
well their lives will go.
Algebra relates to none of this and they know that too.
So, let me ask a simple question:
If we must have subjects in school, why wouldn’t dating be rated
as way more important than mathematics?
Cognitive Process-Based Education 7
The answer to this is simple enough. School was not designed to help
kids live better lives. That was never the point. But shouldn’t it be? 2
From a cognitive growth point of view, school wasn’t even designed
to teach us things that relate to learning per se.
Scholars designed the subject matter of the current school system.
You hear sportscasters describe football players as scholar-athletes. Really?
Scholars? Why would that be what we are seeking to create? There
are only so many jobs for scholars, and while scholarship is very nice,
it ought not be the goal we seek in school in a system of universal
education.
Yes, but dating? Is that the subject I am proposing? Really?
Let me explain the real issue here. Take a look at the items I
mentioned above.
We have learned that learning about how other people behave is
very important.
We have learned that learning about one’s own emotions and
feelings is very important.
We have learned that building confidence is very important.
We have learned that learning to listen is very important.
We also have learned that learning how to express oneself is very
important.
Now, I will transform these slightly:
Students need to learn about how other people behave and why,
and they need to learn how to interact with different kinds of
people.
Students need to learn about their own emotions and feelings
and how to deal with them.
Students need to learn how to rely on themselves and feel
confident in their own abilities.
Students need to learn how to listen to others and really hear
what they are saying.
Students need to learn how to express themselves effectively.
Now this list doesn’t seem so crazy, does it? In fact, most parents will
tell you that they try very hard to teach all these things to their children.
So one argument might be that the school doesn’t have to do it,
since parents do it.
8 Teaching Minds
Another argument might be that if the schools worked on these
issues, they would have students memorize the 12 principles for building
self-confidence and learn to express themselves by analyzing classics
in world literature.
Here is the key point:
These issues, the ones that could be learned from dating,
transcend all aspects of our lives.
And, more important, students know this. I started with the idea that
learning begins with a goal. The points I listed above are goals that
teenagers actually have. They would not have to be talked into those
goals. Moreover those goals are, as all students know anyway, way
more important than algebra. They aren’t interested in becoming
scholars.
Now let’s consider the cognitive science behind this. Everything
we do as human beings is goal-directed. We go for a walk for a reason,
we shower for a reason, we get a job for a reason, we talk to people
we meet for a reason. We pursue goals as soon as we are born. We try
hard to learn to walk, talk, get along with our family, get our needs
satisfied, and find out what we like and what we don’t like. We do
this from birth. If school related to the goals that children actually
had, that they were working on at the very moment that they entered
school, school would seem like a natural and helpful experience. Students
wouldn’t stress about satisfying their teachers any more than
they stressed about satisfying their parents when they were learning
to walk and talk. Yes, they want to please their parents, but that is not
exactly the same thing.
People know what their goals are and they know when something
they are being offered, a parasailing lesson or a pomegranate, for example,
doesn’t fit with their goals. They can be convinced to try out
a new activity that they believe will not satisfy any of their goals, but
for the most part it is difficult to convince them that weird things that
were not on their goal list actually should be on the list. We say things
to students like, “You will need this later.” But this is usually a boldfaced
lie. You don’t need algebra later. Making up nonsense convinces
nobody.
There is a more important issue here. Later on in this book I will
detail the 12 kinds of learning that make up what it means to learn. If
Cognitive Process-Based Education 9
you get good at learning these things, you get good at what life has to
offer. The list above is a partial list of the group of learning processes
that I detail in Chapter 4. It is really quite important. I have used dating
as a simple way of explaining it because no one has to explain why
that matters to a teenager. Teenagers know that they have to learn the
processes that I discuss in Chapter 4. As things are now, these important
issues are not considered significant enough to deal with seriously
in school. World history is always considered more important. But
why should that be the choice?
Earlier, I mentioned that students want to learn how to drive as
well as how to date. This is a pretty universal goal that teenagers have
so we should ask of it as well whether it is important and what it
might be an instance of that is inherently significant in real life.
On the surface, driving seems a skill that is an important part of
daily life. So, one is led to ask why driving isn’t a school subject? The
answer is that it is. Driver’s education has been taught in schools for
many years. Not every school offers it, but many do. So what is the
problem? It is just a useful skill, not a scholarly subject, so surely I
am not suggesting that it is more important than physics. That is, of
course, exactly what I am suggesting.
In our test-driven society, when driver’s ed is taught, it is taught
with a clear goal and a clear notion of success. When a student has
passed the tests and gotten her driver’s license, everyone is satisfied.
Well, not everyone. I was once called in on a consulting assignment
for a university hospital that was working on a study to prevent
teenage car accidents. The study was funded by an insurance company
that would have been happy to pay out less in damages and, presumably,
also thought fewer dead kids would be a generally good thing.
What is the problem?
Students may have their licenses but they don’t know much about
driving and responsibility. It wouldn’t be a shock to anyone to know
that kids drink and drive, text message and drive, and generally yell
and scream and goof around while driving. They often die from this
behavior. Could we teach them not to do that? The answer always
seems to be to put up posters that say don’t drink and drive and to
make them watch scary movies about car accidents. The school system
strikes again.
If we tell them, then they will do it, never seems to work, but we keep
trying.
10 Teaching Minds
I often have used the Department of Motor Vehicles (the DMV) as
an example of the best there is in testing. They have two tests. Dumb
multiple choice questions that make no sense and a real test that tests
to see whether you can drive. Schools typically don’t have the real test
at all, one that tests to see whether you actually can do something, so
the DMV at least is smarter than the school system.
But the real issue is something else entirely. Driving is an instance
of a piece of very complex behavior that exemplifies one of the ways
in which we learn. Perhaps more important, driving entails a great
deal of other things, which could be learned and should be learned.
A simple example of this is car mechanics. Once upon a time
schools taught kids to fix cars as well as to drive them. Perhaps they
still do. But vocational subjects like that have been relegated to the
back burner of education so that more testable subjects can be taught.
Also, cars have gotten more difficult to fix. This is too bad, because
if car mechanics were required instead of physics, students actually
might learn science.
What do I mean by this?
When we hear an outcry about the nation’s need to make children
learn science, no one ever asks why. The standard answer, if this is
ever asked, is that science is important in tomorrow’s world or some
such nonsense. Push harder and you might get some remarks along
the lines that soon all the scientists will be Indian and Chinese, which
may be the real fear of those who push science in the United States. To
address this question properly, one has to ask what exactly is meant
by “science.”
Imagine that you are a student working on fixing a car in a car
mechanics class. As I write this I am imagining a scene from the musical
Grease, which was set in the 1950s when there actually were cars
to work on in school. I never got to work on a car because I went to a
science high school where such a thing would be looked down upon.
So when I graduated from high school and drove to college and my car
broke down, I hadn’t the slightest idea what to do. I wish I could tell
you that at least I understood the physics of the engine but I didn’t. I
just knew F = MA and other stuff that wasn’t going to help me fix my
engine.
Now let me ask you, how is fixing one’s car engine like fixing
one’s air conditioning or plumbing? The answer to this question has
Cognitive Process-Based Education 11
embodied within it what it means to do science. When science means
learning facts about science, we are talking about useless information
that is readily forgotten after the test. I have no idea why anyone
learns to balance chemical equations or apply physics formulas or
learns about biology classifications in high school. None of this is of
any use to most adults. (It is easy to test, however.)
When the stuff that is being taught does not relate to the inherent
goals of the students, it will be forgotten. You can count on it.
Why this stuff is taught is simply that it derives from a conception of
science prevalent in the 1890s that has not been modified since. It is
defended by people as a way to produce more scientists, which makes
no sense since it probably deters more students from entering science
than it encourages.
Scientific reasoning, on the other hand, is worth teaching.
Why?
Because car mechanics, plumbers, doctors, and crime investigators,
to name four random professions, all do scientific reasoning on a daily
basis. As a society we anoint only doctors with the glory of doing
actual scientific reasoning. The other professions get less glamorous
interpretations. But they are all doing the same stuff. This is what they
are doing:
They are taking a look at evidence and trying to determine the
probable causes of the conditions that they have found.
To do this one must know what causes what in the real world, which
is science; what counts as evidence of known conditions, which is science;
and previous cases that are similar and that any good scientist
must know. So while we may not think of a plumber as doing scientific
reasoning, that is exactly what he is doing.
Science is about creating hypotheses and gathering evidence to
support or refute those hypotheses. Children are natural scientists.
They often try stuff out—skipping rocks on the water or dropping
stones from the roof or lighting things on fire—to see what happens.
But there is more to science than trying stuff out. One must seek explanations
and make sure those explanations are correct. Knowing what
constitutes a correct explanation is really the essence of what scientific
knowledge is about. But notice that there are correct explanations for
12 Teaching Minds
hypotheses in plumbing as well as in medicine and that these explanations
exist for repairing a faulty engine and for understanding who
committed a crime. It is all scientific reasoning.
The difference between plumbing and medicine is in the complexity
of the science. Not a lot of invention goes on in plumbing and
there aren’t all that many explanations to choose from. The degree of
difficulty in understanding what is going on and why is what separates
those fields and makes one science and one not. But the basic
thought processes are the same.
This is important to notice because all these areas of inquiry are
what we might call diagnostic.
So, and this is the important part, the real issue from a cognitive
science point of view is not in teaching science per se, but in teaching
scientific activities, one of which is diagnosis. And, since diagnosis is a
similar process no matter what you are diagnosing, it makes sense that
all through school, diagnosis would be a subject, and not physics or
literature. The things that children are asked to diagnose might start
with things little kids like, like finding out what is wrong with their
pets or their toys, and then move on to things bigger kids like, like cars
and crime, and then move on to large issues, like why a business has
failed or why our foreign policy doesn’t work.
Diagnosis matters a great deal in our lives, yet it is not a subject in
school. This is not surprising because the origins of the school subject
areas, as I have said, are scholarly. But if we want to teach children to
do things that matter and we want to retain their interest because they
know intrinsically that these things do matter, then we must have
them practice diagnosis all through their school lives, in a variety of
venues that correlate with their interests. They don’t all have to diagnose
the same stuff. It is the diagnostic process itself that matters, not
what is diagnosed.
I have been using the word subject for an idea like diagnosis but it
is not a subject and should not be seen that way. I have been using the
word only to contrast it to existing subjects in school. Diagnosis is a
fundamental cognitive activity. Cavemen did diagnosis. They may not
have done it well, but they did it well enough to continue the species.
The diagnostic process is as old as people. Knowing why, being able to
prove a hypothesis, is a fundamental cognitive process.
School needs to be organized around fundamental cognitive activities.
It would be easy to demean what I have said here by saying
Cognitive Process-Based Education 13
I want to teach kids to date and drive better. What kind of school is
that?
But this trivializes the point. I do want to teach students to date
and drive better. But these are just a few instantiations of general cognitive
processes. Forming human relationships and figuring out what
is going in the physical world are two of many very important cognitive
abilities that manifest themselves in myriad ways in real life.
A properly designed school system needs to focus on cognitive
abilities, not scholarly subjects. Kids will recognize instantly that these
activities are the ones they know how to do and that they need to get
better at. If we allow them to choose what areas of knowledge they
would like to focus on while learning these skills, they would be attentive
and interested students. No more ADHD. Poof!
A society that organized schools around cognitive abilities would
become one where people were used to thinking about what they did
and how and why they did it. They would not find school stressful or
boring.
This wouldn’t be a bad thing.

CHAPTER 2
Teaching Kids to Walk and Talk
Failure is instructive. The person who really thinks learns quite
as much from his failures as from his successes.
—John Dewey
Teaching is a serious issue. Teachers matter. Or at least they should matter.
But we have the sense that it is the job of the teacher to tell us stuff.
Students expect it and teachers do it. Often, teachers get criticized if
they do anything else. And, this is pretty much the beginning and the
end of the problem with teaching. We force teachers to teach wrong.
I am beyond the age where I have little kids that I have to teach
how to walk and talk. But when I did, I don’t remember preparing
any lesson plans. In a cognitive process-based model of education, all
teaching looks like the teaching you do when you teach your children
to walk and talk.
Lately I have been personally interested in being taught. This is
because at the age of 55 I started to play softball in an old guys’ softball
league in Florida. I discovered I wasn’t really very good. This was a bit
surprising since I had played in the university softball leagues while I
was a professor and had stopped playing only in my 40s. I wasn’t a bad
player then. There hadn’t been that long a hiatus. And, I was playing
against people a good deal older than myself since I am rather young
as recent Florida transplants go. I used to be a good hitter and I wasn’t
now. The reason was easy enough to understand. In the university
leagues they play fast pitch. A batter has a second or so to decide about
swinging. It is all instinct. At least it was after having played for 40
some odd years.
But, in Florida, old guys play slow pitch. The pitcher throws the
ball in a high looping arc and it is a strike if it lands on the plate. Quite
a different experience from trying to hit a ball that is zinging by your
head. Should be easier, no? Not for me. It took a bit of thinking to
figure out why.
15
16 Teaching Minds
I analyzed how I was swinging, when I was swinging, and what
kinds of pitches I was swinging at, and I came to many different conclusions.
I realized I needed to wait longer before I swung. I realized I
had to stop swinging at inside pitches (the ones that almost hit you).
I realized that I had to stop swinging at pitches that looked good but
yet dropped in front of my feet. I realized I had to see the ball hit the
“sweet spot” on the bat. I realized I needed to change my whole approach
to hitting, in fact.
OK. I realized a lot. I had come to many conclusions. Now what?
Just do it, right? Aha. Not so simple.
You can’t just do what you know you should do. Why not? Because
your subconscious isn’t listening to what you have to say. This is
why you don’t tell a little kid how to walk and talk. Apart from the fact
that he wouldn’t understand you anyway, even if he could understand
you, the part of his mind that would be doing the understanding is
the conscious part. Cognitive process-based teaching teaches nonconscious
processes a good deal of the time.
A child learns a lot more from falling down than he ever will learn
from hearing Mom say, “Watch your step.”
We are wired to learn from failure. Those who don’t learn from
failure typically die young. We are descended from people who learned
not to eat certain poisonous plants, and not to travel in a way that
would expose them to danger, and to stay near their mates, and to
protect their offspring. Those who didn’t do these things, those who
didn’t learn from their own failures and from the failures of others,
didn’t get to have surviving offspring. The human race exists precisely
because it is capable of learning from failure, both individually and
collectively.
Did you ever wonder why what you learned in school isn’t still in
your head, or why you can’t remember what your wife wanted you to
get from the store on your way home? Or, why the things you have
decided to do to improve your business or make more money or be a
better person actually don’t ever get executed? The answer is simple:
You can’t learn by listening—not from teachers, not from your wife,
not from helpful suggestions from wise people, and not even from
yourself.
Why not? Because it is your subconscious that is in charge of executing
daily activities—from swinging a bat, to driving home, to talking
to people you want to make an impression on, to getting along
with your wife. Your conscious mind can make decisions, but your
Teaching Kids to Walk and Talk 17
subconscious pretty well does what it is in the habit of doing. The
subconscious is a habit-driven processor.
Bad habits, as they say, are hard to break. Actually, all habits, good
or bad, are hard to break. A new swing is really hard to develop, as is a
new way of selling, or a new way of treating people, or driving a new
route home.
This is the real use of education: the creation of new habits. This
can be done in only one way. The subconscious learns in only one
way.
The subconscious learns by repeated practice.
The only teaching that can work, then, is the kind of mentoring that
helps someone execute better while they are practicing.
How is a high school football coach different from a high school
history teacher?
Before we attempt to answer this question, we need to consider
why it is an important question to consider. In general, I think most
people would agree that the behavior of these two types of teachers is
likely to be quite different. In our mind’s eye, we see images of yelling
and crude behavior versus refined lecture and discussion. But let’s get
beyond the superficial stereotypes and think about what they teach
rather than their style of teaching it.
The history teacher at his worst teaches facts, and at his best teaches
careful analysis of sources of facts.
The football coach at his worst teaches that someone could never
possibly do something, and at his best coaches someone to do something
better.
The history teacher teaches the conscious. The football coach
teaches the subconscious.
This makes sense if we view education (in school) as a conscious
affair. It certainly seems to be a conscious affair. We discuss history,
we don’t do history. And, it makes sense in football since the coach
doesn’t need players who can discuss football—he needs players who
can execute.
It begins to make less sense when we consider how the conscious
and the subconscious interact.
As long as we see ourselves as rational beings who can think logically
and make carefully reasoned decisions about our daily lives,
then education indeed should be about the promotion of reasoned
18 Teaching Minds
deliberation and the gaining of knowledge that will enhance our ability
to reason. But suppose this conception we have of ourselves and
our ability to reason logically is simply wrong?
Our entire education system depends on this debate. Actually the
word debate is really not right here as there is no debate. The other
side, the side that says we need to teach our unconscious because our
conscious isn’t capable of listening, has not really been expressed directly
very often. It is, however, indirectly referred to often enough.
Plato comments:
The most important part of education is right training in the
nursery. The soul of the child in his play should be guided to
the love of that sort of excellence in which when he grows up to
manhood he will have to be perfected.
Why should this be the case? Why should it be in the nursery where
real training takes place? And, what kind of training could the nursery
provide—the kind of the football coach or the kind of the history
teacher? And, what can we learn about education by considering seriously
what Plato said?
The principles of learning in childhood are rather simple really.
The first and most important part of an analysis of early childhood
learning is an understanding of where the motivation comes from.
If learning starts with a goal, as we have said, one question is, What
goals do children have and how do they happen to have them?
When people mention motivation, the word reward often is added
into the discussion. What kinds of rewards do children receive and to
what extent are these involved in learning? Bear in mind that there
are three kinds of rewards: intrinsic, extrinsic, and systemic. If it makes
me happy, I don’t need you to tell me I did well. If the activity doesn’t
really matter to me (an algebra test, for example), I will need some
outside reward to even try. When do kids learn because of the use of
external rewards? If I do well on an algebra test, it might be that it
gives me intrinsic happiness to know I did well at algebra. As a mathoriented
kid, I did get that kind of reward. It also makes you happy
when your parents are proud of you. And it makes you happy when
your grades win you admission into Yale or get you something else
you might want. Which types of rewards figure into early childhood
learning and what can we learn from this about learning? And, what
will this tell us about teaching?
Teaching Kids to Walk and Talk 19
Let’s start with walking and talking.
Walking and talking are intrinsically rewarding. No kid needs encouragement
to do either. They do have to be discouraged from crying
when a word will serve them better. I want milk works better than wah.
But they learn this quite naturally without very much parental help.
They learn to walk when their parents hold their hands and cheer
when they succeed, but they would have learned to walk anyway.
The parents’ role as the teachers of their children can be seen very
clearly when we consider walking and talking. Kids can learn to do
either without much help, but they do these things quicker and better
with parental help. Children who are spoken to by their parents, and
listened to and corrected when they make an error, learn to speak well
and more clearly as adults. While everyone learns to walk, parental
care prevents falls when steps and other hazards present themselves.
So, is the parent teaching the child? What does the parent actually
know about how to teach walking and talking? Actually the parent
knows quite a bit about teaching. We are wired to teach our children
and help them. All higher level animals do this as well. It is not a particularly
conscious process.
So, at what point are children better taught by professional teachers
instead of their parents? This is an important and interesting question.
A professional teacher is better than a parent if and only if the
teacher knows more about what is being taught than the parent does.
Teachers may take education courses and that may seem to qualify
them to teach, but really those courses are not so much about the art
of teaching per se. Teachers learn to teach by teaching, like anyone
else learns how to do anything. But teachers learn to teach in the
system they find themselves in. This means that typically they learn
how to manage classrooms and deal with administrators and handle
various issues that are very specific to school.
Teaching outside of school usually does not entail managing multiple
children nor should it entail dealing with state standards and other
governmental interference (although that often happens anyway).
So, knowledge is the real issue in teaching, not teaching skill. Or
so it would seem.
Actually this idea is clearly wrong if one thinks about university
teaching. Professors become professors by writing a Ph.D. thesis, not
by learning anything about teaching. They may have some teaching
experience prior to becoming professors because they may have
taught an introductory course or two as graduate students, but nobody
20 Teaching Minds
teaches them how to teach. In fact, professors are not qualified to
teach since they know nothing about teaching. They are hired by universities
because of their research credentials, and teaching doesn’t
matter much. There is some lip service about the subject but no one
ever got hired at Yale as a professor because she was a great teacher
who did no research.
Here is a professor of computer science from a very highly ranked
Big Ten university (he does not want his name mentioned):
Every faculty member in the Department of Computer Science
at my university thinks that their small insignificant area is
important enough that all undergraduates must take a course in
it. When you add all those courses up there is simply no time
for a student to do anything other than take crazy courses in
subdisciplines represented by the faculty in the department.
Everybody’s course is a sacred cow. If you tried to put something
new in, something would have to come out, and no faculty
member wants his course to be eliminated.
Professors are not there because they are good teachers.
I certainly knew nothing about teaching when I became a professor
at Stanford many years ago. But I hated seeing students bored and
miserable and started to think about what the problem was and how
I could fix it. Many professors do exactly this. They want to be good
at something they do regularly and their pride makes them into good
teachers. Not all professors do this, by any means. What does it mean
to become a good teacher in that context?
Professors are rated for their teaching ability. It is clear if one looks
at those ratings what the criteria are from the students’ perspective.
They rate the friendliness, fairness, enthusiasm, and even the “hotness”
of their teachers. These ratings have been studied extensively and
conclusions like this one are typical:
While student evaluations of faculty performance are a valid
measure of student satisfaction with instruction, they are not by
themselves a valid measure of teaching effectiveness. If student
evaluations of faculty are included in the evaluation process of
faculty members, then they should represent only one of many
measures that are used. 1
Teaching Kids to Walk and Talk 21
Professors and universities are very concerned about the evaluations
of the teaching of the faculty and these days websites (like www.ratemyprofessors.com)
make a very public show of how badly received
some professors are. The professors are concerned with how they appear
and whether they are liked and how all this might affect their
salaries. They are not concerned with teaching effectiveness because
they are not really teachers in their own minds.
Let’s hear from an Ivy League professor (who also doesn’t want to
be named):
There are faculty here who study real-world phenomena and
don’t know how to apply that knowledge to their own lives. We
could teach students here how to make use of what we teach
in their own lives, we just don’t. Right now the approach that
is taken makes most of the information that professors impart
useless. It doesn’t have to be that way.
My colleagues here don’t even do what they are studying
when they are out of the lab. They are not successful people in
life. If someone studying memory had to remember something,
would they make use of their own data? I doubt it. Many of our
professors don’t realize that they may not know as much as they
think they know. All these people assume that whatever they do
is the best that can be done.
When a child learns to walk, you cannot say you were very good at
teaching her to walk. She would have learned to walk without your
help, most likely. When you teach a child to play baseball, you can
more easily say that you were a good teacher, but really who knows
you didn’t screw him up with nonsense that it may take him years to
undo? I was taught to step into the pitch in baseball and years later
learned that what I was taught was wrong.
College professors can be evaluated on effectiveness only if someone
knows what that means. Does it mean how well students do on
exams? We can make easier exams then. Does it mean how many of
them get into Ph.D. programs at Harvard or how many get good jobs
upon graduation? That likely has nothing to do with the effectiveness
of the professors.
There are no measures that make sense, for a very simple reason.
College teaching doesn’t make much sense in the first place. Lecturing
22 Teaching Minds
and giving grades is certainly not a paradigm that any parent would
use. You don’t grade your child on speaking ability; you help her speak
better. If it takes longer to do that, then it does. Even the DMV doesn’t
care about effective teaching. It doesn’t give grades, just licenses. Can
you do it well? is the question the DMV is charged with answering. But
can you do it well? isn’t a meaningful question in the top universities
because there is typically nothing, other than research, that anyone is
really being taught to do.
This leaves us in a quandary when it comes to understanding what
it means to teach well. Here is the Ivy League professor again:
People need to learn to generalize the information that they are
given. They need to learn how to think about content in order
to see how that content may or may not be true for them. We do
not do that here. Instead we teach that this is the way it is done.
We have kids at mediocre universities who don’t know the
facts and then we have kids at the good schools who know the
facts but very few who know that those facts are not necessarily
true. We need a different approach to knowledge than we
currently have. By having students memorize the facts, it makes
it seem as if the facts are truer than they actually are. We need to
teach students to attack the facts and not to replace them with
other facts.
If facts are taught here in this way, and we are setting the
standard, then we have a problem. Some faculty here actually do
teach in this way, but it is not the main culture. Even the hardcore
facts, like dates, are arguable. Students are not taught to use
the information they have to question other information.
If we are teaching something where there are no performance measures,
then effectiveness cannot be gauged. If the performance measurement
is based on an exam, this likely would not reflect on the
teacher’s ability at all. Some students do well on exams and others
don’t, even though they all hear exactly the same lectures. And, when
there are performance measures, it is not always clear that it was the
teacher who was in any way responsible for the success of the students
(or their failure).
So what is effective teaching?
Teaching Kids to Walk and Talk 23
If a teacher is better at teaching a child than a parent is, it must
be because the teacher knows something the parent doesn’t know or,
at least, doesn’t know how to teach. This makes the teacher more effective
than the parent, but for very uninteresting reasons. You can’t
teach what you don’t know, of course.
But knowledge alone is meaningless because teaching is not about
the transfer of knowledge. I realize that a great many people think that
this is what teaching is about; except if that were the issue, students
wouldn’t even think about rating their teachers on anything except
how much they knew. And, by the way, that is about the last thing
teachers are ever rated on.
For the most part, teachers are rated by students on how entertaining
they are. But entertainment and teaching are really not particularly
related. They are not unrelated because you can’t get through to
someone who has tuned you out. But you can entertain your students
and get great ratings and still teach them nothing.
Here is the Big Ten professor again:
At a big state university, which one would think has an
obligation to supply training to the students of that state in a
major field in which students can readily find employment,
the faculty could care less about that and they only want to
do graduate teaching. We teach courses that are modeled after
courses in the professor training schools like Harvard and MIT.
But how many professors do we need?
Superstars who bring a lot of funding are very important in
the university. The superstar system made sense when there were
superstars. But today how many of these superstars have really
big ideas? Does my school really have any superstars at all? I
don’t think so.
The School of Education, where I am also on the faculty,
has a research focus, which they do badly. Most of their
students plan to be teachers. But they teach them the literature
and not how to teach. It is the same situation as in computer
science. They really want their students to become professors of
education. They are not teaching teachers to teach because they
don’t care about that. They look down their noses at teacher
preparation schools. Ninety-eight percent of their undergraduates
24 Teaching Minds
want to become teachers but the faculty are focusing on their
graduate students. They don’t teach the teachers. They do it, but
it is not their focus.
The average professor of education here understands that he
is supposed to teach teachers to teach but he gets evaluated on
his research not on the quality of teachers who come out. It is
a research university. How many dollars do you bring in? How
much do you publish? Where would quality of teacher training
fit in that model?
So, again, what exactly is effective teaching? Let’s look at two of the longer
versions of what my former Ph.D. students and former employees
wrote to me when I asked about good teaching. These stories each need
some context in order to be understood, and then I will comment.
The first story is from a Ph.D. student of mine who then continued
to work with me for 30 more years.
You were collecting key things teachers needed to know to do
story curricula properly. Your contribution was “know when to
lie to students.” That triggered all kinds of discussion, pro and
con, leading eventually to a longer, more explicit statement
about knowing when to oversimplify, etc.
Reflecting on it later, I realized that “know when to lie to
students” was the right way to say it. The rephrased version was
too reasonable. It didn’t trigger any emotional reaction and reevaluation.
“Know when to lie” is a lie, but that’s the point.
Why is this story important? I placed it here because it reflects an
important belief that I hold about teaching. At the moment to which
he is referring, we were writing, as a group, a set of guidelines on how
to teach Socratically using the online curricula we were building for
high schools. We were, in essence, writing an instruction manual for
teachers on how to teach in a new way. When I supervise very smart
people who know perfectly well how to do things, I deliberately provoke
them. I believe that my job is to make them think. There is no
better way to make people think than by annoying them in a way that
makes them defend their point of view, especially when their point of
view may not have been well thought out.
Teaching Kids to Walk and Talk 25
It is important, when teaching Socratically, which is my preferred
methodology, to make students question their beliefs. No one is a better
teacher than a teacher who makes students wonder whether he has
been wrong about something.
Do I think that teachers should lie to students?
I think teachers should make students think harder than they
might have been capable of doing without the teachers. I also think
that teachers should not tell answers to students. Students do not learn
from memorizing answers. They learn from developing questions for
themselves that they then can begin to find answers to.
I believe that effective teaching makes . . .
students develop questions to which they then will seek answers
students look for answers from people other than the teacher
students confused and less certain than they were before
Now, I realize that these are pretty nonstandard ideas. That is, of
course, the point.
This next writer worked for me (after getting his Ph.D. elsewhere)
in the academic world and later in the business world.
Probably the most important lesson I learned from you was the
value of overstatement and oversimplification in communicating
ideas and getting people’s attention. I recently retired and was
roasted at my retirement party by a group of longtime employees
and there were some interesting anecdotes about what I’d taught
them about selling their ideas through management. Software
engineers are often uncomfortable making a point without
giving every possible nuance, caveat, and detail. This typically
causes management’s eyes to gloss over and their ideas never
get a fair hearing. So, I’ve (apparently relentlessly) encouraged
employees to make their points quickly and to use overstatement
and oversimplification as rhetorical devices. I’m still wincing
over the roasts that portrayed my predilection for interrupting
presenters and asking, “What’s your point?”—I learned that one
from you.
26 Teaching Minds
I most certainly taught the lessons this writer describes. I hated it
when students couldn’t get to the point and I frequently interrupted
them when they were speaking. In business, I make a point of saying
things that are very simple, which tends to upset people. I find this a
good way to start a conversation that addresses complex issues.
Of course, I never actually say any of this. I simply do it. The real
issue in teaching, by parents or by teachers or by anyone else, is the
model you present to the students. That model is presented by what
they see you do and how they see you act. They can choose to emulate
you or not. But a good teacher makes students think about how to
behave and about what works and what doesn’t.

This next writer is a professor at a major university. I hired him to be
on the faculty at Yale, which was his first academic job.
I teach by telling stories that are meaningful to me. I let them
see who I am and how I live. I let them see what is important
to me and why. To be a real teacher you have to let yourself be
vulnerable. The student needs to see that you are a human with
feelings and fears and goals. You are saying to students: This is
the way I do it; it fits with who I am; it helps me be successful;
and don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t do something.
Everyone wants to control you, but in the end, you have to be
you, for better or worse. So, don’t let anyone tell you that you
can’t do something.
I tell that story over and over and over again in different
ways. About my research, about my company, about my family. I
walk the talk.
And, the students have to see that there are consequences
of breaking the rules; that it costs; and the costs can be high

at times. But that’s part of the price of believing in yourself.
Sometimes you get hurt and then you have to pick yourself up
and try it again.

and he knows it.

The next writer worked for me as a writer for many years. Her main
career was, and is, as a concert musician.
My high school English teacher was a great teacher. He was
married to the Singer sewing machine heiress but committed
to teaching kids. He had us keep a writing journal and was just
excellent at helping me understand what was so personal to me
that others wouldn’t be able to connect (or perhaps just plain
sappy romantic drivel!) and what was “strong” and pertinent to
everyone. I still have the journal and wince at what I wrote but
still really admire his comments in the margins.
In the future, in a world where online learning begins to preempt
classroom teaching, mentoring will replace lecturing. Many teachers
know how to mentor but often they are not given the opportunity
or don’t take the time to do it. The teacher described above was a
personal writing mentor, which is about the only way you can teach
someone to write.

Here is the same woman, this time writing about how she learned
music.
My mentor, Otto-Werner Mueller, was conducting the Yale
Philharmonia in the 1970s—I met him as an undergrad in
Madison, WI. I attended his graduate seminars in Madison and
spent a lot of time with him while he was in New Haven. He
guest-conducted the Hartford Symphony (where I now work)
twice in the past few years. (He is 83 now.) I spent hours and
hours in “lab orchestra” watching him teach his conducting
students, both in Madison and at Yale. What always struck
me was how students were either so self-conscious they were
wooden, or how they’d try to imitate Otto (who at 6 feet, 7
inches had amazing stature) physically and couldn’t pull it off.
Very few were able to incorporate what he was teaching and then
make it their own.
I believe that effective teaching makes . . .
students look at what the teacher does and see how they can
imitate it in a way that is consonant with who they are
The next writer was a Ph.D. student of mine and is now a professor at
a major university.
Trust your intuitions. This was something you told many of
us over and over. It has had three meanings for me—first, that
the only right things to work on are those that I can imagine a
solution to; second, that whether a way of attacking something
is the right way or not, it will lead me to the right way; and
third, go out on a limb. I can’t say how I learned this except,
perhaps, through trusting your advice and then noticing that it
got me to success over and over again. It began to really sink in
when I had my own students. Often, the most interesting things
they brought to me were more intuitive than they were based
on what everyone else was saying. And I have had to reassure
people that their ideas are good and they should follow up on
them. Of course, there are also intuitions that my students have
that I don’t think are good, and I don’t advise them to follow
Teaching Kids to Walk and Talk 29
up on those. So I think I now believe in trusting intuitions that
someone I trust can also see value in, and for my students, trust
intuitions that someone they trust can also see value in.
I believe that effective teaching makes . . .
students trust their own intuitions
students trust their teacher’s advice
The final two are a little different from the others. I included them
because teaching is not always implicit, as the above stories indicate,
but sometimes explicit. The next writer was student of mine who is
now high up in a large corporation.
You taught me that you always start by collecting data—so basic,
but so often overlooked. I recall watching most of your papers
start by collection of data. I recall watching your criticisms of
work that was just abstraction on abstraction, with no data at
its roots. For the work I’m currently doing, I have a log of all the
types of entities (typically business or government enterprises),
interactions (typically business models or sustainability models),
and outcomes. I just gave five talks last week and used the
method of “start by collecting data” when introducing my work
and when being a critical thinker about the work of others that
was being presented to me.
This point is about how to do real research does not apply to everyone.
But a more general form of this advice is to start at the beginning,
which is usually useful advice. Knowing where the beginning is can
be complicated, however.

You taught me about the important role of explicit social
hierarchies in a learning environment. At Yale the hierarchy was
very clear and everyone knew exactly where they stood. You
pay your dues before you join the club and academia is chock
full of clubs. You taught this by both example and explanation.
Seeing a good clear example of a social hierarchy that works
(such as the one we had in our lab at Yale) gave me one level
of understanding, but I had to see what happens when the
hierarchy is not so obvious to truly appreciate the importance
of the whole concept. Any longstanding community will have a
social hierarchy, but it’s not always so obvious (especially when
the community likes to pretend it doesn’t exist), and that makes
it really hard on newcomers. I’ve seen some really stellar junior
faculty get into difficult tenure decisions because no one was
guiding them politically (or else they just blew it off). And more
recently I’ve been running into more and more students with
“entitlement issues” who just don’t seem to buy into any social
hierarchies. There is a lot of social commentary on why this is
happening and how the workplace needs to adjust to a whole
generation of kids who always got trophies.
I believe that effective teaching makes . . .
students understand where they fit in the world in which they
live
students understand how to get ahead in the world in which
they live
students understand the roles of those around them
There is certainly a great deal more that one could say about effective
teaching. Unfortunately, much has been written on effective teaching
that is not particularly helpful. Mostly it is politically correct advice
that is quite difficult to implement. Here are two lists that I found. The
first is from Learning to Teach in Higher Education. 1
1: Interest and explanation
2: Concern and respect for students and student learning
3: Appropriate assessment and feedback
Teaching Kids to Walk and Talk 31
4: Clear goals and intellectual challenge
5: Independence, control, and active engagement
6: Learning from students
The second is from a Michigan State website and was taken from a
book by Arthur W. Chickering and Zelda F. Gamson entitled Seven
Principles for Good Practice in Undergraduate Education. 2
Principle 1: Good practice encourages student–faculty contact
Principle 2: Good practice encourages cooperation among
students
Principle 3: Good practice encourages active learning
Principle 4: Good practice gives prompt feedback
Principle 5: Good practice emphasizes time on task
Principle 6: Good practice communicates high expectations
Principle 7: Good practice respects diverse talents and ways of
learning 3
Whenever I see phrases like diverse talents or ways of learning or active
learning or active engagement I am very distrustful of the advice
being offered. Active learning should mean learning by doing, but it
never does because learning by doing is very difficult to implement
in the university context (which is where this advice comes from). It
is easier to do it in 1st grade, but after a while the class has to sit still
and listen and that is not active learning no matter what the teaching
guides say. Different learning styles is usually a way of saying, “some
people are dumber than others,” which no one wants to say. What
bothers me most about these kinds of lists is that they avoid saying
what really needs to be said. It is nearly impossible to measure your
success as an effective teacher because the performance expectations
of students are almost always about test scores and very rarely about
actual production.
With this idea in mind, that effective teaching means helping students
do what it is they wanted to do and not what it is that you wanted
them to do, I will list the suggestions I have been scattering about
in this chapter. Bear in mind that this is not meant to be a complete
list. I got this list the way you saw, by interpreting things written by
students and former employees about their own experiences.

Effective teaching makes . . .

Now, taking my own advice about starting with the data and then classifying
it, let’s look at these rules as a group. What exactly are they suggestions
about? Broadly speaking, they fall into the following categories:
Helping students think:
students develop questions to which they then will seek
answers
students look for answers from people other than the teacher
Teaching Kids to Walk and Talk 33
students are confused and less certain than they were before
students think about the stories the teacher tells
Helping students observe and copy good behavior:

about whether copying this behavior would be a good idea
students think about what works and what doesn’t in the adult
world

Making students respect their advisors:
students believe that their teacher is not a phony, so they can

the value of what you tell them
Teaching students how and when to take action:
students think about what it means to put oneself on the line for
one’s own beliefs
students understand how to begin a process
Teaching students to be good critics of their own work:
students look more carefully at the work that they themselves
have produced

Teaching students their place in the world and how to succeed
in that world:
students understand where they fit in the world in which they live
students understand how to get ahead in the world in which
they live
students understand the roles of those around them
34 Teaching Minds
Effective teaching, then, means teaching these things:
How to be a critic
Whom to respect and copy
How to know where you fit
How to take action
How to think
The relevant question for a teacher, then, is: Does your teaching result
in students who can do the five things listed above? There are many
ways to get those things to happen for students. These, however, typically
do not include lecturing, being entertaining, giving easy grades
or easy tests, or marching students through boring exercises that teach
them the truth.
Effective teaching is made much easier, of course, if what you are
trying to teach is something worth learning. So, let’s move on to discussing
that.
CHAPTER 3
What Can’t You Teach?
Nothing in education is so astonishing as the amount of ignorance
it accumulates in the form of inert facts.
—Henry B. Adams
When children are born, they come with distinct personalities. Ask
any mother of a second child. “It even behaved differently in the
womb,” she will say. One kid is aggressive while the other is contemplative.
One kid is constantly talking while the other hardly says a
word. One kid is shy while the other is outgoing.
Often, when we think about teaching and learning, we have the
idea that if we want someone to do something, or know something,
or behave in a certain way, all we have to do is teach it to them. So we
teach kids to appreciate music, when they may have no interest in,
or inclinations toward, music at all, or to act in the class play, when
they are simply bad at acting, or to throw a baseball when they simply
can’t do it and don’t care. Often, but not always, we are forgiving of
the differences between people and their individual talents and we
acknowledge that she is tone deaf, or he will always throw poorly, and
we give up.
Small children are like sponges. They ask questions constantly
and, if they have reasonable parents, get answers. The belief system
that children adopt is usually quite similar to that of their parents.
They don’t decide to try out a different religion at age 5; they do what
they have always known. They eat what they were fed and they like
to go to places they have been taken. Parents influence every aspect of
a child’s belief system. Because of that, we have the sense that we can
teach children anything, but this gets less true as they get older. The
Jesuits have a saying about teaching a child before he is 7 and thus
producing the man he will become. There is some truth to this. If you
really learn honesty when you are 5, it is unlikely you will become a
crook. Your subconscious wouldn’t permit it.
35
36 Teaching Minds
Then, what is the role of the subconscious here? When a child is being
taught at 3, he is not being taught consciously. He does not memorize
rules for walking or talking and he does not learn anything very
much by consciously trying to learn. Rather, a child absorbs by constantly
practicing and then making that practice a part of who she is.
Later, when the subconscious attitudes about walking, talking,
relating to others, family values, and all the rest, are well within the
deep subconscious of the child, we begin the attempt to teach the
child consciously. We worry when we hear, for example, that:
About a quarter of teens questioned in the broad survey weren’t
able to correctly identify Adolph Hitler as Germany’s chancellor
during World War II. About 20 percent couldn’t say whom
America fought in that war. 1
More than a quarter wrongly believed Columbus sailed to the New
World after 1750. Half didn’t know whom Senator Joseph McCarthy
investigated. And a third had no clue the Bill of Rights is the source
of freedoms of religion and speech. Nearly a third couldn’t tell you
who said in a famous speech: “Ask not what your country can do for
you . . . .”
Until a child enters school, he has been learning things that are
useful to him. He knows where his toys are and how to play with
them; he knows how to get food; he knows how to get his parents to
do what he wants (perhaps); he knows how to entertain himself. In
short, he has learned what he has learned because he has found his
new abilities to be of value.
And the history cited above? Of what value is it to know about
Joe McCarthy? Not only is it of no value to a child, but what we know
about McCarthy is slanted by whoever is writing the history and biased
by whatever point the person is trying to make. It is all very well
to tell students the truth about what happened in the past and assume
that they will learn from it, and therefore not repeat it, but we can’t
easily know the truth and they are not likely to learn much from the
telling anyhow.
Pundits scream and yell about what children don’t know. The
question is: Why do they need to know it? If the answer is that it
makes the system happy that they know certain facts while not making
the child in any way happier, we all can guess how well that is
going to turn out.
What Can’t You Teach? 37
The bottom line here is one of initial belief systems and
fundamental personality characteristics, coupled with the notion of
truly held goals. You cannot teach someone something that:
• does not help them achieve some goal they actually hold
• is not in line with their fundamental personality
characteristics
• goes against their subconscious beliefs
You can try, but you won’t succeed.
So the question of what you can’t teach, which is very important
when we think about teaching and learning, comes down to a question
of whom the child has become because of what she learned prior
to the age of 7, and what she was anyway when she exited the womb.
Those two things are powerful enough even if you don’t add in trying
to teach something that in no way relates to any goal the child has.
This is even more true for adults, of course. We can try to teach
adults things that are at odds with who they are as people, but good
luck with that.
Traits may come with the child, or they may have been learned
by the child prior to the age of 7, but it really makes no difference
when we are discussing teaching. Personality cannot be changed.
Core beliefs are very hard to change. Interests are hard to change,
although new ones can be found. Clinical psychologists try to make
small changes in these aspects of people but they have a very difficult
time doing it.
But my point here is to address an issue in education and training
that is not well understood. Simply stated it is this: It is not possible to
teach or train students to do things that are not in line with who they are as
people. This matters because much of what we try to teach in school
and train for in companies is an attempt to alter behavior.
I have been building what have come to be called e-learning systems
for about 25 years. Over the years, I have realized that there is
nothing new under the sun in the subject matter that e-learning systems
are asked to address. One of my least favorite subjects, one that
comes up frequently, is integrity and compliance. I have been asked
to work on this subject quite often. Usually what is being asked is impossible.
Most e-learning companies simply do what they are asked to
do by the client without pointing out—if they even know—that what
they are being asked to teach can’t be taught. Companies that need
38 Teaching Minds
to train their employees in such things, because of some regulation or
other, ask for it, and e-learning companies willingly build it.
Unfortunately, as my mother would have attested to, were she still
around, I was born with off-the-scale honesty. I can’t build e-learning
I know won’t work any more than I was able, when I was 5, to let my
mother walk out of a store without paying (by mistake) without becoming
hysterical.
So, now I am hysterical about fraudulent education and fraudulent
e-learning—namely, courses that claim to teach subjects that alter the
very nature of a person. Of course, such courses don’t say that is what
they are trying to do, but it is pretty much the basis of courses about
safe driving or drugs or sexual behavior, or how not to violate the law.
How is training about compliance an attempt to alter basic
behavior?
Recently I was presented with an opportunity to teach integrity
and compliance to the employees of a large company that bids on
RFPs. The bidding process is part of a legal process and the company
wants its employees to stay within the guidelines.
Fair enough. Makes sense.
Except, when you look at the guidelines, they include an array
of rules spelled out in a complex document, typically a signed legal
contract for potential bidders. To know those rules, one would have
to read the contract. In effect, the company wants to train people to
read, and pay careful attention to, the contract. The company wants
to do this by putting employees in fictitious situations in which someone
has not read the contract and this failure to read causes serious
difficulties for the company when the employee violates a rule he
didn’t know about.
Much of e-learning is like this. You are the manager of a large
project, which needs to finish on time, and is over budget. Do you:
• steal money
• lie about the time you have spent
• tell the company it can keep the damn project
• carefully explain to your superiors the problems that exist
and let them decide
Do people learn from stuff like this? Of course not. But everyone feels
better after producing it. At least I assume they do.
What Can’t You Teach? 39
If this stuff makes people happy, then build more of it, by all
means. But if we want to address real issues, we need to discuss personality
and how to deal with it.
I have insisted, as long as I have been discussing education, 2 that
learning has to be experientially based. I proposed building complex
social simulators 20 years ago, and this has come to be understood by
the e-learning community as telling people they are in a situation that
they may or may not relate to instead of actually putting them into a
very realistic simulation of that situation. The reason they do it that
way is money, of course, but something gets lost in the translation.
What is the difference?
Suppose that I tell you that you are a baseball player in the major
leagues and your team is down by one run with one out in the bottom
of the ninth with the bases loaded. I then give you a set of multiple
choices about what to do on the first pitch (like, a—take the first pitch,
b—look for a fast ball, etc.). What is the problem with this? There are
right answers about what to do, but they depend on many variables
(Do you know this pitcher’s habits? How have you been hitting today?
How fast is the guy on third?). Pretending that we can abstract a situation
with a simple description and then suggest there is a right answer,
is absurd. But more important, if you have never actually been in that
situation, if you have never played baseball, your comprehension of
the unmentioned details is likely to be zero. Attempting to teach anything
through short descriptions of situations followed by multiple
choice answers is just dumb.
Why, then, do e-learning companies keep on building courses that
sound like that? Usually the answer is that corporations that don’t
know any better asked them to.
What does this have to do with altering basic behavior? I do indeed
play baseball, as I have said, and what I would do in that situation
depends on my personality in many ways. It also depends on
an accurate assessment of my own abilities. What it doesn’t depend
on is deep thought. Professional athletes do not become professional
athletes owing to their superior cognitive abilities. They have superior
physical abilities and rely on instinct for thinking. They do what they
“know” to do. They don’t think it out. Coaches try like crazy to get
them to think it out, but you often can find a 20-year professional veteran
getting chewed out by his coach and being asked, What were you
40 Teaching Minds
thinking? Nothing. He was thinking nothing. Correct action is rarely
about thought, especially when little time for thinking is available.
So, then, how do we teach people to do the right thing, especially
when the right thing is not in line with their normal behavior?
Can we teach nurturance, or aggression, or extroversion, or orderliness?
I hope that it is obvious that we cannot do this. People are
born with these characteristics. They are not learned. Ask any parents
of more than one child. They will respond that their children had
certain personality traits that were apparent from birth. My grandson
Milo is a neatnik. Everything has to be in its place. Also, he loves to
perform in front of an audience. His parents do not share and did not
teach him these behaviors. The degree to which we have such traits
defines our innate personalities. So, we need to translate this question
into one we can answer.
The real issue is one of degree and not of kind. You will never
teach someone who is fundamentally dishonest to be very honest,
or vice versa. You will never teach someone who is very aggressive to
be very passive. What you can do is make people aware of the consequences
of their actions and hope to change their behavior slightly,
when they have the time to think about what they are about to do.
You can make people aware of their behavior, and their rational selves
can direct what they do, if they have time to think about. But their
subconscious is likely to want them to behave differently, and it is
their subconscious that is usually in charge in a pinch.
Someone who hates details is not a good candidate for being
taught to read contracts in detail. Similarly, someone who loves details
is not a great candidate for sales rep. (Why? Because being very
people-oriented is actually a characteristic that never goes hand in
hand with being detail-oriented.) So, it is not uncommon for companies
to be faced with the arduous task of training their salespeople
to pay attention to detail. Telling them to hire differently is hopeless,
because people who are both very detail-oriented and love engaging
people socially do not exist. Accountants don’t usually win personality
contests. What to do?
This is indeed a job for teaching but not for teaching of the usual
sort. To see what kind of job it is, we need to think for a moment about
how the mind works. Specifically, we need to think about how the
unconscious learns to make decisions.
What Can’t You Teach? 41
If you have a character trait, say, honesty, you have had to come
to grips over the years with its upside and its downside. People appreciate
you for being honest, but not when they ask you if they look
good after they have spent an hour dressing (I speak from experience
here). People dislike dishonesty but not when it helps get a deal closed
because you said you loved a restaurant that you really hated. We have
mixed feelings about honesty, as we do about any personality characteristic.
We like friendly people but we dislike overly friendly people.
Who decides which is which is anybody’s guess. Teenagers often try
to be all things to all people, but as adults they soon realize that they
simply will have to be themselves and they will try to find work and
friends that suit the personalities that they happen to have.
Personality features are not conscious. We don’t decide which
ones to have and we may not even be aware of how others perceive
us. We do what we feel comfortable doing and we push on. And then
we meet integrity and compliance officers.
They tell us to read every detail of a contract to make sure we are
in compliance, and those who are detail-oriented and fearful of making
errors and introverted and sensitive do it without question, and
those people who are gregarious and confident and aggressive figure
they can get by without it. What is an integrity and compliance officer
to do?
Here is what not to do:
• Don’t try to tell people who naturally act one way to act
differently.
• Don’t make a movie of the idiot who did it wrong and
say, See, look how dumb that guy was and look what
trouble he got into.
• Don’t lecture on the benefits of behaving the way the
company wants you to behave.
• Don’t write a manual with correct behavior that no one
will read.
• Don’t build an e-learning course with multiple choice
answers where one of them is the right thing to do.
The mind is organized around experiences. We remember our experiences
and we index our remembered experiences so that we can find
them later. Individuals don’t know how they do this, but cognitive
42 Teaching Minds
science can tell something about how this process works. You can’t
find an experience that was indexed wrong, for example.
Good indexing involves figuring out the goal that an experience
relates to and the conditions that allowed that goal to be achieved
or not. We do not do this consciously. We learn by doing, that is, we
learn from experience, and from thinking about those experiences.
When we have understood our experiences well enough, we can (unconsciously)
index them so that they will come up again just in time
when we need them again. (This is what we call being reminded.) It
is beyond the scope of this book to explain how that process works. 3
The simple idea is that experiences get labeled when we think about
them and not otherwise.
So the real question for an integrity and compliance officer is how
to get people to think about integrity and compliance issues. This
thinking needs be done over time in a complex way and voluntarily.
How might we do that?
That is the real question.
One answer to this is stories. People really like stories. As long as
there have been people, there have been stories; we have moved from
epic poems and theatre to novels and movies in recent years, but, by
and large, the stories are the same. How to overcome obstacles to getting
what you want, is a theme that dominates much of literature,
for example. Movie makers say it as “boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy
loses girl, boy gets girl.” There have been many books written about
the basic plots that occur again and again in stories.
Human beings understand stories because stories resonate with
them. Characters have dilemmas that readers or viewers themselves
have had. Stories appeal to emotions rather than logic, and emotions
are at the heart of our pre-7-year-old unconscious selves. We feel
something because of a well-told story and that feeling can help us see
something in a new way.
Why am I going on and on about stories? I believe that all of
human intercourse is about the exchange of stories. (I wrote a book
about this. 4 ) If you want to appeal to the pre-7-year-old unconscious
that resides in all of us, you need to hit emotion not logic. This means
that a good story can help someone to reconsider deep down in their
unconscious a feeling or attitude or seemingly immutable personality
trait that they can feel perhaps is somewhat dysfunctional. Stories can
change our natural instincts.
What Can’t You Teach? 43
That story cannot be short and sweet. It takes a great deal of emotion
and empathy to change a point of view in a belief system. Deciding
to construct a 15-minute, e-learning module in which one plays
the sales rep and learns that honesty is the best policy, is so absurd that
I am sorry I am referring to it at all, except that is what was proposed
by the integrity and compliance people to whom I was speaking.
You can move people ever so slightly by having them have emotional
experiences that they can discuss with one another. Imagine a
book club that deals with a book about dishonesty and causes people
in the discussion group to talk about the subject. If the book presented
deep dilemmas to which there were no obviously right answers, this
would allow people to get to and discuss their unconscious beliefs.
Simply articulating those beliefs can be quite helpful. This is what
clinical psychologists are really trying to do, after all. It is also what literature
professors are trying to get their classes to do. Thinking about
and talking about complex emotional issues makes personality traits
and core beliefs something you can think about consciously.
The real issue, in the end, is interests. Teaching works best when
you teach students who agree that they really want to learn whatever
it is you have to teach. This means making sure that students
are preparing to do things that they want to do and actually will do.
That makes teaching much easier for all involved. The one-size-fits-all
curriculum doesn’t work because one size doesn’t fit all. Let detailoriented
people learn detailed kinds of things. Let artistic people learn
artistic kinds of things. Let logical people learn logical kinds of things.
Everyone would be much happier and all would enjoy learning a lot
more if we simply let people be themselves.

CHAPTER 4
Twelve Cognitive Processes That
Underlie Learning
Those who know how to think need no teachers.
—Mahatma Gandhi
Not everything we would like to teach can be taught, as we have seen.
Similarly, not everything we would like to learn can be learned, especially
if we are taking the wrong approach to learning. In the previous
chapter we discussed what can’t be taught. Now, let’s talk about what
can be taught.
One problem in such a discussion is that we are used to (because we
went to school) thinking about what needs to be taught and learned
in terms of subjects (English, math, science, etc.). We think this way
because school originally was organized by professors who had specialties
in these subject areas. These professors were scholars and they
set up the lower schools on the basis of the specialties that they had.
When I was working in artificial intelligence, I began to realize
that what I needed to teach the computer to do in order for it be smart
was a far cry from what people thought needed to be taught. People
assumed that we needed to tell the computer facts about the world of
the type that children learn in school, and that this would make the
machine smart. (Quite recently, I attended a meeting of AI people who
were planning a project to allow computers to pass SAT tests as a way
of showing that the computer was smart!)
But what computers lack is intelligent capabilities, not information.
It is easy enough to fill a machine with information, but when you are
done, it would be able to tell you only what you told it. (If that was what
a child did, you would think that he was brain damaged.) Intelligence
and the learning required to create useful new knowledge are really a
result of an amalgamation of cognitive processes. Intelligent computers,
and intelligent people, need those processes to be working well.
45
46 Teaching Minds
What I mean by this, is that there is stuff we can do mentally,
and that learning just means doing that stuff and getting better at it.
Learning is not any one process, but many processes, depending on
what you are learning.
What are the cognitive processes that make up learning? If we
wish to teach people, it is important to ask what cognitive capabilities
we want them to have when we are done, not what we want them to
know. In other words, we want to understand what we have to do in
order to make them better able to think.
In this chapter, we will discuss the kinds of cognitive processes
that people can (and must) learn to do well. Later we will discuss how
to best approach learning and teaching these processes.
There are 12 types of processes outlined here. There may be more
types than these, but with these we pretty much can cover the ground
of what human learning looks like. I have divided them into three
groups: conceptual processes, analytic processes, and social processes. Notice
first that all the types are types of processes. Thinking is a process.
It is something we do. We need to see what that doing is like.
All these processes require practice in order to master them. You
cannot learn to master a process without practicing it again and again.
Feedback and coaching help one learn.
CONCEPTUAL PROCESSES
1. Prediction: Making a prediction about the outcome of actions
This is experiential learning about everyday behavior in its most
common form—it includes learning about how to travel or eat or get a
date, for example. In its complex form it is how one learns to be a battlefield
commander or a horse race handicapper. One learns through
experience by trial and error. The cognitive issue is building up a large
case base and index that case base according to expectation failures, as
I described in Dynamic Memory. We learn when predictions fail. When
they succeed, we fail to care about them because most of the predictions
we make are uninteresting (I predict the room I just left will look
the same when I return). Learning to predict what will happen next
requires repeated practice in each domain of knowledge. There is some
Twelve Cognitive Processes That Underlie Learning 47
transfer across domains but not that much. (Learning to buy an airplane
ticket is somewhat related to eating in a restaurant, but not that
closely. You might use a credit card in each, for example, and might be
refused service because you are rude.)
2. Modeling: Building a conscious model of a process
We need to learn how things work. A citizen knows, presumably,
how voting works. Someone looking for venture capital should know
how fund raising works. Processes need to be learned in order to effectively
participate in them and in order to propose changes in them.
Building a conscious model of a process matters a great deal if you
want to make the process work for you. If you want to get into college,
you need to understand how the process works. This cannot be
learned from experience in a serious way because one may do it only
once and may not be able to experience the entire process. Having
the process explained to you may not work that well either because
this will not bring an operational understanding of it (as opposed to
a more superficial understanding of it). Designing it, modifying it,
and participating in simulations of it work much better as learning
methods.
3. Experimentation: Experimentation and replanning based on
success and failure
This is probably the most important learning process we engage
in while living our lives. We make life decisions and we need to know
when we need to change something. There are big decisions—like
getting married or how to raise a child or whether to change jobs—
and little decisions, such as changing your diet or your sleep habits.
We make our decisions on the basis of what has worked before and
what has failed to work. We tend to make life decisions without much
knowledge. We don’t know how our bodies work all that well and we
don’t really know how the world works or what it has in store for us.
Thinking about these issues and learning from failure is a pressing
need all through life. Learning to analyze what has worked out and
what has not and why is part of living a rational life. These things can
be learned by living and talking about our experiences, thus creating a
database of stories that we can rely on later. We learn by talking with
48 Teaching Minds
others and hearing their stories but we also learn from our own experience
as we construct our own stories. We can learn about life experiences
through reading and movies as well. We like stories in all these
forms precisely because they focus on real-life issues. The cognitive
task here is story creation, comparison, indexing, and modification.
Most conversation depends on story exchange. The more emotional a
story is, the more likely it is to be remembered.
4. Evaluation: Improving our ability to determine the value of
something on many different dimensions
There are no rights and wrongs in what we like. But there is general
agreement about what makes a work of art great. The factors to
be considered are not necessarily conscious, although for experts they
typically are. In these more subjective and subconscious areas of life, it
is more a matter of trying to understand what feels right than understanding
why it feels right. There is a difference between being someone
who can make an artistic judgment and being an art expert. One
might learn to notice things that one had failed to notice, if someone
takes the time to point them out. Learning to make artistic judgments
is about learning to notice, to describe, and to appreciate. One’s concept
of beauty changes when one’s focus changes. Practice is a key
idea here as is the assembling of a case base to use as a comparison
set. Nevertheless, the comparison set is not usually conscious. One
can like something because it is pleasing without realizing (or caring
about) why it is pleasing.
When we make a value judgment, we don’t necessarily know the
values we have and we haven’t necessarily learned them consciously.
We should value human life over property but whether we do or not
we will find out only if the situation arises. It is tempting to try to teach
values but this actually is done so early in life and in so many subtle
ways that anybody over the age of 10 is unlikely to be much affected
by what people say to them about what they should value and what
they shouldn’t. Perhaps husbands should value helping their wives
over watching football but that doesn’t mean they will. In important
areas of life, on the job and in child raising, for example, one’s values
come into play. If parents believe they shouldn’t correct a child when
he makes a mistake in speaking, they soon will find that they have
Twelve Cognitive Processes That Underlie Learning 49
a child who speaks poorly. The value held by the parents may well
be that self-confidence is more important than being articulate (“We
don’t want to criticize him.”). Perhaps it is. But the consequences of
one’s values manifest themselves every time a value-based decision is
made.
Nevertheless, we do need to learn to make value-based judgments.
Doing this requires understanding what our values are. Confronting
a person with her own value system (one that she has unconsciously
adopted) can help her think things out, but change is never easy.
ANALYTIC PROCESSES
1. Diagnosis: Making a diagnosis of a complex situation by
identifying relevant factors and seeking causal explanations
Diagnosis is a very important skill and one that needs to be learned
both in principle and separately for each domain of knowledge. Diagnosis
of heart disease isn’t a different process in principle from diagnosis
of a faulty spark plug in a car engine. Nevertheless, one wants a
specialist to do the diagnosis in each case. Why is this? Diagnosis is a
matter of both reasoning from evidence and understanding what to
look for to gather evidence. Given all the evidence, it is easy to make
a diagnosis in an area of knowledge you don’t know very well. So, the
gathering of the evidence is the most important part. Crime analysts
and gardeners both do diagnosis. They both reason from evidence.
What separates them is knowing what constitutes important evidence
and what does not. Here again, this comes from experienced cases.
Analytic processes involve attention to details that enable the
forming of hypotheses that can be tested by a variety of methods.
These three pieces, determining evidence, forming hypotheses, and
testing hypotheses, are what is commonly referred to as the scientific
method. When science is taught, it often dwells on the facts of science
rather than the process. Diagnosis is about the process. But the process
is not of much use without domain knowledge. Domain knowledge
is often about causality, although that knowledge of causality may be
subconscious. Experts know what causes an engine to misfire so they
50 Teaching Minds
know where to look to find a faulty part. Experts also know that an
engine is misfiring in the first place. What causes what is the real issue
in the comprehension of any given domain.
We learn to do diagnosis, and to understand what causes what,
consciously. This is knowledge that can be taught to us by experts, but
it needs to be taught as part of the process of diagnosis. If you have a
goal (understanding what is broken or has gone awry is a very typical
goal), then it is much easier to acquire information that helps in the
pursuit of that goal than it is to acquire that same information without
that goal. To learn diagnosis, one must practice more and more
complex cases in one area of knowledge.
2. Planning: Learning to plan; needs analysis; conscious and
subconscious understanding of what goals are satisfied by what
plans; use of conscious case- based planning
People plan constantly. Often their plans aren’t very complicated.
Let’s have lunch is a plan, after all. Sometimes they make much more
complex plans. A football coach makes plans to fool the defense. They
are called plays. A general makes battlefield plans. A businessperson
writes business plans. An architect draws up architectural plans. All
these more complex plans have a lot in common with the let’s have
lunch plan. Namely, they have been used before or something quite
similar has been used before. People rarely make plans from scratch.
When they do, they find the process very difficult and often make
many errors.
Learning to plan, therefore, has two components: being able to
create a plan from scratch (which almost never actually happens) and
being able to modify an existing plan for new purposes. The first one
is important to learn how to do, but it is the latter ability that makes
one proficient at planning. Planning from first principles is actually
quite difficult. Normally people just modify an old plan. Last week we
had steak; this week let’s try lamb chops. This doesn’t sound like rocket
science and it isn’t. Computer programmers write new programs
by modifying old programs. Lawyers write contacts by modifying old
contracts. Doctors plan procedures by thinking about past procedures.
In each case, people try to improve on prior plans by remembering
where these plans went wrong and then thinking about how to improve
them. Acquiring a case base of plans is critical. One can modify
plans from one domain of knowledge to use in another but this is not
Twelve Cognitive Processes That Underlie Learning 51
easy and requires a level of abstraction that is very important to learn.
Most creative thinking depends on this ability to abstract plans from
one field of knowledge to another. We learn to do this by practicing
it. Teachers can help people see correspondences across domains. Abstraction
of this sort is what creative people do best.
3. Causation: Detecting what has caused a sequence of events
to occur by relying on a case base of previous knowledge of
similar situations (case-based reasoning)
All fields of knowledge study causation; biology, physics, history,
economics—they are all about what causes what. The fact that this is
an object of study by academics tells us right away that it is not easy
and no one knows for sure all of the causes and effects that there are
in the world.
Because of this, acquiring a set of known causes and effects tends
to make one an expert. A plumber knows what causes sinks to stop
up and knows where to look for the culprit. A mechanic knows what
causes gas lines to leak and knows where to look. A detective knows
what causes people to kill and knows where to start when solving a
murder case. Causal knowledge is knowledge fixed to a domain of
inquiry. Experts have extensive case bases. Case bases are acquired by
starting on easy cases and graduating to more complex ones. It is important
to discuss with others the cases one works on because this
makes one better at indexing them in one’s mind, enabling one to
find them later as needed.
4. Judgment: Making an objective judgment
There are two forms of this, both involving decisions based on
data. The first is deciding whether you prefer Baskin Robbins or Ben
and Jerry’s. There is no right answer. We make judgments and then
record them for use later. We find ways to express our judgments (Ben
and Jerry’s is too sweet, for example). We learn what we like by trying
things out. A wine expert learns about wine by drinking it and recording
what he thinks so he can compare his thoughts about one wine to
those about a different wine later on.
The second form is reasoning based on evidence. A jury does this
but it doesn’t learn much from it. Judges, however, learn in this way,
as do psychiatrists and businesspeople. They collect evidence, they
52 Teaching Minds
form a judgment, and later they may get to see whether their judgment
is correct. When asked, they can tell you clear reasons (typically
post hoc justifications) as to why they decided the way they did. The
wine expert can say reasons as well, but the evidence for taste is not
really all that objective. (Of course, the evidence may be found after
the judgment is made. People are not always entirely rational.)
To learn to make objective judgments, one needs constant feedback
either from a teacher or from a colleague or from reality. One
needs to think about what was decided and why. People who are good
at this are good at it because they have analyzed their successes and
failures and they can articulate their reasoning. Learning requires repeated
practice.
SOCIAL PROCESSES
1. Influence: Understanding how others respond to your requests
and recognizing consciously and unconsciously how to improve
the process
Human interaction is one of the most important skills of all. We
regularly interact with family, friends, colleagues, bosses, romantic interests,
professors, service personnel, and strangers. Communicating
effectively is very important to any success we might want to have in
any area of life. But, we do not know why we say what we say, nor do
we really understand how we are being perceived by others. We just
talk and listen and go on our way. Some people are loved by everyone
and others are despised. It is wrong to assume that we know what
image we project or that we are easily capable of altering the way we
behave so that we will be perceived differently.
How do we learn to become conscious of inherently unconscious
behavior? One can learn to behave differently if one becomes consciously
aware of the mistakes one is making. Watching others, watching
oneself, thinking about how to improve—all this helps one make
subconscious behavior into conscious behavior.
We unintentionally return to standard ways of acting in various
situations. A wallflower at a party doesn’t decide to be a wallflower—it
is simply behavior she is comfortable with. If no one is harmed by
Twelve Cognitive Processes That Underlie Learning 53
these subconscious choices, then there is no need to fix anything. But
often we might behave differently in how we treat others, if we realized
what we were doing. Getting along with people is a very big part
of life. Each of us has our own distinct personality and often it doesn’t
match with our own ambitions and desires. To change our behavior,
we need to practice new behaviors that become as natural to us as
our old behaviors. The only way to do this is to do it. People can help
point out what you are doing that isn’t helpful to your needs but that
does not mean you can easily change. If you want to change, you need
to try new behaviors and practice them. This can be coached. Practicing
new behaviors and being critiqued can help greatly. Written communication
is handled the same way.
2. Teamwork: Learning how to achieve goals by using a team,
consciously allocating roles, managing inputs from others,
coordinating actors, and handling conflicts
It is the rare individual who works all alone. Most people need
to work with others. Children are not naturally good at this and are
taught to “share.” Then they sometimes do what is called “parallel
play” where they play near one another doing different things. Getting
kids to cooperate to do something together is not easy. Usually
one wants to dominate the others. There is nothing wrong with this
per se. People are who they are and they need to assume roles in any
team that are consonant with their personalities. One person plays
quarterback and another blocks. People do not have to do the same
thing in order to work together. But they do need to get along and
function as a team. This is no more true of sports than it is of the
workplace. People learn to work in teams by working in teams and receiving
helpful advice when a team is dysfunctional. Football coaches
explicitly teach this. More formal learning situations (like school) often
don’t, which is unfortunate. It really isn’t possible to get along in
the real world unless you can assume various roles in a team that fit
with who you are.
3. Negotiation: Making a deal; negotiation/contracts
Contracts, formal and informal, are the basis of how we function.
We reach agreements in business, in marriage, in friendship, in a store,
54 Teaching Minds
and at school. Parties to those agreements have the right to complain
if obligations are not met. Learning to make a contract, legal or not,
is a big part of being a rational actor. To make a contract one must
negotiate it. Negotiation often is seen as something only politicians
and high-powered business leaders do. But, actually, we negotiate with
waitresses for good service and we negotiate with our children when
we give them an allowance. Learning how to negotiate can be done
only by trying and learning from failures. The techniques tend to be
context-independent, but there is, of course, special knowledge about
real estate and politics (for example, the relevant laws) that makes one
a better negotiator in each situation. Again, practice with coaching is
the ideal.
4. Describing: Creating and using conscious descriptions of
situations to identify faults to be fixed
When problems exist in any situation, we need to be able to describe
and analyze them. We need to be able to describe them in order
to get help from people who may know more about the situation than
we do. We need to learn to focus on the critical issues. In order to do
this, we need also to be able to analyze these situations to see what was
supposed to happen and why it isn’t happening. Consultants who try
to fix failing businesses do this sort of thing all the time, as do doctors
when consulting on difficult cases. Creating a careful description of
a situation is a skill that can be learned only through practice. This
sometimes is described as learning an elevator speech to tell someone
succinctly what you are doing. This ability is a very important part of
understanding and helping others understand.
Now let’s see what we have. First let’s list again the types of cognitive
processes that underlie learning:
Conceptual processes
1. Prediction
2. Judgment
3. Experimentation
4. Evaluation
Twelve Cognitive Processes That Underlie Learning 55
Analytic processes
1. Diagnosis
2. Planning
3. Causation
4. Judgment
Social processes
1. Influence
2. Teamwork
3. Negotiation
4. Describing
What kind of stuff is this? I said above that these are cognitive processes.
So let’s look at them from that perspective. Let’s start with the
analytic processes.
What does it mean to say that diagnosis is a cognitive process? It
means that there are steps and these steps are based in thought rather
than in action. The first step may be to gather evidence, for example.
While this seems like a physical act, and often it is, it is actually a
mental act. Evidence can be gathered by asking questions, by looking
carefully at a scene, by listening to sounds, or by taking blood tests.
There are many ways to gather evidence and typically the physical
manifestations of evidence gathering bear no real relationship to one
another. Evidence gathering is a mental act, although physical actions
may be involved. It is a mental act that is part of a set of complex mental
processes that, of course, include reasoning about the evidence,
checking the validity of the evidence, comparing known information
with previous cases that are similar, and so on. Diagnosis is a complex
mental process. Teaching diagnosis matters because getting good at
diagnosis can make you a good mother, a good teacher, a good detective,
a good nearly anything you can think of. The process of diagnosis
is constant in our mental lives.
Are all 12 of the processes listed above like this? Clearly the other
analytic processes are very similar. Planning is a mental activity
that one gets better at by doing it. Whether you are planning a party
or planning a career, the process involves thinking about steps and
56 Teaching Minds
imagining consequences to those steps. The more you plan, the better
you get at it. We do planning every day. It matters a great deal and
the better you are at it, the easier your life will go. The same is true of
the third mental process: analysis of causation. Knowing why something
happened allows us to not do it again—if we didn’t like the end
result—or to try to do it again, if we did, and everything in between.
Determining causation is a mental process that is very similar to diagnosis,
of course.
So these three are all cognitive processes and they require constant
practice. Getting better at them throughout one’s life is very important.
I define learning as improvement in one’s cognitive processes.
Lifetime learning does not mean the continual acquisition of knowledge
so much as it means the improvement in one’s ability to do these
processes by means of the acquisition and analysis of experiences to
draw on.
CHAPTER 5
Real-Life Learning
Projects Considered
I learned more about the economy from one South Dakota
dust storm than I did in all my years of college.
—Hubert H. Humphrey
These days everyone has ideas about ways to improve student learning.
These range from having kids stretch between classes, to listening
to Mozart, to eating right. Of course, those things won’t harm you, but
they really have nothing to do with learning. They are about getting
students to concentrate on material that doesn’t interest them much.
Presumably, a tedious task is made better by these kinds of things. An
interesting task does not need that kind of enhancement. It should be
interesting in and of itself.
In the summer of 2008, I met a most unusual man. He recently had
retired from being the CEO of Epson Europe. Some years earlier, his
close friend, who was director general of a college, got sick and died.
His dying wish was that his friend, the Epson CEO, would succeed him
and become president of the business school of the college. And so it
happened that a professional from the business world found himself
in charge of the Business Engineering School at La Salle University in
Barcelona, Spain. During his years at Epson he had hired many graduates
from that college and others, and believed that the training they
received there was highly theoretical, not practical enough or oriented
to the real world of business. It was clear to him that students needed
a different kind of training in order to prepare them for professional
life. He began to talk to the faculty about teaching different kinds
of courses, ones that were less theoretical and more related to what
people actually do in business. The faculty objected. Shocker.
A provost friend of mine once said that with faculty, everything is
a la carte. What he meant was that professors never feel that they have
57
58 Teaching Minds
to follow the wishes of the administration. They consider themselves
free agents. This former CEO, coming from a business where there really
is someone in charge, didn’t know what to do. He talked to people
who talked to people and eventually he found me.
As a professor for 30 some odd years, I developed a healthy disrespect
for professors as a group. They tend to lobby for keeping their
lives easy and that means, among other things, making sure they
don’t have to teach too much or teach in a way that makes them have
to work too hard. Professors always have something more important
to do than teach. I am not criticizing here. I would have been the first
to whine and wail if anyone had made me teach more than one course
every other quarter. I considered myself a researcher, also a graduate
seminar teacher, but classes with lots of students wanting to hear a
lecture? Ugh.
The college president and I had dinner and discussed what we
could do together. I said we could build any program he wanted online
as long as we didn’t need the approval of faculty to do it and we had
good experts available. He said he was the expert and we needed the
approval of no one. I said it would be expensive and he said, God will
provide. (Did I mention this school is run by the Christian Brothers?)
Two months later I found myself in front of 25 faculty in Barcelona
as I interviewed the president about what someone would have
to know how to do in order to make them into someone whom he
would hire. He gave me a list. The faculty got to comment, but that
was about it. It was clear who was in charge.
So, we built a story-centered curriculum meant to teach practical
business by creating simulated experiences. The idea is to deliver
it online around the world, using mentors who speak the students’
language. (The website is in English). No classes. No lectures. No tests.
Graduates get an MBA degree but this curriculum doesn’t have that
much in common with traditional MBA programs. The idea is to help
people launch their own business or go to work.
Students are part of teams that work to create deliverables within
a story about a situation that demands some work on their part. They
consult with their team members and use extensive background and
step-by-step help that has been created as part of the website. Mentors
are available to answer questions and to evaluate the final work
product. The projects are large enough that students need to divide up
the work and consult with one another on how to proceed. Eventually
Real-Life Learning Projects Considered 59
they create a deliverable and either continue to work on improving
it after receiving feedback from the mentor or move on to the next
subtask in the story.
I will describe briefly the stories that the students work within
(they each last anywhere from 6 to 9 weeks). Then I want to consider
what these courses are really teaching from the perspective of the
framework of cognitive processes that I described in Chapter 4.
COURSE 1: “CASH CRISIS”—
ANALYZE AND SOLVE FINANCIAL BUSINESS PROBLEMS
The story for this course is that a family that owns a winery business
hires a consulting firm to help determine why the bank denied the renewal
of a loan. The students, working in the role of assistant consultants,
first conduct financial analyses to determine problems within
the business. Next, they conduct a root cause analysis to determine
the underlying causes of the problems affecting the business. Students
then develop solutions to address the problems and write a report outlining
the solutions, including 5-year financial projections.
COURSE 2: “GOING ONLINE”—
TAKE A SMALL BUSINESS ONLINE
Students are contacted by an investor who is interested in starting an
online business selling gift baskets. She wants the students to help her
plan what the business will sell in the gift baskets and to design the
user interface for the website. She is leaving it up to the students to
determine what sort of gift basket business they want to design. Her
immediate concern is seeing what the site would look like, and how it
would function, to make sure she will have a good design to impress
prospective buyers.
Students begin by interviewing prospective customers and seeing
how they typically buy such items online, to learn from their usage
patterns and to determine common breakdowns in the usual process.
Next, students produce expected user scenarios for the “personas”
they identify as being prospective users of the site. They then define
functional and nonfunctional requirements for the site they must
60 Teaching Minds
design. They design the information architecture, including content,
sitemap, wireframes, and low-fi prototypes, after which they test their
prototypes on prospective users. The final step in the process is a review
of proposals from a set of vendors who could build the site the
students designed.
COURSE 3: MARKETING—LAUNCHING A NEW PRODUCT
In this story, the students belong to a product-launching team. The
goal is to launch a new social network for amateur performers, iSing.
com. Students decide which role they want to play, product marketing
or marketing communication, and working together in teams of four,
they prepare the launching plan for this product. Among the activities
they perform are preparing job descriptions for both roles, preparing
a position strategy statement and a message architecture, preparing a
preliminary market segmentation for the product, preparing demographics
and psychographics of the target groups, launching a kickoff
meeting for the project, and preparing a launching program, including
the following subtasks: total product requirements, barriers to
customer adoption, competitive analysis, market/customer research,
hiring a research firm, market leverage model, communication plan,
web tools, branding, market research, and hiring a PR firm. Finally,
students prepare a complete budget and defend the plan and the budget
in front of the top management of the company.
COURSE 4: RE-ENGINEER A SUPPLY CHAIN
Students now play the role of junior executive in the supply chain
management department of RightByte technologies. They receive a
report from the CEO describing the current processes and the main
problems identified. With this information, students are requested to
find out the root causes of the problems and come up with a suggested
course of action to solve them. They have to take into account the
following design principles for the new solution: customer service impact,
impact on cost savings, and ease of implementation.
From this point on, the teams analyze each piece of the supply
chain to make the deep diagnosis: demand/supply planning,
Real-Life Learning Projects Considered 61
transportation, warehouse management, sales order management,
and central order fulfillment. Once the diagnosis and requirements
are well established, the teams develop a suggested solution. Finally,
top management requires the team to prepare a change management
evaluation to see whether the company is prepared to undertake such
a complex project.
COURSE 5: INVESTMENT READINESS—
HELP A SMALL TECHNOLOGICAL COMPANY TO SUCCESSFULLY
RAISE FUNDS FOR AN INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION IN A
SECOND ROUND
Next.TV is a small company that has been very successful in the local
market. It has developed a software package to automate an editorial
department of a TV channel. Most of the main domestic channels
have already implemented the package and the company wants to go
international. Students are hired as expert consultants to prepare the
company for this second round of financing and to present the project
to Venture Capital firms. Students now do several tasks that they
have already done in the previous modules, plus some new tasks, but
they do them now in an integrated manner and with much less time
to finish them. Task to perform are: analyze starting point (P&L and
balance sheet), enhance the product value proposition, prepare a sales
plan, perform a management audit, prepare the internalization plan,
prepare financial planning, write the business plan, identify potential
VC firms to present to, analyze offerings, and negotiate a term sheet.
COURSE 6: ETHICAL AND LEGAL ISSUES IN CORPORATE
GOVERNANCE
This course involves reading and discussing a specially written novel.
The intent of the novel is to inspire readers to wrestle with the
problems of the characters, who are involved in complex ethical and
moral decisions within the pharmaceutical industry. The novel serves
as a starting point for the kind of active contemplation and discussion
that truly make people better able to think more deeply about such issues.
The students immerse themselves in the story of an international
62 Teaching Minds
pharmaceutical company engaged in a hostile takeover of a smaller,
but highly successful, competitor. Students experience the tough negotiations,
the elimination of dedicated and talented individuals, and
the painful shuffling of roles and responsibilities that accompany major
change in a modern corporation. Students also confront the complicated
(and sometimes conflicting) relationship between social responsibility,
legal responsibility, and profit motive, as they witness the
company’s attempt to establish a new research facility in a blighted
town as a consequence of the merger. As students consider each episode,
they critique the actions and reactions of the central characters,
advise them on next steps, and glean lessons related to negotiation,
change management, legal and ethical issues in corporate governance,
and working with other cultures.
S TORY 7: SELLING AND IMPLEMENTING SOLUTIONS
Students begin their work as new project managers at a premier eventplanning
company, World Class Events. They begin by qualifying
and prioritizing opportunities to propose work to prospective clients,
pitching to senior management which of the proposals should receive
the greatest budget, based on potential profitability, likelihood of winning,
and other relevant considerations. They create a project scope
document for the sales effort, first planning and attending a simulated
meeting with event-planning experts to determine a vision for the
event, including risks and open questions for the client. They then engage
in a role-play call with the client, introducing World Class Events
and clarifying the project vision.
Of course, the intent of this curriculum is to prepare students to go
out into the business world. So, there is a natural subject orientation.
The subject is business. But after we acknowledge that, everything else
is different. The curriculum was designed with the 12 cognitive processes
in mind. Let’s see how that was accomplished.
The real issue in learning in any arena of knowledge is getting
better at the cognitive processes that underlie that knowledge. The
processes involved in learning have been with us as long as there have
been humans. School, and subject-based education, is a more recent
invention. To understand how human learning works, we need to
think more deeply about how we can teach these processes.
Real-Life Learning Projects Considered 63
So, we might ask, Where do the 12 cognitive processes get taught
in this MBA program?
First let’s list the cognitive processes again:
Conceptual processes
1. Prediction
2. Judgment
3. Experimentation
4. Evaluation
Analytic processes
1. Diagnosis
2. Planning
3. Causation
4. Judgment
Social processes
1. Influence
2. Teamwork
3. Negotiation
4. Describing
Now let’s consider them one at a time.
Where is prediction taught in our MBA program?
In course 1 (cash crisis), students have to create a financial plan.
Any planning document is a serious attempt at prediction. Prediction
is covered in a different way in course 2. In that course, students need
to predict how users will behave on a website. In course 3, students
need to predict the effects of a marketing campaign and predict what
will work and what will not work in a product launch. In course 4, students
need to predict how changes they make in the supply chain will
improve the process. In course 5, students are developing a business
model, which is in itself a prediction that certain decisions and behaviors
will make money. In course 6, students must predict the effects
of various changes in an organization and must predict the behavior
of the people with whom they will negotiate. In course 7, students
64 Teaching Minds
predict which sales pitches will work as well as predicting various costs
and benefits associated with their product.
In fact, it seems obvious that prediction is at the very heart of this
MBA program. But so are all the other cognitive processes. Students
are always working in teams and are always trying to influence their
peers, their superiors, their customers, and so on. They are in constant
negotiations and they are creating all kinds of plans—financial plans,
marketing plans, and business plans. They are constantly diagnosing
problems in the various stories and constantly creating documents as
work products (describing). They must determine the cause of various
problems in each story and evaluate solutions to those problems. They
make judgments about what to do, and what is working and what isn’t,
in each story and they create models of proposed solutions. Each new
solution they propose is, in effect, an experiment, and they must evaluate
the results of each experiment as they proceed.
Now let’s reconsider what it means to teach and what is important
to teach within the context of a good curriculum. One might
have expected, given that there are 12 cognitive processes that must
be learned, that each project in the curriculum would be put clearly
into one of categories. The schooling mentality naturally leads to the
idea that if diagnosis is important, then we should offer a course in
diagnosis. But you can’t diagnose randomly and you can’t teach students
to do diagnosis in the absence of an acknowledgment of their
real interest and goals independent of a context. While diagnosis is
fundamentally the same process whether you are plumber, a doctor, or
a businessperson, there is also much to learn about the context of the
diagnosis, and real students with real goals will fall asleep while hearing
about diagnosis in one context, whereas they will perk up while
actually doing diagnosis in a context they find fascinating.
We have designed this curriculum to teach the 12 cognitive processes
within the context that was decided upon by the students. No
one is forced to take an MBA program. The students are those who
want to run their own business or work within the context of a large
business. It is the job of the curriculum designer (and the teacher),
therefore, to teach them how to think well within that context.
Now I am not saying that this is not done (or at least cannot be
done) within traditional schooling. Sometimes it is. A good history
teacher does in fact teach about diagnosis and causation and planning.
One can think about the Battle of Waterloo and learn a great
Real-Life Learning Projects Considered 65
deal about planning, and influence, and causation, and teamwork.
But while this could be true of a good history course, it often is
in no way actually the case. If history courses were designed to teach
students to think within the context of history, they would be much
more important than they now are. As long as we think that history is
about getting the facts about who signed what declaration when, we
are missing the forest for the trees from a teaching point of view.
Now, of course, some subjects lend themselves very easily to emphasis
of the 12 cognitive processes. Science courses could, for example,
be entirely about experimentation or diagnosis or causation,
and they would be very useful if they were. But instead we encourage
learning the facts about who did what experiment and we teach formulas
to be memorized and we teach about equations. Experimentation
is indeed a very exciting subject. (Ask any 2-year-old who experiments
with what best goes in his mouth on a daily basis.) But
schooling manages to make it a very dull subject by teaching who did
what experiment when.
One reason that we have managed to create dullness out of material
that can be inherently interesting is the absurd emphasis on testing
that has dominated the world of education in the past years. Below
are three questions (quite typical ones) from an AP psychology exam.
Ivan P. Pavlov is famous for his research on
(A) teaching machines.
(B) perceptual learning.
(C) forward conditioning.
(D) classical conditioning.
(E) backward conditioning.
A stimulus that elicits a response before the experimental
manipulation is a (an)
(A) response stimulus (RS).
(B) unconditioned stimulus (UCS).
(C) generalized stimulus (GS).
(D) conditioned stimulus (CS).
(E) specific stimulus (SS).
66 Teaching Minds
Erikson proposed that trust or mistrust develops during the
(A) muscular-anal stage.
(B) locomotor-genital stage.
(C) latency stage.
(D) oral-sensory stage.
(E) maturity stage.
Psychology is all about experimentation, but the questions here are
about facts about previous experiments, which is very different from
learning to design and perform an experiment about something that
personally interests you. Psychology teachers cannot teach students
how to create a hypothesis and experiment to find out whether it is
true, unless they go around the existing curriculum. Since teachers are
judged by their students’ results on AP tests, this is hardly likely.
Another problem here is that only some of the 12 cognitive processes
are conscious. Others are hidden from our conscious minds.
If school were to actively try to teach diagnosis, for example, soon
enough there would be the 18 principles of diagnosis or a test about
who said what about diagnosis. There probably wouldn’t be much actual
diagnosis unless something drastically changed our conception of
what schooling should look like.
The major problem with how we think about teaching is our conception
of what it means to teach, as well as our conception of what it
means to learn. In school we “know” that one has to learn math and
science and literature. I am asserting here that it is that notion, that
there are these specific subjects to teach, that has ruined our schools.
There are abilities to teach, not subjects.
Academics designed the school system. To them, it seemed natural
that the subjects that they were experts on should be taught in
high school. Such a simple thought has created a major problem. 1
Education ought not be subject-based but, in a sense, we can’t help
but think of it that way because we all went to schools that were subject-based.
Even corporate training, which need not be subject-based,
tends to be viewed in that way as well, simply because that is the way
we have always looked at education owing to our own experiences in
school.
Once you set up the learning question in terms of subjects that need
to be taught, it is very tempting to use the old tried and true, Why
Real-Life Learning Projects Considered 67
don’t we just tell them the facts and any underlying theories? The knowledge
metaphor, the one that says that teachers know some stuff that students
don’t, naturally leads teachers to tell students what they know.
Now let’s consider corporate training.
The companies that contract with my company 2 to build courses
know that we will not use the learning by telling method. Presumably
they are frustrated with the results that the telling method has produced
in courses that have been built for them by others. (In fact, they
refer to it as “death by PowerPoint.”) This is why they come to us. Still
they can’t help but ask the same subject-based question. How could
they not? It is all they know. They went to school. They see the world
in the way that school taught them to see it.
They don’t ask the questions they should ask because they can’t.
We need to transform badly formed educational questions into properly
formed ones. We need to transform subject-based questions into
cognitive process-based questions. This means changing statements
about the need to manage client relationships into statements about
cognition, and statements about product launch into ones about cognition,
and so on. What does it mean to make such transformations?
It means asking what one does when one manages client relationships
or when one launches a product. This is, of course, exactly what we
ask clients in our first meeting with them. For example, we ask: What
does one do when one launches a product?
What I plan to do here is reveal what we do next, namely, the subject
to cognitive ability transformation process. We must do the transformation
properly and then make clear what one does in course design
after one has figured out what really needs to be taught.
Let’s start simple. Let’s imagine we want to train insurance adjusters
to decide what compensation a policy owner is entitled to after a
hurricane hits his property. (Yes, I do live in Florida, but I can’t say I
care much about this process personally.) I found this on the Internet
covering this subject:
Catastrophe Adjusting Refresher
Course Description: This is a course package comprised of three
courses plus a bonus section and downloadable documents.
One of the three courses is this:
68 Teaching Minds
Catastrophe Adjusting Skills and Techniques
Course Description: This is a course package comprised of seven
courses plus two bonus sections and a number of downloadable
documents.
This online class is for individuals who are new to adjusting
catastrophes, such as hurricanes, windstorms, and tornadoes.
The course is broken down into two key sections: “Getting
Prepared for Adjusting” and “The Actual Adjusting Process.”
The first section includes a number of course components and
background knowledge that can be done in preparation for any
catastrophe. The second part of the class takes you through
all the steps and processes required for adjusting residential
properties. This online package includes everything listed under
course topics.
Course Topics:
• Insurance Basics
• Tools of the Trade
• Working with Digital Photos
• Residential Construction Basics
• Claim File Components
• Homeowners Policy Interpretation
• Property Adjusting 101
• Getting organized
• Claim reporting
Course Length: 8 hours
Audience: Property adjusters who are new to processing and
adjusting catastrophe claims and need the knowledge and skills
required to be successful on the job.
One thing that jumps out here is the time. In 8 hours, the above
topics will all be covered.
Wow! Assuming an hour for each subject, this means you can
learn insurance basics, or residential construction basics, in an hour
if you take this course. What this means in practice, I assume, is that
Real-Life Learning Projects Considered 69
there will be some text to read and some questions to answer to make
sure that you have read the text. Personally, I doubt that one could
learn much about any of these subjects by oneself in 8 hours (or even
8 days.) Clearly, they are teaching vocabulary and a few facts. Most of
it will be forgotten.
Now suppose the insurance industry had come to me and asked
my company to build a course that covered these topics. What would
I say? (Apart from: Are you nuts?—not in 8 hours.)
I would start by asking what is hard about insurance adjusting. At
the same time, I would have already assumed that this was basically a
diagnosis task.
Diagnosis is a complex cognitive process that has three important
parts. The most important part is the end result. All successful diagnoses
result in an answer (cancer, stopped up sewer line, misfiring spark
plug, paranoia, etc.). These results are taken from a list of acceptable
answers and typically are not in any way inventive. The second part
is the case. A prototypical case for all possible results typically is compared
with the current case. A match determines the result. The third
part is the evidence. To construct a case, one must gather evidence.
When more than one prototypical case matches the situation, more
evidence needs to be gathered in order to differentiate the cases that
might match. Doctors call this differential diagnosis.
How does one learn to do diagnosis? One must know the prototypical
case, which often takes years for one to acquire naturally
through experience. One must know how to gather evidence, and
what constitutes evidence, and one must know the possible set of results.
All of this takes a long time to learn. But the process itself is very
much the same no matter what you are diagnosing. So, one question
we would ask was whether the students in the course had any experience
diagnosing anything. It is easier to teach diagnosis to people who
have done it before even if the subject matter is different this time.
Another question we would ask is how much the students knew about
the basics of the subject matter since it is easier to teach diagnosis to
those who already know the subject matter.
So when I ask what is hard about insurance adjusting, I have a
good idea of what the answer may be. It is probably in one of these
three things. Is it difficult to learn all the kinds of cases that there are
and what differentiates one from another? This depends on how many
70 Teaching Minds
types of cases there are. Is it hard to gather evidence properly? Probably.
It usually is. Is it hard to know all the possible results? It might
not be. It might be hard to decide on a result, however, since the result
is usually to pay some amount of money, so how much money would
be the key question. All this takes practice, so what we really need to
know is where the main areas of practice should be.
So now we have a real question to ask:
Q1: How can we practice gathering evidence, learning about
prototypical cases, and knowing how to determine the correct
final result in insurance adjusting?
Notice that this is a very different question from asking what an
insurance adjuster knows and then asking how to tell students what
they should know.
Making the transformation from the list of knowledge given above
by the online course offerers into Q1 is the real issue in transforming
subject-based education into cognitive process- based education.
Let’s discuss a different type of example. My company was invited
into a technical college in Peru to discuss how to teach accounting.
Why would you want to teach accounting? I asked. Because the students
need to know it, I was told. Why? I said. Because they need it in their
work. So I changed the subject. I asked, What work do most people do
when they graduate from your school?
It turns out most of their graduates ran fast-food restaurants. Then
why do they need to learn accounting? They need it in order to run a restaurant.
I am sure there is some accounting done as part of running a
restaurant, but surely not every part of accounting is needed. And, I
asked, Do you actually teach how to run a restaurant?
Of course they didn’t. Why not? Because accounting is an academic
subject and managing fast-food employees and ordering meat
are not. They hire an accounting professor and he knows accounting
and knows nothing about running a restaurant. Even a practical technical
school gets caught up in subject-based education in part because
it hires graduates from that system who know only what they themselves
were taught.
What are the cognitive processes involved in running a fast-food
restaurant? Let’s see which are relevant.

Conceptual processes

3. Causation YES
4. Judgment YES
Social processes
1. Influence YES
2. Teamwork YES
3. Negotiation YES
4. Describing YES
Hmm. All of them. How can this be?
Managing a business, any business, requires one to influence employees,
negotiate with suppliers, plan future moves, determine what
isn’t working, teach employees how to work together, make judgments
about people and processes, and so on.
All this should give a hint about how to approach a business that
wants to teach its employees to do their jobs properly. One must teach
each of the 12 processes, but they need to be taught in the actual context
of what people will do when they graduate. This does not mean
that for every problem there are 12 courses that need to be created.
While you might need to predict an employee’s behavior, this does
not mean there should be a prediction course. This is not a problem
because there never is such a course. A businessperson has to make
judgments, and determine causes of problems, and so on, so maybe we
should have courses in each of those processes. But this makes no sense.
We must teach people to deal with the real-life issues that arise
in any situation they are preparing to work in. In other words, the
72 Teaching Minds
designer of a course on how to manage a restaurant must focus on
the typical goal conflict situations that a new manager would have to
confront. The course designer must create a fictional situation where
it is necessary to convince an employee to do something or to find out
why something that was asked of an employee did not happen.
The magic word is scenario. Scenarios are like plays. Things happen
and you have to deal with them. A well-written scenario makes sure
that all of the processes that could be at all relevant to what you want
to teach, occur in this new context. In a reasonable education system,
students would have been practicing all of these processes all of their
lives. But we do not have a reasonable education system. We have
one based in subjects. So our cognitive processes are not rehearsed
over time in different contexts by constant practice. Instead we learn
knowledge about subjects.
To remedy this, a course designer (and a teacher if the teacher has
that freedom) must make sure that as many of the cognitive processes
as are relevant to a situation naturally occur within the scenario being
constructed to simulate what will happen in real life later on. Not every
situation requires diagnosis, but many do. Not every situation has
a goal conflict or forces one to make predictions or plans, but many
do. If what needs to be taught naturally lends itself to working on
any of the 12 cognitive processes, then the training being built must
concentrate on that. If there could be diagnosis, then there should be
training in diagnosis in that context, and that training must supersede
the garnering of facts.
Schools are tough to change. We are trying, but the subject-based
educators have a few hundred years head start. However, in designing
new training, it is quite possible to reorient subject-based courses and
turn them into cognitive process-based courses that are much more
satisfying to both the teacher and the student.

Sit down before fact as a little child, be prepared to give up
every conceived notion, follow humbly wherever and whatever
abysses nature leads, or you will learn nothing.
—Thomas Huxley
Slave Boy: So it really doesn’t matter how you classify a teaching/
learning problem because there are many methods that could
apply, correct?
Socrates: And what follows from this?
Slave Boy: That it is not the classification that matters but the
methods entailed in that classification.
Socrates: And what do all these methods have in common?
Slave Boy: They all involve practice
Socrates: And what else?
Slave Boy: Real experience.
Socrates: And how is experience stored?
Slave Boy: Through cases.
Socrates: Expressed how?
Slave Boy: As stories
Socrates: So what follows from all this?
Slave Boy: That the methodology entailed in each classification of
learning types is not the real issue.
Socrates: And what is the real issue?
Slave Boy: Practice
Socrates: And?
Slave Boy: Dialogue
Socrates: Why dialogue?
Slave Boy: Because it is through dialogue that stories are solidified
and indexed
Socrates: So the classification of learning types doesn’t really matter
then, does it?

Slave Boy: Oh no, dear teacher, I beg to differ. The classification helps
us think about the real issues in education.
Socrates: Indeed.
CHAPTER 7
Knowledge-Based Education vs.
Process-Based Education
Diagnosis is not the end, but the beginning of practice.
—Martin H. Fischer
In our society we have set up schools to teach knowledge. We concern
ourselves with what facts children know, we test to make sure they
know them, and then we complain that the schools are failing when
they don’t. This idea is so ingrained in our way of looking at schooling
that when people like me complain about it, we are seen as people
who are rambling around muttering to ourselves.
There are so many people having anxiety attacks about what kids
know, it seems one can find an article about it in every news segment
on education.
I happened on an article in Huffington Post written by someone
named Schweitzer who is listed as “having served at the White
House during the Clinton Administration as Assistant Director for
International Affairs in the Office of Science and Technology Policy.”
Here is a piece of what he said:
The health care debate cannot be understood in historic context
because many Americans have never heard of Thomas Jefferson.
Extrapolating from state surveys, only 14% of American high
school students can name who wrote the Declaration of
Independence. Nearly 75% do not know that George Washington
was our first president. . . . We can say that our educational
system has failed when the vast majority of American students
do not know enough to pass an exam to qualify as American
citizens.
This is an astonishing statement.
75
76 Teaching Minds
Why do we have such a failed system? Could it be the policies of
presidents like Clinton, who pursued a policy of never offending the
teachers unions by doing anything threatening to them, like changing
the curriculum?
Or, could it be that people such as this writer define education
in terms of random facts they wished everyone knew? The problem
is not that people don’t know who Thomas Jefferson was. If citizens
knew who he was, would that mean that they could think clearly and
not be influenced by all the special interests who were trying to tell
them what to think? If they knew who George Washington was, what
exactly would they know about him? That he could never tell a lie?
This is obviously untrue, and many have written about what a good
liar he actually was. That he was a brilliant general? There is lots of
evidence against that. That he owned 300 slaves? This is not usually
mentioned. That he married a rich woman probably so he could get
her land? Historians discuss this. Schools never do. Nevertheless, people
are upset because our students don’t know our national myths and
some random facts.
The real issue in the healthcare debate is that the general public
can’t think clearly. That would have a simple explanation. The schools
don’t even try to teach people to think clearly.
I mentioned President Clinton above, but really all U.S. presidents
are culpable. It may not be their fault. Certainly they are given terrible
information.
Lamar Alexander, former Secretary of Education (under George
H.W. Bush) was speaking in the U.S. Senate recently on restoring
teaching history to its “rightful place” and making sure that history
was part of the NCLB act. Here is a quote from him from 2006:
Just one example of how far we are from helping our children
learn what they need to know. The fourth grade national
report card test asked students to identify the following
passage, “We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men
are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator
with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life,
Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.” Students were given
four choices: Constitution, Mayflower Compact, Declaration
of Independence, and Articles of Confederation. Less than
Knowledge-Based Education vs. Process-Based Education 77
half the students answered correctly that that came from the
Declaration of Independence. Another question said, “Imagine
that you landed in Philadelphia in the summer of 1776. Describe
an important event that is happening there.” Nearly half
the students couldn’t answer the question correctly that the
Declaration of Independence was being signed.
Politicians never seem to get it about education. What history do
students “need to know”? None, actually, unless they plan on being
historians, or maybe senators. Now I realize this is a radical point of
view, but history is not something anyone needs to know.
Why not?
Because knowing what happened in Philadelphia in 1776 does
not in fact make you a better citizen, no matter what Alexander says.
Random historical “facts” do not make one a critical thinker about
history nor do they promote clear thinking about current political
issues. Such “facts” are almost always used by politicians to justify
whatever it is they already believe. Understanding how human events
typically flow is, in fact, quite valuable, but that has more to do with
understanding human nature and prior circumstances than it does
with memorizing facts that politicians deem important to know. A
good citizen would be one who carefully considered the issues when
voting. That would mean being able to diagnose problems and evaluate
proposed solutions. But that would produce a citizenry that could
ask hard questions of politicians, which is probably not what these
politicians are aiming for.
In 1776 we had a bunch of politicians who, if the present set are
any example, surely were voting for their own special interests. The
fact that we, as a country, feel the need to make them into folk heroes
does not make it one bit more likely they were any better or worse
than the current people who govern us. What Alexander is really arguing
for is more indoctrination—more informing students what to
think instead of teaching them how to think.
It would be nice if one simply could point a finger and say it is all
the politicians’ fault. They really don’t want people to think all that
clearly. But politicians are only part of the problem.
Recently, a report was issued about the teaching of mathematics,
stating:
78 Teaching Minds
Students who complete Algebra II are more than twice as
likely to graduate from college compared to students with less
mathematical preparation. 1
The natural assumption here is that we must hurry up and teach
more Algebra II, of course. Except that obviously is not what is going
on; it just serves the interests of those who wrote the report to put it
that way. Here is another statement from that report:
Students who depended on their native intelligence learned less
than those who believed that success depended on how hard
they worked.
The claim is simply this: If you work harder, you get into college.
Now the question is: Why are the writers of this report claiming that
the thing that students have to work harder at is Algebra II?
It is easy enough to see why this panel decided that. At stake was a
$100 million federal budget request for Math Now, and the people who
were on the panel were people who would receive that funding. University
professors issue reports asking for grant money to be approved
that state that the nation will not succeed without that grant money.
Vested interests are nothing new. I am sometimes amazed that no one
points this stuff out, however. It is well established that everyone must
know algebra. The fact that this is well established by those who make
money on the teaching of algebra is never brought up by the New York
Times, which published a lead article on the report, or by anyone else,
it seems.
My favorite part of the Times article was the following:
Dr. Faulkner, a former president of the University of Texas at
Austin, said the panel “buys the notion from cognitive science
that kids have to know the facts.”
Dr. Faulkner, let me point out, is a chemist, and I am pretty sure
he doesn’t really know much about cognitive science. But cognitive
science has been used of late to justify a great deal of what is wrong
in education. E.D. Hirsch, an English professor at the University of
Virginia, made a career of making lists of stuff every kid should know.
When cognitive scientists trashed this work as nonsense, he cited the
Knowledge-Based Education vs. Process-Based Education 79
idea that one needs background knowledge in order to read, which is
both true and a product of various works in cognitive science.
Hirsch was made to look like a fool so often that he resorted to hiring
a cognitive science professor at Virginia, who has written a book
justifying the same nonsense with more cognitive science facts. 2
There is plenty of work in cognitive science that shows that background
knowledge helps people interpret the world around them, and
thus reading, for example, is facilitated by having knowledge about
the world about which you are reading. This idea, however, does not
imply that ramming facts down a kid’s throat is the way for them to
acquire that background knowledge. Knowledge acquisition is a natural
result of engaging in cognitive processes that are being employed
to satisfy a truly held goal.
If you are trying to find your way around a city, you will learn the
streets of that city and develop what is called a cognitive map. If you
try to memorize those same streets, it simply won’t work. Real knowledge
is acquired as a natural part of an employed cognitive process in
service of a goal. But Hirsch and Willingham know nothing about cognitive
processes. They only know, and talk about, how best to acquire
more facts. Politicians listen to them and there are more tests to make
sure those facts have been acquired. No one remembers Algebra II or
much about the Founding Fathers because that stuff is mostly facts
acquired independent of any real goals that will employ those facts.
Knowledge is not the real issue in education or in mental life. The
real issue is developing facility with doing various cognitive processes.
Knowledge comes along for free with practice of these processes in
specific domains.
There is no evidence whatsoever that accumulation of facts and
background knowledge are the same thing. In fact, there is plenty of
evidence to the contrary. Facts learned out of context, and apart from
actual real-world experience that is repeated over and over, are not
retained.
Why don’t kids like school? Because we teach them knowledge
that they know they won’t need. How do they know this? They know
that their parents don’t know this stuff—that is how. Many kids don’t
like math much and it is clear why. They find it boring and irrelevant
to anything they care about doing. If we think math is so important,
then why not teach it within a meaningful context, where it actually
is used? There is plenty of evidence that shows that teaching math
80 Teaching Minds
within a real and meaningful context works a whole lot better than
shoving it down their throats and following that with a multiple
choice test. But for the vast majority of citizens, Algebra II is never
used.
There is no evidence whatsoever that says that a nation that is
trailing in math test scores will somehow trail in GDP or whatever it
is we really care about. This is just plain silly, but we keep repeating
the mantra that we are behind Korea in math as if it has been proven
that this matters in some way. Nothing of the sort has been proven.
What is true is that there are a great many vested interests that need
to keep teaching math: tutoring companies, testing companies, math
teachers, book publishers, and many others who make lots of money
when people are scared into thinking that their kid won’t get into college
because he or she is bad at Algebra II. Nearly every grownup has
forgotten whatever algebra he or she ever learned to pass those silly
tests, so it is clear that algebra is meaningless for adult life. Any college
professor who is honest will tell you that algebra almost never comes
up in any college course, and when it does come up it usually needn’t
be there in the first place.
So, math isn’t important and history isn’t important. What is
important?
Tests. Tests are very important. Not to me, of course, but my vote
isn’t being counted.
The past two presidents have been obsessed with raising test scores.
I am assuming this is true because some political analysts somewhere
have determined that the general public believes in the significance of
raising tests scores and will vote for politicians who are able to show
that they have done it. There can’t be any other reason. Try taking
those tests. Most of them are available online. See how well you can
do at them.
But what could really be wrong with testing and emphasizing test
scores?
TESTING TEACHES THAT THERE ARE RIGHT ANSWERS
The problem is that in real life, the important questions don’t have answers
that are clearly right or wrong. “Knowing the answer” has made
school into Jeopardy. It is nice to win a game show, but important
Knowledge-Based Education vs. Process-Based Education 81
decisions are made through argumentation and force of reason—not
by knowing the right answer. People who know a lot are generally
quite smart. I could do well at Jeopardy as could most professors, I
would think. But we are not successful intellectuals because we know a
lot of facts. We know a lot of facts because we are successful intellectuals.
People have got this backwards.
Consider athletes. A great baseball player and a great basketball
player, it can be assumed, also will be very good at lifting weights. But
they did not become good at lifting weights and then become great
athletes. It was the other way around. They had a natural talent for
hitting a ball or shooting baskets and then they had to get stronger in
order to compete with others who had the same talents. The talent is
the reason—not the weightlifting. Michael Jordan, a really great athlete,
couldn’t become a successful baseball player because he couldn’t
hit a curve ball. That talent had nothing to do with the athletic ability
that made him a great basketball player. Hitting a curve ball is a
different kind of talent. His weightlifting ability was the same either
way. I know a lot of facts and I am talented at designing educational
software. The facts I know do not help with the talent. But the more
educational software I design in different domains of knowledge, the
more facts I pick up.
When we look at people who are knowledgeable and confuse that
with people who can think well, we totally miss the point about education.
Education ought not be focused on imparting facts any more
than athletic training ought to be focused on weightlifting. You learn
to hit a ball by hitting one and you learn to think clearly by thinking.
Focusing on the 12 cognitive processes I have outlined, rather than
focusing on fact acquisition, helps one learn to think.
TESTING TEACHES THAT SOME SUBJECTS ARE MORE
IMPORTANT THAN OTHERS
The tests are small in number. If there were thousands to choose from,
then perhaps people could get tested in fiber optics instead of history.
But the system has determined which subjects are the most important.
The system made that determination in 1892. Some things have
changed in the world since then. There are a few new subjects—psychology,
computers, medicine, business, and law, for example. Many
82 Teaching Minds
new sciences and social sciences came into being after 1892. But none
of those will ever make it into the sacred group of math, science, English,
economics, and history because everyone seems to think that the
big five were handed down on tablets to Moses.
And everyone is sure that their favorite subject is the most important
one, be it history, literature, math, or science. Math and science
are having a big moment as I write this. We hear that the nation does
not produce enough students interested in math and science. Something
must be done.
I was a math major in college. I got 98 on every math Regents test
offered. (I lived in New York where testing ruled in the world in the
1950s too.) My mother always asked where the other two points went.
I grew up to be a computer science professor. I am not a math phobe.
But neither am I a math proponent. I have never used math in my
professional life.
I always start any discussion on education by asking if the person
I am talking with knows the quadratic formula. One out of one hundred
knows it. (The last few times I asked, the people included the
head of a major testing service, the governor of a U.S. state, various
state legislators, and 200 high school principals.) Then why do we
teach this obviously useless piece of information to every student in
the world? Because math is important, of course.
Why?
As a person who was involved with graduate admissions for 30
years at three of the top ten universities in the country, I know what
this hysteria is actually about. Nearly all applicants to graduate computer
science programs (which is what I know—but it is true in most
fields of engineering and science) are foreign nationals. We wonder
why American kids aren’t interested in these fields—which is a reasonable
enough question. But then we have come up with an extraordinary
answer.
What we say is that we must teach math and science better in high
school when what we mean is that it would be nice to have some more
American-born scientists.
Do we really believe that the reason that there are so many foreign
applicants to U.S. graduate programs is that they teach math and science
better in other countries? China and India provide most of the
applicants. They also have most of the world’s people. And many of
Knowledge-Based Education vs. Process-Based Education 83
those people will do anything to live in the United States. So they cram
math down their own throats, knowing that it is a ticket to America.
Very few of these applicants come from Germany, Sweden, France, or
Italy. Is this because they teach math badly there or is it because those
people aren’t desperate to move to the United States?
U.S. students are not desperate to move to the United States, so
when you suggest to them that they numb themselves with formulas
and equations, they refuse to do so. The right answer would be to
make math and science actually interesting, but with those awful tests
as the ultimate arbiter of success, this is very difficult to do. Math and
science are not important subjects. There, I said it. Start the lynching.
One can live a happy life without ever having taken a physics course
or knowing what a logarithm is.
But being able to reason on the basis of evidence actually is important.
You cannot live well without this skill (or any of the other
cognitive processes I have been writing about). Diagnosis is science
as it actually is practiced by scientists. Science is not a bunch of
stuff to be memorized. It is the fact-based tests that cause this problem.
We don’t need more math and science. We need more people
who can think.
TESTING FOCUSES TEACHERS ON WINNING NOT TEACHING
Many teachers are extremely frustrated by the system they have found
themselves a part of. They cannot afford to spend time teaching a
student or getting a concept across if the issues being taught are not
on the tests. They are judged on the basis of test scores. So any rational
teacher gives up teaching and becomes a kind of test preparation
coach. Testing has become a kind of contest between schools, much
like football. I like football. But the football mentality that envelops
our concept of schooling is a disaster.
Take a look at this excerpt of an article taken from my local
paper. What our educators are worrying about is winning the game.
Unfortunately, the game has nothing to do with educating students
and everything to do with test scores, which are probably less valuable
than football scores in predicting anything about the future of
children’s lives.

Martin County School District won’t settle for B
July 27, 2007
STUART—The Martin County School District was just short
of earning a perfect report card from the state in late June.
But the district, which earned 18 A’s and one B, has a chance
to earn straight A’s. School officials are appealing J.D. Parker
School of Science, Math & Technology’s B grade. The Stuart
elementary school had enough points to be considered an “A”
school, but because the lowest 25 percent of the school’s students
didn’t make learning gains, the state dropped the grade to a B.
. . . .
Martin had the second-highest percentage of A schools
among the state’s 67 counties. Gilchrist County had the highest
percentage of A’s, though the county in northeastern Florida only
has four schools.
The district is also filing an appeal for Warfield Elementary
in Indiantown. The school received an A, but did not make
adequate yearly progress under the federal No Child Left Behind
Act, state data shows.
The result of all this is that teachers are now being “held accountable”
for their teaching, which is another way of saying, Get those test scores
up or else.
The following is from an article on the front page of the New York
Times (December 23, 2007):
Mr. Obama, for instance, in a speech last month in New
Hampshire denounced the law (NCLB) as “demoralizing our
teachers.” But he also said it was right to hold all children to
high standards. “The goals of this law were the right ones,” he
said.
When Mr. Edwards released an education plan earlier this
year, he said the No Child law needed a “total overhaul.” But he
said he would continue the law’s emphasis on accountability.
And at the elementary school in Waterloo, Mrs. Clinton said
she would “do everything I can as senator, but if we don’t get it
done, then as president, to end the unfunded mandate known as
No Child Left Behind.”
Knowledge-Based Education vs. Process-Based Education 85
But she, too, added: “We do need accountability.”
Accountability must play well in Peoria because every politician is for
it.
Accountability must mean to voters, I assume, that teachers will
be measured by how well they teach their students. Political candidates,
always willing to hop on an uncontroversial point of view, are
all quite certain that the voters know what they are talking about. No
matter how stupid NCLB is, no matter how mean spirited, no matter
how awful for both teachers and students, its very horror rests on the
premise that no one seems to be disputing that the federal government
has the right to tell the schools what to teach and to see whether
they are indeed teaching it.
How is this premise wrong?
• It assumes that all schools should teach the same
subjects.
• It assumes that some subjects are more important than
other subjects.
• It assumes that all important subjects can be easily tested.
• It assumes that seeing who did better than whom in
school is an intrinsic part of the educational process.
• It assumes that all children have the same educational
needs.
Let’s take them one by one.
ALL SCHOOLS SHOULD TEACH THE SAME SUBJECTS
Why is this wrong?
First, it is wrong because subjects aren’t what should be taught.
But even if one follows the view presented in this book that the issue
is cognitive processes and not subjects, cognitive processes need to be
applied to actual domains, that are relevant to the life of the student..
Kids in New York come from, and will live in, a different world than
their compatriots in New Mexico. In New Mexico, I was asked whether
we could teach casino management and land use. Yes, we could, but
not if there is federal accountability about algebra and 20 other subjects
that make it impossible to fit these subjects in.
86 Teaching Minds
SOME SUBJECTS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN OTHER
SUBJECTS
Yes, we have electives. But they don’t matter. Because accountability
means making sure that we first teach what does matter. What matters
is the stuff that we are holding people accountable for. Since this
seems to be math and science these days, for no good reason I can
discern, this means that we will get to the stuff that would excite kids
and keep them in school, and might teach them some job skills, after
we are done with the important stuff. But I am certain that none of
the politicians mentioned in the Times article knows the quadratic
formula or the elements of the periodic table, which is, of course, the
stuff of accountability since it is so easy to test. Then how can that be
the important stuff?
ALL IMPORTANT SUBJECTS CAN BE EASILY TESTED
Yes, there are right answers in math. But are there right answers in
whether we should have invaded Iraq? No? Does that mean we can’t
teach how governments actually work and how to get reasoned arguments
to be heard? Is there a right speech political candidates should
make? Does that mean we can’t ask students to give speeches because
we can’t easily assess them? Do we teach only subjects for which there
are clear right answers? We do now, which is one reason why school
is a deadly experience for one and all and will remain so as long as accountability
is the key word in government.
SEEING WHO DID BETTER THAN WHOM IN SCHOOL IS AN
INTRINSIC PART OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS
It really is all about competition, isn’t it? Bush, both Clintons, and
Obama are all the winners of the school competition. They went to
Ivy League schools, which seems to be the real issue for most parents.
I taught at Ivy League schools and I was profoundly unimpressed
with the test- taking, grade-grubbing students I found there. The goal
of education is not to say who won, and it is not to tell Harvard
whom to admit. The goal is provide real-world skills, some of which
Knowledge-Based Education vs. Process-Based Education 87
may not be so easy to assess until the graduate actually shows up in
the real world.
ALL CHILDREN HAVE THE SAME EDUCATIONAL NEEDS
There is more than a 50% dropout rate in many high schools because
we have forgotten that not everyone is going to Harvard and that
going to Harvard is not the goal of education. Some children simply
need to learn about ethics and business and child raising and how the
legal system works, how to take care of their health and how to understand
when politicians are saying things that make no sense. Why
wouldn’t those subjects be critical? No politician seems to think any
of those are more important than math and science. How about the
student who has a passion for the environment, or doing social good,
or being a good parent, or running for office? Does every student’s
school life have to be the same?
STUDENTS LEARN THAT MEMORIZATION IS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN THINKING
In an answer-obsessed world, “go figure it out for yourself” or “go try
it and see what happens” are replaced by more memorization. Giving
kids a chance to fail helps them learn. Actively preventing failure by
telling the right answer just helps kids pass tests. In each of the cognitive
processes that I presented in Chapter 4, failure is not only an
option—but it will happen all the time. One’s first hypothesis will be
wrong. One will plan badly or botch a negotiation. These processes are
all about failure, not right answers. Recovering from failure, getting
better next time, is what learning is all about. Learning entails failure
and cannot happen without it. The kind of failure I have in mind here
is expectation failure. This means that we can fail even when we succeed,
because we didn’t expect things to happen quite like they did.
Our predictions are often wrong. We work at getting better at making
them and explaining to ourselves why we were wrong. This process of
expectation failure followed by explanation is at the heart of learning.
That’s what learning is all about. Memorization has nothing whatever
to do with learning, unless you want to become a singer.
88 Teaching Minds
How can we offer new curricula and new ways of learning if no matter
what we do children must pass algebra tests? Each administration
says over and over again that science is important, but since science
in high school is defined for the most part by boring tests of vocabulary
terms and definitions, who would be excited to learn science? If
a really good scientific reasoning curriculum were created, the schools
could not offer it unless it helped kids pass the very same tests that
that curriculum was intended to replace.
We must make radical change. The only way to do that is to stop
focusing on teaching subjects and stop using the fact-based tests are
the natural end result of that focus on subjects.
An education system based on cognitive processes would look
very different indeed.
CHAPTER 8
New Curricula for a
New Way of Teaching
A smart man makes a mistake, learns from it, and never
makes that mistake again. But a wise man finds a smart man
and learns from him how to avoid the mistake altogether.
—Roy H. Williams
How do we put all this into practice? First, let’s make sure we avoid
creating departments around each of the 12 cognitive processes. The
organization around subjects, which is the basis of how our schools
are organized, is the source of the problem in both universities and
high schools.
Subjects create departments. Departments in universities are a serious
problem for students and administrators. They represent silos
where decisions are made that will help the department prosper. Departments
lobby for their courses to be required so they can hire more
faculty. They make sure majors in their departments follow certain
rules for graduation that are intended to make students scholars in
their field rather than practitioners. Departments are the reason students
graduate without job skills. Faculty are almost always against
practical training. English departments have to be forced to teach students
to write. Computer science departments have to be forced to
teach students to program in a way that would make them hirable by
industry. Psychology departments avoid teaching clinical psychology,
which is really what students what to learn more about.
For about 10 years I have been building new online story-centered
curricula. The idea behind a story-centered curriculum (SCC) is that a
good curriculum should tell a story. That story should be one in which
the student plays one or more roles. Those roles should be those that
normally come up in such a story. These curricula are intended to
teach students how to actually do something. The roles students play
89
90 Teaching Minds
in the story are ones that a graduate of such a program actually might
do in real life or actually might need to know about (possibly because
he is likely to manage or work with someone who performs that role).
Stories have been at the center of human consciousness for a long
time. People tell stories, and the stories they tell shape who they are.
People hear stories and remember those that resonate deeply with
them. And, people live stories. The stories they live become part of
them in a deep way. While we may easily forget everything about a
traditional course we took in high school, we can hardly forget the
roles we have played in real-life experiences, especially when those
roles went on for a long time and had emotional impact on us.
The central argument here is that good education requires good
stories—not solely stories that one is told, however. A good education
relies on the creation of stories that a student can participate in and
feel deeply about. This means that those stories must include others
who are playing roles the student will have to deal with on the job,
and that the roles the student plays in the stories must relate to the
current or future roles that the student intends to play in his or her
career.
The SCC is inherently goal-based. The goals must be those that a
student has already. For small boys, for example, it can be assumed
that the idea of building a truck or designing an airplane is an activity
that would grab their interest. For older students, these would be
ones like current or future job assignments. In an online world, it is
quite possible to create hundreds or thousands of choices and allow
students to pick what they want to do—not what they want to study,
but activities that genuinely excite them.
The SCC is inherently activity-based. The tasks that constitute the
SCC must relate to goals that the student has and the tasks that people
actually perform in the roles that the student will play when the training
is completed. Thus, an SCC is made up of a set of real-life types of
tasks that make up the bulk of the work done by the student, and a set
of events that occasionally interrupt or augment those tasks.
Thanks to a grant from the Kauffman Foundation, we built a fullyear
(all day, every day) high school curriculum in health sciences.
This would be, ideally, used in a high school that offered perhaps over
100 full-year curricula. Students would choose four that they liked and
after completing them would graduate from high school. All of the
curricula would teach what it is like to live in a part of the real world,
as well as allowing for practice in the 12 cognitive processes. It takes
New Curricula for a New Way of Teaching 91
a while to build these SCCs and they are quite expensive to build, but
they cost less than building a new school, so the money could easily
be made available.
Let’s look at the health sciences curriculum we built.
The year in health sciences comprises nine “rotations,” each lasting
3 to 4 full-time weeks on average, in which students experience
what it is like to solve the kinds of problems real professionals solve
in various specialized fields related to biology and healthcare. These
experiences are set in realistic stories in which the students play a
leading role. The rotations are conducted consecutively. Students primarily
work on assigned projects in teams, although each rotation has
independent tasks as well. Each of the rotations was created with the
assistance of an expert in each of the respective specialties.
One goal of the curriculum is for students to discover that practicing
science is fun and relevant to real-world problems. They also
should develop a sense of what it would be like to work as a practitioner
in the various health sciences fields, so they can decide whether
they might someday like a career in healthcare or biology. Of course,
the real goal is to enable practice in the 12 cognitive processes. Let’s
see how that happens.
The rotations in the year in health sciences are:
1. Internal Medicine—Students diagnose and develop a treatment
plan for a fictional patient who has a major illness and
ultimately requires an organ transplant as a part of his
treatment. Students also make judgments about ethical issues
related to transplants, following a principled approach to
ethical reasoning.
2. Nutrition Advisor—Students coach fictional nutritional
advisors on their management of teenage clients’ nutritional
concerns and issues. During the process they also develop
nutritional plans for themselves and for a peer.
3. Super Worm—Students work for a fictional philanthropic
billionaire who asks them to invent ways of modifying the
common earthworm so it can more efficiently improve soil to
better supply the world with food.
4. Sports Medic—Students diagnose and develop treatment plans
for patients who have sports-related injuries. In the process
students produce in-depth reports on additional issues related
to sports medicine.
92 Teaching Minds
5. Designer Genes—Students consider ethical and political issues
related to genetic engineering, for example, cloning, gene
therapies, and the manufacturing of drugs. In the process
they learn about DNA and the basics of genetic engineering.
6. Plant Plague—Students working for a fictional county farming
agency are faced with an anomalous powdery mildew that
has infected wheat in their local area. They investigate how
the new strain of mildew arose and how it spread to this area
and crop in particular. They work to develop a treatment for
the current crop; then they develop a way to alter the wheat
or the way in which it is grown to prevent future fungal
outbreaks.
7. Medical Detective—Students work with the fictional county
medical examiner to conduct medical investigations. They
are asked to determine the time and cause of death for
various mysterious cases.
8. Cutting Costs Without Cutting Care—In this rotation,
students consider business aspects related to healthcare.
Students play the role of a hospital consultant whose job
it is to discern why the hospital is losing money and make
recommendations for correcting the situation. In the process
they confront ethical issues related to cutting costs in the
area of healthcare.
9. Outbreak—In this rotation, students work in the areas
of infectious disease, epidemiology, and public health
administration. They begin by diagnosing the cause of a
fictional patient’s infection that stems from bacteria in a
food item. They then learn that many people across the
country have been found with similar illnesses. Students
have to develop a plan to manage the outbreak due to the
availability of the food item to a wide population. Later they
are fictionally hired to develop a readiness plan for a possible
worldwide pandemic.
Students spend weeks in each rotation. What do they learn?
Remember, the answer cannot be that they learn about health sciences.
Why not?
Because that is really not the issue. No high school student learning
a subject really learns that subject. Students forget what they have
New Curricula for a New Way of Teaching 93
learned in a day or in a week or a year. Professors always assume that
entering high school students need to be retaught the basics. They
may pick up the general idea but in reality the content of the subject
area is, at best, vaguely understood. What they can learn is that they
like a subject or have an interest in learning more.
The only other thing they can learn involves the 12 cognitive processes.
So let’s look at how the health sciences curriculum covers these
processes.
By explicit design, all of the health science rotations emphasize all
four of the “social processes.” The students work in teams (teamwork),
sometimes even in collaboration with other teams. The students and
teams necessarily try to influence one another, negotiate with one another,
and constantly have to describe their points of view and their
results. The step-by-step instructions that are part of every rotation
explicitly discuss how best to handle this. Now let’s look at four of the
rotations in detail.
INTERNAL MEDICINE
The essence of this rotation is learning about how to do diagnosis,
in this case, of liver disease. Students watch a detailed interview with
the patient, select (after some orientation) specific tests to administer,
receive the results, and report suggested diagnoses. They must communicate
what they have discovered. So they describe the patient’s
symptoms and must analyze and discuss the causation of the patient’s
symptoms. Then they begin to plan a course of action. Planning what
to do is a major component of this rotation. To do this they must
make a judgment as a crucial part of the diagnostic work. They must
do this again as well in the ethics unit that occurs later in this rotation.
In that unit they undertake a detailed study of both medical and ethical
issues in liver transplantation—which is where evaluation comes
into play. Here the students become consciously aware of their values
as they decide how to influence medical and ethical choices.
SUPER WORM
The students plan carefully for this unit (a hypothetical redesign of the
earthworm to make it even more helpful in agriculture). Hypothetical
94 Teaching Minds
experimentation is performed repeatedly as the students predict the
effects of various modifications of the worm’s anatomy. Describing
their conclusions is important—the project’s goals; the worm’s anatomy,
physiology, and behavior; and the interaction of anatomy and
function.
SPORTS MEDIC
The core of this rotation is four athletic injuries. In each case the students
examine the patients, describe their observations in detail, and
perform a formal differential diagnosis. The students must use judgment
and modeling to predict the effect of providing a competitive
athlete with an artificial bone implant.
DESIGNER GENES
This rotation has three primary activities. In all three, evaluation plays
a role as they discuss genetically modified animals, crops, and muscles.
Describing, planning, and influence all are involved as the students
prepare a congressman for hearings. All four of the social processes
come into play in formal debates.
What should be clear here is that what the health sciences curriculum
seems to be about and what it is actually about are very different
things. It seems to be about teaching health sciences content, when
what it is really about is having students practice various cognitive
processes that occur again and again throughout life. This was the goal
of the design, pure and simple: to help students practice thinking. It
really doesn’t matter what arena they are thinking in. We get them
interested in thinking by having them think about something that
interests them and is connected to a world they may wish to explore
later on in life. They may indeed learn something about that world as
well, but the point is the cognitive process-based education, not the
subject-based education.
I thought of the idea of building SCCs instead of using the normal
set of courses that constitute most students’ school year when I took
a job with Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) as the Chief Education
Officer of its new West Coast campus, located in Silicon Valley. There
New Curricula for a New Way of Teaching 95
were no faculty located at this campus, since Carnegie Mellon is in
Pittsburgh. I took this as an opportunity, not as a problem, since faculty
want to teach the way they always have taught. Lecturing is easy
and faculty like to do it. Students have learned to cope with lecturing
and later cramming for tests, so no one complains much. No one
learns much from this, but no one seems to be too concerned about it.
I was asked to design master’s degree programs in computer science.
It seemed to me that students entered a master’s degree program
because they wanted to get a good job after graduation, so I asked
what jobs they were preparing for as I looked at each Pittsburgh campus
program. Even though the faculty in Pittsburgh had been teaching
these master’s degree programs for years, faculty members were
surprisingly unconcerned with what students did after graduation.
They just taught their courses, their specialties actually, and assumed
the students would find value in them. This seemed an odd state of
affairs to anyone who looked at it from the outside, but as professor I
know that faculty are rarely concerned with master’s degree students
at all and naturally wouldn’t have given these programs that much
thought.
There was a great deal of hostility to the SCCs that were built by
my team and me. They were seen as threatening the existing structure
of courses and lectures. Nevertheless, the students liked them a great
deal and the people who mentored in them, after some initial resistance,
began to like them and promote them. This happened in the
areas of software engineering and software development.
The faculty in e-business liked what we had built so much that
they got rid of the existing course-based, e-business master’s degree
they had offered in Pittsburgh and now offer only the SCC version on
the main CMU campus.
SCCs work and work well. Students learn actual skills and teachers
feel like they are helping students do something real. But faculty,
who are used to the old classroom-style method, often resist doing the
hard work now required of them. This is true for students as well. One
mentor in the West Coast e-business program who himself had graduated
from the Pittsburgh classroom-based program said that he felt
sorry for the kids on the West Coast campus because they had to work
so hard. He noted that they were learning a lot more than he did but
that he had liked sitting in the back of the classroom and ignoring the
teacher. It was much easier and he had done well at that.
96 Teaching Minds
A story-centered curriculum is intended to teach cognitive processes,
not subjects. Subjects are, of course, covered, but they are not
really the point. Certain things need to be done again and again in
life, but those things can be learned only in context, not as an abstraction.
Different contexts must be provided in order to motivate
students and to provide real-world skills that will be remembered, not
because they were studied and tested, but because they were practiced
again and again.
What is life like in a story-centered curriculum? The first ones we
built were built as master’s degree programs at Carnegie Mellon’s new
West Coast campus. Here is Max Soderby, a mentor in the first one of
those master’s programs, talking about his experience:
I am almost jealous in a way because I see that they are gaining
skills more rapidly than I gained them when I was a student in
Pittsburgh at CMU’s campus. They get exposure to things that
we just talked about in a lecture hall, whereas they are actually
doing it: implementing actual software and putting designs
into practice. We mostly did homework and talked about it in a
lecture hall. So I am jealous in that respect. It is also a lot more
work, but that work pays off for the students.
Subject-based education is not really supposed to be training for work.
I once proposed to the president of Yale (Bart Giamatti) that we build
a master’s degree program in an area of computer science that would
help get people jobs after graduation. He said that that was training
and that Yale does not do training. The academic subjects taught at
Yale are meant to produce scholars. But, in a way, he was very wrong.
Yale does do training. Yale and almost all other colleges are divided
into departments, and a major in a department’s subject typically
is seen by the faculty as preparation for an academic career in that
subject.
The students may well have a different point of view, however.
Unfortunately, they come away disappointed. An English major could
be hoping to become a journalist, but the education that he will receive
is more likely to be appropriate for creating an English professor.
A math major may well want to be an actuary, but will not learn
actuarial science at Yale. He will learn to be a potential mathematics
professor. And, worst of all, in my own field of computer science, the
New Curricula for a New Way of Teaching 97
very idea that a Yale degree would make you capable of getting a good
job as a programmer is frowned upon by the faculty. They are training
computer science professors. This is the logical end result of subjectbased
training.
Now, what Giamatti had in mind as the end goal of college,
training for the mind, is a noble enough ideal, and a natural outcome
of cognitive process-based education. The classic liberal arts
view of education, one that a reader might think I am not in favor
of, is actually a better model than the model that has evolved in the
nation’s top universities. The idea that you should try thinking in
a variety of fields is a better plan, and one more in line with what I
am proposing here, than the model that exists on most universities’
campuses. The latter model, the one that makes students major in a
subject and thus supposedly become prepared to work in that field,
is really just a big lie.
There is nothing unusual here. Here again, is a statement from the
Ivy League professor whom I quoted earlier:
There is an unspoken rule at places like my university that if you
are really good, you do exactly what your teacher does.
So what are these schools training students for? It could be only one
thing—to become professors. There is no attempt to teach practical
real-world applications of the ideas taught in classes, in part because
the faculty themselves don’t know those applications. Here is the Big
Ten computer science professor again:
There are roughly 60 faculty members in computer science. They
cover all the traditional areas of computer science. Ironically,
software engineering, which is what 90% of the undergraduates
do when they graduate, is not covered. It is not considered an
intellectual or academic discipline. It is considered too practical.
There is only one software engineering course and it is taught by
an adjunct because no one really cares about it.
This is a real problem because (the Big Ten professor again). . .
There are hundreds of computer science majors here. The
faculty doesn’t feel it needs to change because there are students
98 Teaching Minds
clamoring for what is now offered. Ninety-eight percent of them
want to be programmers. Almost none of them want Ph.D.s.
I cannot go to a faculty meeting any more. I get into a fight
at every faculty meeting. I argue about teaching and education
and they think they know because they are professors. I cannot
subject myself anymore to their abuse.
These problems exist precisely because of the subject-based
education system. That system is about factual knowledge, and it is
this emphasis on factual knowledge that has given rise to the testing
mania that has swept the country. These problems exist because the
real mission of the university is very different than the general public
imagines.
Here is a quote and a story that I rather like:
A university is what a college becomes when the faculty loses
interest in students.—John Ciardi
Benjamin Franklin told the story of some Massachusetts
commissioners who invited the Indians to send a dozen of their
youth to study free at Harvard. The Indians replied that they
had sent some of their young braves to study there years earlier,
but on their return “they were absolutely good for nothing,
being neither acquainted with the true methods for killing deer,
catching beaver, or surprising an enemy.” They offered instead to
educate a dozen or so white children in the ways of the Indians
“and make men of them.”(From Benjamin Franklin, An American
Life, by Walter Isaacson)
What has changed? Key life skills no longer include catching beaver.
Otherwise, things are pretty much the same. Change “catching beaver”
to any modern daily skill, and Franklin’s story is just as valid
today.
What do students really learn at a great university? Parents never
really ask this question. They just know that their kid got into a good
college and that their child is lucky to go there.
Should you avoid sending your child to top schools because they
don’t teach so well there and really don’t plan to improve the situation
any time soon?
New Curricula for a New Way of Teaching 99
No. Of course not. If your child gets into Yale, send her there. It is
a great place. But you should know what Yale actually has to offer and
what it doesn’t.
If your child wants to be a professor, Yale is the place.
If your child wants to be an intellectual, Yale is the place.
If your child wants to go to law school, Yale is the place.
If your child wants to hobnob with the best and brightest, Yale is
the place.
If your child wants to have a fun time for 4 years, Yale is the
place.
Then what is wrong?
There is a problem only if you think that there is a different reason
to go to college than the reasons I have listed above.
Oh. There is this other problem. Many of the other 3,000 colleges
are trying very hard to imitate Yale. They attempt to provide similar
experiences and they can’t pull it off. Yale is a unique place. The nation
can afford only so many unique places, however. We cannot afford
having the main university of a state thinking it is Yale, as my
state university friend suggests. If every university has as its main focus
research and not education, then the best and brightest of each
state will be trained, not necessarily willingly, to be academics rather
than practitioners. There will be a great many students who came to
school for an education that will help them in their future lives who
will be disappointed to find out that that is not the type of education
being offered.
Professors at Yale are playing the prestige game. Unfortunately,
they are hardly alone in this.
My state university professor again:
We definitely want to be part of the superstar system but we have
no superstars. If we had them, we would probably lose them to
Harvard and Yale anyway. Nevertheless, we are obsessed with
the National Rankings put out by places like U.S. News and World
Report. Faculty and deans say they are not obsessed with them,
but rankings are an important part of the evaluation process and
shape a department’s growth. We want to be in the top 4 or 5
universities. We are not but that’s what we want to be.
100 Teaching Minds
U.S. News and World Report’s annual rankings weigh heavily on the
minds of the faculty and administration of universities who are in
the prestige game. These rankings are based on numbers: average SAT
scores of admitted students, average rank in class of admitted students,
faculty publications, and many other numbers that come out in favor
of research universities with world-class faculty. But world-class faculty
means faculty who care about research and not about teaching.
While there certainly is no harm in going to Harvard or Yale, the success
of their students hardly depends on what they learned in those
places and depends a great deal more on the fact that the best and the
brightest are the ones who go there in the first place.
These places get away with teaching courses in obscure issues in
literature and history, or in economic theory or in complex mathematics,
by pretending that they are really teaching students to think.
But does knowing obscure information necessarily imply that one is
a good thinker?
A good thinker, I claim, would be good at each of the 12 cognitive
processes.
What does it mean to be good at prediction, for example? Is a
2-year-old good at prediction? Is a dog good at prediction? Is a professional
gambler good at prediction? Is a stock trader good at prediction?
Is a mother of a toddler good at prediction? Is a politician good
at prediction? Is a scientist good at prediction?
We actually are quite good at assessing the ability of others at prediction
precisely because we have data to support our conclusions. We
know how good gamblers or stock traders are at predicting. If they are
very successful, we can say they are brilliant at what they do, or we can
say they are lucky. Those are our choices.
The same is true of scientists. Most scientists make predictions,
and those that are proven right are seen as brilliant. Luck enters into
science as well and quite often scientists say that a given Nobel Prize
winner was lucky and isn’t really all that bright.
Dogs are seen as being smart (for a dog) when they can correctly
predict the arrival of their master or bad weather or threats, and are
seen as stupid when they bark at thunder. Their behavior is seen as
stupid precisely because of the erroneous prediction that barking will
scare the thunder away. A dog’s inability to predict is exactly why we
think dogs are dumb animals, and when they surprise us with an accurate
prediction, they are seen as smart. Of course, we don’t expect
dogs to predict who will win the big game. We know their limitations.
New Curricula for a New Way of Teaching 101
But it is not only the accuracy of predictions that factors into our
sense of a person’s or an animal’s ability to think. We say that a person
is intelligent even when he predicts badly, if he gives good explanations
for his predictions even though they don’t pan out.
So when a sportscaster gives his prediction about the outcome of
an upcoming game, we think he is intelligent if he has thought it out
carefully, and if his explanation is coherent, and if his reasoning is
sound, and we give extra credit if some of his ideas are surprising in
some way. So, even if he subsequently turns out to be wrong, we still
think he is good at thinking.
But prediction is actually quite complicated to judge. We respect
great predictors. We think people who can predict well, especially
those who can explain their predictions well, are very intelligent. But,
often, we see intelligence when it may not be there. The reason is
scripts. And we may fail to see it when it is there. The reason for that
is explanations.
Scripts and explanations are at the beginning and at the end of
intelligent behavior. What do I mean by that?
When a child is learning about the world, she is learning the
scripts that commonly are followed in the world that she inhabits.
I have explained this at length in two different books, 1 so I will just
summarize here.
Scripts tell us what will happen next in the aspects of the world
that repeat frequently. Anyone who goes to a restaurant knows that
when you order food, someone will bring it to you and later you will
be expected to pay for it. There are lots of variations on this standard
restaurant script, however. It doesn’t work quite like that at Burger
King. The script is different but there is a script there too and we learn
it if we frequent Burger King. The restaurant script has many variations
and we are initially confused when we encounter a new one, but
we learn through repeated practice. And, we generalize so that we can
understand that the McDonald’s script is pretty much the same as the
one at Burger King.
We can predict what will happen next in the world based on experiences
we have repeated. Following scripts is so normal that it is
not seen as a sign of intelligence to be able to do it. We don’t exclaim:
Wow, he predicted that the waitress would bring what we ordered and
she did. Amazing!
But the opposite is certainly seen as a sign of stupidity. Once one
has experienced something many times, one should know what will
102 Teaching Minds
happen next in that arena. Dogs usually know the scripts that pertain
to them, as well. They know which merchant will have the dog biscuit
for them, for example.
People seem astonishingly dumb when they can’t predict what
is obvious to everyone else. Not knowing what will happen next in
a script you don’t know, because you don’t have the relevant experience,
means nothing at all, of course. The question is: If you have
experienced something repeatedly, why haven’t you figured out that
what you have seen before will happen again?
Script following is, therefore, a sign of intelligence but a very limited
one. We can blindly follow a script, and this can make us seem
dumb indeed. Since scripts vary one from the other in many ways,
the ability to see the nuances makes all the difference. Expecting that
a fast-food restaurant will be the same as a three-star Michelin restaurant
because it is a restaurant after all is what makes people seem
stupid. Failing to make the right generalizations indicates a lack of
thought.
The real question is this: What do you do when your script fails?
This is important because scripts fail all the time. You expect something
to happen and it doesn’t. You love the cheesecake at Lindy’s and
suddenly it doesn’t serve cheesecake. Or you find that Lindy’s is now
out of business. What do you do? People recover from script failure on
a daily basis. How they do this tells us a lot about how the mind works.
When people refuse to abandon the generalizations they have
made, they immediately are perceived as being stupid. When a medical
assistant asked me the other day about the upcoming Thanksgiving
holiday, I responded that I would be eating duck instead of turkey.
She said that sounded awful and that duck was greasy and gamey and
it sounded like a terrible idea. I asked her if she had ever eaten duck
and she said no because it was game and she hated game. I told her it
wasn’t gamey. She refused to believe me. I was about to recommend
trying magret de canard but thought better of it and asked if she had
ever eaten in a French restaurant in her life. She said that she hadn’t.
People who have scripts often generalize them so that in their own
minds they experts on things that they have never experienced. This
is what stupid looks like.
On the other hand, we might wonder what smart looks like. Let’s
imagine the same woman with the same beliefs hearing me say that
duck was not gamey or greasy. Intelligent people respond, when they
New Curricula for a New Way of Teaching 103
are confused, or when a long-held belief is challenged, with a request
for evidence. She might have asked where she might try duck or what
duck tasted like since she had not understood it correctly. She might
have allowed for the possibility that she was wrong and asked to know
more. But she didn’t. People who aren’t intellectually curious rarely do.
This kind of dull thinking is not so much a matter of genetics as it
a matter of not having been educated properly. And, that is, of course,
the real issue here. If a child grows up in a world where questions are
expected and where long-held beliefs can be abandoned because of
new evidence, he will seek such interactions. But a child who grows up
in a world where adults set themselves up as knowing everything and
no one’s beliefs are ever questioned, you will get mindless behavior
like this.
Of course, it doesn’t matter if this woman doesn’t try duck. It
is likely, however, that this behavior pattern—learn rules and never
question them—pervades her life. This leads me to my main point.
Scripts are great things to have. They get you through the airport.
They get you through Burger King. They get you through most of the
mundane aspects of life. But scripts need to be modified. They fail all
the time. The airport starts a new check-in procedure. The restaurant
you always go to deletes your favorite item from the menu. The store
you always shop in is getting very crowded. At some point we encounter
script failure and we deal with it. The question is how.
We deal with script failure using two key procedures. It is our facility
with these procedures that differentiates intelligence from stupidity.
Thinking depends on them, and everyone must do them when
trying to think. But not everyone does them well.
The procedures are:
Generalization
Explanation
These are not new ideas in the context of this book. Explanation is
one kind of describing. Generalization is the method by which we do
prediction, make judgments, do diagnosis, and determine causation.
We generalize whenever we try to think.
This entire book is a generalization. It is an attempt to make
sense of a vast array of information. That is what generalization is all
about. The book is also an explanation of the generalizations I have
104 Teaching Minds
found to be true. At the core of thinking, you find generalization and
explanation. But it is important to remember that what starts the
process of generalization and explanation is failure. Without failure
we don’t try to generalize and explain because we have nothing to
generalize and explain. Thinking, therefore, looks like this:
Make a prediction
Prediction fails
Make a generalization
Explain your generalization
Make a new prediction
Let me explain how this works and why one cannot think well if one
cannot do this. To explain, I will tell a personal story relating to my
own thinking and learning with respect to two of the twelve cognitive
processes. I will explain afterwards why I have chosen to tell stories
and why I have used personal ones.
DESCRIBING
Let’s start with describing. There is, of course, an art to describing.
Anyone who writes and anyone who speaks publicly is learning all the
time about describing. Since I was a professor for 30 odd years, and
since I have written hundreds of papers and about 25 books, and since
I have given numerous keynote speeches around the world, I have
been thinking a great deal about describing for many years. I learn
something whenever I speak publicly because I can easily tell whether
I am being heard or not. Are the listeners on the edge of their seats or
are they half asleep (or literally asleep)? I learn when I write because I
read the reviews, and colleagues are always happy to tell me what was
wrong with what I wrote.
Once, I was given a lesson in public speaking by someone older
and wiser than me that I never forgot. I recently had been hired at
Stanford as a professor. I was pretty young (22) and full of myself. In
those days, the Computer Science Department ran a course for new
graduate students that served as an introduction to all the special research
possibilities in artificial intelligence for those who wanted to
enter that field. There were many faculty in AI at Stanford and each
New Curricula for a New Way of Teaching 105
got a week to talk about what his work was about. The goal was to try
to convince students to sign up for a special research seminar with
that faculty member the following quarter.
My champion at Stanford was a psychiatrist named Kenneth Colby.
He invited me to share his week and thus we would be a team for
which students could sign up the following quarter. I listened to his
talks to the students. He was very funny but rather light on content, in
my opinion. I wasn’t impressed. But, after I spoke, he said something
to me I never forgot. He said: If you try to say everything that you
know in an hour, either of two things is true. Either you can do it and
therefore you must not know very much, or else you can’t do it and
you will talk way too fast trying to fit it all in and you will be generally
incomprehensible.
I listened to what he had to say, but I wasn’t sure he was right. At
the first meeting of our jointly run seminar, we discovered that we
had won the student jackpot. While other faculty had gotten four or
five sign-ups, we had gotten 25. I was very proud of myself until the
students went around the table to say who they were and why they
had signed up. Not a single one of them had signed up because of anything
I had said. They had been mesmerized by Colby.
Then I reheard in my head what Colby had told me the previous
quarter. He had entertained them—not overwhelmed them. They
thought he would be interesting and fun and they wanted to work
with him. While I had looked down on his lighthearted presentation
style, it turned out he knew what he was doing.
So, what did I learn and how did my thinking change? Thinking,
as I said earlier, looks like this:
Make a prediction
Prediction fails
Make a generalization
Explain your generalization
Make a new prediction
What was my prediction? I had predicted that speaking quickly with
a great deal of brilliant content would woo the incoming students.
This was simply wrong. I needed to make a new generalization. Fortunately,
I did not have to do the work myself. Colby had helped me by
supplying a generalization that he believed to be true. (Good teachers
106 Teaching Minds
do exactly this: They supply generalizations when a student needs one
and cannot come up with one by himself after a prediction that he
made has failed.)
The generalization that Colby supplied was, more or less: Be entertaining
if you want to attract followers and be listened to.
Was he right? Is this a good generalization?
The next step in thinking is: Explain your generalization. What
this means here is that I needed to understand why this might be
true. If possible, one wants to test out the new hypothesis. Fortunately
for me, I had many opportunities to speak in public over the next 40
years. I tried many different methods of teaching and lecturing. Entertaining
always works. Colby was right.
But I said that one needs to explain why it works. This is my explanation:
People have trouble paying attention to someone who talks for
an hour. Human beings are not built for this. Our ancestors certainly
didn’t listen to lectures. People communicate best by asking questions
and interrupting. Since this isn’t possible in a lecture, any questions
they might ask, they ask themselves and try to answer. While they are
thinking about what a speaker says, the speaker keeps on talking. No
one can really hear a lecture, in my opinion. So, a good speaker, recognizing
this, does not try to make the audience do that. He makes them
laugh, he paints interesting pictures for them to ponder, he amazes
them perhaps, but he does not try to get them to, nor does he expect
them to, remember all that he has said. The less content, the more
likely they will remember. Colby knew all this. I learned it over time.
He jump-started my thinking.
By now, this new generalization of mine, together with my explanation,
is part of my core beliefs. But any belief can be challenged by
reality. And, any new belief generates new predictions. So I predicted
that if I was funnier when I spoke, people would appreciate what I
said more. I also predicted that if I didn’t speak much in a graduate
seminar and let students argue with one another, they would get more
out of it. After 40 years I still believe these things. But, and this is the
important part, there are nuances upon nuances about all these issues
in my memory. I need to explain it simply when I write or speak
about it, but when I think about it, I recall all kinds of exceptions and
caveats. I know, or at least I think I know, a great deal about speaking
and have lots of memories about specific successes and failures.
Thinking and learning require one to recall one’s experiences, analyze
those experiences, come up with new hypotheses about failures, make
New Curricula for a New Way of Teaching 107
new predictions, and be prepared for these predictions to fail. This is
what thinking looks like no matter which cognitive process is being
thought about and practiced.
DIAGNOSIS
Now let’s talk about diagnosis. Again I will start with a story. This is
one I have been telling for a long time because it informs us about
how the mind works.
I was discussing with my colleague (Bob Abelson) how it could
be that my wife could not seem to make steak rare (as I like it—she is
no longer my wife, but not because of this). Bob responded that he
couldn’t get his hair cut as short as he wanted in England 20 years
earlier.
This seems on the surface to be a rather odd response, but when
we look deeper we can see that I was saying something like, She could
do this right if she wanted to, and he was thinking, Maybe she thinks
the request is too extreme, as happened to me with a barber in England
many years ago.
Matching odd situations to other odd situations and seeing the
similarity is what creative thinking is all about. Bob was trying to diagnose
a problem that had been on his mind for a long time, and my
new story provided him with new evidence to think again about what
the proper diagnosis might be. This is what thinking looks like. It is
also what reminding looks like. People get reminded precisely because
they are trying to match a new situation to one they already know
about and thereby determine what to do next. To put this another
way, diagnosis depends on prior diagnosis. We constantly are trying
to improve our diagnostic capability because we always strive to make
better decisions no matter what arena these decisions are in. The fact
that the improvement of diagnostic capability is not explicitly part of
each and every curriculum in school is scandalous.
When we design new curricula, we need to ground them in some
realistic framework that will enable students to practice things that
they might end up doing in the real world. But that does not mean
that the real issue in designing these curricula is anything other than
teaching thinking, that is, enabling practice in the 12 cognitive processes.
However, teaching thinking in the absence of a context that
truly interests students is absurd.

CHAPTER 9
How to Teach the Twelve Cognitive
Processes That Underlie Learning
The art of teaching is the art of assisting discovery.
—Mark Van Doren
We need to completely redefine what we mean by school and what we
do in school. We need to think about education in a new way. Rather
than wanting people to be educated, which usually means being able
to quote Shakespeare or nod sagely when Freud’s name is mentioned,
we need to expect people to be able to think well. Education would be
better defined by defining an educated person as one who can make
well-reasoned arguments for what they are about to do.
We must focus on teaching cognitive processes and abandoning
the subject-based (and test-based) education system we have now that
is clearly failing. The reason we have all those tests is simply because
we have no idea how to make people learn all the stuff that is part of
that subject-based system without threatening them. No one really
wants to learn the Pythagorean theorem or information about the Taft
Hartley Act. Let scholars know about these things; the average person
just doesn’t need to know this stuff.
But all people do know how to find and use the mathematics they
need when they have continually practiced it, and they know how to
find prior relevant experiences when they have to come up with a new
plan they want to propose. That simply does not mean we have to tell
it all to them years before they might ever make use of it.
In the age of the Internet, just-in-time learning is a serious reality.
We can change things now in part because we have information readily
available online. But the Internet has been designed by committee.
It has much in it that is nonsense, and finding what you need just in
time can be quite difficult. Still, it would not be that complicated to design
a different kind of Internet, the moral equivalent of Encyclopedia
109
110 Teaching Minds
Britannica, if you will. It would be filled with knowledge from experts
that had been vetted by other experts and delivered seamlessly without
your having to search for it. You don’t need to be a scholar in order
to make reasoned decisions. You just need to know how to find information
to help you think things out well. This means that learning
to think clearly and knowing how to assess the value of new evidence
that one has found, must be the main goal of any school system.
When does school start to falter? One way to think about school
is to ask about the significance and age-related properties of each of
the cognitive processes. Let’s see if we can rank the processes in terms
of age. Which of these processes would we expect a child who was
entering school to already be able to do? To put this another way, a
normal 5-year-old:
1. can make some accurate predictions about very simple
things, like where his mother might be and what she might
be doing and what will be on television
2. would have trouble modeling any process
3. has a limited sense of evaluation but knows what he likes
4. would be able to experiment with simple things like food and
toys
5. might be able to do limited diagnosis of what might have
gone wrong in a process, but it typically would be limited to
explanations that he had heard from someone else
6. might be able to do limited planning based on plans that had
been used before
7. might know something about causation because he would
have been told about it and remembered what he had been
told
8. can make some judgments based on his own tastes and what
he has been taught about what is good and what is bad
9. can do some describing, but typically is not at all good at it
10. should be able to influence some people, especially his
grandparents
11. should be able to work in a simple team together with kids
his own age toward a goal
12. should be able to do some simple negotiation, especially with
his parents, siblings, and some friends
How to Teach the Twelve Cognitive Processes 111
So, upon reaching school age, a child can do some of the cognitive
processes. Now the question is, How to we teach him to get better at
them?
First let’s see what the cognitive processes fundamentally have in
common. This will give us a way of thinking about how to teach them.
The first and most important thing they have in common is that
they all rely on a case base. We have all engaged in each of these
processes many times and we have a range of experiences we can call
upon to guide us the next time we find ourselves doing them. Each
process relies on a story base as well. We can tell stories about interesting
experiences we have had in doing each one of them. Stories
usually revolve around failures, or at least unexpected results, since
without these there are no good stories to tell. Engaging in any cognitive
process includes the possibility of making a mistake during the
process. We expect to get smarter each time as a result of any mistakes
we make. This is what cognitive processes are like. We learn cognitive
processes through experience and we index the failures we have so
that we can find them again and perhaps avoid making the same mistake.
When we avoid an error that we know we have made previously,
we say that we have learned.
It follows, therefore, that acquiring a case base, learning the stories
of others and learning to tell our own stories, and learning classic
mistakes and being able to analyze behavior to find a mistake are all
aspects of learning the cognitive processes.
Acquiring the case base and consciously analyzing the cases in
that case base, then, is the fundamental issue in teaching the cognitive
processes.
HOW TO TEACH PREDICTION
We live in a physical world but we also live in a social world. Children
need to understand that if they drop something heavy on their foot,
it will hurt; they also need to know that if they do something mean
to someone, the person may dislike them for it and may seek revenge.
We use predictions to figure out what will happen as a result of our
actions and then we use that knowledge to guide us in our future
112 Teaching Minds
actions. What kinds of predictions do children regularly make, then?
And, what can we teach and how can they learn?
1. Children predict the actions of the people that they interact
with, but they do not necessarily realize that they do this.
2. Children predict the reactions of objects and actions in the
physical world, but they do not necessarily realize that they
do this either.
3. Children predict their own feelings and mental states. They
do things that they think will make them happy, but they
don’t necessarily realize that they do this either.
These three worlds, the social, the physical, and the mental, are at the
center of what adults make predictions about. We predict the speed
of an oncoming car and decide whether we can cross the street safely.
Children may not do this so well. We predict what will happen when
we scream and yell at someone, but children may not predict this too
well either. We predict events that will make us happy or sad, such as
taking a nice vacation, or playing a game, or a good meal, or establishing
a relationship with another person. Children do not consciously
think about such things.
But adults do think about these things, so where do children
learn about them? At the present time, the answer is that they learn
about them as events happen randomly in their lives. If they are lucky
enough to have someone helpful to talk with about their experiences,
they may, in fact, become good at analyzing how the world works
and making their predictions conscious. Getting better at prediction
is the cornerstone of living one’s life in a satisfying way. One can, of
course, get better at prediction by simply thinking about it—this is
how most people do that today, of course. But not everyone is capable
of doing that and, clearly, most adults are not all that good at making
important predictions in their own lives. (This is one reason that
there are bad marriages, financial counselors, clinical psychologists,
and prisons.)
What helps teach one to predict is to hear about the experience of
others and to be able to reflect on one’s own experience. This means
that having experiences to reflect upon, and people who are knowledgeable
to discuss those experiences with, is at the cornerstone of
learning to predict effectively.
How to Teach the Twelve Cognitive Processes 113
This should start as early as 1st grade (or age 5—I don’t really believe
in grades).
How do we do it? We design experiences for children that are age
appropriate and talk about what will happen in those experiences before
they do them and how they can learn from and improve upon
those experiences after they happen. Then they undergo a slightly
more complex experience that builds on what they learned. The process
is simple enough. The question is what experiences to design,
how to design them. 2
I should note that prediction is used as a teaching methodology in
schools today, especially in reading. I suggested this in a book I wrote
about teaching reading in 1978, and since that time (not necessarily
because of that book) it has become more common to use prediction
to teach reading. Also, high school kids are asked to make predictions
in courses that cover current events. Kids predict sporting events or
the sex of their in utero sibling.
The idea that kids can make predictions is not a really radical
point. My point is that prediction has to be the curriculum, not be
ancillary to the curriculum. If we want children to predict well, we
need to help them do that. As it stands now, they are on their own.
As adults who have not been taught to predict well, they will make
poor life decisions, predicting wrongly about how people in their lives
(bosses, spouses, children, co-workers, etc.) will behave toward them
after they take certain actions, for example. Yes, understanding is improved
if one predicts the future actions of characters in a book one is
reading—it helps a lot. And, reading is a skill that is very important.
But it also helps to understand how to predict daily actions better and
how to find out whether you were right and how to explain why you
were wrong. Doing this consistently makes you better at predicting
something more important than what an author has a character do
in a story.
How do we get good at making predictions about the outcome of
actions? What outcomes do we need to predict?
Every action we take involves a prediction. When we put one foot
in front of the other in an effort to move our bodies forward, we are
predicting that this will work, that we won’t fall down, and that it
won’t hurt to do this. Sometimes we do fall or it does hurt. We learn
this and compensate next time. This is learning in its most basic form.
And obviously, we have been learning about walking since we were
114 Teaching Minds
very small. We keep learning about walking throughout our lives because
things change.
Babies predict what will happen when they cry. They don’t start
out making such predictions. They learn to expect results that they
have already experienced. These are scripts, and I have discussed them
at length elsewhere. 3 Scripts are acquired naturally as a result of repeated
sequences of events. We predict what will happen next because
we know the script. Scripts are not normally taught because they are
readily acquired from living. But what if you want to teach them? You
might want to teach them in a situation where someone’s new job is
a script and rather than learn that job from repeated experience, there
is a desire to jump-start the process by simply teaching the script. How
can we do this?
There is also prediction that is not script-based. In other words,
there could well be a script but the predictor doesn’t know it. How can
one learn to predict well if one does not have a script?
And lastly, there is often the need to predict when there couldn’t
possibly be a script because what needs to be predicted is novel, at
least to the predictor. How can the prediction be made? More important,
how can someone be taught to predict in that kind of situation?
These, then, are the three aspects of prediction: learning a script;
functioning without a script because it isn’t known; and predicting
when there is no script.
How do we teach these things? Scripts are learned through repetition.
No one seeks to explain to a child that since she will be doing
something again and again, she will now memorize the steps before
she tries it out for the first time. Instead, we take the child through
the steps until she has learned them. There is no need to try to teach a
child scripts (such as how restaurants function or airplane rides go or
school procedure works). We can say some words about these things,
of course, but the learning comes from repeated practice no matter
what we do.
Teachers (and course designers) often fail to understand about
teaching scripts. Talking about what a student will have to do later will
not help that student do what he is being asked to do. We don’t learn
scripts consciously and thus aren’t likely to remember what we are
consciously told about what to do. We are conscious when we execute
a script—we are thinking about what will happen next—but not so
much in words as in expectations of next events. We don’t talk about
How to Teach the Twelve Cognitive Processes 115
one foot going in front of the other foot or think about it very much.
So if a teacher tries to teach us about it, it is doubtful that the words
will help us much. Scripts are practiced. We can prepare for them if
that makes people happy. We can tell a child what will happen when
he rides in an airplane for the first time, but it isn’t so that he can do
what he is supposed to do so much as to make him more comfortable
and less surprised by noises or procedures that might be upsetting.
The only way to really learn a script is to do it again and again.
So what does this tell us about teaching scripts? What if we don’t
have the time to allow a student to practice? This is, of course, what
happens in job-training situations. We tell someone what to do and
hope they very quickly will learn how to do it. We can’t afford weeks
of practice. So how do we teach scripts in that case?
The answer to this depends on the number of mistakes that it
is possible to make while executing a script. The real issue in script
execution is, after all, not knowing the next steps, but knowing what
to do (or what not to do) when the script begins to falter in some
way. This means that a teacher (or a course designer) must have one
question in mind when thinking about teaching a script: What are
the most common (and most important) mistakes that are made by
novices when they execute this script?
To teach people to avoid mistakes in a script, or to teach them to
get out of difficult situations properly, one must practice those situations.
This means that script teaching must focus around errors and
that it is the job of a teacher to systematically make sure that everything
that could go wrong, does go wrong in any practice situation.
Teaching scripts means helping the student form a case base of errors
and a case base of how to handle them. Here again, this cannot be
taught consciously. Script failures must be taught through practice.
The students must build up their own case bases by experiencing the
problem and then either think their way out of it, or learn standard
solutions as a way out of it by practicing them. So, we can speed up
the script-learning process by creating a simulation that has every important
mistake built into it waiting for the student to trip up and
make that mistake.
When a script isn’t known and predictions need to be made, the
usual human procedure is to adapt on old script to serve as a temporary
new one. Never been on a plane but have been on a train? Never
been in a fancy restaurant but have been to a fast-food restaurant?
116 Teaching Minds
Never been to college but have been to high school? These are situations
that happen to people. They usually assume that one is like the
other. While this assumption may not work out all that well, it is the
best a scriptless person can do in the situation.
A teacher, therefore, can take advantage of this human desire to
see unknown A as being like known B. People do this all the time.
They assume the girl they just met will behave like the last one they
went out with. They assume that their teacher will behave the way
their last teacher did. They assume that their new car works the way
the last one did. They do this with situations as well. What it means is
that people predict on the basis of experience and it is the job of the
teacher to help students understand which of their prior experiences
is most relevant when they are confused. Doing this is not so easy. But
it is possible and it is a proper area for a teacher or a course to focus on.
Here is the process. Students need to be asked what to do in a situation
that is new to them. Their natural response would be to rely on
prior experience. The teacher’s job is to make that reliance explicit. To
ask students to say which experience they will rely on for help in the
new situation and ask why they think that that particular choice will
be helpful. To ask them to analyze the differences between the current
issue and the prior script and to predict where the prior script might
not work. To ask them to think of alternative scripts that might help.
What I have described here is the basic process of indexing cases
and matching cases, which is critical to thinking—especially original
thinking. No case is really exactly the same as one that came before.
We are used to partial matches when we use an old case to help with
a new one. What we are not used to is a discussion of why one match
was correct and why another was less helpful. Making case matching
a conscious process helps us understand something that we normally
do without much conscious thought. People need to learn to rely on
partial matches and they need to know how to determine which partial
match is most likely. I have referred to this process as case-based
reasoning in many prior publications. 4 But I have not spoken about
how to teach case-based reasoning. This is where post hoc discussion
is very important. An example of such a discussion can be found in
a book written by Harvard government professors 5 on the failure of
President Ford to choose the right cases to reason from in a crisis. Usually
this kind of analysis is done as kind of an afterthought. However,
teaching people to do it actually is critical to teaching people to predict
properly.
How to Teach the Twelve Cognitive Processes 117
How do we teach prediction when there is no script and there are
no seemingly relevant prior cases? In some sense we can’t. We can teach
people how to go about trying to make predictions. This is actually what
science is about. Scientists create theories that make predictions, which
they then try to verify with evidence. This process—hypotheses verified
by evidence—can be taught in the sense that it is a way of thinking that
can be practiced in various venues. It is reasonable to start teaching children
to think in this way about the world around them. As for adults,
teaching scientific reasoning in the context of corporate training is
probably a less than optimal place to start. People in corporations need
to be able to reason from evidence and to understand what data would
confirm or deny the value of actions they have taken for the benefit of
the company. This, of course, is scientific reasoning. But, unfortunately,
the people who go into the business world tend to have never practiced
scientific reasoning in their educational careers because they weren’t
interested in science. But they must be interested in predicting well in
order to succeed in business.
HOW TO TEACH MODELING
Building a model of a process is very difficult for a child to do and not
so easy for an adult to do either. When you teach computer science,
you learn this quickly enough. Computer programs are models of processes.
People try to write computer programs by creating diagrams
that model what happens first and then what happens next, and so
on. These models are almost never right the first time.
Programmers learn to debug their programs, which means they
continue to try to get their model to be accurate. But most people
cannot do this very easily, and it is a very important skill. Knowing
how to raise money is important if one wants to start a business, for
example. The money-raising process can be understood, but one has
to examine it and go through it.
This is just as true of ordering in a restaurant. Children may seem
to know about ordering in a restaurant, but they may not understand
money or service or having a job exactly and thus may have an erroneous
model of the process. Why does the waitress bring food, is a
complex question for a 5-year-old, but also an important one. Building
models of how and why things work as they do, is significant for
children to learn to do.
118 Teaching Minds
The way to do this is to look at processes that children engage
in during the course of their daily lives and have them first explain
how and why the processes work and then try to improve upon them.
They could carefully examine the operations of the school cafeteria,
for example. Of course, this has to be done in line with the interests
that the children actually have. The idea is building the model, not
telling them what models they have to build. Every child has an interest—animals,
sports, family, cars, dinosaurs, whatever. Children need
to learn to model the processes that interest them in order to better
understand them and to make them better. Children will learn about
the modeling process from working on a car engine, for example, if
they are taught to think about what is going on in a deep way rather
than just learning a set of facts about how the car runs. This is true in
any area of interest, from medicine to government to science.
Adults have a difficult time with models at work, as citizens, at
home, and so on. They don’t always know how things really work. To
get people to be better at understanding the processes that they engage
in daily life, they need to be able to model them. This ability has
to be taught and practiced early..
Of course, kids have been building models of actual objects for a
long time. Using a kit to build a model airplane is fun but it doesn’t
teach you much about how planes fly. More detailed models of physical
objects are very helpful.
Building a medieval castle, for example, sounds like fun to me,
and there are things to be learned from doing this, of course. It is a
good activity for little kids, but modeling involves social processes as
well. Kids need to understand how the world works, so it isn’t the
castle itself that is so important but perhaps a model of the society
around the castle, and the need for the castle, that would matter in
this instance.
HOW TO TEACH EXPERIMENTATION
Everyone experiments all the time. We eat foods that we hope won’t
make us fat or might make us healthy. We take drugs that are supposed
to help us, and maybe they do maybe they don’t. We try out relationships
that may or may not work. We experiment with jobs, hobbies,
How to Teach the Twelve Cognitive Processes 119
homes, cars, toys, games, lifestyles, behaviors, hairdos. . . . The list is
seemingly infinite.
We may not see ourselves as experimenting when we try out something
new. We often experiment ineffectively. Learning to experiment
in a reasonable way is yet again something that can be done only
through experience. But, in this case, there really is an experimental
process to be learned. It can be taught early on by finding simple experiments
that small children really are interested in doing—they do
not all have to do the same ones since it doesn’t matter what they do.
They can learn to attempt to control the variables and see what happens
in a variety of circumstances. This is, again, the scientific method,
but the issue is really not teaching science so much as it is teaching
a scientific approach to gathering useful knowledge. What constitutes
evidence and how to draw conclusions are the kinds of things that a
teacher can help with. Here again, a case base is acquired and relied on
throughout this process. The discussion of findings so that they can be
mentally indexed is very important part of the process.
But how do we find out what is true? Ask any 5-year-old this
question and the answer is not very likely to be, We run an experiment.
Ask mommy, is more likely or, Ask the teacher, if the kid is in
school.
But, testing hypotheses is a critical part of learning to think. Of
course, one has to have a hypothesis first. Children are rarely asked
for their hypotheses about things. This is not exactly odd because although
children do have them, it is a weird kind of discussion to have
with a 5-year-old. Nevertheless, it is important to do. Teaching children
to form and test hypotheses is as simple as asking them to do it.
But, here again, asking them to do it must be done within the context
of something they really care about. There have been many attempts
over the course of educational history to teach kids science by having
them run experiments; sometimes they are asked simply to replicate
old experiments and sometimes they are asked to try new ideas out
and figure things out for themselves. While the latter is most certainly
preferable, these experiments tend to be about testing water quality,
or nutrients in the soil, subjects that are not exactly on the mind of a
5-year-old.
What is on the mind of a 5-year-old? He might be wondering
about how to deal with his baby sister. Or he might be wondering
120 Teaching Minds
how best to throw a rock in order to hit the cat. For many of these
things, hypotheses can be formed, discussions about what makes a
good hypothesis can be had, and ideas for testing out hypotheses can
be sought. Maybe these would just be thought experiments (as in the
case of hitting the cat), but thought experiments are important also.
Knowing what would confirm or deny a hypothesis is important.
Finding out what kids want to get better at is part of the issue here.
If they want to learn to hit a baseball, having a theory about what
makes a good swing and what makes a bad one may matter to them.
The subject matter doesn’t matter at all really, just the thinking and
the experimentation.
This suggests that the real way to teach experimentation and the
other subjects we have discussed here is to group kids not by age but
by interests. So, if a child wants to think about dogs all day, group him
with a set of other dog lovers and start coming up with hypotheses
about dogs’ behavior, needs, commands that they might learn, training,
breeding, and so on. It just doesn’t matter what the subject is at
this stage.
Suggestions for kids’ science experiments are everywhere. Here is
a typical one:
Gravity
The Earth tries to pull everything down toward its center. This
pull is called the force of gravity (the invisible force). When you
lift things up, you have to pull against gravity. If you drop a
pencil, gravity pulls it to Earth. If you rest its midpoint on your
finger, gravity will pull down equally on both sides of the pencil
and it will balance in the air.
Here is another:
Sound and Noise
Have one person fill each of the plastic eggs with a different item.
Put some rice in one, some dried beans in another, and so on.
Keep track of what you put in each egg by writing numbers on
the eggs. Have a different person try to see if he can figure out
How to Teach the Twelve Cognitive Processes 121
what is inside each egg by shaking and listening to the sound
generated. After he takes a first guess, show him the list of what
items are in each egg and have him guess again. See if he changes
his mind about some of the previous guesses. Now open the eggs
and see how close the guesses were to what was actually inside
each egg.
Now, let’s make a musical instrument called a kazoo. Cut a
small square of wax paper about 1 inch larger than the end of the
cardboard tube. After doing that, wrap the wax paper over one
of the ends of the tube and put a rubber band over the paper to
hold it in place. Now, put the open end of your kazoo up to your
mouth and hum a tune into it. Notice how the kazoo buzzes and
vibrates to amplify (make louder) the sound of your voice.
Of course, this is not exactly what I have in mind when I suggest focusing
school on experimentation. Say the word experiment and the word
science usually follows right away. This is unfortunate because most
kids won’t become scientists any time soon. Also, most kids already
know what they are being asked to “experiment” about. They know
the pencil falls and they know you can make noise by blowing through
things. They may not understand how all this works, but they won’t
understand much more after doing these so-called “experiments.”
Experiments in the larger sense are about attempts to find out
what is true about things you are uncertain about. The issue is how
to do that when you are wondering about something. To do this we
need to constantly deal with what kids are worrying about and ask
them to determine how they can find out what is true. This is experimentation
that can be helped by teachers. It needs to be individually
focused, however. You can’t have a class worry collectively about any
one thing. Each kid has his own concerns.
HOW TO TEACH EVALUATION
For an issue that is so important to so many people, it is astonishing
how difficult this seems to be. Just say no to drugs campaigns don’t
work and people wonder why. Abstinence campaigns don’t work
and people wonder why. It is not all that mysterious. You can’t teach
122 Teaching Minds
evaluation verbally. Since children naturally copy their parents, it is
not that complicated to figure out where children acquire their initial
values. And, since values are not typically stated (my father never said
liquor at 5 p.m. is a good thing), it certainly isn’t through lectures that
we learn values. I learned to drink at 5 p.m. from my father. He wasn’t
trying to teach me that. I learned to gamble from my father. He wasn’t
trying to teach me that either. I learned to be argumentative from my
father. He wasn’t trying to teach that. I did not learn algebra from my
father. That, he was trying to teach me.
My son wanted to grow up and sip Pepsi. He told me this constantly
as he was growing up. It did not matter that I hadn’t drunk Pepsi for
10 years at the point when he was saying that. He was impressed that I
had done this when he was 3 and he was frustrated that I didn’t allow
him to drink it. Presto, another family value is learned.
Children learn the family values that their family actually has.
Teenage mothers who warn against getting pregnant at a young age
may say that in words, but their actions say that their kid is alive and
well and it all worked out.
So, it follows that we don’t have to consciously teach values because
we teach them without saying a word. Values are held subconsciously
and learned subconsciously. We can only hope that we have
set a good example. That having been said, there will still be those
who ask how we can teach values. You can’t expect that “you can’t,”
will work as an answer.
I mentioned in Chapter 3 that there are lots of things that you
can’t teach. I mentioned honesty as an example. Honesty is, of course,
a value. Now let’s ask whether you can teach people to be more honest
than they are naturally inclined to be. The answer is that to do
this, you have to turn a subconscious process into a conscious one.
You would need to provide case after case and experience after experience
to a student that all led to the conclusion that honesty simply
works out better in the long run. This is, of course, what abstinence
and say no to drugs campaigns endeavor to do. They want to argue
kids into believing that things they think are fun, are bad. But how
can we make that argument? The argument we can make is that these
things aren’t as much fun as you think, so try them and see for yourself—but
that kind of ruins the basic premise about not doing them
in the first place. So, in principle there is no way to argue kids into
not doing what looks like fun to them and what doesn’t seem to have
How to Teach the Twelve Cognitive Processes 123
hurt anyone very much. The idea of showing pain is big in values
campaigns. Campaigns against drunk driving like to show students
dead drivers and awful car crashes. But they miss the real point. Have
the students seen their parents drink and drive or friends drink and
drive? Are they dead? If not, these campaigns will have little impact
since values are subconsciously held.
There is a way to teach these things but it isn’t easy. Imagine that
you wanted to teach teenagers not to drive drunk. You could create a
simulation of drunkenness that asked students to drive drunk while
not being able to hold their heads steady, blacking out from time to
time, and seeing very badly. In other words, instilling a new emotion
into the mix can alter values. Make people afraid of something they
want to do and that fear will manifest itself when it is time to do it.
Emotions can be induced into subconscious processes and decisionmaking
through experience. Emotions can change values.
There is a sense in which appreciation cannot be taught. You like
it or you don’t. I have two grandsons. The 5-year-old (my daughter’s
child) has announced that he doesn’t want to have anything to do
with a ball. The 3-year-old (my son’s child) goes wild with excitement
when he sees ballgames being played and responds excitedly when
balls are given to him. What is the difference and how did this happen?
The difference is obvious: One appreciates the art of it and one
doesn’t. How this happened is less clear, but the parenting is very different
with respect to balls in each house. There are other, biological
differences as well. The 3-year-old has much taller parents and is
already the same size as the 5-year-old. He is much more physical as
well.
So, the question is, Could we teach the 5-year-old to love balls and
ballgames, and could we teach the 3-year-old to hate balls and ballgames?
The answer to this is obvious. We could do this. It might be
hard but people are, unfortunately, quite good at negative reinforcement,
so it is possible to make people change their attitudes by using
it as a method.
Is there a way to teach the positive? Can we get someone to appreciate
a work of art who does not respond immediately to works of
art? Can we get someone to appreciate classical music who does not
have any interest in it?
This is, of course, what many art history or music appreciation
courses endeavor to do. Their methodology is always the same:
124 Teaching Minds
repeated exposure and analysis. It always involves a lot of talking. And
therein lies the problem. Since appreciation and enjoyment are subconscious
processes, it stands to reason that these processes are best
addressed by a methodology that is less conscious. Telling me why I
should like something is not likely to do much more than teach me
how to talk about something as if I liked it. I can point out the finer
points of baseball to you, but if you don’t care, I won’t be able to get
you to go to the next baseball game.
On the other hand, of course, you certainly won’t like baseball if
you have never seen it played. Exposure is the key to teaching subconscious
processes. Add to that an enjoyable atmosphere surrounding
the experience, especially if it is early on in one’s life, associated with
the artistry you want to teach, and it is likely that the learner will learn
to like whatever he is being exposed to. So, evaluation, which starts
out as a subconscious process, must be taught by enabling copying
and repeated practice, but cannot easily be taught verbally.
HOW TO TEACH DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis is the same and it is different. Many different people do diagnosis
under many different circumstances. But, the process is always
the same. So it seems normal to ask why an expert in doing diagnosis
in one area cannot do diagnosis nearly as well in another area of
knowledge. Why can’t a doctor fix his own car? Why can’t a detective
figure out why a business is failing? It is all diagnosis after all.
Diagnosis is best taught early on but it can be taught at any age.
In the end, it is just about knowing what counts as evidence and how
to create and rule out hypotheses. The general process of gathering
evidence and testing hypotheses is the same no matter what you are
doing. This is true in principle, of course, not in actual fact. In reality,
doctors cannot rule out hypotheses by tests that might harm the patient.
Businesspeople cannot rule out hypotheses by running control
businesses that may lose money while others make money. Detectives
cannot spoil a crime scene by altering the evidence. Mechanics cannot
try something that might make things worse. Investors cannot control
world events that might make a seemingly correct hypothesis still not
work out all that well.
To teach diagnosis, simple problems can be worked on that lead to
more complex problems. What is being taught, apart from the process
How to Teach the Twelve Cognitive Processes 125
itself, is the knowledge that underlies the hypothesis and understanding
what constitutes evidence and the consequences of evidence. This
knowledge is very domain specific and is the reason that doctors don’t
necessarily make good car mechanics, and vice versa. This knowledge
can be acquired only through practice and experience and can be acquired
only consciously. Diagnosis is thus a conscious process that is
very knowledge dependent. There is no seat-of-the-pants diagnosis,
namely, diagnosis that is seemingly subconscious, although it may
well seem that way. Having an intuition is usually just the result of
having a great deal of experience, so much so that hypotheses just
jump out at you because similar cases are so easily recognizable to an
expert. Someone who is good at diagnosis would be good at diagnosis
in any domain of knowledge if they knew how to gather and interpret
evidence in that domain.
Diagnosis is clearly very difficult to learn. Most people are rather
bad at it outside of their own areas of interest. Even inside their knowledge
base they can be sloppy in the reasoning and leap to wrong conclusions.
This is true of all analytic skills. It is possible to never learn
to do them well.
HOW TO TEACH PLANNING
Planning is extremely important and typical of an analytic cognitive
process; it is something that some people simply never learn to do
well. Teaching planning must be focused around the assembly of a
case base. Planning is taught in many domains of knowledge and is
almost always taught wrong. The classic error is to teach the theory of
planning, means–ends analysis, a theory of urban planning, spatial
planning, military planning, and logic-based artificial intelligence
planning. Such courses all make the same mistake. Course designers
think people use theories when, in fact, when people plan, they simply
try to adapt old plans that have worked before to new situations.
Often people don’t plan at all. They simply assume that a set of actions
they intend to perform will work to achieve an expected goal.
Teaching planning is therefore a tedious process that is best begun
in childhood. It involves making plans, seeing how they play out,
and performing an analysis of what went wrong. Often people are
not even aware that they have made a plan, and are simply frustrated
when things go wrong. They almost never perform an after-action
126 Teaching Minds
review (as the military calls the analysis process that takes place after
a plan has been implemented).
Teaching planning means teaching about goals, how they typically
are achieved, what obstacles might be encountered, and how to
deal with them. The principles of planning are the same no matter
what domain you are in, so children can learn to plan birthday parties,
hikes, class trips, how to deal with their problems, how to treat
their little sister, how to get along with their parents, and so on. This
process can be learned by copying, seeing how others deal with these
things, adapting a plan that has worked before, and so on. A teacher
who tries to teach planning from first principles is teaching something
that is easily forgotten as well as teaching a process that doesn’t occur
that much in real life. Chefs adapt old recipes or parts of old recipes.
Generals adapt old battle plans or parts of old battle plans. Computer
programmers use code that has worked before. Planning without a prior
plan in mind really is quite unusual and generally not a good idea.
Planning, like diagnosis, should be a basic part of all curricula in
school at all ages. People make plans all the time. They plan their
lunch, they plan their day, they plan their trips, they plan their errands,
and, of course, they plan their lives. It is astonishing that we
don’t teach planning all the time in every aspect of life. But we don’t
because this doesn’t seem very academic. Since it is not explicitly
taught to children, it is reasonable to ask how we might best teach
planning to adults. Corporations want to teach financial planning,
resource planning, supply chain planning, creating business plans,
creating marketing plans, and so on. Planning is, in fact, one of the
major preoccupations of business, as well it should be. So, how do we
teach it?
The problem here is that planning really works in only one way.
It is relies on a case base. We plan by adapting old plans. That’s how
we do it. We store old plans and we retrieve them when we need them
again; we change them so they apply to the new situation or change
them so that this time they will work out when they failed before. But
we always start with an old plan. New planners, those we are trying to
teach how to plan, cannot help but do this, even if they do not have
a relevant old plan to work from. They simply will choose the best
plan they have, even though it might not be all that germane to the
current situation. Proverbs—for example, to a man with a hammer,
everything is a nail—don’t come from nowhere.
How to Teach the Twelve Cognitive Processes 127
Thus, when we teach planning, there is either a lot to undo, or we
must start from the beginning. We can try to explain why each and
every old plan is not really helpful in a new situation, or we can teach
a series of plans that are relevant. In other words, if you are trying to
teach people to write a business plan, you need to start with a lemonade
stand and work up. If you are trying to teach financial planning,
you need to start with a child’s allowance and work up. If you want to
teach battle planning, try a tug of war first. This is what should have
occurred in childhood. If it didn’t, it needs to be restarted that way for
adults. We need to use, again and again, plans in different situations
that are simple and begin to analyze why they fail. (And these plans
must fail, at least in simulation, or no real learning will occur.)
Planning is very difficult. It must start simple and be practiced
simply for a while or it never becomes second nature. Plans must fail,
at least in simulation, because analysis of what went wrong is a critical
part of planning. If you aren’t analyzing what went wrong, you aren’t
learning to plan. Your case base will not end up having been indexed
well enough to enable you to pick and choose appropriate plans in
the future.
HOW TO TEACH CAUSATION
At the root of diagnosis and planning is causation. Detecting cause
is an essential part of diagnosis, and anticipating cause is an important
aspect of planning. Causation must be understood in order to do
many things in this world. One needs to know what causes what. Science
courses in school attempt to teach causation by having students
memorize F = ma, or having them imitate chemistry experiments, or
having them dissect a frog. While there is nothing wrong with any
of that in principle, it really doesn’t teach causation in a way that is
particularly useful to a functioning adult.
While diagnosis and planning may not be recognized as critical
skills by schools, causation is, although not under that word. Causation
is understood as being what science is all about, and when
schools endeavor to teach science, they are in fact trying to teach
causation. This is true for social science as well. History is about causation,
as is psychology. The fact that these subjects are not talked
about in this way indicates something important about them.
128 Teaching Minds
Subject- based education makes the academic disciplines the center
of what needs to be learned, when there is really something else at
the base of learning. All human learning and all scientific inquiry is
about causation; attempts to determine what causes what, and why,
are what it means to be a scientist or an academic. Theories of causation,
and tests to see whether those theories are true, are what it
means to be a scientist.
The problem is that telling students that causation is part of science
makes them think about physics formulas and fact memorization
when the real issue in teaching causation is how to determine what
causes what, rather than how to memorize what causes what. There
are, of course, facts about causation that are worth knowing. It is nice
to know that if you let go of something, it may fall, but it is not necessary
to know that gravity is the issue in this. The world went on quite
well for millions of years before Newton. People certainly understood
before Newton that things would fall when you let go of them and
nothing else was supporting them. Scientific explanations of causation
are nice for scientists but not necessary for everyday humans.
What everyday people need to know is how to determine what causes
what in areas of their own interest. They can hear you tell them about
causation—the stock market always goes down when a Democrat is
elected president—but they need to be able to decide whether what
you said is true and whether it is the election that causes the decline
or something else.
Understanding about causation is much more a function of being
able to figure out what caused what in any given instance than it is the
memorization of facts about science. Of course, with known cases, as
we have seen, being able to extrapolate from one case to another is a
good way of determining what is likely to happen. There is no harm in
knowing prior cases and great value in being able to use them. But, as
always, cases are better learned from one’s own experience than from
being told about them.
Teaching causation, therefore, means teaching the process of determining
what happened in any given situation. Since there is a
great deal to learn about any domain of inquiry in order to determine
causation, the main issue is how to know what the facts are
and how to reason from them. This means that, yet again, it is the
domain of knowledge that needs to be learned, and this entails constant
practice in that domain. And, the methodology of determining
How to Teach the Twelve Cognitive Processes 129
causation needs to be learned. This, too, can depend on the particular
domain of inquiry. Reasoning from all this takes practice as well.
Determining cause is a critical cognitive process that underlies nearly
all thinking.
HOW TO TEACH JUDGMENT
How do we get good at making a judgment? Judgments are a kind of
prediction, of course. When a judge sentences a criminal, he is, in a
sense, making a prediction about what will happen in the rest of this
person’s life. But he also is making decision that is no way a prediction,
but simply serves as punishment. Similarly, when we decide that
a certain restaurant is our favorite, we are predicting something about
how much we will enjoy future experiences, but we also are making
a decision that may or may not matter to others, that is, a recommendation.
Recommendations are also predictions, but they have a
different feel. When a boss decides whom to promote, he is predicting
something about future behavior but, again, the prediction isn’t the
key point. A judgment is a decision that has some import.
Nevertheless, as different as judgments and predictions may or
may not be, the process of teaching them is identical. Good judgment
is learned by making judgments and analyzing the results or
truth of those judgments as more information becomes available. After
a judgment is made it too becomes one of one’s cases and stories.
Cases about judgment can be learned only by making simple judgments
and getting smarter about the process over time on the basis
of experience.
Judgments can be made in two ways that matter here. Either someone
can decide to do one thing versus another thing based on ethical,
moral, avaricious, or emotional grounds, or for many other reasons.
Judgments aren’t so different from decisions in this aspect. Teaching
someone to make a judgment of this sort, between A and B, can be
done by putting students in situations in which such judgments need
to be made and then going over with them how they decided and
what they may have left out of their thinking.
A different kind of judgment is made when one judges the behavior
of others. Judges do this, of course, as do compliance officers in
companies, and teachers with respect to student mistakes.
130 Teaching Minds
Children normally make judgments about the behavior of their
parents and friends as well. In all these cases, judgment is best taught
by having a student watch the behavior of others, keeping himself out
of the issue and seeing what factors motivated and determined the
behavior of the actors. It is a lot easier to teach proper behavior when
it is not one’s own behavior that is being judged. One can learn to act
by judging how others act.
So, children make judgments all the time. Typically those judgments
reflect the values that they have been taught at home. Children
decide what is good and what is bad mostly based on what they have
been told. No child discovers for himself that George Washington was
an admirable man. No child decides on his own that the United States
is the best country in the world. These things are taught by parents
and by schools. School, to the extent that it serves as a place of indoctrination,
has always succeeded at producing citizens who believe
what they are taught to believe at a young age. There obviously is a
great deal of sentiment for keeping indoctrination as a key part of
education, but teaching judgment means allowing children to come
to conclusions based on their own experience and not merely what
they were told.
Learning to make judgments is a process of deciding for oneself
what is true, which is, of course, not so easy. This should be the role of
school but it usually isn’t. School wants to teach us the truth when, in
fact, truth is best discovered, again, from experience.
How would one discover the “best country in the world,” if that
is a meaningful idea, or whether George Washington was all he was
cracked up to be? Obviously, travel helps teach one about countries.
Kids can learn about countries by simulated travel in the modern era.
But the point wouldn’t be so much to teach them that they make good
cheese in France, which is the kind of thing school does today, but to
think about what makes France different from the United States. Similarly,
we can read and learn some facts about George Washington, and
these are indeed taught to children in primary school. I do not believe
that children are equipped at a young age to determine for themselves
whether Washington was a good man. Perhaps that would be a worthwhile
assignment in high school, as long as students were interested
in the question and were allowed to come to any conclusion that they
could reasonably defend. But children of 5 or 6 can understand what
How to Teach the Twelve Cognitive Processes 131
a hero is and what leadership is, and they can determine for themselves
who they know or have seen who is good at both. Again, real
experiences and discussions are how one learns to think about this,
but it must be done in an environment of possible truths, not predetermined
truths. One doesn’t create a nation of people who can think
by telling them what they should think. Kids know who is the leader
among them. They should learn to discuss what it is about their leader
that makes them want to follow. This is difficult discussion to have
with a 6-year-old, but it gets easier with age.
Once again, asking kids to make judgments isn’t that unusual.
Here is a remark from a parenting book that I happened upon:
When adults praise their kids for smart judgments, the kids glow.
But here’s the clincher: kids earn more and more freedom and
independence when parents trust their judgments more and
more. 6
The issue here is, yet again, not whether kids make judgments, but
whether they are taught, as a central part of what they study, how to
make judgments.
The cognitive processes depend on reasoning from evidence in a
way that makes sense. This is not something people are naturally good
at. They often exhibit faulty reasoning. Practicing reasoning means
practicing within particular domains of knowledge. Reasoning is the
same process no matter what you are reasoning about, but we don’t
reason about nothing. Learning the actual facts is important, but it
is the idea that this is important that has sent the school systems on
the wrong path. Academics study the facts, as well they should, but
they also teach the facts, which is a grievous error. How to determine
the facts and how to determine their effects on a situation is what the
processes of diagnosis, planning, and causation are all about.
HOW TO TEACH INFLUENCE
This is yet another childhood skill. Children learn how to influence
their parents and their siblings and their friends very early on. Of
course, they may not learn these things in a good way. They might
learn that temper tantrums or bullying works very well.
132 Teaching Minds
Teaching people how to influence people involves putting them
in situations where it is possible to influence people and seeing how it
goes. There is nothing to learn exactly. We try behaviors and see what
works. What works for one person may not work for another. One way
or another, we learn how to get what we want, or we learn to hang
out with people who will respond to our needs. This is basically a subconscious
process. We are so busy working on this at a very young age
that we may not have any idea what it is we know or how to improve
what we do. Of course, there is a conscious part as well. Someone can
tell us that we will catch more flies with honey than with vinegar,
and we can, if we think about it, adjust our behavior. But aphorisms
about what works and what doesn’t work aren’t always correct and
are highly idiosyncratic. Although there are books about how to win
friends and influence people, the reality is that, apart from adopting a
phony personality, people are who they are, more or less.
But this does not mean they can’t be taught what works. It usually
does mean that they can be taught what works as a result of their own
experience. And, they can be taught what doesn’t work as a result of
their own experience. But this isn’t at all easy. If it were, psychiatrists
would not be able to make a living. You can tell a person to change
his behavior, you can even tell him exactly what to do when, but he is
likely not going to be able to do what you say.
The way influence is taught currently is probably the way it has to
be taught, then, by use of mentors who look at your behavior and talk
you through why you do what you do. This same mentoring method
can be used in corporate settings. Simulations may not be so effective
because while we may know and be able to say the right answer, this
doesn’t mean that we can execute the desired behavior in reality.
HOW TO TEACH TEAMWORK
Teamwork is learned by working in teams. It is a mixed process because,
here again, we behave in ways that are not so conscious but
we can make conscious changes. Leaders learn to manage teams by
thinking about what works and what doesn’t. Quarterbacks must
learn to manage their teammates. If they don’t, it really doesn’t matter
how well they can throw the ball. Team members have to want
to work hard for the leader, and the leader has to know how to motivate
each team member. People are different so what works for one
How to Teach the Twelve Cognitive Processes 133
may not work for another. A leader learns to figure out who is who
and what works for each member of the team. The conscious part of
this is about learning who needs what from the leader in order for
the leader to get the most out of each individual so that the team’s
goals are achieved. The subconscious part is about interacting with
others, which is rarely conscious behavior. We get smarter through
experience. If our team wins because we functioned well as a team,
we learn to repeat the behaviors that worked. If we win because our
team was simply much bigger than the other team, then we probably
won’t learn much about teamwork.
Teamwork can be taught only by examining how a team functions
and attempting to make conscious the subconscious behavior that is
not working. Thinking about what we have done that may not have
been helpful to the team, and making sure that team members’ goals
are aligned, is pretty much the only way we can learn to improve our
behavior.
HOW TO TEACH NEGOTIATION
My daughter was a little over 2 when we moved back to the United
States from Switzerland. The enormity of U.S. toy stores overwhelmed
her and it seemed that she wound up crying every time we entered
one. She wanted everything. So I had what I thought was a clever idea.
I told her that she could have two toys of her choice but that if she
cried she couldn’t get any at all. We talked about it and it was clear that
she had understood what I said. She ran around the toy store and ended
up selecting three toys. I told her one would have to go back—that
our agreement was two. She started crying hysterically. I then said she
had to put them all back as she had violated our no crying agreement.
All of sudden, she sucked up all her tears and said in a breathless voice:
I’m not crying now. I said that we would compromise on one toy.
That was possibly her first lesson in negotiating. I say possibly
because kids and parents negotiate all the time. She and I are still negotiating.
Now it is about when she will come to visit or when she will
send her son down to visit or a range of other family issues.
Negotiation is so important that it is nearly absurd to ask how we
teach negotiation. We can learn it by copying, of course, which I did
when I watched my father get a good price on a used car I was buying
that I was ready to pay much more for. But really we negotiate with
134 Teaching Minds
our wives and children and friends and co-workers all the time.
It is possible to teach negotiation, of course. My team once built
a course on negotiation, working with a Harvard Law professor 7 who
taught negotiation. The course worked by having people negotiate.
The situations were artificial so there is some question as to how valuable
lessons can be learned from negotiating when nothing important
(except ego) depends on it. What I found most interesting about that
course were the stories that the expert told from his life as a professional
negotiator. I can’t say that I was ever able to personally make
use of the lessons that those stories taught, but other people’s experiences
are interesting to think about. In the end, what we really know
about negotiation is what has worked well for us in the course of our
lives when we were negotiating. Coaching can help, of course, which
implies that the best way to teach negotiation would be with a mentor
watching you do it for real and offering tips. Psychologists perform
this service in couples counseling, and presumably real estate agents
perform this service for homebuyers and sellers. Just-in-time advice is
always helpful.
HOW TO TEACH DESCRIBING
There is a famous quote: “I apologize that this letter is so long—I
lacked the time to make it short.”8 As long as people have been talking,
they have had to learn to talk well. When they learned to write,
they had to learn to write well. Communication is a very big part of
living in a society and those who communicate well gain all kinds of
advantages. It is difficult to attain public office without speaking well,
or to become an important academic without writing well, or to make
sales or convince anyone of anything without making your case well.
This takes practice and coaching, and there is no substitute for either.
One also has to have something to say, so this means one has to
have had experiences to talk and write about. Further, it helps if one
is writing about something that one is passionate about. Asking kids
to write about their summer vacations doesn’t necessarily make them
into good writers. Asking kids to give speeches about George Washington
fails for reasons of lack of passion. People need to learn to describe
well what is most important to them. And, they must be doing this
How to Teach the Twelve Cognitive Processes 135
in every task they undertake. They must talk about and write about
what they do until the description process becomes second nature to
them. So, describing cannot be taught in and of itself. It must be part
and parcel of other events students undertake. Writing classes make
no sense, therefore. They exist because of the subject-based divisions
in school. Writing and speaking must be part of everything that is going
on.
SUMMARY
Proficiency at all the cognitive processes depends on discovery and
being able to extrapolate from one’s experience about what has been
discovered. These processes depend strongly on prior cases, and prior
cases are best learned slowly in childhood. They also depend on an
analysis of those cases, which is best done with help from a teacher.
Discussion, reflection, and analysis of prior cases make one better able
to deal with new cases. New cases must be compared with old ones
in a way that helps one reason better from them. This comparison is
the basis of teaching analytic cognitive processes. Learning cognitive
processes means having prior experiences with events that are similar
to current events and being able to extrapolate from them. When we
go to a doctor, we want one who has seen our problem, and described
it to others, many times before. Only then can we detect the nuances
of difference that will determine an effective course of action.
Teaching cognitive processes means providing students with experiences,
hopefully each one more complex than the one before,
and helping students discuss those experiences and compare one with
another. Knowledge is experience, but it is experience that has been
analyzed so that it can be retrieved again just in time as needed. This
will happen only if we have thought about what we have experienced.
A teacher’s job, therefore, is to help provide the experiences and
to help the student reflect upon the significance of those experiences.
Good parents do this naturally. Good teachers would do it naturally as
well, if they were allowed to do so. Helping someone see the world in
a new way is pretty much what good teaching is all about.

CHAPTER 10
Defining Intelligence
All our knowledge begins with the senses, proceeds then to
the understanding, and ends with reason. There is nothing
higher than reason.
—Immanuel Kant
What is school for? A common answer is, to make people more knowledgeable.
Another is, to socialize them and prepare them for living
with others. Another is, to make them ready for work. (This last one
seems almost laughable because it is clearly untrue in the modern
world, but people do seem to still believe it.) Another is, to prepare
them for more school. (People take this one very seriously.) My answer
is: School should make people more intelligent.
Really? Can we make people more intelligent? There are those
who would argue, and I am quite sure they are right, that intelligence
is genetic: It can’t be altered by school, one way or the other.
Nevertheless, I think that school should make students more
intelligent.
How can I believe both things?
It all depends on how you define intelligence. Let’s think about intelligence
the way ordinary people define it when they say that someone
seems dumb or that someone seems to be very smart. There is a
lot to be learned by considering seriously the folk view of intelligence
as opposed to the classical school/testing view.
In the 2007 Miss Teen USA contest, Miss South Carolina responded
to this question:
“Recent polls have shown that a fifth of Americans can’t locate
the United States on a world map. Why do you think this is?”
137
138 Teaching Minds
In this way:
“I personally believe, that U.S. Americans, are unable to do so,
because uh, some, people out there, in our nation don’t have
maps, and uh . . . I believe that our education like such as in
South Africa, and the Iraq, everywhere like such as . . . and, I
believe they should uh, our education over here, in the U.S.
should help the U.S. or should help South Africa, and should
help the Iraq and Asian countries so we will be able to build up
our future, for us.”
Millions of Americans upon hearing this interview, which was replayed
on every television outlet, thought this response was both very
funny and an indication of how stupid Miss South Carolina was. Most
adults feel that they know what intelligence looks like and that they
know what stupidity looks like. Everyone agreed about the absurdity
of this response. It was, after all, incoherent, and this was obvious to
anybody.
Miss South Carolina was given another chance to answer the
question on the Today Show on NBC, some days later. Here is a
description of what happened from the MSNBC website:
She explained Tuesday that she was so overwhelmed by the
moment she barely heard any of the question.
“Everything did come at me at once,” she said. “And I made
a mistake—everybody makes a mistake—I’m human. Right when
the question was asked of me, I was in shock . . . I would love to
re-answer that question.”
Curry [of the Today show] obliged, reading the entire
question as it had been asked during the pageant. This time,
Upton [Miss South Carolina] was ready.
“Personally, my friends and I, we know exactly where the
United States is on a map,” she said. “I don’t know anyone else
who doesn’t. If the statistics are correct, I believe there should
be more emphasis on geography in our education so people will
learn how to read maps better.”
She came back later in the show to deliver a flawless
explanation of lunar eclipses.
Held up on the Internet as the quintessential dumb blonde,
Upton was an honor student in high school.
Defining Intelligence 139
The premise here is that she isn’t actually stupid but was just confused
by the moment and that she is intelligent because she is on the
honor roll at school, can explain lunar eclipses, and could answer the
original question coherently, given sufficient time to do it (and maybe
with some help).
The media, for reasons of their own, decided to make this a feelgood
story and get people to feel better about Miss South Carolina.
She has continued to work in the media in various ways since the
original interview.
I am not concerned here with Miss South Carolina’s intelligence,
but with what it means to be seen as being intelligent. My premise is
that while native intelligence is certainly genetic, the perception of
intelligence and what might be described as intelligent behavior can
be altered. (Perhaps this seems as incoherent a position as Miss South
Carolina’s position on education.)
The curious thing about her second response is that it doesn’t
answer the original question at all. The question was about why she
thought Americans were ignorant about geography, and she responded
by saying that they weren’t but that maybe there should be more
education about reading maps, which in no way addresses the question
about why Americans can’t locate the United States on a map.
So her answer is still awful even after she was given time to work
on it. It is simply unintelligent.
The question is: Could we make Miss South Carolina more intelligent
somehow? Clearly school hasn’t done it. (She was an honor
student!) How might one do it?
Of course, we really aren’t concerned with Miss South Carolina
in particular. Consider the following interviews conducted at a Sarah
Palin book signing in November 2009, in Columbus, Ohio. The
interviewees were all in line waiting to meet Sarah Palin and to buy
her book:
Interviewer: Tell us why you are here today.
Older woman: She stands for what America is.
Interviewer: What do you mean by that?
Older woman: Freedom, liberty, right to speak . . .
Interviewer: What are the particular issues you would like to see
her bring to office?
Older woman: Oh, geez, help me out here, guys.
Second woman: Fairness. Realness.
140 Teaching Minds
So we have a Palin supporter who has no idea why she supports Palin
and asks for help. The “helper” says fairness and realness, which apart
from being ungrammatical is also nonsense. Neither supporter seems
to know much about Palin, but they are eager to meet her and they believe
in her. (This is not a comment about Sarah Palin, at least not by
me. Supporters of most political candidates have difficulty explaining
why they like whomever they like. Or, alternatively, they can explain
it and those explanations leave you wondering.)
I will never forget attending a JFK campaign visit to Brooklyn
when I was 14. The woman next to me exclaimed that she would vote
for JFK because he was so gorgeous. I was appalled. I knew the woman.
She was not a deep thinker, but, really–people vote for someone because
of their looks? Yes, people do, political scientists have pointed
this out consistently.
Is this intelligent behavior? Of course not.
The question is: Can we do something about it? Is this an aspect
of intelligence that is not genetic and that therefore can be changed?
If you know and believe that what you have just said makes no
sense, you can try to learn how to make sense. Do these people know
that are they are not making sense? Here is another person from that
same Columbus event:
Young man in Ohio State jacket: She’s the epitome of
conservativeness and I’m telling you if the Republican Party
doesn’t back her, it doesn’t matter because she’s going to get
the presidency.
Interviewer: What would you like to see her do with foreign
policy?
Young man in Ohio State jacket: To be honest with you I don’t
know anything about her foreign policy.
Interviewer: What are some of the problems you have with cap
and trade proposed by Democrats in office?
Young man in Ohio State jacket: You want to give away your own
money, it’s fine, but don’t tell me to give away my money. It’s
socialism.
Young man in Ohio State jacket: The state that she did govern
was right across the street from Russia. You know so I’m not
saying that she ever had to deal with Russia but I’m sure she
Defining Intelligence 141
had boundary issues she had to deal with. We have boundary
issues right now with Mexico now.
This Palin supporter is also incoherent but incoherent in a different
way. He doesn’t know much, and he knows he doesn’t know
much. But he has beliefs and he believes in his beliefs. He has beliefs
about socialism (that it is bad, and that President Obama thinks it
is good) that are based on no real knowledge. He has beliefs about
foreign policy and what it means to have foreign policy experience
that are based on nonsense. And he has made up some beliefs about
“boundaries.”
What does this tell us? It tells us that at some point, maybe not
now because he is too set in his own beliefs, someone could have
taught him about socialism or “boundaries” or what it means to have
foreign policy experience. But it should be clear that this is exactly
the kind of education that we have been trying to do in our schools
forever. You can talk about socialism in school, but that doesn’t mean
that your average person learns much from what is said there.
There is a wonderful movie called Ferris Bueller’s Day Off that
reveals a great deal about education. I often use a clip from that movie,
when I give speeches on education or training, wherein the teacher
drones on about the Smoot Hawley tariff and George Bush’s view of
Reagan’s voodoo economics (as stated in the 1980 primaries) while
the students doze off. At a different point in the same movie, the lead
character blows off a European history test, saying:
It’s on European socialism. I mean, really! What’s the point? I’m
not European . . . I don’t plan on being European. So who gives a
crap if they’re socialists? They could be fascist anarchists. . . . It
still wouldn’t change the fact that I don’t own a car!
They do teach about socialism in school, but no one is listening. If we
can’t produce reasonably intelligent voters in our schools, then we
aren’t doing much.
Here is another Columbus Palin fan:
Interviewer: What do you think she would bring in terms of
policy in office?
142 Teaching Minds
Young woman: Good judgment.
Interviewer: Any specifics?
Young woman: I think she would control the out-of-control
spending.
Young woman: I think she would acknowledge the system of
government in the United States rather than focus on the
administration of czars.
Interviewer: Yeah, and what is your problem with czars?
Young woman: I’m an American and we don’t have czars in
America.
Here again, we have a juxtaposition of beliefs based on no actual evidence
or reality. I don’t know what this woman has heard about czars,
but whatever it is, it misses the point. Could we teach this woman to
be on point—to say meaningful things based on actual evidence? Not
now, I fear, but it is my contention that we could have done so at some
point in her life. School has failed her and she seems, to anyone listening,
to be stupid. But she is not really stupid; she is just talking stupidly
because she hasn’t been challenged to behave in any other way.
Here is another:
Middle-aged woman: Governor of Alaska is the only one that has
top security.
Interviewer: What does that mean?
Middle-aged woman: It means that if anything happens to our
borders on that side, she’s the first one in line for attack for
there.
This person not only makes no sense, but she can’t speak in an understandable
way. Is that genetic? I doubt it. Intelligence, as it is popularly
defined, includes the ability to produce coherent speech, which certainly
can be enhanced through teaching, but apparently not by our
schools as they currently exist.
Here is one last interview from that event:
Interviewer: What do you think of foreign policy—what would
you like to see her do with foreign policy?
Man with cap: I don’t know, I really don’t have an answer—I
don’t know her well enough. I don’t know what she knows or
doesn’t know. I don’t know some stuff of what people ask me.
Defining Intelligence 143
Interviewer: Some of the viewers think there’s not enough oil.
Man with cap: We got us self-sufficient energy gas oil right
under our feet. Why aren’t we exploring more for it and
drilling here instead of sending all that money overseas and
exporting, I mean importing, all that oil back to America?
Interviewer: Do you hope she runs for president in 2012?
Man with cap: Yes, I do.
Interviewer: You will support her?
Man with cap: I sure would.
Interviewer: Do you think there will be any problems supporting
her, knowing that you’re unfamiliar with her foreign policy
issues?
Man with cap: That wouldn’t keep me from not voting for her.
There is a difference between ignorance and stupidity, just as there is a
difference between knowledge and intelligence. It is a good guess that
the “man with cap” above is both stupid and ignorant. The question
is why?
One reason is that it is now acceptable in our society to be ignorant
and stupid. Here is some of the famous ABC/Charles Gibson interview
with Sarah Palin during the 2008 presidential campaign:
Gibson: Do you agree with the Bush doctrine?
Palin: In what respect, Charlie?
Gibson: The Bush—well, what do you—what do you interpret it
to be?
Palin: His worldview.
Gibson: No, the Bush doctrine, enunciated September 2002,
before the Iraq war.
Palin: I believe that what President Bush has attempted to do
is rid this world of Islamic extremism, terrorists who are
hellbent on destroying our nation. There have been blunders
along the way, though. There have been mistakes made.
And with new leadership, and that’s the beauty of American
elections, of course, and democracy, is with new leadership
comes opportunity to do things better.
Gibson: The Bush doctrine, as I understand it, is that we have the
right of anticipatory self-defense, that we have the right to a
preemptive strike against any other country that we think is
going to attack us. Do you agree with that?
144 Teaching Minds
Palin: Charlie, if there is legitimate and enough intelligence that
tells us that a strike is imminent against American people, we
have every right to defend our country. In fact, the president
has the obligation, the duty to defend.
I suppose it is not a crime to not know the doctrine of the sitting
president from your own party when you are running for vice president,
but it does seem odd. But what is worse, is that after being told
what that doctrine is, Palin is content to ramble on incoherently.
Why doesn’t this bother her? Clearly this is not a real issue because it
doesn’t bother her supporters either.
Here is some more from that interview:
Gibson: But this is not just reforming a government. This is also
running a government on the huge international stage in
a very dangerous world. When I asked John McCain about
your national security credentials, he cited the fact that you
have commanded the Alaskan National Guard and that
Alaska is close to Russia. Are those sufficient credentials?
Palin: But it is about reform of government and it’s about putting
government back on the side of the people, and that has
much to do with foreign policy and national security issues.
Let me speak specifically about a credential that I do bring to
this table, Charlie, and that’s with the energy independence
that I’ve been working on for these years as the governor
of this state that produces nearly 20% of the U.S. domestic
supply of energy, that I worked on as chairman of the Alaska
Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, overseeing the oil
and gas development in our state to produce more for the
United States.
Gibson: I know. I’m just saying that national security is a whole
lot more than energy.
Knowledge should matter for high government officials, but it doesn’t
matter precisely because the people who are listening have no knowledge
either. Is Sarah Palin intelligent? There are plenty who would
say that she is not. These include those who rank coherent thinking
and the ability to create coherent explanations high on their list of
what constitutes intelligence. But, it should be clear, that is not what
Defining Intelligence 145
generally is thought of as intelligence. IQ tests have been measuring
intelligence for decades with questions like these:
At the end of a banquet 10 people shake hands with each other.
How many handshakes will there be in total?
A. 100
B. 20
C. 45
D. 50
E. 90

Saturday. What day is it today?

A. 8
B. 11
C. 24
D. 21
E. 27
Library is to book as book is to
A. page
B. copy
C. binding
D. cover
It is a reasonable guess that neither Palin nor her supporters would do
really well on questions like these. But the real issue is why questions
like these were chosen to be on IQ tests in the first place. Certainly
our concept of intelligence, and how to measure it, depends on some
vague sense of mathematical reasoning ability rather than real-life
situation reasoning ability.
146 Teaching Minds
The schools make the same distinction. They do not seriously debate
foreign policy in high school, but they do teach how to do number
sequences. There might be those who would say that Palin and
her supporters probably didn’t do well on the math SAT either. But
to me this is just a nonsensical way to look at intelligence. Plenty of
smart people don’t do well in, nor do they care about, math. But smart
people do well in reasoning logically from evidence and in presenting
a coherent argument for their beliefs. This is the essence of what it
means to be smart and to be educated. We expect leaders to be coherent
in what they say and to be able to justify their beliefs and actions.
One can assume that those who are bad at number sequences present
no problem for the country in any way, but being bad at detecting
faulty reasoning has its consequences in a democracy.
Here is a bit from the Katie Couric interview with Sarah Palin that
was shown on CBS during the 2008 campaign:
Couric: Why, in your view, is Roe v. Wade a bad decision?
Palin: I think it should be a states’ issue not a federal
government-mandated, mandating yes or no on such an
important issue. I’m, in that sense, a federalist, where I
believe that states should have more say in the laws of their
lands and individual areas. Now, foundationally, also, though
it’s no secret that I’m pro-life, that I believe in a culture of life
is very important for this country. Personally that’s what I
would like to see, um, further embraced by America.
Couric: Do you think there’s an inherent right to privacy in the
Constitution?
Palin: I do. Yeah, I do.
Couric: The cornerstone of Roe v. Wade.
Palin: I do. And I believe that individual states can best handle
what the people within the different constituencies in the 50
states would like to see their will ushered in an issue like that.
Couric: What other Supreme Court decisions do you disagree
with?
Palin: Well, let’s see. There’s, of course in the great history of
America there have been rulings, that’s never going to be
absolute consensus by every American. And there are those
issues, again, like Roe v. Wade, where I believe are best held on
a state level and addressed there. So, you know, going through
the history of America, there would be others but . . .
Defining Intelligence 147
Couric: Can you think of any?
Palin: Well, I could think of . . . any again, that could be best
dealt with on a more local level. Maybe I would take issue
with. But, you know, as mayor, and then as governor
and even as a vice president, if I’m so privileged to serve,
wouldn’t be in a position of changing those things but in
supporting the law of the land as it reads today.
So little of what Palin says makes sense that this interview was seen as a
national embarrassment, provoking multiple explanations for it from
the Palin camp, none of which said: She is just stupid and ignorant.
Obviously that is what her detractors were thinking. But is it true?
Is she stupid and ignorant? How can we find out? Look at this next
piece of the Couric interview:
Couric: . . . people have questioned your readiness since that
interview. And I’m curious to hear your reaction.
Palin: Well, not only am I ready but willing and able to serve as
vice president with Senator McCain if Americans so bless us
and privilege us with the opportunity of serving them, ready
with my executive experience as a city mayor and manager,
as a governor, as a commissioner, a regulator of oil and gas,
not only with my résumé proving that readiness, but I think
the important thing here is that John McCain and I, we share
a vision for America that includes energy independence.
What could be clearer than the idea that she is simply out of her
league and that it was a foolish idea to promote her as a possible vice
president? Why cynical politicians decide this is OK to do is not my
problem. The question I want to address is what makes one intelligent,
apart from genetics.
Looking at what we have seen here, we can think about our 12
cognitive processes one more time. Which of them are critical to the
everyday assessment of the intelligence of another person that most
people do on a daily basis?
Let’s start by eliminating some. Being able to evaluate something,
or having a set of values you believe in, has very little to do with basic
intelligence. The samples of stupidity that I cite above do not indicate
that any of this ability—determining what is important—is missing in
the people being interviewed.
148 Teaching Minds
Similarly, these people probably can influence one another, work
in teams, and negotiate with one another to some extent. They may
not be great at it, but we wouldn’t characterize the ability to influence
others well as a sign of intelligence. Many world leaders are very influential
but not all of those are considered to be brilliant.
Similarly, the ability to be a good team player is no way considered
to be a sign of intelligence. Some very bright people have difficulty
working with others. These things are not signs of intelligence.
Modeling and experimentation ability aren’t really important
when we talk about intelligence. Experimentation is something scientists
do. Children and chefs and nonscientists do it as well, of course.
But we wouldn’t criticize these interviewees if it turned out that they
didn’t know how to experiment. We certainly have no idea from these
interviews whether they can experiment or not. We can guess that
they cannot. We tend to think that experimentation is the province
of brilliant people, but would we say that someone is unintelligent
because they don’t know how to conduct a real experiment? Or, that
a chef is brilliant because he takes risks with food? (We may say that
he is a brilliant chef, but that doesn’t mean we think he is brilliant.)
Experimentation has a lot to do with innovation, which is certainly
related to intelligence, but, again, it really is not what we think about
when we hear interviews and think that the people being interviewed
are stupid.
Similarly, we don’t know whether these folks can effectively create
a model of the world. It seems a good guess that they cannot, but, yet
again, this lies more within the province of science and very intelligent
thinking than within our everyday definition of intelligence.
Some very smart people have weird models of the world or no model
of certain aspects of the world.
We do not think that the interviewees are stupid because they
don’t conduct experiments or create elaborate world models.
But a different story emerges when we look at the rest of the cognitive
processes. Which of the remaining processes are clearly missing in
the answers supplied by the interviewees above?
Obviously these people don’t speak particularly well.
Being able to aptly describe your views, or describe a situation you
have been in, or a thought you have had, is a hallmark of intelligence.
We judge people’s intelligence, at least in part, by how well they
speak.
Defining Intelligence 149
Does the ability to do diagnosis serve as a hallmark of intelligence?
Certainly doctors do diagnosis on a daily basis and doctors are
highly respected in our society. Most people think that if you are a
doctor, then you must be smart, but if you push on this belief, you
find that what people actually think is that a doctor had to go to
school for a really long time, learn of lot of complicated material, and
then work really hard as an intern and then as a resident. People respect
doctors and may well think that the doctor is the smartest person
in their small town, but that is typically because she is likely the
most educated person in that town. They easily may not consider her
to have “common sense,” which is one way that ordinary people describe
their perception of intelligent behavior.
Diagnosis is done by plumbers, detectives, engineers, and beauty
care professionals as well. Diagnosis is a very important cognitive
process to learn. Learning to do it well often means the difference
between success and failure on the job and personally. Can the interviewees
do diagnosis? Miss South Carolina can.
She asserts that her friends can locate the United States on a map
of the world. She can find contradictory evidence for the proposition
presented to her, which is certainly part of diagnosis. The Palin interviewees
have done diagnosis as well. They have determined what is
wrong with the country. They may not have done much more than
listen to someone on talk radio, but they came to a conclusion based
on the evidence presented to them.
But they have done it badly. That is why they seem stupid.
Coming up with an accurate diagnosis requires intelligence. Everyone
does diagnosis, but we seek counsel from those who do it better
than others. Diagnostic ability is a hallmark of intelligence.
What about causation? Let’s consider Miss South Carolina’s revised
remarks again:
“Personally, my friends and I, we know exactly where the United
States is on a map,” she said. “I don’t know anyone else who
doesn’t. If the statistics are correct, I believe there should be more
emphasis on geography in our education so people will learn
how to read maps better.”
Miss South Carolina thinks “there should be more emphasis on geography
in our education so people will learn to read maps better.”
150 Teaching Minds
In many ways this remark is as dumb as her early remarks. Why do I
think this?
Because it makes it clear that she hasn’t a clue, and doesn’t really
care, about causation.
And, this is exactly the problem with Sarah Palin’s remarks to
Katie Couric as well:
Couric: . . . people have questioned your readiness since that
interview. And I’m curious to hear your reaction.
Palin: Well, not only am I ready but willing and able to serve as
vice president with Senator McCain if Americans so bless us
and privilege us with the opportunity of serving them, ready
with my executive experience as a city mayor and manager,
as a governor, as a commissioner, a regulator of oil and gas,
not only with my résumé proving that readiness, but I think
the important thing here is that John McCain and I, we share
a vision for America that includes energy independence.
Why do I think that the problem here is about a misunderstanding of
how to determine causation? Miss South Carolina has determined the
following things to be true:
If students can’t do something, they should be taught to do it.
If students can’t do something, it is because they weren’t taught
to do it.
If students can’t do something that it seems anyone should be
able to do, then it should be taught in school.
Reading maps is more important than whatever would have to
be eliminated from school so that reading maps could take its
place.
These decisions should be made on the basis of statistical
evidence of student’s abilities.
But is any of this reasonable? Not only could one argue with each of
these propositions, but it is fair to say that Miss South Carolina herself
doesn’t know that she holds these positions, that she hasn’t thought
about them, and that she might disagree with what she said if someone
pointed this out to her.
In other words, she cannot reason well precisely because her beliefs
indicate that she does not think about causation, and one can
Defining Intelligence 151
guess that she doesn’t think about causation because no one ever tried
to get her to do so. So she may very well be smart but she sounds
stupid because she seems to be unaware of her own causal reasoning
and is not very good at it. Being good at understanding causation
and figuring what could possibly cause what and why is a hallmark of
intelligence.
Intelligence can be enhanced by practicing the cognitive processes
that are the basis of intelligent behavior and intelligent reasoning.
One of these hallmark processes is certainly causation.
We could make Miss South Carolina smarter by teaching her how
to determine what causes what and asking her to figure things out and
explain them to others using a causation model that she could defend.
Of course, it would have been better if this process started when she
was a small child.
Now, with that in mind, let’s look at the Palin remark. Palin was
asked about her readiness for the office of vice president, which isn’t
much of an office really. What was really being asked was her readiness
for the presidency, which was not unreasonable to worry about
considering John McCain’s age. She responded in a way that made
clear that she has no understanding of causation either.
In the statements above, she asserted (implicitly) the following
beliefs about causation:
Any mayor or city manager is ready to be president.
Any governor is ready to be president.
Any commissioner is ready to be president.
Any regulator of gas and oil is ready to be president.
If you have a vision of energy independence, you are ready to be
president.
Now, of course, one of these beliefs is, in fact, shared by the country
since we have chosen governors to be president. But the other beliefs
are simply wrong. No one thinks that having a vision of energy independence
prepares you to be president or that being an oil and gas
regulator prepares you to be president.
So, what does Palin misunderstand here? She doesn’t get the idea
of preparedness as causation. Having a degree in accounting prepares
you to be an accountant, most would agree. We believe, as a society, in
certain rites of passage preparing you for the next step. Palin apparently
has never thought about this or why anyone would hold such beliefs.
152 Teaching Minds
It is not an unreasonable question to ask whether being a U.S.
senator prepares you to be president. It would not have been odd if
Palin had asked Couric whether we ever had a president who actually
was prepared for the job. Other than vice presidents who work closely
with a president for 4 years or more, it is not unreasonable to assert
that we have a history of unprepared presidents. But she didn’t say
that because preparedness is a causative notion and Palin doesn’t seem
to get causation. She may be bright enough to have been taught about
causation when she was small, but apparently this didn’t happen. As a
result, she seems stupid to those who do understand causation.
Palin recently has made statements that make you wonder where
her ideas about causation come from. This is from a 2009 interview
on ABC:
Walters: Now let’s talk about some issues—the Middle East. The
Obama Administration does not want Israel to build any
more settlements on what they consider Palestinian territory.
What is your view on this?
Palin: I disagree with the Obama Administration on that. I
believe that, um, the Jewish settlements should be allowed to
be expanded upon because the population of Israel is going
to grow. More and more Jewish people will be flocking to
Israel in the days and weeks and months ahead.
What is the problem here? Again, there is a question of causation, but
it is more obvious that that is the issue. No one who hears this statement
would fail to ask why Jews would be flocking to Israel in the
weeks and months ahead.
It is important to understand that determination of causation is
the backbone of an intelligently thought out belief system. People believe
certain things. They believe that the sun will rise in the morning
and that their parents will come home from work at night. Beliefs
often are based on observation and generalization. People also are
taught beliefs. There are many ways to acquire beliefs. Children get
them from their parents mostly but also from friends and siblings.
At some point, however, reality comes into play. Reality often means
comparing a belief with what you know or can figure out about causation.
You can believe that the sun rises each morning but not know its
cause. And, of course, you can learn the cause. You can believe that the
Defining Intelligence 153
Great Pumpkin rises on Halloween if you like, but at some point you
might notice that this doesn’t seem to take place.
Beliefs, reality, and the rules of causation are interrelated but they
are not the same thing. Causal knowledge should, however, enable
one to alter erroneous beliefs that don’t stand up to what one knows
about causation.
So what would cause Jews to suddenly flock to Israel? Is she privy
to information about another Holocaust or is this some fundamentalist
religious belief? She doesn’t say. The fact that she doesn’t say, is
what makes her look either unintelligent or incapable of clear reasoning.
Being able to justify one’s beliefs by citing common knowledge
or revealing knowledge known only to you involves relying on commonly
known rules about causation.
What about prediction?
You can believe that New York will beat Philadelphia in football.
You can predict it based on evidence. You can explain the cause and
effect that have made you come to this point of view. But, after New
York loses, you need to modify some beliefs that you previously held.
At the very least you have to acknowledge that your prediction was
wrong and you might want take this into account the next time you
make a prediction, by finding out what went wrong in your reasoning,
if anything. Or, you simply can say your team wasn’t lucky, of course.
Prediction relies on beliefs, and in many situations predictions are
or are not verified immediately and new thinking can begin. But when
one gets married, for example, one is predicting that the marriage will
be good and will work out well for all parties. One might not realize
for some years that this prediction was wrong. Then, when seeking
a new marriage, the predictor hopes she has determined what went
wrong by seeing what erroneous beliefs were held the last time.
It is very good to be able to predict, but predictive ability is not
seen as a sign of intelligence. After all, people seek out fortune tellers
because they think fortune tellers have a gift, not because they think
fortune tellers are very bright. At the 2010 Olympics an octopus was
apparently capable of making accurate predictions. No one claimed
that it was an especially bright octopus.
A prediction made by someone that is justified by, “I just feel it,”
makes the predictor look foolish. In contrast, a prediction about relativity,
for example, that is complex to understand but has been explained
clearly and later is borne out by evidence makes the predictor
154 Teaching Minds
look like a genius. But what actually makes us feel that a scientist’s
accurate predictions make him smart is the reasoning behind those
predictions, the causal explanation.
We can see how intelligence, or the lack of it, is perceived by
people and we must begin to reconsider how intelligence should be
measured by those trying to put numbers to mental abilities. And, we
can see why those Palin supporters seem so dumb. Let’s look at one of
them again:
Interviewer: What do you think she would bring in terms of
policy to office?
Young woman: Good judgment.
Interviewer: Any specifics?
Young woman: I think she would control the out-of-control
spending.
This is a prediction. The question is what this prediction is based on. It
is a good guess that the young woman cannot cite examples of Palin’s
good judgment and has no idea whether Palin was able to control
spending in Alaska. If she were able to cite examples, that is, if her
predictions were supported by evidence that she clearly articulated,
we would, in fact, think that the young woman was smart. Perhaps
she is smart and perhaps the interviewer deliberately cut out those
responses. It seems unlikely, given the weird “czar” remark that followed
this, but the point is that we seek such evidence when we make
a judgment about someone’s intelligence.
What about planning? Those who make bad plans are usually
laughed at. Criminals who get caught by doing something dumb are
always made fun of by the press. Bad planning makes a person look
stupid.
Bad judgment, on the other hand, is more easily forgiven. When
you make a mistake, you can always claim to have used bad judgment.
Make the same mistake again and you begin to look stupid.
So, if we are interested in making people more intelligent, as opposed
to more knowledgeable, it is clear that we need to redefine what
we mean by intelligence.
Intelligence is the ability to diagnose well, to plan well, and to
be able to understand what causes what. To do this one must be able
to reassess one’s belief system when new evidence is presented and
Defining Intelligence 155
one must be able to explain one’s reasoning clearly to those who ask.
And, one must have a knowledge base of relevant information to draw
upon. But our education system, in concentrating only on the knowledge
base and not on independent reasoning from that knowledge
base, has ensured that the knowledge base remains incomprehensible
to most people and therefore is immediately forgotten after school is
over.
It would be a good idea to eliminate IQ tests as a measure of intelligence
and begin to teach people to do diagnosis, to plan well, to be
able to determine causality, and to clearly explain their reasoning to
others.
Those that cannot learn to do this would rightly be called stupid,
but those who can would rightly be called intelligent.
Degrees of intelligence would be about one’s ability to do this for
more and more complex issues in complex domains.

CHAPTER 11
Restructuring the University
It is a miracle that curiosity survives formal education.
—Albert Einstein
When I moved from Stanford to Yale, it was entirely because of the
efforts of Bob Abelson, a psychology professor who became my good
friend and wonderful colleague during the 15 years I was at Yale. Bob
had been instrumental in helping to create the Computer Science
Department at Yale, which is the department that wound up recruiting
me( Bob had hoped I would be outside the department structure
since I didn’t really fit in anywhere very well, but he couldn’t win that
argument.)
Bob told me a story about the creation of the Computer Science
Department at Yale, which involved his having to argue with another
faculty member on a university committee about why a department
should be created around a machine. He said that one member of the
committee actually asked him whether there should be a department
of lathe science as well.
We both found this to be pretty funny at the time. Now, however,
I have to admit that the guy had a point.
I have been a professor in quite a few academic departments in
my university career: linguistics, computer science, psychology, education,
and electrical engineering. These departments all have some
something in common: They have no real reason to exist. One would
assume that departments represent academic disciplines that are coherent
in some way, but it simply isn’t so. The people in a computer
science department, for example, have in common that they all think
about computer-related issues, but so do people in other disciplines.
Some parts of computer science have more in common with mathematics
than they do with other parts of computer science. There were
many people in the departments that I was in who worked on things
that I didn’t understand or care about. All our interchanges were about
157
158 Teaching Minds
department affairs, never about computer science. We had nothing to
say to one another about that. The same is true in every department.
Academic departments are made up of faculty who have been thrown
together for historical reasons but really have no business being in the
same department.
What does a clinical psychologist have in common with someone
who studies animal behavior? Do they talk about crazy chimps? What
does an historical linguist have to say to a Chomskian linguist? What
does someone who works on the philosophy of mind have to say to
someone who studies religious philosophy?
Departments probably should have been organized around ideas
instead of around words. I tried to facilitate that when I helped create
cognitive science as a discipline by founding the Journal of Cognitive
Science and the Cognitive Science Society. That was over 30 years ago
and while some cognitive science departments have been created, in
the end the disciplines that study the mind continue to do so in their
own ways. Computer scientists who study the mind build computer
models, and psychologists who study the mind run experiments.
Anthropologists who study the mind do descriptions. That these are
three of the twelve cognitive processes is no accident. Departments are
organized to some extent around the processes that they use, but that
is by no means the central organizing principle. As that old adversary
to the creation of the Yale Computer Science Department said, the
central organizing principle was a machine and that is kind of silly.
Who suffers from this state of affairs? The students, of course.
When a department’s faculty meets to decide what courses students
must take in order to major in their field, it is not a sage conversation
among scholars about what it means to be a computer scientist or psychologist.
It is a political tug fest, where people from very diverse fields
within these departments push and shove for turf.
Why do they care? There are two big reasons. First, if no one signs
up for the courses you teach, you won’t be teaching them for long.
Second, if many students sign up for the courses you teach, you can
justify hiring more faculty in your subdiscipline, which means more
friends to hang out with and more power in department meetings
where the votes can now go your way. You think this stuff doesn’t
matter? These issues are the lifeblood of every university department.
Let’s look at both of these and see why they might matter.
Restructuring the University 159
Instead of subjects then, let’s take a fanciful tour through the
twelve cognitive processes and see what would happen to the university
if it organized itself around those processes.
First let’s look at the existing Yale departments and schools:

Statistics
This list may be somewhat inaccurate since it is taken from a list of
possible majors, which is not the same thing as a list of departments.
I just edited it to reflect my memory of Yale, which could conceivably
have added a new department or two since I was there 20 years ago
(but departments are not easily created or deleted at Yale).
Now let’s ask what would happen if we reorganized.
Which departments specialize in prediction, for example? Clearly,
economics is about prediction, as is physics, and sociology, and psychology,
and any branch of engineering.
Which departments specialize in judgment? Law does certainly.
Medicine, parts of psychology, parts of anthropology, aspects of statistics,
architecture, and art history do so, as do many others.
Which departments specialize in modeling? Computer science
certainly does, as do parts of psychology. Engineering disciplines do
and nearly all of the sciences do. Economics and sociology do as well.
Which departments specialize in experimentation? All of the sciences,
plus psychology, do experiments. Economics and sociology
people sometimes do them. Political scientists do experiments.
Which departments specialize in describing? The humanities specialize
in this, as do English and Italian, and Near Eastern languages,
and linguistics, and anthropology. Parts of psychology and medicine
and law do as well.
Where is diagnosis practiced? In medicine, of course, but also in
law, business, and engineering.
Where is planning studied and practiced? In engineering and in
architecture certainly, but also in business, medicine, computer science,
and psychology.
Restructuring the University 161
Where is causation worried about? Nearly everywhere. Anyone
in the social sciences or in any practical discipline worries about
causation.
So, should departments be organized around the twelve cognitive
processes? Probably not.
It would be difficult to do and everyone would be against it. It
is difficult to change what has always been in place. But those who
study diagnosis would benefit from being around others who were
doing diagnosis all the time. And those who are worried about descriptions
would do well to hang around others doing the same. But
it doesn’t matter that much, really. In a research university, professors
really just talk with people who are doing more or less exactly what
they themselves are doing. Departmental seminars are social gatherings
more than intellectual meeting places, since a talk on one subspecialty
rarely interests those who work in different subspecialties in the
same department.
But none of this really matters. Our research universities (of which
there are maybe 50 in the United States) are doing very well, and my
problem is not with them. It is with the institutions that claim to be
educating our youth for the future and that employ professors who
have a Ph.D. from a research university and who really wish they were
still there. The research universities serve as professor training grounds
that train many more professors who can do research than we possibly
could need. These people then become professors at institutions
where hardly any student intends to get a Ph.D., but they continue to
teach the same Ph.D. training curriculum that they studied.
This has got to stop. The problem is not so much the universities
as the high schools, of course. As long as college is seen as a professor
training ground, then high school is seen as way to get into the professor
training ground, and a nonsensical system evolves that trains high
school kids to study what professors need to know. This has to end.
When students sign up for psychology at their university, they
want to know what is wrong with them and their parents, and instead
they study how to do experiments because that is what their professors
learned to do in graduate school. When students take computer
science in college, they want to learn to use the computer, but instead
they study the mathematics of computation because that is what their
professor does. When kids study chemistry in college, they are doing
it in order to become doctors for the most part, but instead of learning
162 Teaching Minds
chemistry that doctors need to know, they study the chemistry research
that their professors are doing. When they want to learn business,
they learn economics. When they want to learn how to write,
they learn about literature. All of this happens because of the nature of
the research universities’ domination of our education system.
In order to fix our high schools, we need to get rid of departments
based on rather arbitrarily defined academic subjects.. We should organize
universities around the kinds of work people do, where work
means the kinds of thinking that they engage in, not the machines
that they play with. Anyway that’s my suggestion.
AN IMAGINED FIRST YEAR IN COLLEGE
We all know that what I propose will never happen. University faculty
would stop such a proposal at every turn. So, in the name of reality,
I want to make a suggestion that university faculty possibly could
adopt.
Simply divide the 4 years that make up college into two parts.
Dedicate the first 2 years to the teaching of the 12 processes and the
last 2 to the study of the subjects that the faculty so dearly love. Introduction
to X, which now dominates the first 2 years of college for most
students, would be abandoned. The faculty hate teaching it anyway
and the students hate taking it.
How would this work? Let’s first consider the set of processes
grouped under conceptual processes.
Conceptual Processes
Prediction is an area of life that is worth getting good at doing.
Who, in the various faculties, organize their daily lives around predictions?
Economists make predictions. It is what they do all the time.
Medical doctors make predictions. Physicists make predictions. Political
scientists make predictions. Let’s imagine that students were
taught by a team of people from these four areas who were the exactly
those people who specialized in making predictions all the time in
their careers. And, let’s suppose that they created a year-long course
in how to make predictions based on known evidence, past cases, and
Restructuring the University 163
pushing the boundaries of what is known. Wouldn’t this be a better
course than Introduction to Physics? The teachers could introduce
whatever aspects of physics they wanted to help students understand
the predictive process in that area, but other faculty who did prediction
in other areas would be part of the discussion. There would be a
set of interesting issues ranging from predictions that were thought
to be right but weren’t, to predictions that are being made today in
each area. The content would be the predictive process itself, not the
traditional subject matter. Statistics (and other useful tools) would be
taught in this context while the predictive process was being studied.
Modeling. Who build models? Psychologists think about models of
the mind, as do computer scientists and philosophers who specialize
in thinking about thinking. Architects and economists build models
of a different sort. Engineers work with models regularly. All of these
people use different modeling tools but they work on the same thing:
trying to figure out how something works by building it and seeing if
they can replicate it. They may be using a computer or building blocks
or electricity or art. It makes no difference. It is all an attempt to see
how things work by building some facsimile. This is an important idea
in human thinking, and a course should be taught to undergraduates
on how to do it by the people who actually do it, teaching different
techniques as they go. They are many ways to build a model, and
students in college should know the possibilities before they take on
further study.
Experimentation. Psychologists do experiments. Chemists do
experiments. Physicists do experiments. Medical researchers do
experiments. (The drug companies are constantly doing experiments
that affect us all.) Why is there no course in learning how to do an
experiment? Shouldn’t students be learning how to come up with a
hypothesis and how to test that hypothesis? Isn’t that more important
as a fundamental building block of the mind than any course offered
to freshmen in college today?
Evaluation. Every academic field does evaluation. In every
discipline there are ways and means to discuss and evaluate the
worth of papers and research and practical proposals. Businesses are
164 Teaching Minds
evaluated regularly and evaluation is taught explicitly in business
school. Political scientists evaluate politicians and political systems.
Historians evaluate what makes governments, battles, cities, and a
range of other things successful. Architects and urban planners and
engineers worry about evaluation of what they propose and produce.
All of these people could combine to teach students how to evaluate.
This is very important part of functioning in any society.
First College Year Summary
It would be my contention that a freshman year made up of these
four processes, taught in four simultaneous courses that were designed
to relate to one another in various ways and at specific times, would be
a wonderful thing for teaching people how to think. The best of our
faculty could teach what they thought about to students, who now
would be ready to start to think rigorously. By the end of this first year,
students could begin to specialize, not in academic subjects just yet,
but in other processes that build on the conceptual processes.
SECOND YEAR IN COLLEGE
Let’s look at the analytic processes.
Analytic Processes
Diagnosis. Who does diagnosis? Doctors certainly. Lawyers certainly.
All the people I mentioned above who are building models
need to figure out why their models may have gone wrong. Anyone
who manages people or large operations needs to figure out all the
time what has gone wrong. In fact, diagnosis is a critical part of nearly
every area of thinking and every area of work. Diagnosis needs to be
studied for its own sake. How do we do diagnosis in principle, no matter
what the situation?
Diagnosis also needs to be examined in the various contexts in
which it can be applied. A course in diagnosis, taught by the entire faculty
who do diagnosis regularly, showing real work and real situations
that they have had to handle, and coming after the first year, would
have two advantages. One, it could build on the basic conceptual
Restructuring the University 165
processes discussed above. Second, students could choose to think
about diagnosis in some areas as opposed to others. Art experts might
teach about art fraud, and lawyers might teach about detecting business
fraud. In each case there would be similarities, and these should
be taught by a group of faculty from different areas, but at the end
of the course students should be able to start to actually do diagnosis
under the tutelage of an expert in an area that interests them.
They actually may not know much about that area of knowledge,
of course, and that would be the objection of the faculty to this idea.
But it is my contention that faculty have had this wrong all these
years. Teaching the basics to students, who have no concept of their
possible use, is really not helpful. All these introductory courses are
just an excuse to pack kids into lecture halls and pretend to do education
while saving money on hiring more teachers. Teachers should
pose real-world problems to students and encourage students to gain
the knowledge they need to solve them.
Diagnosis is a perfect area for this. One can try one’s hand at
crime detection, without knowing everything about the details of
how one does it, with the help of an expert looking over one’s shoulder.
This kind of just-in-time learning is how humans have always
learned what they needed to know. The idea that school should teach
you what you need to know before you need to know it, is seriously
flawed. People can’t remember what they learned, years after they
learned it in school, if they haven’t been practicing what they learned
all along.
Judgment. Law typically is not part of any college curriculum
because law schools are recent inventions on college campuses (that is,
they are from the past century and not the century before) so law never
got to be part of the required or even elective set of college courses
despite the fact that so many students want to be lawyers. Judges make
judgments all the time, and those lawyers who teach judges to make
judgments should be teaching freshmen to make judgments as well.
Of course, artists and musicians and literary critics make judgments
of a different sort, as do philosophers and businesspeople. All of these
people could be teaching a course together on how to make judgments
fairly and how to determine what is fair. This is where ethics and
morality come into play as well.
166 Teaching Minds
Planning. What I said about diagnosis is also true of planning. We
plan in everything we do. There are economic plans, architectural
plans, medical treatment plans, business plans, and so on. A computer
program is a type of plan, and research plans are everywhere in a
university. Writing these plans is not so different in principle, but in
reality a business plan doesn’t look much like a treatment plan. So
there is the idea of a good plan and the understanding of what a plan
looks like, what a plan’s description ought to be like, in any area of
life. You may think a business plan should look a certain way, but if
the business community has a different idea, that idea will turn out
to be right.
Students should have the opportunity to write all kinds of plans,
learning about the principles of planning while learning about what
officially is considered to be a good plan in an area of the real world
that interests them.
So, as part of the second year, students should get to study planning,
and then study successful planning documents, and then write
plans and have them evaluated by the faculty.
Causation. Who studies causation? Everybody. Psychologists
worry about what makes people crazy, doctors worry about what
makes people sick, environmentalists worry about what is ruining
the planet. Physicists want to know how the world works. Computer
scientists want to know how computers can work better. Engineers do
nothing but causation, really. So, here again, determining causes is a
basic cognitive skill and it can be learned within the second year as
well, in the same way I have been describing building on what came
in the first year to tackle complex problems of causation in areas that
interest the students.
Social Processes
Describing can easily be taught, as all of the eight processes discussed
above are taught by requiring students to present their work in
written and oral form. Students need to learn to write but they also
need to learn to talk and to use alternative media to make their points
and to explain what they have done. A coherent course of study in
how to describe properly is easily within the ability of any college faculty
and ought to be its highest priority, taught from many different
Restructuring the University 167
points of view, teaching what description is about not how to work
PowerPoint.
THIRD YEAR IN COLLEGE AND BEYOND
Now what next?
After these 2 years, what will students be able to do and what
should the faculty do with them? Clearly, faculty, as I have pointed
out, want to teach what interests them—their own research subspecialties.
Faculty will want to continue to insist on there being majors.
Students should not have to be forced to select a major subject because
majors (and, of course, subjects) are at the root of the problem.
Whose needs do majors satisfy? Faculty like them because the faculty
can determine that to be a major in X students must know all
of its aspects, and then insist that students, take obscure courses that
they would not want to take. This is another way of making sure that
faculty get to teach whatever they want to teach.
An alternative would be to let students specialize in a cognitive
process, like diagnosis, and an area where they have become knowledgeable
to which diagnosis applies, like financial diagnosis or behavioral
diagnosis. Every student who majors in business doesn’t really
want to, or need to, know every aspect of business, and a student who
majors in psychology doesn’t need to study clinical, social, animal,
and developmental psychology, if what he is interested in is diagnosing
personality disorders, for example.
Let students specialize, if they want—they shouldn’t be made to,
but let them specialize in processes that they might want to become
proficient at. We shouldn’t force them to take courses , that in no
way serve their interests. Such requirements are made using arguments
about breadth when they are there to make sure that undersubscribed
courses get taught. Majors in computer science at Yale when I
arrived there had to take artificial intelligence and numerical analysis.
These subjects never interest the same people. They are as different as
accounting and clinical psychology. These requirements were there
because faculty wanted to make sure there were students enrolled in
their course. If they didn’t, they would have had to teach something
they didn’t know as well. Faculty made arguments about the wellrounded
student, but students’ needs had nothing to do with it.
168 Teaching Minds
Whenever you see a required course in a departmental major,
there is politics behind it. Someone has traded with someone else. If
you make them take my course, then I will vote to make them take
your course. It is how requirements are created at every school. No one
is thinking of the students’ needs, trust me.
So what if we did think of the students’ needs? What would we do
in the third and fourth years of college? It seems obvious that students
would like to learn some job skills and that they would like to be able
to pick subjects that interested them for further study. In addition,
they might have found something that they were working on in the
first 2 years that made them want to get better at it. This is what the
rest of college should look like then.
For computer science, for example, students should get to select
software engineering, as suggested by my colleague earlier, if they
want to be employable, and they should be able to improve cognitive
skills that they may have acquired in the first 2 years. They may
not have studied various subspecialties in computer science, so they
should get to choose the ones that interest them. They also may have
an interest in pursuing some noncomputer-related subjects taught at
the university, for their own edification. In other words, they get to
choose and the choices should include job skills and continued use of
the cognitive processes they have honed in the first 2 years. Faculty
simply should offer choices, and students should pick.
What would happen if this were done?
In a world where students got to decide what they studied, many
of the departments listed above would disappear. There might be some
call for Near Eastern languages or art history, but not that much. These
departments exist for historical reasons and universities are reluctant
to get rid of them, so universities make requirements that students
take courses in them. An enormous English department is justified
only by the sense that universities ought to have that sort of thing and
by continuing English literature requirements for students. Without
that, such departments would be much smaller than they are.
Therefore, it is clear that this cannot happen.
What could happen is this: High schools could change and colleges
would have to adapt. This is possible because high school does
not have to be the way it is today. Its current organization around
academic subjects makes no sense. This can be fixed by simply building
different kinds of high school curricula. But how can we change
high school?
Restructuring the University 169
As it stands now, we can’t. High schools teach what colleges tell
them to teach. Recently I was looking for a picture of the man who
was principal of my elementary school many years ago. I wanted to
put it in a speech I was about to give. So, I went to the P.S. 247 (Brooklyn)
website and discovered that it is now a “New York City College
Partnership Elementary School.” When I finished laughing, I started
to wonder when this “everyone must spend their entire childhood
worrying about getting into college” nonsense would end. P.S. 247
was not a great bastion of learning or a fun place in the 1950s, and I
can only imagine how awful it is now. I wondered why P.S. 247 now
had to be a college prep elementary school. A commenter on what I
wrote noted that the old trade schools, which used to dominate the
New York school system, were serving mostly minority populations
and this had to stop; so now “everyone can go to college” is the mantra
of the equity folks.
But the problem is, of course, that what is being bought with all
this college preparation is the right to be an unemployed English major
instead of the airplane mechanic you might have been if you had
gone to Aviation High School.
High school has become all about college, and college is all about
scholarship and research, so what is left? So who teaches students to
think clearly? Who teaches students about the possibilities there are
for work that might interest them? Who teaches students how to get
along with one another, and who teaches people how to communicate
well?
Certainly not the high schools, which are obsessed with test score
preparation, which means rote memory for the most part.
Certainly not the colleges, which are run by faculty who do research
and who think mostly about that.
One possible answer is community colleges, but when someone
like me suggests that skipping college and going to community college
instead to learn an actual skill might be a good idea for most students,
that suggestion is disregarded as being on the lunatic fringe.
The good news is that because of all this craziness, there is a big
opportunity to build an alternative, which I will discuss in Chapter 14.

CHAPTER 12
How Not to Teach
Some people will never learn anything, for this reason, because
they understand everything too soon.
—Alexander Pope
My daughter learned a lot from me and from her surroundings when
she was small. All children learn all the time when they are little.
But what are they learning? When Hana was about 1-1/2 we lived in
Switzerland. Hana was my parent’s first grandchild. Since they were in
New York, there were frequent phone calls back and forth and more
than the occasional visit. Once during this period I got curious as
to whether Hana knew the names of her grandparents. I figured she
might not know the word name so I asked her, “What does Gammy
(her name for my mother) call Poppy (my father). She immediately
responded, “Maaacc!!” imitating the intonation and exasperation of
my mother trying to get my father’s attention. I asked what my father
called my mother, and she said “Marge!” in the tone of an authoritative
military call.
Hana talked to her grandparents on the phone quite a bit. One day
I noticed her walking in furious circles while she was talking, at one
point almost bringing the phone down on her head. Now who had
been teaching her that? Well . . . me. That’s what I do when I talk on
the phone. And it is still what my daughter does, 30 years later.
Speaking of 30 years later (well, 20 in this story), I observed this
same seemingly imitative behavior in Hana when she was in college.
I remarked to a friend of my daughter who went to school with her in
Evanston that there was a no left turn sign in Evanston (where I also
worked) that I always ignored because it was so stupid. She said that
my daughter always ignored the same sign and also said it was stupid.
The curious part of this story is that my daughter and I, having our
own cars and lives, had never been in a car together in Evanston and
neither had we ever discussed this sign.
171
172 Teaching Minds
Did I teach her to ignore stupid no left turn signs? Of course I
did. But I never said such a thing to her or taught her how to decide
when it was safe to ignore a sign. I was just in her world and she was
watching.
I observed a similar phenomenon with my son. I like to watch
football and my son sat with me and learned to watch too. Twenty
years later, when an event occurred on the field, I noticed that we said
exactly the same thing at the same time. “Oof,” “oh come on,” “ugh.”
Whatever event on the field caused me to exclaim something, caused
my son to exclaim the same thing. Now, I could not tell you what
was an “oof” and what was an “ugh,” and neither could he. I do this
kind of thing unconsciously and so does he. He learned what I had to
teach, but he doesn’t know what he learned and I don’t know what I
taught.
What does this have to do with teaching? Perhaps we just need
to watch our teachers and then we can copy what they do. Well, not
exactly.
I took a yoga lesson the other day. The instructor got into a pose
and said I was to copy what he did. I said there wasn’t a chance that
I could copy what he did. He wasn’t used to being talked to like this.
(Most students are better at being students than I am, of course.) I
explained that I could barely understand what he had done, despite
seeing it, and I certainly didn’t know the intent of what he had done,
so I wouldn’t know which aspects of his action were significant and
which were unimportant. I told him this was no way to teach.
Now I know I will not be able to teach the yoga instructor how
to teach better, and I doubt he will be reading this book. But whether
you are teaching yoga or baseball or science or business, the rules are
the same. Before I list them, let me start with the top mistakes teachers
make. Some of these mistakes are forced on teachers by a badly
designed education system, and some are ones that teachers make no
matter what they are teaching or which system they are teaching in.
Some of these are less than obvious. So, let’s consider them one
by one:
Mistake #1: Assuming that there is some kind of learning other
than learning by doing
Mistake #2: Believing that a teacher’s job is assessment
Mistake #3: Thinking there is something that everyone must
know in order to proceed
How Not to Teach 173
Mistake #4: Thinking that students are not worried about the
purpose of what they are being taught
Mistake #5: Thinking that studying can replace repeated practice
as a key learning technique
Mistake #6: Thinking that because students have chosen to take
your course, they have an interest in learning what you plan
to teach them
Mistake# 7: Correcting a student who is doing something wrong
by telling him what to do instead
Mistake #8: Thinking that a student remembers what you just
taught him
Now, let’s consider these teaching mistakes one by one.
Mistake #1: Assuming that there is some kind of learning other
than learning by doing
All of us, teachers or not, believe that we can teach by telling.
When I say that people learn by doing, people think: Yes, maybe most
of the time, but you also can learn by being told. The issue is what it
means to learn, of course. I define learning in terms of the cognitive
processes that are exercised during the attempt to learn.
This means that when I say the following: “You cannot learn by
being told,” what I mean is that that you cannot learn to do any cognitive
process by being told. I can tell you that George Washington
never told a lie, and you could learn that and you could make it something
that you now believe. But this is not learning in the sense that
it doesn’t make you more capable of doing something because you
have learned it. Subject-based education relies on learning by telling
because for most of the things that are being taught, there is no other
way to learn them. How else could you learn that George Washington
never told a lie? By observation? By historical research? We learn this
by being told. But we do not learn cognitive processes by simply being
told. We learn them by practicing them.
This confusion is why teaching in its current form, with a teacher
in front of a class, exists at all. Without this focus on subject-based
education, it could not exist. And, this is why parents never stand in
front of their kids teaching them things. Cognitive processes cannot
be altered by telling.
So, we have rule #1 for teaching:
174 Teaching Minds
Rule #1: A teacher should never tell a student anything that the
teacher thinks is true. Now, on the surface this seems ridiculous.
How can you resist telling students the truth? Isn’t that your job as a
teacher? No. It isn’t.
Why not?
Because, in general, students wouldn’t believe you anyway. Students
don’t take what teachers say as gospel. And, they tend not to
remember what you say. I have taught many a class and asserted X
only to be told minutes later that I had asserted not X. People don’t
listen very well. So what is the point of saying true things, besides
feeling good about having said something wise? The point certainly
isn’t teaching.
How will students learn what is true, then? By discovery. By failure.
By repeated experience. By talking with people about what they
think and having to defend their claims. Not by listening to you.
Let’s consider mistake #2.
Mistake #2: Believing that a teacher’s job is assessment
What does this mean? In the real world, teaching and assessment
are usually conjoined. Teachers teach and they also give grades and
test. This is a problem. It is a problem because satisfying the teacher
becomes a goal of the student that tends to supersede learning, and it
is a problem because as the ultimate arbiter of truth, a teacher gets to
say what is true and students have to believe it. To fix this a teacher
needs to not be in this dual role.
This is easier said than done, of course. I used to tell students they
would get an A no matter what they did as long as they handed in the
work that I asked for. This had the effect of having many students sign
up for an easy A and having the administration become annoyed with
how many A’s I gave out. Both of these outcomes were entirely predictable.
But what I did, changed student behavior in the class greatly.
They often wrote about how much they wanted to please the
teacher and how once I took that out of the equation, how much
it changed their view as to why they were doing anything at all. For
some, it had a very bad effect. They just didn’t take the class seriously.
Others took it more seriously than ever because they were the judges
of their own work. (I asked them to defend their viewpoints to the
class during class time so their friends were also judges.)
How Not to Teach 175
Of course, the system teachers teach in does not allow them to
separate assessment and teaching. But it doesn’t allow them to teach
only cognitive processes either. For a cognitive process-based education
system to work, teachers must be allowed to teach, and others
should be the ultimate judges of success. Teachers need to help students
get where they are trying to go and let others decide whether
they have gotten there.
So, we have rule #2 for teaching:
Rule #2: A teacher should never be the ultimate judge of the
teacher’s own students’ success. Here again, this seems absurd. But
in the end, this separation of responsibilities is very important. Parents
judge how well their children are walking and talking, of course. But
the children are not anxious about passing their parents’ assessments.
The success is its own reward. And in the end, others judge how well
your children speak. A parent is really there to help, not judge.
Let’s look at mistake #3.
Mistake #3: Thinking there is something that everyone must
know in order to proceed
This is, of course, the killer mistake. Go to any faculty meeting, or
interview any teacher, and he will tell you that something is the basis
for all that follows that, and if you don’t know it, you can’t proceed
in the subject he teaches. Theory first is the mantra of nearly every
teacher. The question is why this is so. I have been in arguments about
this so often that I wonder why these views are so widely held.
Teach theory first, then practice. Because of this mantra, computer
science majors often don’t learn to program in a way that actually
would make them hirable, and budding medical students drown in a
sea of chemistry equations. Businesspeople learn about finance long
before they learn how to run a business, if they ever do learn that, and
psychology students learn about B.F. Skinner when what they really
wanted to know is why they are so screwed up.
Why do teachers like teaching theory so much? I think that the
answer is that it is orderly stuff, with official answers that the teacher
gets to know while the students try to learn them. This puts the
teacher in a powerful situation and teachers are comfortable with
that. Teaching practice is much harder. There often are no right answers
and many screw-ups, and the learning process is much messier.
176 Teaching Minds
Theory is a subject. Practice in a field means exercising the twelve
cognitive processes we have been referring to, and because of that,
progress is much harder to ascertain. You can test theory. It is harder
to test practice. One can gain a lot of knowledge about what doesn’t
work while practicing and still produce nothing worthwhile. The lessons
learned are harder to assess. Teaching theory makes all teachers
more comfortable. Of course, theory means there is no doing, so no
one really learns much. After they pass the test, they can forget what
they learned with no consequences.
There is a big difference between knowing that and knowing how.
Schools have always emphasized knowing that. The primary reason
for this is that the stuff you can say you know is testable. But knowing
how is much more important. So we worry that students don’t know
that George Washington was president, without asking what the use of
that knowledge is. There may be a use for that knowledge. It is doesn’t
come to me immediately what that use would be, but let’s assume
there is some use for that knowledge for your average student. If so,
that knowledge should be taught within the context in which it might
be used. There is, for example, a use of that knowledge for constructing
a history paper about the origins of the United States. Of course,
that itself may not be a useful exercise. In the context of doing that
exercise, assuming there was good justification for it, that knowledge
would be naturally learned. Natural learning of factual knowledge,
learning it when it comes up, is fine, as long as it isn’t being learned so
that it can be tested. It is much more useful to learn knowledge when
that knowledge enables you to do something, however.
There are endless books about what every 3rd-grader must
know that use the idea that factual knowledge is the basis of
the ability to read as their justification. Unfortunately, the writers
of these tracts have misunderstood the cognitive science behind
those statements. It is difficult to read things when you don’t understand
what they are about. But it does not follow from that,
that the solution is to ram that knowledge down kids’ throats and
then have them read. It is much more clever to have them read
about what they know and to gradually increase their knowledge
through stories that cause them to have to learn more in order to
make the stories understandable to them. In that case, the learning
is in context and thus more natural.
How Not to Teach 177
Rule #3: Teach practice first, theory and facts second (if you
must teach theory and facts at all). It is the rare course that starts
with, let’s build this now. Courses that start like that usually hold the
students’ interest, however.
Now let’s move on to the next mistake.
Mistake #4: Thinking that students are not worried about the
purpose of what they are being taught
When students ask what use algebra will be to them, they are told
they will need it later. They are told this about any number of subjects
that they are forced to learn in high school. The problem is that subject-based
education is never about the potential use of those subjects.
Those were the subjects at Harvard in 1892; that is the only answer
that is true about why students are being forced to learn them. No one
gives that answer. In fact, very few seem to know that answer.
Students have the right to know why they are learning something.
“You will need it later,” is usually a lie, so we need to stop telling them
that. And, we need to think about what real reasons there are to learn
something. If we cannot find those reasons, we really shouldn’t be
teaching the subject. But, of course, I don’t think we should be teaching
subjects at all, so my view on this should come as no surprise.
Rule #4: Don’t teach anything unless you can easily explain the
use of learning it.
Let’s look at the next mistake.
Mistake #5: Thinking that studying can replace repeated practice
as a key learning technique
Practice makes sense. When studying and homework mean practice,
then they are good things. But rarely is that their intent. Unless,
of course, we are talking about practicing test taking, which makes
sense only if good test scores are the goal. I realize that good test scores
are, these days, the goal in our society, as one would expect in any
subject-based education system.
So here is rule #5:
178 Teaching Minds
Rule #5: No homework unless that homework is to produce
something.
Now let’s have a look at mistake #6.
Mistake #6: Thinking that because students have chosen to take
your course, they have an interest in learning what you plan to
teach them
Professors who typically teach courses that students have chosen
voluntarily to take generally are under the illusion that students have
come to the course hoping to learn what they intend to teach. Nothing
could be further from the truth. Unless you are teaching human
sexuality or how to get a job, or abnormal psychology, you generally
can expect that students have very little interest in the content you
are about to share and a great interest in the grade you eventually are
going to give them. The reason for this is simple enough. Professors
are teaching a subject.
Subject, in the university world, is a euphemism for profession.
The profession of English professors is something other than teaching
English—it is being a professional in some subspecialty in literature
or some allied field. Similarly, a professor of psychology has an area of
research within psychology that is his real profession. When a professor
teaches, he is teaching how things work in his profession and he
is teaching the basics of being in that profession. The percentage of
undergraduates in a class that actually want to enter the profession
of the professors is very small. Most have no intention whatsoever of
entering the profession of the professors. So, they recognize instantly
that what they are learning is very unlikely to be of use to them in
their later lives. Some take it seriously anyway and some don’t. But for
the most part students really aren’t much interested in what a professor
is teaching.
They don’t listen and they don’t do what you ask them to do. Why
not? They may be lazy, but that isn’t the real reason. It may be true
that they are taking four other classes, but that also isn’t the real reason.
The real reason has to do with the inherent value of work, which
is one of the real issues in the transformation from subject-based education
to cognitive process-based education. Students can feel, rightly,
that they have read enough Dickens or have solved enough equations
How Not to Teach 179
to satisfy the teacher or at least to satisfy their own needs in these
areas. The problem is, as I stated originally, that learning starts with a
goal and that the students’ goals may not be the same as the teacher’s
goals. Since the students have no Dickens-related goal, and actually
have a teacher satisfaction goal, they simply have misestimated what
will satisfy the teacher.
Now let’s consider real goals. Students do not stop driving a car
because they are tired even though they haven’t arrived where they
are going. They do not fail to ask out Mary Lou on a date because
they got bored talking mid-sentence. They do not give up on hitting
a baseball mid-swing or midway through the game. People put in the
effort required when they are working on truly held goals. Subjectbased
goals are almost never truly held. But cognitive process goals
are nearly always truly held if the student is working on real things. If
school wants to deal with artificial things (flying an air flight simulator
instead of a real plane, for example, in order to learn to fly), then
those artificial things need to feel very real and be very motivating.
Rule #6: Try teaching students things they actually may need to
know after they leave school.
Here is mistake #7.
Mistake# 7: Correcting a student who is doing something wrong
by telling him what to do instead
This one seems really weird. Wouldn’t you tell someone to do
things differently or what went wrong when you see them making
a mistake? Most of us would because this seems a reasonable thing
to do. It just isn’t a reasonable thing for a teacher to do. A teacher
needs to help a student think about what went wrong as opposed to
telling him what went wrong and how to fix it. What do you think
happened? Why did it happen, do you suppose? What could you have
done differently?
Why does this matter? It matters because self-generated explanations
are remembered more easily than explanations that we are told.
It actually is quite difficult to remember anything you have been told.
It is much easier to remember what you yourself have thought up,
in part because you probably spent some time doing it, considered
180 Teaching Minds
alternatives, and finally decided on an explanation, and then perhaps
you tested that explanation another time. A self-generated explanation
is a hypothesis, and hypotheses that we have come up with ourselves
serve as the basis for learning. We tend to remember what we
ourselves have said and thought more than we remember the words
of others.
Rule #7: Help students come up with their own explanations
when they have made a mistake.
Here is the next one.
Mistake #8: Thinking that a student remembers what you just
taught him
I can’t tell you how many times I have said X in a lecture or discussion
only to be asked why I believed not X. Why does this happen?
People really don’t listen. They are not being annoying. They really
can’t easily listen. There is so much going on in their own heads while
you are talking that it is remarkable they hear anything of what anyone
says to them. Teachers live in a world where students are worried
about the perceptions of their friends, events at home, and a million
other things that have nothing to do with what a teacher is saying. A
teacher simply cannot assume that a student will remember what he
was just told. In any case, a teacher shouldn’t necessarily be telling
students the truth.
How could telling a student the truth be a bad idea? When telling
is about facts, it is certainly a fine idea. But remember, I do not
think that it is the job of a teacher to tell students facts. A teacher’s
primary responsibility is to get students to understand the world better
and to help enhance their capabilities. Neither of these things happens
through a teacher telling a student anything. Comprehension is
an internal affair, arrived at by thinking. Ability comes from practice.
Neither comes from a teacher. What a teacher can do is to encourage
students to take on more and thus enhance their capabilities, or think
more and thus enhance their comprehension. This means that telling
a student a fact that he needs just makes it all too simple. Figuring out
what you need is the real issue. Confirming what a student has discovered
is a fine idea, but even that isn’t always a matter of telling the
student the truth. A Socratic teacher might deny what he knows is true
How Not to Teach 181
in order for a student to defend a point of view and learn to be convincing.
A teacher might fail to praise a student, even when she has
succeeded, because the student should know that she has succeeded in
any case. I am not suggesting that teachers never tell the truth, only
that it isn’t necessary to do it all the time.
Since coming to one’s own conclusions is mostly how we learn,
the real job of a teacher is to force students to come to sensible conclusions
by confronting what they already believe with stuff that is
antithetical to those beliefs. A confused person has only two choices.
Admit he is confused and doesn’t care, or resolve the confusion. Resolving
the confusion entails thinking. Teachers can encourage thinking
by making sure students have something confusing to think about.
Rule #8: Never assume that a student is listening to what you are
saying or that what you are saying really matters.
What I have been arguing so far amounts to defining what I
call Socratic apprenticeship. Learning by doing is facilitated by a good
teacher, but that teacher has to be around when needed and has to
know what to say and what not to say that will help the student think
harder. The teacher doesn’t provide answers—he just helps students
find out where to look for answers and how to know whether they
found the answers. Our current education system does not encourage
teaching and learning to work this way, and I assume neither did the
system that Plato was criticizing when he started to talk about learning
by doing and Socratic teaching in the first place.
But something important has changed. We can now create apprenticeships
online. It is possible to learn by doing in a simulated
world set up on the computer that provides for human help as needed.
We have been building what we call story-centered curricula for about
10 years now. Students learn within the context of an intense yearlong
experience where they do only projects and produce deliverables
that are commented on and improved upon by interaction with a Socratic
teacher. We have produced them for masters programs at various
universities, for high school programs intended to replace what
is there now, and for corporations when they wish to create really
effective training.
These curricula change how we learn and how we teach. Both of
these need to be reconsidered in the wake of the disaster of an education
system that we have created.
182 Teaching Minds
In summary, a good teacher does the following:
• never tells a student anything that the teacher thinks is
true
• never allows himself to be the ultimate judge of his own
students’ success
• teaches practice first, theory second (if he must teach
theory at all)
• does not come up with lists of knowledge that every
student must know
• doesn’t teach anything unless he can easily explain the
use of learning it
• assigns no homework unless that homework is to
produce something
• groups students according to their interests and abilities,
not their ages
• ensures that any reward to a student is intrinsic
• teaches students things they actually may need to know
after they leave school
• helps students come up with their own explanations
when they have made a mistake
• never assumes that a student is listening to what he is
saying
• never assumes that students will do what he asked them
to do if what he asked does not relate to a goal they truly
hold
• never allows “pleasing the teacher” to be the goal of the
student
• understands that students won’t do what he tells them if
they don’t
• understand what is being asked of them
• earns the respect of students by demonstrating abilities
• motivates students to do better and does not help them
to do better
• understands that his job is to get students to do
something
• understands that experience, not teachers, changes belief
systems
• confuses students
• does not expect credit for good teaching
CHAPTER 13
How the Best Universities
Inadvertently Ruin Our Schools
We have met the enemy, and he is us.
—Walt Kelly
It should come as no surprise to readers of this book that I never really
liked school. I endured it. I didn’t have the option to quit—an
unthinkable idea in my household. In the end I even wound up with
a Yale degree (all right, an honorary one—but it is printed in Latin).
Truth be told, I did get a real Ph.D., but that was more a testament to
my figuring out how to work the system while avoiding the draft, than
it was a testament to my scholarship or academic prowess.
I became a professor, an unlikely job for someone who hated
school, and I became an unlikely colleague who worked with people
who, by and large, loved school. I spent 35 years of my life as a professor
at the best universities in America, and still I hated school.
Somewhere in the middle of my academic career, about the time
that my kids went to school, I began to think about how learning
worked. (I was trying to develop computers that learned.) Since my
kids also hated school, I began to wonder about why school was the
way it was and why it really had so little to do with learning as I understood
it.
Eventually I realized that I was part of the problem. I readily had
found employment in a world that let me think about interesting
problems all day and work with really smart graduate students. To
pay for this life of the mind, I was required to teach every now and
then. I never really liked teaching for exactly the same reason I didn’t
like being on the other side of the classroom. I didn’t get the point.
I talked. Students listened or at least faked listening, and then there
were grades to be given out based on how well they actually had been
listening. I didn’t like this game any more as a teacher than I had
183
184 Teaching Minds
liked it as a student. Who said that listening to what I happened to be
talking about was an important thing to do? And, who said students
should be graded on how well they had listened to whatever truth I
was espousing? What if I was saying nonsense? I didn’t think I possessed
a direct line to the truth any more than I had thought that my
own teachers did. The system didn’t make sense to me as a student
and it didn’t as a professor.
But it was a very easy job. And the pay, despite what people think
about professors’ salaries, was pretty good.
How hard was this teaching obligation? At Northwestern I was
required to teach one 3-hour- a-week course for 1 quarter every other
year. This came to about 36 hours of work in 2 years.
Yes, really.
So, how was I part of the problem? Actually my light teaching obligation
is the tip of the iceberg of an enormous problem. It brings up
the question of how and why that light load works for a university, the
answer to which sheds light on what is wrong with our school system.
How do the economics of a university work such that a professor
can teach so little? That is an important question. But an equally
important question is how it is that a professor, who is after all, in the
mind of the public at least, a teacher, teaches so little and is happy
about it?
People used to ask me, when I said that I was a professor, what
I taught. I would always laugh. I would suggest that they ask me instead
what I was a professor of, which was, of course, the only relevant
question. I didn’t teach much and when I did teach, I hardly taught
computer science, which was actually what I was a professor of. I usually
taught my view of how the mind worked. Sometimes I taught how
education needed to be fixed. But, anyhow, as I have said, there wasn’t
all that much teaching going on in my life. Sometimes I taught more
often than required of me, simply because I was feeling guilty. The
rules said I didn’t have to teach much but there were students, usually
graduate students, who were thinking that as they had attended this
university in part to interact with me, at least I should teach a course
that included them at least once. So I did it because I felt guilty, not
because anyone higher up in the university cared what I did.
I remember a Yale undergraduate who wanted an appointment
with me. He was screaming in the halls, after he had been told that he
could see a graduate assistant instead of me, that he had paid $20,000
How the Best Universities Inadvertently Ruin Our Schools 185
a year (or whatever the tuition was at that time) to attend Yale and he
damn well was going to see me. I did in fact see him because he had
a point.
Professors are hard to find. There are many reasons for this. The
first is that if no one makes them see undergraduates, so why should
they? The second is that from long experience most professors have
come to understand that when an undergraduate wants to see them,
there typically is one of two motives. Either the student wants to argue
about a grade he or she received, or wants to engage the professor in
a conversation whose point is that the undergraduate is really a great
guy or gal and will be counting on a recommendation down the road.
Neither of these conversations is any too fascinating to professors so
they usually make themselves hard to find.
The funny part of this story is that the student who was making
the fuss had neither of those issues. He was exactly the sort of student
professors very much want to see. He wanted to become a professor in
my field. This is exactly who a professor wants to meet with. The conversation
with him didn’t start out about that exactly, but it was easy
to see that he had real issues he wanted to talk about, science issues,
the kind professors wish were on the mind of every undergraduate but
rarely are. This student did in fact become a professor, the ultimate success
story for the professor who guided him there. And, no surprise, he
treats undergraduates who want to see him the same way I treated him.
There is a naïve conception on the part of students in a top university
that their needs matter to the professors of that university. But the
top universities are not structured in such a way as to reward professors
who care deeply about students. If a young assistant professor spends
too much time with undergraduates, there usually will be some wiser
head who will counsel him against this behavior. Assistant professors
must be concerned with getting tenure. Having the students like you
has next to nothing to do with tenure at the top universities.
No one higher up in the administration of the university cared
much about how much I taught. “Why not?” you wonder. To answer
this, one has to understand how universities really work, why they
work that way, what game they are playing, and who wins and who
loses. The answers to these questions, well known by anyone in a top
university, are, somehow, completely unknown to the general public.
Outsiders don’t ask how Yale works. They ask how they can get their
kids into Yale. And therein lies the problem.
186 Teaching Minds
As long as the customers keep coming, as long as people will do
anything to get their kids into Yale, Yale will not have to change. Now
bear in mind that going to Yale isn’t such a bad experience. This is
not my point. But Yale’s attitude (and every other top university’s attitude)
toward what those universities are inherently about is seriously
harming the education of every high school student and almost every
college student in the country. Yale doesn’t know that it is doing this.
The faculty of Yale didn’t wake up one morning and think that
destroying the American education system would be a good idea. They
never think that subject-based education is a bad thing. They are professors
of subjects, after all. It makes sense to them.
Most of the Yale faculty doesn’t think for even a minute about
the U.S. high school system, or the community college system, or the
thousands of other colleges in the United States. Yale professors are
thinking about their research, ideas, and projects. Yale administrators
are thinking about making Yale work better and about money and
prestige issues. They are not thinking that the subject-based education
that is the basis of the university structure has filtered down to high
school for no good reason. They think that there is a good reason: to
prepare high school students for college, namely to make the professors’
lives easier when the students arrive at college.
They do not know they are killing education with their subject orientation.
But they are, just as surely as if they had a plan to do so and
were working on it on a daily basis. And, the parents who just must
send their kids to Yale are regularly giving them the power to continue
doing just that.
People who do not live and work within the confines of a great
university imagine that professors are basically teachers, like high
school teachers but more intellectual. They do not understand the collective
mindset at a place like Yale, a mindset that the Yale faculty, for
the most part, is perfectly happy with. They do not understand why
asking what I taught was a funny question. They do not readily get, if
teaching isn’t a professor’s main concern, what exactly his concerns
would be.
To explain all this requires looking at the life of a typical Yale faculty
member and beginning to understand the world in which he
lives. We must begin by understanding the aims of the university itself.
Universities are employers, after all, and professors, like any other
employee, worry about what their boss thinks of them. Curiously,
How the Best Universities Inadvertently Ruin Our Schools 187
however, professors don’t really have bosses in the traditional sense. I
remember the provost of a top university complaining to me that with
professors everything is a la carte. The provost is the guy who runs the
university. What he meant was that he could not ask any professor to
do anything without the professor asking what he would get in return.
The traditional sense of boss is gone, of course, when the boss can’t
fire you.
The real bosses in the university system are your colleagues.
Huh?
Your colleagues can’t fire you. But this is what they can do. In
order to hire a new senior faculty member at Yale, we actually had
to write letters, at the beginning of the process, to all the important
faculty members around the world in the subspecialty in which we
wanted to hire, asking them to rank the top ten people in the world in
that subspecialty. If the person we wanted was not on that top ten list,
we would not be able to hire them without proving why we couldn’t
get one of the people in the top ten and why we so desperately needed
someone who clearly wasn’t that good.
Top universities are caught up in a game they can’t get out of that
has two very bad results. The game is the superstar-prestige game. Top
universities want to be number one. They want this very badly. University
administrators worry about this on a daily basis. All hirings
revolve around this issue. All professors worry about their status in the
academic world at large. It is the coin of the realm in academia.
Although it does not obviously follow from this, one effect of
this game is less than stellar education for undergraduates. And, incidentally,
this game also has a disastrous effect on the nation’s high
schools. This is not at all obvious to professors and to the universities
for whom they work. To understand this, we need to first see what
professors do and how they think about what they do.
I will start by telling a story about someone I barely know. He is a
professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Washington,
which is in the top tier of state universities. I met him because I was
working on creating a high school aerospace curriculum that I hope
one day will replace some of what is now in high school for those interested
in engineering. I asked Boeing to host a meeting to design this
curriculum and they agreed. They invited some of their engineers as
well as this professor, I brought some of my people, and we began to
design a series of projects that would take students with no knowledge
188 Teaching Minds
of engineering and after a year allow them to work on designing a
787. Such a project-based, real-world curriculum is, in my mind, an
important improvement on the way things are done now in school.
At the very beginning of the meeting, this professor said that he
hoped the outcome of this high school curriculum redesign meeting
would be a curriculum that taught math and science better because
the average student at the University of Washington that he encountered
had very weak math and science skills.
This was not my intent at all and I told him so. I was hoping to
allow high school students to have a year-long experience of actually
doing engineering so they could decide whether that interested them
or at least make use of some of what they learned in their later lives.
As far as I’m concerned, there is too much math and science in high
school now and I told him so.
Since no one ever says things like that, he was quite shocked. I
asked him, since he thought entering college students who wished
to study aerospace were deficient in math and science, why he didn’t
think it was his obligation to teach it to them? He replied that this was
the duty of the high schools. His position then was that even though
less than 1% of college students would study aerospace engineering,
nevertheless every student in the country should be made to learn
the math and science they might need just in case they might study
aerospace engineering.
Of course, this is hardly a unique position. In fact, this stance is
exactly the one in place in high schools today. Just in case you some
day might need it, we will teach it to you.
What is the reasoning behind this point of view?
What is really going on here relates strongly to the teaching
requirement issue I mentioned earlier. I had a light teaching load. This
man certainly teaches more often than I did. To see what his load was,
I looked him up on the web. Here are the courses he was teaching in
2007–08 as I wrote this:
• A A 430 Finite Element Structural Analysis
• A A 432 Composite Materials for Aerospace Structures
• A A 532 Mechanics of Composite Materials
I had guessed what kinds of courses he taught before looking him up.
The man is about my age, which means he has seniority, and he is
How the Best Universities Inadvertently Ruin Our Schools 189
obviously respected by Boeing, so he is a senior and successful man
in his field. This means a small teaching load since the best professors
teach the least. Three semester-long courses in a year is a light load at
a big state university.
You might wonder, as an outsider to the ins and outs of the university,
why the best professors teach the least. You also might wonder
why I knew the types of courses he would teach and what I mean by
that. I will explain.
To start this explanation, it is important to understand why professors
are “rewarded” with light teaching loads. (Note the word load.
This is the normal way this is discussed in a university.) I was given
an extraordinarily light load at Northwestern for two reasons. One
reason was that universities, like baseball teams, recruit so-called “superstars”
(yes, that is how they are referred to in the university) from
competitors. So Northwestern had to beat Yale’s offer in my case. At
Yale I taught one semester-long course per year, so Northwestern simply
made me a better offer.
The reason both of these universities would even consider such a
light load is that I earned money for the university. As I used to tell
my children when they asked “why” questions, in the end it is usually
about money.
I was recruited by Northwestern (in 1988), but I was really being
recruited by Andersen Consulting. They offered Northwestern (that is,
they offered me if I came to Northwestern) $30 million (over a 10-year
period). Yes, that’s right, $30 million. I think you can see that Northwestern
didn’t really care what I taught or when I taught it. They
wanted that money. And, they also wanted the prestige.
Before I go too much further, I need to explain the prestige thing
because it is very important. In fact, the prestige issue for professors
and universities is precisely the root of the problem in our education
system. This will take some time to explain, so let me start simply for
now.
When Harvard plays Yale in football, they are battling for prestige.
But the battle may not be on the field exactly. The real battle is in
how powerful and important the alumni who attend the game have
become and how big their respective endowments have become and
who has the best chemistry department or business school. It is a real
battle. The battle is for reputation. And, although it may seem silly to
take this battle seriously, it is taken very seriously. There is no World
190 Teaching Minds
Series that determines the winner. The real determination is made by
newspapers, or parents who want their kids to apply there, or potential
donors. But the battle is real enough.
This battle was dead serious before U.S. News and World Report
started publishing annual rankings. Now, it is the basis of how the
university functions. When the current president was recruited at
Northwestern, he essentially was told that his job was to get Northwestern
into the top ten (in the U.S. News rankings). Northwestern was
ranked 12th or 13th at this time. In his first year he succeeded. Why?
Because Northwestern’s football team won the Big Ten title and went
to the Rose Bowl. Of course, he had nothing to do with that. But the
following year applications doubled (or something like that) and that
is a statistic that U.S. News uses, so presto, we were number nine. It
didn’t last. Neither did it make sense.
Recruiting me was like winning the Rose Bowl. Well, all right, not
really. But a member of the Board of Trustees actually did say to me
when he met me: “It’s our star quarterback.” I brought in money and
prestige. It is natural to wonder who actually got the money that Andersen
offered and what was done with it and why it was given out,
and, while we are at it, what exactly it was I did all day if I didn’t teach.
First the university’s share. Every dollar of that $30 million went
into Northwestern’s bank account. Then they let me spend it according
to certain rules. The first rule is called “overhead.” The university
charges an overhead rate on all contracts. The actual percentage varies
and one of the first things I had to negotiate with Northwestern was
how much their take would be. I don’t remember exactly now, but
they got about 30% of what I brought in. So, about $9 million of this
money went into Northwestern’s pocket. Do you see now why they
didn’t care how much I taught? They just wanted me there and they
wanted that money. By the way, they also got the interest on all the
money.
They also got the prestige. I set up a new institute that became instantly
well known and was something the university could brag about.
The Institute for the Learning Sciences was something unique. Northwestern
had one and no one else did. Moreover, I might (and did) raise
even more money for my institute. More overhead money. Yippee!
What did I do with the money? Mostly what you can do with
this money is hire people. If you have a research agenda, something
you want to build or accomplish, you will need help. If you want to
build a rocket ship that no one has ever built before, you will need to
How the Best Universities Inadvertently Ruin Our Schools 191
hire folks who can contribute. I was trying to build educational software
but the principle was the same. I hired programmers, researchers,
assistants to do lower level work, video staff, artists, and, of course,
graduate students.
And, now you know what I did all day. I managed this enterprise.
Eventually my institute had 200 people working in it. I did what any
person in charge of 200 people does. I set the direction and checked
on progress. Also, I wrote books and thought deep thoughts. This is
what any professor does who brings in grant money. I was just doing
it on a larger scale than most.
All of this is about winning the prestige game. Any university
wants pre-eminent professors. Universities want the best faculty so
their name is mentioned a lot, so they get applications from students,
attention from the media, and more grant money. That is what universities
do. Teaching? Well, how exactly does teaching fit in with all
that?
It really doesn’t. Most professors agree that the university is a lot
nicer place when there aren’t all those undergraduates around. From
May to September New Haven was an idyllic place. Smart people, good
weather, interesting conversation. Then in September, thousands of
young people, making a racket and expecting to be taught. But, therein
lies the problem. Are students really expecting to be taught?
It doesn’t take very long for a professor to learn that those brilliant
Yale students, the ones who killed themselves to get into the place, may
not be there solely to enter into the life of the mind. While everyone
is thinking great thoughts and doing great research over the summer,
professors manage to get themselves believing that the job of a professor
at a great university is to be an intellectual. What they forget easily
enough is who is paying the bills. And, they forget the real agenda of
those who are paying the bills. They are reminded soon enough.
Students want courses to be easy, not bother them too much with
work outside the classroom, and help them get a good job. Of course,
I am oversimplifying here. Many students attend Yale to learn what it
is that you, the professor, really know and want to teach. In 15 years
at Yale I met a number of them. I remember their names because there
weren’t that many. We can hope that all professors have met their
share of that type of student.
Most college students are 18-year-olds who are on their own for
the first time. They are more interested in exploring themselves and
their new freedoms than they are in working hard at intellectual
192 Teaching Minds
pursuits. Every university has underground lists, written by students,
about courses that are easy or professors who readily give good grades.
The real agenda of the majority of students is to take school just seriously
enough to graduate. If you offered them a diploma after 1 year,
most of them would take the deal.
This all brings me back to our aerospace friend. Why does he want
high schools to teach more math? Because he doesn’t want to teach it.
Teaching undergraduates becomes pleasurable at precisely the point
where you can teach the very courses this man teaches. He is teaching
highly technical courses, and, it is safe to assume, the students
who are taking those courses are there with serious intentions. They
want to become engineers and they want to know what he knows. So
he may well enjoy teaching them. But he certainly would not enjoy
teaching them calculus. There is a big difference in the experience of
teaching when you are teaching people who plan on working in your
field some day and when you are teaching a required course that students
wish they weren’t being made to take.
But why does it matter what this man enjoys teaching?
In the ideal university, the one professors at top-tier universities
would have if it were possible, professors, who consider themselves
primarily to be researchers in very specialized subfields, would teach
only work that directly related to their actual research or was important
for preparing future researchers in their field.
Professors at Yale get to be professors at Yale because they are either
potentially or actually the best in the world at something. While this
might not actually be true, it is certainly supposed to be true. When
a professor is proposed to be promoted (or hired for the first time) as
a full professor at Yale, the chair of his department must address a
meeting of all the other chairs and high officials and explain why the
professor in question is indeed the best in the world at what he does.
To do this, the chairs often have to define what he does extremely
narrowly to have it be at all credible. Isn’t there someone at Stanford
or Princeton who is just as good or, perish the thought, even better
than the candidate you propose? There better not be or this candidate
won’t get voted in. So, somewhere in every professor’s mind is the idea
that he or she is the best at something or for assistant professors, soon
will become the best at something.
Under this kind of pressure, and this kind of egotism, a professor’s
first and foremost concern is attaining and maintaining that exalted
How the Best Universities Inadvertently Ruin Our Schools 193
status. Teaching future professors in one’s own field helps maintain
that status, so graduate students pursuing Ph.D.s are quite often taken
very seriously. Teaching graduate seminars is intellectually stimulating,
may help with one’s own research, and is therefore worthwhile
to do. But undergraduates are a whole different story. Very small percentages
of them actually will become researchers in one’s field. Professors
are in the fame game. They worry about the prestige of their
department and themselves. They care about this because they won’t
attract high-quality Ph.D. students unless they maintain that prestige.
Undergraduates do not figure into this equation. Except they do pay
the bills.
So professors have to teach them. And, someone has to teach those
damn introductory courses that typically have hundreds of students
in them. Why do they have hundreds of students in them? Because
no one wants to teach them so making the sections as large as possible
means fewer professors will have to teach them. And, why does our
aerospace guy want high school to teach the math his students need?
Because he certainly doesn’t want to do it. He wants to teach esoteric
courses about composites, which is his field. Teaching basic math
would be worse than teaching Introduction to Aerospace. A great deal
of work and no enhancement to prestige at all. And, there is a bigger
problem. He can’t teach math because the structure of the university
doesn’t allow it.
Math is taught by the math department. If everyone had to learn
math, there would have to be an awful lot of math professors. While
that sounds OK, it really isn’t possible. Remember, at top universities
everyone has to be a superstar or close. Math isn’t that hot of a
field. There aren’t large numbers of people wanting to become math
professors, nor is there a great deal of funding for math research. Remember,
without outside funding as a possibility, a top university isn’t
going to want to create a big department. You get big departments,
and lots of professors, only in fields that pay for themselves through
outside funding. So math has to stay small. Solution—make sure math
is taught in high school.
This solution makes everyone in the university happy. And, it
shouldn’t be a big surprise that the original idea of requiring algebra
of high school students came from the president of Harvard and
the chairman of the Princeton Math Department (in 1892). It has always
been in the university’s interest to push teaching the basics that
194 Teaching Minds
are needed in college into the hands of the high schools so that the
university professor’s life is easier and involves less teaching that he
doesn’t want to do.
So, of course, professors want high schools to do a better job. The
question is why high schools should care about what universities want
at all. High schools have their own problems, or should have, but they
have been convinced to ignore their problems and focus on the problems
that universities have.
Parents demand that high schools prepare their kids for college,
which really means help them get into college. Gradually the high
school curriculum has become one giant entrance test for college. The
idea that someone might not want to go to college seems very odd to
most people. So, if the colleges say more math, then more math it is.
But colleges are not saying more math in good faith. They are just having
high schools teach what they don’t want to teach.
But there are about 3,000 colleges in the United States and only
about 50 top-tier research universities. What Yale needs may not be
what the other colleges need. Why, then, is the tail wagging the dog?
Yale says jump and everybody asks how high. Yale sets the rules. Yale
says 3 years of math, and 3 years of math it is, even though higher
math will not, or at least should not, come up in most college classes.
Does Yale know it is doing this? Do the faculty understand that
by requiring that the high schools teach mathematics, they are causing
massive numbers of dropouts and making learning a very stressful
experience for most high school students?
I think the answer is no, but even if they did know it, they would
do nothing about it. They have a university to run and they simply
cannot change the way they operate. I can explain this with a story,
this time from Columbia University.
I once had the opportunity to create courses for Columbia University
that would be put online through a business I started that
was funded (and then abruptly terminated when the dot com boom
busted) by venture capitalists. I interviewed various professors at Columbia
in order to decide which courses to put online. I wasn’t trying
to simply copy the courses they had but was trying to build learn-bydoing
versions of them that would be more engaging than the usual
lecture course and would try to teach real-world skills rather than the
usual stuff one gets in an introductory course.
We decided to build an economics course and talked at length with
the chairman of the Economics Department. We decided to simulate
How the Best Universities Inadvertently Ruin Our Schools 195
the experience that this man had had working as an economic advisor
in the White House. The students played that role in the simulation
and learned how economics is used in the real world.
All of this is really beside the point, however. I learned, during
these conversations, that at Columbia calculus is required in order to
be an economics major. I wondered about this, since the courses we
were building never had any complicated math in them, so it seemed
that calculus wasn’t something that came up regularly in real-world
economics.
I asked and was told that my observation was right and that calculus
was required in order to ensure that there wouldn’t be too many
economics majors. As an insider in the university world, I understood
this remark, but it needs some explaining for outsiders.
Columbia doesn’t have an undergraduate business major. And, in
New York City there are a lot of students interested in business. Columbia
and other Ivy League schools think that business isn’t an academic
subject, so students shouldn’t learn it until they go to graduate school.
Columbia does have a well-respected business school, but, as I pointed
out, no one really wants to teach undergraduates so they certainly
aren’t lobbying to teach them. (This is also true of medical schools and
law schools and it is why you never see courses for undergraduates in
those fields despite the evident interest of the undergraduates.)
So, potential businesspeople at Columbia need to major in something
and economics seems to them to be a reasonable second choice.
(I am not really sure that it is a good choice but these are 18-year-olds
making these decisions.) Thus, the Economics Department is flooded
with potential majors. This seems like it would be a good thing,
doesn’t it? Students want to study what you teach. Isn’t that good?
Well, not really.
Let us assume we have an economics faculty of 20 people, each of
whom teaches three courses a year. So we can offer 60 courses. Sounds
like a good number. But this has to include graduate seminars, and
the faculty will be lobbying to have more of these and more advanced
courses where they can teach their own specialty, as I have said. But
majors need courses too. They might need 20 or more. This doesn’t
leave a lot for introductory courses unless the department runs enormous
lecture courses that have hundreds of students. Now departments
know that such courses are pretty awful things and they try to
keep them down to a dull roar. But if you have hundreds of students
wanting to take your courses, and you were set up with just enough
196 Teaching Minds
faculty to handle 60 courses with fewer than 20 students in each class,
you have a problem. Multiple sections of courses require multiple faculty
and maybe even, God forbid, heavier teaching loads.
Simply put, if there are too many majors, all the specialty courses
will overflow and you might need twice the faculty to handle them.
The university is not going to let you hire twice the faculty in order to
handle them. Why not?
Tenure is why not. Once you hire tenured faculty, they stay forever.
Tenure is another one of those ideas that sounds a lot better than
it is. One of its downsides, and it has many, is that you can’t easily
hire new faculty when you need to. There may be a jump in economics
majors this year, but who is to say that this will be true next year?
Universities move slowly.
So, the current economics faculty would have to teach more courses.
They simply do not want to do that. They want to go back to their
offices and do research and write books and consult with the government
or big business, should they call.
Voila!
Calculus.
That will keep the little buggers out. If that doesn’t work, advanced
calculus. Who cares if those courses have little relevance for economics?
They can always say it might come up some day. (It might.) Or
they can say it teaches rigorous thinking. The real reason is to keep the
numbers down. This is also why biology and chemistry are required
courses for pre-med students, why statistics is required for psychology
majors, and so on. Most departments will not admit to this, but that’s
why those things are there.
You never see this kind of thing in departments that have too few
students. Too few students is the kind of problem that gets your department
shut down. So, linguistics departments, which were started
when linguistics was in fashion in the 1960s, are always under threat
of shut down. They won’t be requiring calculus. But they would if
their situation changed. Instead, what they are doing is trying to explain
why linguistics is calculus.
Huh?
When I arrived at Northwestern, undergraduates were required to
take a math course in order to graduate. There could have been any
number of reasons for this requirement—none of them having to do
with interests or needs of the undergraduates.
How the Best Universities Inadvertently Ruin Our Schools 197
In fact, diverting from that story for a moment, my secretary, who
never went to college, insisted that her daughters go, so one of them
found herself in an art history course that she hated and complained
to her mother who in turn complained to me. Why does she have to
take art history? She is a business major (at Hofstra), for God’s sake,
said my secretary.
Obviously, I replied, there are art history professors who are worried
that no one will take their course and they will be fired (tenure
doesn’t apply in that case as tenured faculty can be fired if their department
is shut down), so they have lobbied successfully to require it.
She thought that was stupid and so do I. Now back to Northwestern.
Clearly the mathematics professors at Northwestern were similarly
concerned. Of course, they made their argument, the same way
the Hofstra art history professors did, one would assume, about these
courses being necessary for a liberal education, but the real argument
was about saving the department and everyone knew it.
But at Northwestern, this math argument had been made a long
time ago. What was new was that linguistics, at Northwestern, had
been classified as a math course! The reasons are clear enough. No one
was taking linguistics at Northwestern and the linguists were scared.
How they won the argument that linguistics was math (and thus an
alternative to the required math course) is anybody’s guess. Just remember
that none of this is being done with the interests of the students
as the real agenda item.
If you believe, as universities do, that the most important thing
you can do as an administrator is recruit superstars to make your university
great, then there is a consequence to all this. The students suffer.
At first this seems an odd idea. How could a student be harmed by
recruiting a superstar? Well, it depends on the university.
At MIT, where students are different than they are at Northwestern
by quite a bit, there are a number of superstars that I know quite well.
Two of them, whom I will not name but are about as famous as a professor
can be, are people I have heard lecture many times. I have never
understood what they were talking about in any of those lectures. Now,
bear in mind that I know their fields very well so I should have been
able to understand them. Also, bear in mind that I was a terrible student,
which means my attention fades fast when I am bored or irritated.
Since I know these two men well enough, I can tell you that neither
is particularly worried about being understood. They have been
198 Teaching Minds
acclaimed by one and all to be brilliant, and many brilliant people
think that if you can’t understand what they are thinking about, then
it is your fault not theirs. They are talking about complex issues that
interest them, and you should be able to follow along, and if you can’t
then you are a dope.
This works at MIT, sort of. No MIT student happily admits to not
understanding what the professor is saying. They all muddle through
as best they can and are usually awestruck by even being in the presence
of these great men, much less being able to take a course from
them. Understanding what they said, or, worse, actually being able
to make use of what they said, seems unimportant by comparison.
You would take a course given by Einstein, wouldn’t you, even if you
didn’t understand physics? That is the attitude.
This attitude works at MIT. But it fails miserably at lesser schools.
I took advanced calculus from a superstar when I was an undergraduate.
I didn’t understand anything. I was a math major, but that
course caused me to lose interest in math and start thinking about
other things. I went to see this superstar and asked him for advice. We
had a great conversation. He was a very smart guy. He pointed me in
a direction that helped me make some important decisions. As a oneon-one
advisor he was great. But the system made him teach, which
really wasn’t something he could do very well.
As luck would have it, years later when I was chairman of the
Computer Science Department at Yale, he was one of my faculty. So,
in a sense he wound up working for me (to the extent that any faculty
member actually works for the chair, which is really not the case).
He was a great man. He inspired many a graduate student to become
a professor. He was fun to talk to. But he couldn’t teach at all.
At Yale we made sure that he taught only specialty courses, which was
fine with him. What he was doing teaching advanced calculus that year
long ago is anybody’s guess. My guess is that as he was the chairman of
the Math Department at the time, either he got stuck with it because
there was nobody else or he was trying to prove a point in order to induce
senior faculty to come down from on high and teach the basics.
Either way it was a terrible idea.
Prestigious universities that recruit superstars are not, at the same
time, recruiting teachers. They are just hoping someone can and will
teach. But no one cares that much.
I once had dinner with a man who was on the Board of Trustees of
the University of Illinois. I asked him how he liked being on the board
How the Best Universities Inadvertently Ruin Our Schools 199
of a fraudulent institution. He reacted the way you might expect and
demanded an explanation. I asked him if he thought the average student
attending the University of Illinois was going there because she
figured after graduation she would be able to get a job.
He agreed.
I then asked whether job skills were in fact taught to the majority
of students there and whether the faculty, by and large, actually had
ever worked anyplace but a university.
He laughed.
It is OK that Yale hires only intellectuals and only the best of the
best because Yale is not a state-run institution and Yale can do what it
wants. No one is making anyone go to Yale. Caveat emptor.
But a state spending a great deal of money on its flagship educational
institution ought to know what it is getting.
This is what it is getting—Yale.
There are no faculty members at the University of Illinois in any
mainstream department (I don’t mean agriculture, for example) who
do not consider themselves the equal of, and in some cases better
than, their Yale colleagues.
When I went to Northwestern, I was given the right to hire a variety
of faculty in a number of disciplines that related to learning.
When you recruit faculty, you mostly consider how your institution
might look better to someone at another institution. So, Northwestern
doesn’t recruit from Harvard or MIT (or Yale!) very often because Chicago
doesn’t seem a more appealing place than Boston to an academic
and Northwestern isn’t a step up. And, Northwestern doesn’t recruit
from California in general, for the same reason.
So, it’s the University of Illinois!
I recruited heavily from Illinois because Chicago looks more appealing
than Champaign-Urbana to most people, so I had something
to offer, and the faculty there had already bought into the idea of living
in the Midwest. Moreover, in the academic world, the University
of Illinois is considered to a top-ranked institution with a faculty every
bit as good as Yale’s, maybe better in some departments.
So, why is this bad?
It is bad for the students of the state of Illinois who worked hard
to get into the state’s best university only to discover that its faculty
think they are at Yale.
Of course, they know they are not at Yale, but they are competing
in that world nevertheless. They also do research and publish and
200 Teaching Minds
work hard to be famous superstars. They are in exactly the same game
as their Yale counterparts, so it follows that they don’t want to teach
either.
But the numbers are much bigger at Illinois. Classes are larger and
faculty have to teach more classes. So these same people, who would
readily move to an institution that didn’t treat them like this, are stuck
competing with their Yale colleagues and, at the same time, having so
many more undergraduates to deal with.
Guess who loses?
And, I haven’t even started to discuss the idea that most students
at Illinois do not go there to become professors or intellectuals, or
hobnob with the best and brightest. The faculty think they are (or
ought to be) at Yale, but the students do not. The students want to
get jobs 4 years later. Good luck with that. That is not what Yale is for.
I was told that explicitly one day, by the way. I had to give a short
talk to entering freshmen at Yale when I was the department chair.
The idea was to extol the virtues of majoring in the field represented
by the chair. Each chair gave a short speech. Mine, as usual, was the
shortest. Major in computer science—get a job. That was my speech.
I was booed.
I was booed by the freshmen, who by this time at Yale had been
there maybe 5 minutes but had already absorbed the zeitgeist of the
place. Yale was for thinkers not workers.
By the way, that was in 1982 or so. All our computer science graduates
went to work at Microsoft in those years. There were lots of millionaire
alums not too long after. (Presumably, not those who were booing.)
They wouldn’t have booed at Illinois, and that is the point. Yale
is not the problem unless you realize that it sets the direction for every
other university in the country. It doesn’t do this by itself and it
doesn’t do it intentionally. Nevertheless, it ruins the chances that Illinois
graduates will receive a reasonably practical education that actually
might get them jobs or teach them how to live in the real world.
So, we have created a system that values heavy intellectuals and
gives them a place to do their thing. Is this bad? How could it be bad?
It certainly isn’t bad for the intellectuals. But it is bad for the students.
Not necessarily for the students at Yale, although there are certainly
unhappy students there. It is bad for the society at large. Students
don’t need to major in subjects unless they intend to become professionals
in those subjects. Actually, they need to intend to be professional
researchers in those subjects, since the faculty really don’t know
How the Best Universities Inadvertently Ruin Our Schools 201
how to or care to think about their subject as anything other than a
research area. Making a real living with what they teach is not on any
faculty member’s mind. But students go to college precisely because
they think they will get a job afterward that college will have prepared
them for. It just isn’t true.
Teaching how to survive in the real world is simply not the job of
an Ivy League professor. This is too bad because there are professors
who really do like to teach.
One day I decided that I needed some news video from the major
networks for a project I wanted to start. I called the president of
Northwestern and asked him if he knew anyone at the networks, and
he told me that the former president of one of them was now on our
journalism faculty.
So I called him. He said he would help me but only on one condition.
He wanted me to sit in on the class he taught. This was really an
odd request, and especially hard for me to agree to given how much I
hate classes and classrooms. But I really wanted that video.
Professors almost never ask other professors to watch them teach.
One reason is that they usually aren’t all that proud of their teaching
and don’t want to hear the criticism that inevitably follows. Also, it
really isn’t something they want to talk about even if they are good at
it. It has minor value in a professor’s world.
The class I attended was the most extraordinary I had ever witnessed.
This former head of a network previously had been head of the
news division. He had turned his class into an all-day simulation of a
network newsroom. Students were charged with preparing and producing
the evening news. They got their information from various sources
that were used by the networks and prepared stories, played the roles
of on air reporter, news writer, anchor, camera person, editors, and so
on. They finished and went on air at 5.00. At 5:30 they watched to see
what the networks had done that day and compared and judged their
own success. The professor was there all day guiding them.
I thought this class was fantastic and said so. I then said it would
be a loss when he left Northwestern in a couple of years. He said he
had no intention of leaving, but I knew what he was doing would
never be tolerated.
Why not?
Let me count the reasons. First, he was teaching doing and practice,
and not theory and analysis. While the rest of the world knows
that doing and practice is how you learn, this is the exact opposite of
202 Teaching Minds
how teaching occurs in a great university. (There are exceptions to this,
of course. In engineering, agriculture, and even in journalism, practice
does occur. But it always occurs in the presence of lots of theory.)
University professors are not practitioners. Usually they don’t
know a thing about how what they teach actually is used in the real
world, never having been in the real world themselves, so they have
created a culture where theories and ideas are considered to be more
important than simply being able to do something. So one reason his
class would have to go is that it inevitably would be seen as threatening
to the other faculty.
Another reason that it threatens the other faculty is that it is a
lot of work to do what he did. He was there all day. Professors teach
3 hours a week, 6 if they aren’t superstars. No one wants to see a new
standard of teaching created that is both practical and takes a long
time to do. When would the professors do their research and write
their books? This man didn’t have that agenda. He just wanted to
teach. There is no room for that in a top-tier university.
And, how would this class fit in a student’s schedule? Students can’t
spend all day at something without missing those important required
classes that meet 3 times a week for an hour. Totally consuming classes
that take all day, and may even take all week, cannot possibly exist.
Two years later this man was gone.
It is actually very difficult to change the way a university runs, and
this includes trying to change any aspect of how courses are offered
or structured.
I learned this when I took on the job of building a new West Coast
campus for Carnegie Mellon University. (By building, I mean designing
its offerings, not its buildings.) As I am an advocate of learning by
doing, in just the way our former network head was doing in his class,
I decided that there would be no courses, only projects, and that each
project would build on the one that preceded it. The administration
in Pittsburgh let me get away with this precisely because there were no
faculty hired in California and the Pittsburgh faculty wouldn’t much
notice what we were doing 2,000 miles away.
We had to lie to the registrar about what we were doing because
courses had to be in parallel to make it into their system and we
weren’t offering courses at all. The projects had to be labeled as courses,
but they varied in length (not every project takes the same amount
of time). These “courses” ran in sequence not parallel, so we basically
had to lie about it to get by the registrar.
How the Best Universities Inadvertently Ruin Our Schools 203
The students objected that there were no faculty around and were
no classes, so they felt cheated in some way and asked why they had
to show up at all. We replied that they didn’t, since all the materials
they needed were online anyway. The students were assigned mentors
who were on campus, but after a while students interacted with them
by instant message instead of walking down the hall even when the
students were on campus. The students started out hating what we
did and wound up loving it. These were students in master’s degree
programs and they were, in essence, simulating the jobs they were
preparing for.
Even the faculty in Pittsburgh came to appreciate what we were
doing in California. But you will never hear about it (except from me).
Carnegie Mellon will never brag about it or publicize it in any way.
Why not?
What I did is very threatening. At one point the provost, realizing
that since the program was online, in principle we could serve a lot of
students, asked me whether I was going to put Golden Arches over the
campus and say over a million served. Seemed a good idea to me. But
not to Carnegie Mellon. We don’t want to cheapen our brand name,
the provost told me.
In other words, if hundreds of thousands of people had Carnegie
Mellon degrees, how prestigious would such a degree be? These degrees
were in computer science, a field in which Carnegie Mellon is
number one or two in the world. But if too many people had these
degrees, the university’s prestige would go down, so whether or not
this was good educational practice, and the certifying boards certainly
thought it was, this was never going to happen.
I made the mistake of saying in an interview how well our experiment
was going, and was told by Carnegie Mellon to stop doing that.
It seemed that parents of undergraduates at Carnegie Mellon were
calling and asking why, if this method was so preferable to the usual
course-based method, it wasn’t being employed in Pittsburgh? Since
that could never happen—the professors would never allow it—I had
to stop giving interviews.
As I write this, the learn-by-doing master’s degree programs we
built are still running, but no more will be developed at Carnegie Mellon.
Eventually the ones I built will be shut down. The reason will be
that they employ teachers who teach (as mentors) all the time and
therefore don’t do research and that can’t be allowed. Not if you are in
the superstar prestige game.
204 Teaching Minds
Universities will not change until some equally prestigious online
university is developed that challenges their ability to attract students.
As long as students show up at Yale, and there is no danger there in the
foreseeable future, Yale does not have to change.
But Yale must understand what it is doing to the high school system.
It has to stop telling the high schools what to teach. It has to stop
talking about how high schools must prepare students for college.
That should not be its job. Yale has to accept the idea that students
will arrive at Yale “unprepared” for college. Making Yale’s admissions
process easier should not be the job of the high schools. Teaching the
subjects that superstars don’t want to teach should not be the job of
the high schools. High schools need to focus on the concerns and issues
of real students living in the real world. If Yale really believes in
algebra for its students, then it can teach algebra to all entering freshmen.
(Believe me, it never will.)
Until subjects cease to be the basis of the structure of universities,
there will be a big problem in education across the planet because everyone
everywhere assumes that university degrees are important. As
long as we assume this, and as long as we accept that what is taught
in high school will be determined by the universities, we are in serious
trouble. High schools have become college preparation centers and
thus no one learns anything but academic subjects in high school.
Cognitive processes must be the meat of high schools and should
be the basis of college as well. The top-tier colleges will not change and
maybe they shouldn’t. They can continue to be research universities
and specialize in producing the next generation of Nobel physicists or
literary scholars. Great scientists are nice and I am all for producing
them. But the 3,000 colleges in the United States are not all producing
great physicists. Still they teach chemistry and require mathematics
for no reason that anyone can remember.
If we don’t start thinking seriously about how to teach thinking,
as opposed to academic subjects, to the 99% of students who have no
intention of becoming scholars, we will all lose.
CHAPTER 14
What Can We Do About It?
Simple solutions seldom are. It takes a very unusual mind to
undertake analysis of the obvious.
—Alfred North Whitehead
What is obvious here? Schooling is broken. It needs to be rethought.
What can we build as an alternative? It is a simple question really. If
we had all the resources in the world and we really wanted to educate
our children, where education means teach them to think clearly,
live well-thought-out lives, and be able to pursue their dreams, what
would we build?
It is, of course, very difficult to think about replacing sacred institutions.
The only way I know to think about it, is as a thought
experiment. Just imagine that we lived in a different world, maybe a
Greek colony in the 1st century, and ask yourself how we might educate
our children in this environment, pretending that schools are the
one thing we cannot build for some reason. As we think about this,
we must not assume that what we teach in schools now needs to be
taught in some other way. We simply need to ask: What should one
teach children? while making no assumptions that what we have been
teaching is necessarily relevant.
To put this another way, the right question to ask is: What do children
need to be able to do, in order to function in the world they inhabit?
The next question is, of course, How would we teach children to do
those things?
Now admittedly I am prejudicing the answer here by simply leaving
out the word know. The usual question is, What should children
know? It is this question that leads people to make lists of things every
3rd-grader should know and allows school boards to create lists of
facts students need to be tested on. So, let’s leave that word out of the
discussion and see where it gets us.
205
206 Teaching Minds
A good place to start is to ask what a highly functioning adult can
do and moreover has to be able to do in order to live in this world.
When we ask this question, the phrase “21st-century skills” will not
come up. Every time that phrase comes up, somehow the answer
turns out to include algebra and calculus and science, which, the last
I heard, were 19th-century skills too.
In fact, let’s not talk about particular centuries at all. To see why,
I want to diverge for a moment into a discussion of the maritime industry,
a subject with which I have become more fascinated over the
years. What did a mariner from Ancient Greece have in common with
his modern counterpart in terms of abilities?
The answer is an obsession with weather, ship maintenance, leadership
and organization, navigation, planning, goal prioritization,
and handling of emergencies.
Effective mariners from ancient times would have in common
with those of today is an understanding of how to operate their ships,
the basic laws of weather, tides, navigation, and other relevant issues
in the physical world, and an ability to make decisions well when
circumstances are difficult. They also would have to know how to get
along with fellow workers, how to manage the people who report to
them, as well as basic laws of commerce and defense.
In fact, the worlds they inhabit, from an educational point of view,
that is, from thinking about what to teach and how to teach it, would
be nearly identical except for one thing: how to operate and maintain
the equipment. Their ships were, of course, quite different.
So, let’s reformulate this question that seems to haunt every modern-day
pundit on education (usually politicians or newspaper people).
What are 21st-century skills? Can this question be transformed (for
mariners) into what does a 21st-century mariner need to be educated
about that his Ancient Greek counterpart was not educated about?
The answer, it seems obvious to me, is 21st-century equipment
and procedures: engines, navigation devices, particular political situations,
computers, and so on. But, and this is an important “but,” none
of this stuff is the real issue in the education of a mariner. The real
issue is decision making. What one has to make a decision about is
secondary to the issue of knowing how to make a decision at all.
You can learn about a piece of equipment or a procedure by apprenticeship.
Start as a helper and move on gradually to being an expert.
But this is not what school emphasizes. School typically attempts
to intellectualize these subjects. Experts write books about the theory
What Can We Do About It? 207
of how something works and the next we know, schools are teaching
that theory as a prelude to actually doing the work. Scholarship has
been equated with education. You do not have to know calculus to repair
an engine. You might want to know calculus to design an engine,
but that is no excuse for forcing every engineer to learn it. Similarly,
you do not have to know theoretical physics to master the seas. Mariners
do know physics, of course—practical physics about load balancing,
for example—but they do not have to know how to derive the
equations that describe it.
What I am saying here about the shipping industry holds true for
every other area of life as well. Twenty-first-century skills are no different
from 1st-century skills. Interestingly, Petronius, a 1st-century
Roman author, complained that Roman schools were teaching “young
men to grow up to be idiots, because they neither see nor hear one
single thing connected with the usual circumstances of everyday life.”
In other words, schools have always been about educating the elite in
things that don’t matter much to anyone. This is fine as long as the
elite don’t have to work.
But today the elite have extrapolated from what they learned at
Harvard and decided that every single schoolchild needs to know the
same stuff. So, they whine and complain about math scores going
down without once asking why this could possible matter. Math is not
a 21st-century skill any more than it was a 1st-century skill. Algebra
is nice for those who need it, and useless for those who don’t. Skill
in mathematics is certainly not going to make any industrial nation
more competitive with any other, no matter how many times our “experts”
assert that it will. One wonders how politicians can even say
this junk, but they all do.
Why?
My own guess is that, apart from the fact that they all took these
subjects in school (and were probably bad at them—you don’t become
a politician or a newspaper person because you were great at calculus),
there is another issue: They don’t know what else to suggest.
Thinking about the 1st-century will help us figure out what the
real issues are. People then and people now had to learn how to function
in the world they inhabit. This means being able to communicate,
get along with others, function economically and physically,
and in general reason about issues that confront them. It didn’t mean
then, and doesn’t mean now, science and mathematics, at least not for
95% of the population.
208 Teaching Minds
How do we choose who studies the elite subjects? We don’t.
Offer choices. Stop making lists of what one must know and start
putting students into situations where they can learn from experience
while attempting to accomplish goals that they set out for themselves,
just as people did before there were schools. Education has
always been the same: learning from experience with help from wiser
mentors. School has screwed that all up and it is time to go back to
basics.
So the “what” question is simple. We should teach children what
adults know that enables them to function in the world they inhabit.
This has much less to do with academic knowledge than it has to do
with practical, and often subconscious, knowledge of how to do a variety
of things in the social and physical and economic world we have
created.
Now let’s address the question of how to teach these things.
John Dewey noted, in 1916, that he had been talking about learning
by doing for a long time, but nobody ever listened to him about
it—which was exactly his point. He was frustrated about changing the
system. In 1916! Imagine how he would feel today.
It is not unreasonable to ask why the system never changes, and
who is making sure that it won’t change. The answer is obvious. So
many people have vested interests in things staying as they are that
the system basically cannot change—at least not of its own free will.
The President of the United States could help make the changes
needed, but he won’t. Here is a piece from then-Senator Obama’s
education speech given during his campaign in Dayton, Ohio, in 2008:
We will help schools integrate technology into their curriculum
so we can make sure public school students are fluent in the
digital language of the 21st-century economy. We’ll teach our
students not only math and science, but teamwork and critical
thinking and communication skills, because that’s how we’ll
make sure they’re prepared for today’s workplace.
Some advisor of his had read my writings and was quoting me on that
one. I usually say reasoning and not critical thinking, but this is taken
from my many speeches on education. And what has the President
actually done? He said in that same speech:
What Can We Do About It? 209
And don’t tell us that the only way to teach a child is to spend
most of the year preparing him to fill in a few bubbles on a
standardized test. I don’t want teachers to be teaching to the
test. I don’t want them uninspired and I don’t want our students
uninspired.
Uh huh. Did he change No Child Left Behind? No. Of course not. Testing
dominates education as much as it ever did. All presidents are the
same, really. They can’t fight the vested interests, or won’t. I will avoid
figuring out why here, although, once again, John Dewey had much
to say on the subject of how governments stay in power by making
sure that people aren’t really educated.
We can’t count on politicians, but here is what we can do. We can
build it and then we can work inside or outside the system in such a
way that allows people to be able to come.
But how do you build a new high school system? Very simple: one
curriculum at a time. The trick is making sure that you put the curricula
online. We cannot change education one school at a time. Many
good schools have been created over the years. Today, John Dewey’s
Lab School (in Chicago), which was entirely a learning-by-doing place,
is now a college prep school. Having a few reasonable schools will not
change the system. A curriculum offered online is available to everyone
and eventually can provide an alternative to a system that offers
boring and mindless education.
In addition, online means choices. Once we create dozens, maybe
hundreds, of curricula from which to choose, students should be
able to learn anything they want to learn without regard to whether
a teacher for that curriculum or other students interested in that curriculum
happen to live nearby.
So, in an ideal world, what would these curricula be about?
They can be about anything that one can learn to do in the real
world (which would leave out all the traditional academic subjects).
They should teach teaching cognitive processes, of course, but one
should not endeavor to teach cognitive processes specifically, that is,
apart from their possible use. So, it is the use of these processes in
some area of real life that would be the intent of any full-year, storycentered
curriculum.
These curricula and any others that we would design have the
following characteristics:
210 Teaching Minds
1. They must be learn-by-doing curricula consisting of series of
projects inside coherent stories about life in some aspect of
the real world.
2. They must be delivered on the web. Students should work on
projects where the background and help are web delivered.
They would submit their work to mentors and receive
feedback online.
3. Mentors in the curricula would include parents, online
subject matter experts worldwide, local experts, and teachers
trained to be mentors. Mentoring, unlike teaching, is not
about providing information that can be found easily in
books but about helping students through a problem without
giving them the answer. Mentors point students in the right
direction and react to their work as it progresses.
4. Students should, on a regular basis (sometimes weekly,
sometimes more often), submit work products related to each
project for evaluation and feedback. Students would submit
their work many times to achieve increasing mastery and get
continuing feedback. There should be no competency tests,
only the continual monitoring of performance.
5. Each curriculum should be designed by a panel of experts in
a given field. The curriculum should provide a simulation of
what life might be like in that field. For example, students
might spend the year working legal cases, or starting a
business, or designing roads and bridges.
6. Students should be encouraged to work in virtual teams,
learning to deal with others to produce results.
7. Choice must be a staple of the curricula. There can be no
single set of standard requirements. Instead, students should
be able to select the curricula they wish to participate in.
Their records would list what deliverables they have created
in their chosen curricula.
8. Curricula must be designed around projects with clear,
meaningful, achievable goals. They must be designed
carefully so to incorporate all the key basic skills like reading,
writing, reasoning, researching, calculating, computing, and
so on, in a systematic and natural way.
What Can We Do About It? 211
Here are some curricula that have been proposed that would meet student’s
interests head on, that would be able to teach them to be good
at a variety of skills (including all 12 cognitive processes), and that
would make the students employable as well:
• Criminal Justice
• Sports Management
• The Music Business
• The Legal Office
• Military Readiness
• The Fashion Business
• Aerospace Engineering
• Computer Networking
• Homeland Security
• Medical Technology
• Construction
• Computer Programming
• Television Production
• Real Estate Management
• Architecture
• The Banking Industry
• Automotive Engineering
• Architecture
• Biotechnology
• Film Making
• Travel Planning
• Financial Management
• Parenting and Childcare
• Starting an Online Business
• Urban Planning
• Hotel Management
• Health Sciences
• The Food Industry
• Graphic Arts
• Communication
• Veterinary Science
• Marketing
• Telecommunications
• Scientific Reasoning
212 Teaching Minds
Obviously, this list could be much longer. The intention here is to
make any student excited about learning because what he or she wants
to learn about is offered. The trick for the designers of the curricula is
to make sure that students’ interest is grabbed and maintained for a
full year, while teaching them how to hone their capabilities at the 12
cognitive processes.
What are the obstacles?
What would prevent this from happening? Really there are only
four issues:
Finding people who know how to build the curricula
Paying the people who will build the curricula
Convincing schools or other entities to offer the curricula
Training teachers to be mentors in these curricula
Smart, articulate, people who are well organized and can write
well can easily learn to do the bulk of the work involved in building
a course as long as they have access to experts and are guided by
experienced designers, and the project is run by someone how knows
how to run projects. Finding people who can do this work is not a
problem. Being able to pay them for the year or so that it takes to do
the work is the real issue.
This leads us to discuss who would pay for this. The answer should
be the federal government, but it is clear that that will never happen.
The federal government, as any interested citizen knows, is influenced
mightily by big business, especially when big business has profits to
protect.
Companies that produce textbooks and companies that produce
and grade exams will not stand by and see their revenues drop. Any
alternative curriculum that did not use textbooks and did not use
standardized tests would be anathema to them. Companies that have
billions of dollars in revenues from textbooks know how to encourage
politicians to protect their interests.
What about the testing industry? A recent report says that “the
testing industry is somewhat secretive.” I wonder why. But sometimes
they do report revenue. To give an example, the revenue of Kaplan
Inc., which is just one of many test preparation companies, was over
$1 billion in 2008. Who owns Kaplan? The Washington Post. So while
the testing companies make great profits, the nation’s newspapers,
having a vested interest in those profits, tout testing as the country’s
What Can We Do About It? 213
salvation. The most visible touter is the Secretary of Education, who
gives eloquent speeches about more rigorous testing that are, of course,
printed in The Washington Post.
Why would President Obama want to do the same thing as President
Bush did, especially when he campaigned against No Child Left
Behind, as I pointed out earlier? The answer is simple. There is lots of
money invested in testing by powerful players. Kids are no one’s main
concern.
So the money for the new plan will not be coming from the
government.
What about from business? Venture capital, for example?
Is a new kind of high school offered online likely to be a successful
business venture? One mentor in the story-centered curriculum can
handle between 20 and 50 students, depending on the mentor’s experience.
Assuming that the students pay tuition that covers the mentor’s
salary, which means they need to pay at least $3,000 a year, more
or less, in tuition, it shouldn’t cost anything to run. Charge larger tuitions
and there will be profits. Initial investment is about $2 million
to build a curriculum, but enough students paying reasonable tuitions
will pay that investment back quickly enough. So, is this a big business
opportunity?
Actually I doubt it. I think that it is a big opportunity for universities
that traditionally charge large tuitions. We have had a great deal
of success with master’s degrees, for example. But universities typically
don’t invest $2 million in anything, even if it does have great upside
potential. When Carnegie Mellon University made that investment in
its West Coast campus (where I was designing the curriculum), it did
so without quite knowing it was doing so because the person in charge
didn’t tell the University officials what he was up to. Universities typically
don’t think about investing money in order to make money in
the daily enterprise. Businesses do think that way, of course, but businesses
have trouble starting universities that are accredited. I worked for
Trump University, which supposedly was going to do exactly that, but
they never could raise enough money or figure out how to be accredited.
So there is a potentially very big business in master’s degrees, but
it needs some well-financed and prescient people to make it happen.
High schools are another story. I actually do not believe that business
will invest in online high schools whose mission is to overthrow
the existing system. Venture capitalists are not revolutionaries. They
tend to follow the herd in whatever they do and there is no herd in
214 Teaching Minds
education except the one promoting more testing. They certainly do
invest in that.
So we are left with appealing to people who actually care about
kids and their education. Money isn’t and shouldn’t be the allure here.
This means that the saviors of education will have to be wealthy individuals
or foundations started by wealthy individuals.
The health sciences curriculum that we built was funded by the
Ewing Kauffman Foundation. We built it using our not-for-profit company,
Engines for Education. I really believe that no alternative to the
nonprofit model funded by wealthy people exists. We just have to find
people who care about education. They are in short supply, and they
typically aren’t the wealthy people who make pronouncements about
education, but I am hopeful that they are out there.
I wouldn’t mind being wrong about anything I have said here. The
federal government could get taken over by people who actually care
about kids and not votes.
How do we convince schools to offer these curricula once they
have been developed? It won’t be easy. There aren’t that many schools
run by people who realize that the system is broken. But they do exist,
however. The real problem is not so much convincing the head of
a private school or the superintendent of a school district. It is more
about convincing parents who fundamentally do not understand education,
or teachers who have taught what they have always taught and
really don’t want to learn new skills.
And, in addition, there are all those state standards. The first thing
that any school that wants to use our curriculum has to do is to see
how they can map what we will teach into their state’s standards. If
the state standards specify 2 years of algebra, we are out of luck. If
they have vague science standards, we are in better shape. Either way,
the state standards, passed by all those brilliant state legislatures that
know all there is to know about what should be taught in high school,
inhibit real change in the system.
So we need motivated heads of schools or school systems, in states
that have flexible standards, where parents who hold views about why
school was better in their day do not have to be listened to. Do these
exist?
Sure.
The last issue is training teachers to mentor. We do this by having
teachers be students in a curriculum mentored by others who have
experience in that curriculum. Mentoring does not come naturally to
What Can We Do About It? 215
people who have been teaching in the usual way. But they pick it up
and often find that they like it better.
Here is Lynn Carter, one of the first mentors we trained to teach
in this new way at CMU’s West Coast campus. He is a professor of
software engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.
It has taken me a while to figure out how to undo about 25 years
of teaching experience that was standing in front of a room and
talking, but I really like it. I enjoy interacting with students. As
much as I enjoy standing in front of students and talking, it is
much more satisfying to be dealing with smaller groups, more of
a one-on-one interaction.
Professors often complain that no students come to see them
during their office hours. That isn’t a problem with us here.
How did we teach Professor Carter to mentor Socratically? It wasn’t
trivial to do, but it didn’t take that long either. Once a teacher gets
the idea that his job is not telling but helping, he gets into the swing
of it fairly easily. Training teachers to teach in the kinds of SCCs we
propose for high school is more an issue of familiarizing them with
the content, which will differ considerably from what they have been
teaching. Handholding comes naturally to most people because they
have been doing that kind of teaching all their lives with siblings and
children. Lecturing is not a natural human activity and teachers are
easily dissuaded from doing it as long as they are not being presented
with a classroom of listeners.
In the end, the real question is this: Why do we still have schools?
This is a little like asking why we still have religious institutions.
In fact, it is a lot like asking that question because you will get the
same reactions. People get used to the institutions that have always
been a part of their lives. The fact is that these institutions were created
in a different time when knowledge was harder to come by and
the economy was quite different.
Religion is not my issue. Should we still have schools?
Instead of answering this question by listing all the good things
that schools provide—no one would argue that a literate population
is a bad thing, for example—I will turn the question around: What is
bad about having schools?
Here is a list of what is bad. Following the list, I will explain what
is bad about these things (assuming it isn’t obvious).
216 Teaching Minds
Schools emphasize competition.
Schools make kids stressed.
Schools know the right answers.
Schools enable bullying and peer pressure.
Schools stifle curiosity.
Schools choose the subjects for students.
Schools have classrooms.
Schools give grades.
Schools provide certification.
Schools confine children.
Schools claim that academics are the winners.
Schools do not value practical skills.
Schools cause students to want to please teachers.
Schools cause students to question their self-worth.
Schools are run by politicians.
Governments use education for repression.
Discovery is not valued in school.
Boredom is seen as a bad thing in school.
Competition: Why should school be a competitive event? Why do
we ask how a kid is doing in school? Learning in life outside of school is
not a competitive event. We learn what we choose to know in real life.
Stress: When 6-year-olds are stressed about going to school, you
know that something is wrong. Is learning in real life stressful? Stress
can’t be helping kids learn. What kid wouldn’t happily skip school on
any given day? What does this tell us about the experience?
Right answers: School teaches that there are right answers. The
teacher knows them. The test makers know them. Now you have to
know them. But in real life, there are very few right answers. Life isn’t
mathematics. Thinking about how to behave in a situation, planning
your day or your life, plotting a strategy for your company or your
country—no right answers.
Bullying and peer pressure: You wouldn’t have to have say no to
drugs or cigarettes campaigns if kids didn’t go to school. In school there
are always other kids telling you how to dress, how to act, how to be
cool. Why do we want kids’ peer groups to be the true teachers of
What Can We Do About It? 217
children? Being left out terrorizes children. Why do we allow this to
happen by creating places that foster this behavior?
Stifling of curiosity: Isn’t it obvious that learning is really about
curiosity? Adults learn about things they want to learn about. Before
the age of 6, prior to school, one kid becomes a dinosaur specialist,
while another knows all about dog breeds. Outside of school, people
drive their own learning. Schools eliminate this natural behavior.
Subjects chosen for you: Why algebra, physics, economics,
and U.S. history? Because those subjects were pretty exciting to the
president of Harvard in 1892. And, if you are interested in something
else—psychology, business, medicine, computers, design? Too bad.
Those subjects weren’t taught at Harvard in 1892. Is that nuts or
what?
Classrooms: If you wanted to learn something and had the
money, wouldn’t you hire someone to be your mentor, and have
them be there for you while you tried out learning the new thing?
Isn’t that what small children have, a parent ready to teach as needed.
Classrooms make no sense as a venue for learning unless, of course,
you want to save money and have 30 (or, worse, hundreds of) students
handled by one teacher. Once you have ratios like that, you have to
teach by talking and then hoping someone was listening, so then you
have to have tests. Schools cannot work as places of learning if they
employ classrooms. And, of course, they pretty much all do.
Grades: Any professor can tell you that students are pretty much
concerned with whether what you are telling them will be on the
test and what they might do for extra credit. In other words, they
want a good grade. If you tell them that 2 + 2 = 5 and it will be on
the test, they will tell you that 2 + 2 = 5 if it means getting a good
grade. Parents do not give grades to children and employers do not
give grades to employees. They judge their work and progress for sure,
but not by assigning numbers to a report card.
Certification: We all know why people attend college. They do so
primarily to say they are college graduates so they can get a job or go
on to a professional school. Most don’t care all that much about what
218 Teaching Minds
hoops they have to go through. They do what they are told. Similarly,
students try to get through high school so they can go on to college.
As long as students are not in school to get an education, you can be
pretty sure they won’t get one. Most of our graduates have learned to
jump through hoops, nothing more.
Confined children: Children like to run around. Is this news to
anyone? They have a difficult time sitting still and they learn by trying
things out and asking questions. Of course, in school sitting still is the
norm. So we have come up with this wonderful idea of ADHD, that
is, drug those who won’t sit still into submission. Is the system sick or
what?
Academics viewed as winners: Who are the smartest kids in
school? The ones who are good at math and science, of course. Why do
we think that? Who knows? We just do. Those who are good at these
subjects go on to be professors. So those are certainly the smartest
people we have in our society. Perhaps they are. But I can tell you from
personal experience that our society doesn’t respect professors all that
much, so something is wrong here.
Practical skills not valued: When I was young, there were
academic high schools and trade high schools. Trade high schools
were for dumb kids. Academic high schools were for smart kids. We
all thought this made sense. Except that are a lot of unemployed
English majors and a lot of employed airplane mechanics. Where
did we get the idea that education was about scholarship? This is not
what Ben Franklin thought when our system was being designed, but
he was outvoted.
The need to please teachers: People who succeed at school are
invariably people who are good at figuring out what the teacher
wants and giving it to her. In real life there is no teacher to please
and these “grade grubbers” often find themselves lost. When I did
graduate admissions, if a student presented an undergraduate record
with all A’s, I immediately rejected him. There was no way he was
equally good at or equally interested in everything (except pleasing
the teacher). As a professor, I had no patience for students who
What Can We Do About It? 219
thought that telling me what I just told them was the essence of
academic achievement.
Self-worth questioned: School is full of winners and losers. I
graduated number 322 in my high school class (out of 678). Notice
that I remember this. Do you think this was good for my self-esteem?
Even the guy who graduated number 2 felt like a loser. In school, most
everyone sees themselves as a loser. Why do we allow this to happen?
Politicians in charge: Politicians demand reform but they wouldn’t
know reform if it hit them over the head. What they mean is that
school should be like they remember rather than how it is now, and
they will work hard to get you to vote for them to give them money
to restore the system to the awful state it always was in. Politicians,
no matter what party, actually have no interest in education at all. An
educated electorate makes campaigning much harder.
Government use of education for repression: As long as there have
been governments, there have been governments that wanted people
to think that the government (and the country) is very good. We all
recognize this tendency in dictatorships that promote the marvels of
the dictator and rewrite history whenever it is convenient. When you
point out that our government does the same thing, you are roundly
booed. We all know that the Indians were savages that Abraham
Lincoln was a great president and that we are the freest country on
earth. School is about teaching “truth.”
Discovery not valued: The most important things we learn we
teach ourselves. This is why kids have trouble learning from their
parents’ experience. They need their own experiences to ponder and
to learn from. We need to try things out and see how they go. This kind
of learning is not valued in school because it might lead to, heaven
forbid, failure, and failure is a really bad word in school. Except failure
is how we learn, which is pretty much why school doesn’t work.
Boredom ignored: Boredom is a bad thing. We drug bored kids
with Ritalin so they will stop being bored. All of my best work has
come when I was most bored and let my mind wander. It is odd that
220 Teaching Minds
we keep trying to prevent this from happening with kids. Lots of TV,
that’s the ticket.
Major learning by-doing mechanism ignored: And last but not
least, scholars from Plato to Dewey have pointed that people learn
by doing. That is how we learn. Doing. Got it? Apparently not. Very
little doing in schools. Unless you count filling in circles with number
2 pencils as doing.
Online education can change all this. Build it right once and children
the world over will have the opportunity to learn how to think and to
learn how to work. Such a system would be capable of changing fast.
Any new industry or market or technology could produce a course in
what is needed to work in that field and instantly get the people it
needed.
Schools are an ancient artifact that can’t last much longer.
Notes
Chapter 1
1. In the United States it all stems from a meeting of the Committee of

Fallujah Ambush victims - In October 2006, Blackwater hired one of the nation’s heaviest-hitting
lawyers to represent it - Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel in the 1999 impeachment of
President Bill Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal... Starr and his colleagues argued that
Blackwater was constitutionally immune from such lawsuits and said that if the Fallujah case were
allowed to proceed, Blackwater will suffer irreparable harm.” In the eighteen-page petition to the
Supreme Court, Blackwater argued that there are no other such lawsuits against private
military/security companies in state courts because the comprehensive regulatory scheme enacted
by Congress and the President grant military contractors like Blackwater immunity from state-court
litigation. (pp. 234-235, Blackwater). (Author Ken Davis writes) The four men had spent the night
before they set off at marine base Camp Fallujah. But the men kept their distance from the
leathernecks. Had they spoken to the marines, the Blackwater team might have learned that the
Americans were already in the midst of a major offensive meant to assert control over the
increasingly restive city, where elements of the radical Islamist movement and remnants of
Saddam's army were beginning to aggressively strike back. at the American occupation” (p. 306,
The Hidden History of American at War), and perhaps this is the only thing that makes sense of the
fact that Under the terms of its contract, Blackwater was supposed to supply these convoy security
missions with two SUVs, each carrying three guards per vehicle; a driver, one man riding shotgun,
and a third man in back with a heavy machine gun. Instead, the foursome set out that morning with
just two men per car, each vehicle missing their rear gunner. The SUVs were only outfitted with a
steel plate as extra armor. And the men had not been given maps. (p. 305).

Starr went on to defend Jeffrey Epstein abasing allegations of child sex trafficking - Along with a
dream team of attorneys that included Gerald Lefcourt, Roy Black, and Ken Starr, [Alan Dershowitz]
was successful in getting federal investigators not to charge Epstein with moving his victims across
state lines and other associated crimes. The federal non-prosecution agreement Epstein's legal team
negotiated with the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida immunized all named and
unnamed potential co-conspirators in Epstein's child trafficking network, which includes those who
allegedly procured minors for Epstein and also any powerbrokers who may have molested them” (-
http://gawker.com/flight-logs-put-clinton-dershowitz-on-ped...). Otherwise, Epstein’s eventual 18
month sentence by the state of Florida was exceptionally light under the circumstances to include
the number of victims who came forward with testimony. This is best understood in the context of
children being used as a means to government-sponsored sexual blackmail and other forms of
leverage.

Why Assad need not fear Gaddafi’s fate

Ed Husain

August 23, 2011 -- The dramatic scenes in Tripoli are already being
seized upon by those keen to depose other despotic regimes. Taken
alongside the unstable situation in Syria, there is now a risk of a
dangerous moment of western triumphalism. This must be resisted,
especially given that the odds of overthrowing dictator Bashar al-
Assad are so small.

After months of holding his nerve, US president Barack Obama last
week succumbed to calls from commentators and Syrian opposition
leaders, and demanded Mr Assad’s removal. The decision was a
mistake. Earlier in the week, Hillary Clinton, secretary of state, noted
that, “if the US called for Mr Assad’s head, then what?”. And,
indeed, then what? I lived in Syria for two years and still visit
regularly, so I know only too well that the US is viewed with deep
animosity. Officials told me many times, and with straight faces, that
America is at war with Arabs and Muslims — a view also ingrained
among the wider population, particularly after the Iraq war.

Calls for regime change will thus help Syria, as Mr Assad defies the
west with ease. As elsewhere in the Middle East, defying Washington
is a cause of strength and popularity, as Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran
show. Every passing day will now be seen as a humiliation for Mr
Obama, while the fragmented and shambolic Syrian opposition will
be more credibly dubbed “American stooges” or “Zionist agents”’.
For a population that is vehemently anti-American and anti-Israel,
such labels are powerful and destructive.

The regime has been barbaric in responding to the brave people on
the streets, but we must be careful about accepting the narrative that

psychoanalyst, has labeled my affliction “FOMS”—“fear of missing something.” I plead guilty to
that diagnosis.

Nor was this event-filled week unusual. Two weeks later, my wife and I were off to Israel, where
I received the Begin Prize” for my “contributions to the Jewish people,” and gave several lectures
in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. During my visit to Israel, I flew to Paris for a talk and to the Hague
on a human rights matter. Then back to Israel for a conference and meetings with the Prime
Minister and other government officials. My granddaughter joined us in Vienna for a few days of
opera and strudel, followed by a visit to Prague as guests of the U.S. Ambassador, a speech at a
Czech university and the lighting of Chanukah candles at the U.S. Embassy.

I don’t know how long I will be able to keep up this pace. I am now teaching only in the fall
semester at Harvard Law School, though I generally squeeze 4 or 5 separate courses into that one
semester—one large class, two seminars and one or two reading groups. We move to South
Beach for the winter, where I write, lecture and consult on cases. I am trying to accept fewer
commitments, but I find it hard to say no to interesting offers (FOMS?). I also cannot remain
passive in the face of injustice and bigotry, which appear to be on the increase. I still love a tough
challenge and welcome a good fight. I hate to lose and I never give up.

If past is prologue, my approach to life—living the passion of the times—will not change, but
nature has its claim and physical energy inevitably abates and requires choices and priorities. My

priorities will continue to be determined by the seriousness of the wrongs that need to be
challenged by rights.

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021777.txt,"The Palm Beach Count State Attorney's Office could have let a jury decide whom to
believe. Instead, State Attorney Barry Krischer left the public to wonder whether the
system tilted in favor of a wealthy, well-connected alleged perpetrator and against very
young girls who are alleged victims of sex crimes.

Mr. Krischer took the unusual step of referring the case to a grand jury, which last month
indicted Jeffrey Epstein on one felony count of solicitation of prostitution. That decision
came after Harvard law Professor Alan Dershowitz met with prosecutors to undermine
the credibility of the 14- to 17-yearold girls who charged that Mr. Epstein had paid them
$200 to $300 to undress and massage him in his five-bedroom, 7 1/2 -bath home on the
Intracoastal Waterway.

The girls, Mr. Dershowitz told prosecutors, had written on myspace.com about smoking
marijuana and drinking alcohol. But if the girls have a credibility problem, what about
Jeffrey Epstein? Mr. Goldberger, told The Post: Mr. Epstein absolutely insisted anybody
who came to his house be over the age of 18. How he verified that, I don't know.” And
prosecutors took him at his word?

Police collected evidence that refutes Jeffrey Epstein's defense. Police searched his home
and garbage and found phone messages about the girls' school schedules and even a high
school transcript, suggesting that Mr. Epstein at least knew that the girls were teenagers.

The state attorney's office has responded to criticism from Palm Beach police and others
by noting the higher standard prosecutors face for conviction than law-enforcement
officers do for arrest. But in this case, the state attorney bowed to the risk that a jury
might look at both Jeffrey Epstein and the girls, and point fingers at both sides.

Even if the girls could be impugned as prostitutes, solicitation of a minor is a crime.
Former disc jockey and teacher Bruno Moore was charged with that Tuesday.
Investigators say the 34-year-old used the Internet - myspace.com - to recruit a 13-year
old.

Police say Jeffrey Epstein used a 20-year-old woman who had a myspace.com

account to recruit young girls. His actions were sleazy. It would have been good to ask a
jury just how criminal they were.

Palm Beach Post Editorial #3

Spare us the outrage

Wednesday, February 13, 2008

An 11-month police investigation led to an indictment on one felony charge of
solicitation of prostitution. That was in July 2006, and part-time Palm Beacher

Jeffrey Epstein still has faced no repercussions for allegedly preying on underage
girls.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028070.txt,"My job was to ensure the security not just of the Gush Emunim march but of
the counter-demonstrators, and, of course, the local Palestinian population. As
the rival marches by the Israelis proceeded, I personally delivered warnings
against any violence, both to the settlement leaders and to a pair of the most
prominent counter-protesters, the peace activist Uri Avneri and Knesset member
Yossi Sarid. The event went off without major incident. But the next day,
Davar, the venerable Labor newspaper I’d first read as a child in Mishmar
Hasharon, let rip against me. Under a photo of me with Avneri and Sarid — my
arm raised, ostensibly in some kind of threat but actually in the time-honored
Jewish practice of talking with my hands — the article accused me of siding with
the settlers. If blood was spilled in the weeks and months ahead, the newspaper
said, “it will be on Barak’s hands.”

Ordinarily, I would have ignored it. But never in my military career had I
been similarly attacked on an issue of any importance. I was especially angry
because not only was the insinuation unfounded. It was diametrically opposite to
the stance I was determined to take in this, my first regional command. Yes, I
was committed to providing security for the settlers. But especially in the wake
of the crimes of the Jewish underground, I was determined to ensure they
remained within the boundaries of the law.

A few days later, I called Rabin’s aide and asked to see the Defense
Minister, and was told to come see him after Saturday lunch at his home. When
I arrived, Rabin got right down to business. “Ehud, you wanted to see me?” he
said. “You’ve probably seen Davar,” I replied. “It was a pretty nasty piece. It
distorted things.” Yet as he began asking for details, it seemed he had no idea
what I was talking about. “Ehud, I never read it,” he said. “If you hadn’t told
me, I’d never have known there was an issue.” I assumed this was a white lie,
told to reassure me. But years later, when I was Minister of Defense, and then
Prime Minister, I sometimes found myself on the other side of such meetings.
An officer or official would come see me because of something said about them
in the media, or remarks they were quoted as having made. When I told them
I’d been unaware of it, I could see the disbelief in their eyes. By then, however,
I realized that under the multiple demands of a senior role in government, you
really could fail to notice events that others viewed as crucial to their
reputations or careers. To reassure them I truly hadn’t noticed, I’d tell them the
story of my meeting with Rabin.

President Bill Clinton

I first met President and Mrs. Clinton, both of whom who are indeed fascinating, on Rosh
Hashanah in 1993. We shared many mutual friends and teachers from Yale Law School, but we
had never actually met before I invited the President and First Lady, who were vacationing on
Martha’s Vineyard, to join my family at the M.V. synagogue for Rosh Hashanah services. When I
learned that the Clintons were living near us on the Vineyard, I had the following letter hand
delivered to the President by a mutual friend:

Dear Mr. President:

It is my great honor to invite you on behalf of the Martha’s Vineyard Hebrew Center (the
only Jewish house of prayer on the Island) to attend one of our Rosh Hashanah (Jewish
New Year) services. It is a part of the Jewish tradition for the congregation to bless the
President of the United States and the great nation that has given us the freedom to
practice our religion without prejudice or discrimination. Our congregation would love to
extend that blessing personally to you and to invite you to respond with your own New
Year’s greeting or to accept our good wishes silently.

In years gone by, Jews in different countries lived in fear that government officials would
enter their religious sanctuaries. Such visits were often prelude to crusades, inquisitions,
pogrom, and—eventually—the Holocaust. The lyrics of the Broadway hit “Fiddler on the
Roof” include the following mock prayer for the Russian Czar. “May the good Lord bless
and keep the Czar—far away from us.” In contemporary America, the attitude of the
Jewish community is quite different: We welcome our president with open arms.

The services will be held in the Whaling Church in Edgartown—a wonderful building used
for year as a place of Christian prayer for whaling captains and their crews. The use of
this church for Jewish services symbolizes the ecumenical nature of our wonderful
Island...We hope you and your family and staff members (Jewish or non-Jewish) can join
us as we pray for a year of peace, health and productivity.

The president immediately accepted, thus becoming, we are told by the eminent Jewish historian
Jacob Marcus, the first sitting American president ever to attend a Jewish High Holiday service. I
sat next to him during the service and shared a mahzor (Holiday prayer book) with him for most
of the davening, pointing out the prayers and whispering explanations of such concepts as the
“talit” (prayer shawl) and “mitzvot” (good deeds). We used a prayer book in which the Hebrew
was transliterated for the parts that are chanted, and the president and Mrs. Clinton sang along in
Hebrew. Then the president spoke briefly from the lectern, declaring his role in the Mideast peace
process “one of the most rewarding things I’ve done,” and wishing the Jewish people a “Shana
Tova.” He wore a white Kipah my wife and I gave him from our wedding. He and Hillary signed
it and gave it back after the service. We have kept it as a treasured reminder of that historic night.

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026414.txt,"no worry,  ifiunderstand correctly you are suggsting there are layers 1 through N . lets cal them L 1 -
Ln. there aretimesT 1-Tn/ and then conjecture that changing the time . correlations ( by genetic swtch
or other method. , you might be able to make blacks smarter by changing the time for motor layer
development and changing the time for other layers. .). like telemeres for the cell , are their equivalents
for the layers. . as you talked about culling the unused neurons in each layer, each neuron in each layer
would get dfferent (kill yourself if you are not being used instructions ).

Exactly. I looked up the statistics, black kids in the US have slower cognitive development (and never catch
up), which the study of course attributed to social factors without any evidence, and they had faster motor
development! I suspect this means their brains are slower at learning high-level concepts, because the low-
level structures are optimized for a shorter time. But they will keep the lead in motor development, because it
is easier to learn, and they have more time and attention to practice once they get the structures in place.

It could also be that they have an additional set of learning directives in place that adapts them better to a
more hunting/running style of life, whereas the Europeans had to adapt for identifying long-term seasonal
patterns, delayed gratification for agriculture etc.

and CONCEPTS could be layer to layer communicaiton. . are gender differences also a matter of time ,
and structure of interactions. .

I suspect gender differences are mostly motivational, i.e. we have a reward system for all the different social
and cognitive needs, which makes us receive different kinds of pleasure and pain, thereby pay attention and
learn. You cannot learn what does not attract your attention. Women tend to find abstract systems, conflicts
and mechanisms intrinsically boring. Most women in computer science do not write programs because they
enjoy solving puzzles, but because they want to help people, get approval etc. There are almost no women in
math, because it does not help people or yield social attention.

Men tend to find elaborate social relations boring. If there is no pleasure in observing and empathizing with
people, one will not have good social cognition.

1Q is not the only meaningful difference. Chinese pay an inordinate amount of attention to authority. I
suspect historically., the authorities tended to kill them a lot if they did not. Jews tend be intellectually
independent and anti-authoritarian, which might make them creative and inventive in ways that are hard to
find in Asia.

At the moment, I think speed/quality of brain development plus motivational system are the key to
understanding both mind and individual differences. Important part of human language might be the result in
a motivational need to discover/invent grammatical structure, which as a side effect makes us interested in
music.

It would mean that Chomsky’s life long hypothesis, that people have a special circuit for grammatical
language, is wrong. They might be GENERAL learners, just like Gorillas, but with a strong motivational
urge to build grammatical structure, which the brain simply invents (there are only a few ways in which a
natural language can work). That is much easier to wire into a brain than a specific circuit.

imy self believe that african music, westrn music , chinese music are a window into the the structure of
those layers. . western rigid, african primitve , chinese nature based,. I belive that synphoic movments
best describe your layering. they open with a basic simple melody, , after it is learned , it is repeated and

[company name] would be willing to consider them. We can test this arrangement for a few months to
see if it works for both of us, since that would make the most sense.

Role #1: Graphic Design and Print Advertising Coordinator
Responsibility:

Create timelines for print materials and coordinate with respective program teams.

Expectations:
e Print materials will be completed on time.

Responsibility:
Coordinate design projects with program directors and outside graphic artists/designers.

Expectations:

e Print materials designs are suitable for the audience, accurate, and appealing.

e Print materials are professional quality and produced within set timelines.

Responsibility:
Maintain relationships with print vendors to minimize cost relative to time and quality in producing
program print materials.

Expectations:

e Print materials are printed within the established budget, unless budget overages are specifically
approved by the Director of Marketing.

Contract Solution:
By using e-mail and web-based programs such as

*ConceptShare, I can continue to coordinate these design projects from a distance. I currently maintain
relationships with print vendors and designers at a distance so physical presence is not necessary for this
to continue. For meetings with program directors and the marketing team, I would use a free video and
phone conferencing service called *Skype. We usually meet once or twice to discuss changes to their
marketing materials and the rest of the process is continued through e-mail and ConceptShare.

Role #2: Special Marketing Project Manager
Responsibility:

Maintain a collection of updated, appropriate marketing images.
Expectations:

e Images needed for marketing materials and websites are anticipated and acquired.

Contract Solution:

I am still able to complete this task remotely by doing images searches on web databases such as

unacceptability of the use of chemical weapons at the noon press briefing. To both
Kushner and McMaster it seemed obvious that the president was more annoyed about
having to think about the attack than by the attack itself.

Finally, Ivanka told Dina they needed to show the president a different kind of
presentation. Ivanka had long ago figured out how to make successful pitches to her
father. You had to push his enthusiasm buttons. He may be a businessman, but numbers
didn’t do it for him. He was not a spreadsheet jockey—his numbers guys dealt with
spreadsheets. He liked big names. He liked the big picture—he liked /iteral big pictures.
He liked to see it. He liked “impact.”

But in one sense, the military, the intelligence community, and the White House’s
national security team remained behind the times. Theirs was a data world rather than a
picture world. As it happened, the attack on Khan Sheikhoun had produced a wealth of
visual evidence. Bannon might be right that this attack was no more mortal than countless
others, but by focusing on this one and curating the visual proof, this atrocity became
singular.

Late that afternoon, Ivanka and Dina created a presentation that Bannon, in disgust,
characterized as pictures of kids foaming at the mouth. When the two women showed the
presentation to the president, he went through it several times. He seemed mesmerized.

Watching the president’s response, Bannon saw Trumpism melting before his eyes.
Trump—despite his visceral resistance to the establishment ass-covering and standard-
issue foreign policy expertise that had pulled the country into hopeless wars—was
suddenly putty. After seeing all the horrifying photos, he immediately adopted a
completely conventional point of view: it seemed inconceivable to him that we couldn’t
do something.

That evening, the president described the pictures in a call to a friend—the foam, all
that foam. These are just kids. He usually displayed a consistent contempt for anything but
overwhelming military response; now he expressed a sudden, wide-eyed interest in all
kinds of other military options.

On Wednesday, April 5, Trump received a briefing that outlined multiple options for
how to respond. But again McMaster burdened him with detail. He quickly became
frustrated, feeling that he was being manipulated.

The following day, the president and several of his top aides flew to Florida for a
meeting with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping—a meeting organized by Kushner with the
help of Henry Kissinger. While aboard Air Force One, he held a tightly choreographed
meeting of the National Security Council, tying into the staff on the ground. By this point,
the decision about how to respond to the chemical attack had already been made: the
military would launch a Tomahawk cruise missile strike at Al Shayrat airfield. After a

McGurk Effect; Go to the Website and Watch the Linked Video

Chinese children tend to learn the piano very young, they don't lose the
absolute part of pitch. An astonishing 93% of these children develop and
retain perfect pitch throughout their lives.

There are many cross connections between the audio and video
processing systems. At parties you often can't hear speakers clearly because
of the background noise. Watching their lips will help comprehension,
but which sense wins if there is conflict between the two? The McGurk
effect shows this.

To test the effect, go to the website, watch the video and see if you
can distinguish when a speaker talking normally and when he is making
the mouth movement of another sound. There is a winner. Try it for
yourself; check out the link on my website.

Once upon a time people imagined the brain was like a camera
forming an image of the world, but if this were the case there would be
a paradox. Who is looking at the image in our brain to make sense of it?
Modern research shows we don’t take a complete picture of the world
like a camera but rather parse the image into its constituent parts on the
fly.

If someone asks, “Which side of the house is the tree on?” your
brain parses the question and compares it with the image map in your
mind’s eye. What is the image composed of: trees, houses, sky, grass?
Your brain manipulates the linguistic question about the relationship
of elements and matches it with the visio-spatial understanding of the
image, allowing you to answer the question. You might not have to answer

Fig. 13.1: A Simplified Look at Feedback-Control in Uncertain Inference

What is missing in [PNRO7] and [Dam00] perspective is a vision of distributed memories
as attractors. The idea of localized memories serving as indices into distributed knowledge
stores is important, but is only half the picture of glocal memory: the creative, constructive,
dynamical-attractor aspect of the distributed representation is the other half. The closest thing
to a clear depiction of this aspect of glocal memory that seems to exist in the neuroscience
literature is a portion of William Calvin’s theory of the “cerebral code” [Cal96]. Calvin pro-
poses a set of quite specific mechanisms by which knowledge may be represented in the brain
using complexly-structured strange attractors, and by which these strange attractors may be
propagated throughout the brain. Figure 13.2 shows one aspect of his theory: how a distributed
attractor may propagate from one part of the brain to another in pieces, with one portion of
the attractor getting propagated first, and then seeding the formation in the destination brain
region of a close approximation of the whole attractor.

Calvin’s theory may be considered a genuinely glocal theory of memory. However, it also
makes a large number of other specific commitments that are not part of the notion of glo-
cality, such as his proposal of hexagonal meta-columns in the cortex, and his commitment to
evolutionary learning as the primary driver of neural knowledge creation. We find these other

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013196.txt,"280 15 Emergent Networks of Intelligence

15.2 Small World Networks

One simple but potentially useful observation about CogPrime Atomspaces is that they are
generally going to be small world networks [Buc03], rather than random graphs. A small world
network is a graph in which the connectivities of the various nodes display a power law behavior
— so that, loosely speaking, there are a few nodes with very many links, then more nodes with a
modest number of links ... and finally, a huge number of nodes with very few links. This kind of
network occurs in many natural and human systems, including citations among papers, financial
arrangements among banks, links between Web pages and the spread of diseases among people
or animals. In a weighted network like an Atomspace, small-world-ness must be defined in a
manner taking the weights into account, and there are several obvious ways to do this. Figure
15.1 depicts a small but prototypical small-worlds network, with a few hub nodes possessing
far more neighbors than the others, and then some secondary hubs, etc.

An excellent reference on network theory in general, including but not limited to small world
networks, is Peter Csermely’s Weak Links [Cse06]. Many of the ideas in that work have apparent
OpenCog applications, which are not elaborated here.

Fig. 15.1: A typical, though small-sized, small-worlds network.

One process via which small world networks commonly form is preferential attachment
[Bar02]. This occurs in essence when the rich get richer — i.e. when nodes in the network
grow new links, in a manner that causes them to preferentially grow links to nodes that already
have more links. It is not hard to see that CogPrime’s ECAN dynamics will naturally lead to

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011539.txt,"Ahraleh Yariv, in the command post for our mission, atop a hill on the Israeli
side of the northern border.

The sun set at around seven, but we waited for darkness. It was nearly eight
when we set out. Twenty minutes later, we crossed the border. I led the way,
with Motti Nagar, Moshiko, Kuti Sharabi and, finally, Avi Telem behind. We
carried the bugging equipment and our tools in our backpacks. Avi and I had a
pair of binoculars. Mine were bulkier, but offered a slightly better view in the
darkness. Each of us had an Uzi and a pair of grenades. All our planning had
been aimed at getting on to the Golan, installing the bug and getting out again. If
all went well, no one would even know we’d been there. But we had practiced
what to do if things went wrong. If challenged or ambushed by a Syrian patrol,
we would operate by old Company A rules. We would open fire.

The climb onto the plateau wasn’t too tough, not nearly as hard as our
sayeret training treks. When we reached the top, there was no obvious sign of
any Syrians. Still, we had to move slowly. Even with my binoculars, I could see
barely 30 yards into the moonless night, and I had to scan the route ahead, back
and forth, to make sure there were none of the fences or warning signs to keep
the Syrians’ own soldiers, or unsuspecting shepherds, from a minefield. Soon,
however, we found an obviously well-used footpath which I figured was very
likely to be safe.

When we had walked a few minutes, we found ourselves going through a
tangle of bushes and reeds, some of them up to two feet high, still dry and
crackly from the summer. Aside from the risk of tripping, I knew the noise we
were making might attract attention. I told the rest of the team to hang back 20
yards behind me. I moved forward to make sure the route was clear before
signaling them to follow. I had been slightly nervous on the climb up, not so
much because I expected trouble but because there was no way of knowing
what to expect. Much as I tried to put the concerns of the generals from my
mind, I also knew that this was no ordinary mission. But almost immediately,
the nerves had gone, and I was now focused only on getting us through the next
minute, the next 20 or 30 yards of the Golan.

But as soon as we’d made it across the plateau, we ran into trouble. We
needed to cross the Banias River. On our map, I’d picked out what looked to be
a Shallow ford. But the water was much higher than we expected. After
spending 30 minutes scouting the bank for 150 yards in either direction, we
settled on what seemed to be the shallowest part. Yet we hadn’t anticipated the
need to cross a river in full flow. Worse, we’d never trained to do it. Not had we

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016879.txt,"Throughout his career, whether studying language, advocating a realistic biology of
mind, or examining the human condition through the lens of humanistic Enlightenment
ideas, psychologist Steven Pinker has embraced and championed a naturalistic
understanding of the universe and the computational theory of mind. He is perhaps the
first internationally recognized public intellectual whose recognition is based on the
advocacy of empirically based thinking about language, mind, and human nature.

“Just as Darwin made it possible for a thoughtful observer of the natural world to
do without creationism, ” he says, “Turing and others made it possible for a thoughtful
observer of the cognitive world to do without spiritualism. ”

In the debate about AI risk, he argues against prophecies of doom and gloom,
noting that they spring from the worst of our psychological biases—exemplified
particularly by media reports: “Disaster scenarios are cheap to play out in the
probability-free zone of our imaginations, and they can always find a worried,
technophobic, or morbidly fascinated audience.” Hence, over the centuries: Pandora,
Faust, the Sorcerer’s Apprentice, Frankenstein, the population bomb, resource depletion,
HAL, suitcase nukes, the Y2K bug, and engulfment by nanotechnological grey goo. “A
characteristic of AI dystopias,”’ he points out, “is that they project a parochial alpha-
male psychology onto the concept of intelligence. . .. History does turn up the occasional
megalomaniacal despot or psychopathic serial killer, but these are products of a history
of natural selection shaping testosterone-sensitive circuits in a certain species of primate,
not an inevitable feature of intelligent systems.”

In the present essay, he applauds Wiener’s belief in the strength of ideas vis-a-vis
the encroachment of technology. As Wiener so aptly put it, “The machine’s danger to
society is not from the machine itself but from what man makes of it.”

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015810.txt,"120 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?

most famous case was a Russian journalist known as ‘S. He habitually
memorized things using association with places. In antiquity this was
taught as ‘the method of loci. The unusual thing was his inability to turn
the effect off, and he found it as much a curse as a blessing. He was unable
to forget useless information and found it hard to interpret complex
images, tending to see areas of color and shade rather than objects such as
trees, houses and fields.

Very recently some people have come forward, six in America and
one in the UK, who appear to have genuine photographic memories It is
well worth watching the TV documentary The Boy Who Can't Forget to
gain a sense of what this is like. These people appear to lack the ability to
forget, and this turns our understanding of memory on its head. It seems
memory might work the opposite way we thought. We had previously
thought we only remember what we pay attention to, but perhaps we must
actively forget, and this ability is missing in these subjects. Scientists are
studying these people to see if they can understand more about memory.

The Aging Brain

We can explode a myth and encourage older readers simultaneously.
Memory does not deteriorate with age, or at least not until we are very
old. Most studies looking at memory deterioration focus on the very
old and compare them with the very young. Even then, the differences
are small. When people are asked to attempt memory problems there
is a mild drop off with age but the results are quite similar. The most
likely reason older people don’t remember so well is they don’t believe
they can. Perhaps they don’t have as much incentive to remember new
information. Why learn someone’s name if you're unlikely to meet them
again? Since IQ actually increases with age, don't believe people when
they say you are going downhill from the age of 40. You are not!

Computer Brains

Computers are really quite simple compared with all the evolved
baggage we humans carry around. When a computer is presented with
instructions, for example, for a program like Excel and a file such as my
expenses, it will load everything into memory and ‘run it. The process of
running a program is simple. Each instruction is a number. The computer
reads the number, looks it up in a table, finds a corresponding number,
and writes that down. Essentially that’s all there is to it. From a simple
mechanism like this, we get the enormous complexity of a modern

an annual average production of six million tons, has dropped to two.

4. Tourism is a very promising field. The Island, very beautiful and with dozens of beaches,
has at least 14 points on both coasts that are potentially transformable into ideal sites
for building tourism poles similar to Puerto Banus in Spain or Casa de Campo in La
Romana, Dominican Republic.

5. Considering the number of researchers in the field of medicine, totally under-utilized,
the country would potentially be the perfect partner of large international
pharmaceutical industries, to both develop new medications and produce them.

6. Given the prestige (today somewhat reduced) of its health system, Cuba is potentially an
excellent site for medical tourism and a place to establish links with the North American
insurance systems. Havana is much closer to Key West than Miami is to Orlando in
Florida.

7. Whenever relations are really normalized and travel is facilitated and multiplies, Cuba
will become an ideal place to retire for tens of thousands of Cuban Americans and North
Americans who perceive an average of USS1,800 a month.

8. Cuba receives some three million tourists every year, and has eleven million inhabitants.
In a few years it could receive eleven million tourists and reach the classification of
paradise. A few daring and intelligent developers could transform the Isle of Pines, in
Cuba’s south, into the Mallorca of the Caribbean. In the United States there are 300,000
luxury yachts that could visit Cuba and dock in already existing as well as future marinas.

9. If relations between the United States and Cuba continue to deepen, it’s possible to
foresee a Free Trade Agreement that would allow the Island unlimited exports to the
richest market in the world.

10. Because of its geographical position, Cuba is an ideal hub for the distribution of ocean-
going and air cargo to North and South America.
11. Cuban-Americans, as occurred in the case of Taiwan and China, could transfer to Cuba

their business expertise, their relationships, and the capital they've created, which
would integrate the Island into the business and trade world of the United States.

12. The country, as happened in post-Communist Europe, would be the paradise of the best-
known North American fast-foot franchises such as MacDonalds, Burger King, KFC, etc..
13. The same thing would occur with department store chains: Zara, Corte Inglés, Macys,

Sears, and the rest of the best known establishments.
Weaknesses

1. The government of Raul Castro doesn’t want a regime change but rather an
improvement of the Communist model initiated in 1959. According to published and
verbal statements, the model foreseen isn’t even the Chinese or Vietnamese model, but

Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway walked to center stage for the best picture finale.

| was now standing against the wall at the first row of the first balcony. Lionsgate publicists Julie
Fontaine and Jennifer Peterson, both dressed in haute couture gowns and borrowed emeralds,
anxiously insisted | join their good luck group hug as best picture was announced. Despite my
faux pas, and my work on most of the year’s top films, including “Moonlight,” “Manchester by the
Sea’ and “Hidden Figures,” Oscar night | was in the “La La” camp due to my long friendship with
it's director Damien Chazelle.

So we three bejeweled broads were hugging tightly, wnen Faye broke Warren’s pregnant pause
and screamed La La Land”. The girls cried, the “La La” producers ran to the stage and | was
thinking about how to apologize to Marc Platt as he thanked his family. Then, the stage filled up
with men in headsets. Producer Jordan Horowitz, the class act of the evening, grabbed the right
card and calmly announced Moonlight. No Joke. Platt, Horowitz and their co-producer Fred
Berger handed their Oscars to Moonlight director Barry Jenkins, and producers Jeremy Kleiner
and Adele Romanski and left the stage as Mahershala Ali, the first Muslim actor to get the gold
guy, joined the cast waving his historic Oscar.

Julie and Jennifer ran to Soho House to oversee Lionsgate's victory party, where hundreds of
confused well-wishers waited to celebrate the “La La” wins, including Emma Stone’s best
actress, Justin Hurwitz’s best score, and Benj Pasek, Justin Paul and Justin Hurwitz’s best song
for “City of Stars.” At 32, Damien Chazelle also made history as the youngest best director ever.
Some, lacking any empathy for the winners and losers onstage, called this historic screw-up
great live-television.” But standing in the balcony, alone and speechless, all | could think was,
“How did | miss this?”

| ran to the Governor's Ball, which is the next stop for winners on their busy night. They get their
statues engraved there before they drop by their studio’s party, get photographed, Oscar in
hand at Vanity Fair's fete, wall-to-wall with celebrities, and then head to Guy Oseary's home
high in Beverly Hills to rock-and-roll ‘till dawn.

At the entrance to the Governor's Ball, Warren Beatty walked up to me, still holding the two
priceless envelopes as proof of his innocence. | asked him, What happened?

His phone rang. It was so noisy, he bent toward me to hear better. The phone was almost in my
face and | heard Annette Benning asking where he was and saying, Warren, come home.
Warren said, No. | have done nothing wrong.

Warren's wonderful film, Rules Don't Apply received little Academy love, yet he was generous
enough to show up. Now, fifty years after “Bonnie and Clyde,” he was in the Oscar spotlight

control? Imagine this scenario and run through questions 1-3 above. If you quit your job to test
other options, how could you later get back on the same career track if you absolutely had to?

What are you putting off out of fear? Usually, what we most fear doing is what we most need to
do. That phone call, that conversation, whatever the action might be—it is fear of unknown
outcomes that prevents us from doing what we need to do. Define the worst case, accept it, and do
it. Pll repeat something you might consider tattooing on your forehead: What we fear doing most is
usually what we most need to do. As I have heard said, a person’s success in life can usually be
measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have. Resolve to
do one thing every day that you fear. I got into this habit by attempting to contact celebrities and
famous businesspeople for advice.

What is it costing you—financially, emotionally, and physically—to postpone action? Don’t
only evaluate the potential downside of action. It is equally important to measure the atrocious cost
of inaction. If you don’t pursue those things that excite you, where will you be in one year, five
years, and ten years? How will you feel having allowed circumstance to impose itself upon you
and having allowed ten more years of your finite life to pass doing what you know will not fulfill
you? If you telescope out 10 years and know with 100% certainty that it is a path of
disappointment and regret, and if we define risk as “the likelihood of an irreversible negative
outcome,” inaction is the greatest risk of all.

What are you waiting for? If you cannot answer this without resorting to the previously rejected
concept of good timing, the answer is simple: You’re afraid, just like the rest of the world.
Measure the cost of inaction, realize the unlikelihood and re-pairability of most missteps, and
develop the most important habit of those who excel and enjoy doing so: action.

42(h)), and Edwards’s refusal to force his clients to accept modest settlement offers
was claimed to breach some duty that Edwards owed to Epstein. Interestingly, Epstein
never states that he actually made any settlement offers. Even more interestingly,
Epstein was never able to explain how a scheme to defraud third party investors ever
caused any legally cognizable damage to Epstein himself.

The supposed “proof” of the Complaint’s allegations against Edwards included
Edwards’s alleged contacts with the media, his attempts to obtain discovery from
high-profile persons with whom Epstein socialized, and use of “ridiculously
inflammatory” language in arguments in court. Remarkably, Epstein filed such
allegations against Edwards despite the fact that Epstein had sexually abused each of
Edwards’s clients and others while they were minors. Indeed, in discovery Epstein has
asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege rather than answer questions about the extent
of the sexual abuse of his many victims. Even more remarkably, after filing his suit
against Edwards, Epstein settled the three cases Edwards handled for an amount that
Epstein insisted be kept confidential. Without violating the strict confidentiality terms
required by Epstein, the cases did not settle for the “minimal value” that Epstein
suggested in his Complaint.

Because Epstein elected to hide behind the shield of his right against self incrimination
to preclude his disclosing any relevant information about the criminal activity at the
center of his claims, he was barred from prosecuting his case against Edwards. Under
the well-established “sword and shield” doctrine, Epstein could not seek damages
from Edwards while at the same time asserting a Fifth Amendment privilege to block
relevant discovery. Here, Epstein tried to do precisely what the “well settled” law
forbids. Specifically, he tried to obtain “affirmative relief’ — 1.e., forcing Edwards to
pay money damages — while simultaneously precluding Edwards from obtaining
legitimate discovery at the heart of the allegations that form the basis for the relief
Epstein was seeking. As recounted more fully in the statement of undisputed facts
filed in support of Edwards’ Motion for Summary Judgment, Epstein has refused to
answer such basic questions about his lawsuit as:

e “Specifically what are the allegations against you which you contend Mr.
Edwards ginned up?”

e “Well, which of Mr. Edwards’ cases do you contend were fabricated?”

e “Ts there anything in L.M.’s Complaint that was filed against you in September
of 2008 which you contend to be false?”

e “I would like to know whether you ever had any physical contact with the
person referred to as Jane Doe in that [federal] complaint?”

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031138.txt,"It was the great Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto who noticed — among other
things — that no matter what kind of government you think you have, there are

always some crafty insiders, the “foxes,” who take control of it.

Policies are set, programs are started... decisions are made... with no consent

of the people or their elected officials; the foxes work the angles.

Over time, the forces of law and order become more and more corrupt... as the

foxes bend the entire system to do their bidding.

Wars are started with no plan or intention to win them. Money is handed out

for no better reason than this: They can get away with it.

And best of all, most people are none the wiser; they believe the myths... and

attack anyone who challenges them.

Rip-Off

Perhaps the biggest rip-off of all time has taken place over the last eight years

— and in plain sight of everybody.

Via the magic of ultra-low rates, the Fed — a nest for the wiliest and most
cunning of the foxes — took roughly $8 trillion out of the pockets of savers and
retirees and handed it to borrowers.

Who is the world’s biggest borrower?

Yes... it’s the Deep State itself.

The Fed claimed to be helping to “stimulate” the economy. But you can’t really
stimulate an economy by stealing from the people who produce wealth and

provide it with capital.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020014.txt,"meant to defend and restore: trade agreements, or trade wars, that supported American
manufacturing; immigration policies that protected American workers (and, hence,
American culture, or at least America’s identity from 1955 to 1965); and an international
isolation that would conserve American resources and choke off the ruling class’s Davos
sensibility (and also save working-class military lives). This was, in the view of almost
everyone but Donald Trump and the alt-right, a crazy bit of voodoo economic and political
nonsense. But it was, for Bannon, a revolutionary and religious idea.

For most others in the White House, it was Bannon’s pipe dream. “Steve is ... Steve,”
became the gentle term of art for tolerating him. “A lot of stuff goes on in his head,” said
the president, pursuing one of his reliable conversational themes, dismissing Bannon.

But it wasn’t Bannon versus everybody else so much as it was Bannon Trump versus
non-Bannon Trump. If Trump, in his dark, determined, and aggressive mood, could
represent Bannon and his views, he could just as easily represent nothing at all—or
represent solely his own need for instant gratification. That’s what the non-Bannon people
understood about Trump. If the boss was happy, then a normal, incremental, two-steps-
forward-one-step-back approach to politics might prevail. Even a new sort of centrism, as
inimical to Bannonism as it was possible to conceive, could emerge. Bannon’s
pronouncements about a fifty-year rule for Trumpism might then be supplanted by the rule
of Jared, Ivanka, and Goldman Sachs.

By the end of March, this was the side that was winning. Bannon’s efforts to use the
epic health care fail as evidence that the establishment was the enemy had hopelessly
backfired. Trump saw the health care failure as his own failure, but since he didn’t have
failures, it couldn’t be a failure, and would in fact be a success—if not now, soon. So
Bannon, a Cassandra on the sidelines, was the problem.

Trump rationalized his early embrace of Bannon by heaping scorn on him—and by
denying that he had ever embraced him. If there was anything wrong with his White
House, it was Steve Bannon. Maligning Bannon was Trump’s idea of fun. When it came to
Bannon, Trump rose to something like high analysis: “Steve Bannon’s problem is PR. He
doesn’t understand it. Everybody hates him. Because ... look at him. His bad PR rubs off
on other people.”

The real question, of course, was how Bannon, the fuck-the-system populist, had ever
come to think that he might get along with Donald Trump, the use-the-system-to-his-own-
advantage billionaire. For Bannon, Trump was the game he had to play. But in truth he
hardly played it—or couldn’t help undermining it. While ever proclaiming it Trump’s
victory, he would helplessly point out that when he had joined the campaign it was facing
a polling deficit that no campaign, ten weeks from election day, had ever recovered from.
Trump without Bannon, according to Bannon, was Wendell Willkie.

Bannon understood the necessity not to take what otherwise might be Trump’s own

to know about the data they contained. These compartments were
the final line of defense against an inside intruder.

In 2009, Snowden, as we know, found his way into the NSA
through a temporary job with an outside contractor that was work-
ing for the NSA’s Technology Directorate to repair and update its
backup system. Four years later, by maneuvering to get hired by
another outside contractor with access to the NSA’s sources and
methods, he was able to steal secrets stored in isolated computers
bearing directly on the ongoing intelligence war. Snowden also
copied from these compartments in a matter of weeks, as has been
previously mentioned, the NSA’s Level 3 sources and methods used
against Russia, Iran, and China. The Snowden breach demonstrated
that the NSA’s envelope of secrecy was at best illusory.

After this immense loss, the NSA’s sources inside these adversary
countries were largely compromised, even if they were not closed
down. Once these adversaries were in a position to know what chan-
nels the NSA was intercepting, they could use these same channels
to mislead U.S. intelligence. A former top intelligence official told

© me, “The queen on our chessboard had been taken.” ©

The NSA moved to mitigate the damage and find new ways of
obtaining unexpected intelligence. In June 2014, the new NSA direc-
tor, Rogers, had to confront flagging morale that, according to Gen-
eral Hayden, was near paralyzing the intelligence service. Rogers
recognized that as a direct result of the Snowden breach, “the nation
has lost capabilities against adversaries right now who are attempt-
ing to actively undermine us.” But even with that loss, he observed,
“the sky has not fallen.”

As in the Chicken Little fable he cited, the world had not ended
for the NSA. Nor had it ended for the multibillion-dollar outsourc-
ing enterprise it superintended. The NSA might have lost many
of its sources, or “capabilities,” but Rogers held out hope that new
sources could eventually be found to replace them. Compromised
codes, after all, could be changed. New technological methods could
be devised. New vulnerabilities could also be targeted in enemy ter-
ritories. Although repairing the damage might take many “decades,”
according to Michael McConnell, the vice-chairman of Booz Allen,
the new director had to get on with that task. McConnell, a for-

encampment, on the other side of the kibbutz cemetery, where neatly stacked
boxes of munitions were being kept. But we spent the next several afternoons
on reconnaissance. A soldier was always on guard. But there were times the
area was unwatched, either when one guard handed over to the next, or on their
cigarette breaks.

We struck the following Friday. Nowadays, the cemetery consists of a half-
dozen rows of headstones. Walking through it, as I still do at least once each
year, 1s like revisiting my past. Almost all the grown-ups I remember from my
childhood now rest there, including my parents. My father died in 2002, at the
age of 92. My mother passed away only a few years ago, a few weeks after her
100 birthday. But in 1956, the cemetery was tiny. The chances of anyone being
there at midnight on a Friday were close to zero. Crouching in the shadow of the
headstones, we could see the guard. We waited until he left for his break. Each
of us took a wooden box and one of the slightly larger metal boxes. Inside, we
found a treasure trove: thousands of bullets for all kinds of weapons. The metal
cases held heavier firepower: grenades and mortars. We returned those. We
were mischievous, but not crazy. Yet each of us now had a crate full of
ammunition, even including belts for machine guns.

My experience at school began to change in my early teenage years as well.
Shortly before my fourteen birthday, our age group was sent to a school outside
Mishmar Hasharon. The kibbutz had decided that since there were only a
dozen-or-so children in each class, it wasn’t economically viable to provide a
quality education. They sent us to the regional high school.

It was several hundred yards down the road in the direction of Tel Aviv. It
was far more rigorous. I was no longer the only kid in my class who liked to
read or could do math problems in his head. It was there I first got truly

and Islam (1981). Then his interest in purely academic subjects expanded
to include modern Islam. He left the university because, as he told an
interviewer from Harvard Magazine, he has “‘the simple politics of a truck
driver, not the complex ones of an academic.” His story of being
harassed through the legal system by a Muslim who later committed
suicide was recently told in The American Spectator (“A Palestinian in
Texas,”’ TAS, November 2012). He has been personally threatened but
prefers not to talk about specifics except to note that law enforcement has
been involved. I interviewed Pipes shortly before Christmas, when the
Egyptians were voting on their new constitution. I started out by saying
that the number of Muslims in the U.S. has doubled since the 9/11 attacks.

DP: My career divides in two: before and after 9/11. In the first part I was
trying to show that Islam is relevant to political concerns. If you want to
understand Muslims, I argued, you need to understand the role of Islam in
their lives. Now that seems obvious. If anything, there’s a tendency to
over-emphasize Islam; to assume that Muslims are dominated by the
Koran and are its automatons—which goes too far. You can’t just read the
Koran to understand Muslim life. You have to look at history, at
personalities, at economics, and so on.

TB: Do you see the revival of [slam as a reality?

DP: Yes. Half a century ago Islam was waning, the application of its laws
became ever more remote, and the sense existed that Islam, like other
religions, was in decline. Since then there has been a sharp and I think
indisputable reversal. We’re all talking about Islam and its laws now.

TB: At the same time you have raised an odd question: “Can Islam
survive Islamism?” Can you explain that?

DP: I draw a distinction between traditional Islam and Islamism. Islamism
emerged in its modern form in the 1920s and is driven by a belief that
Muslims can be strong and rich again if they follow the Islamic law
severely and in its entirety. This is a response to the trauma of modern
Islam. And yet this form of Islam is doing deep damage to faith, to the
point that I wonder if Islam will ever recover.

The American Interest

The Conservative Revolutionary

Walter Russell Mead

June 12, 2011 -- The United States is the most revolutionary power in
the history of the world, but after more than 200 years of a brilliant
revolutionary career we are still not very good at understanding or
responding to the revolutions our example, our ideas, our economy
and our technology do so much to create.

The Arab spring is the latest example of the clash between America’s
revolutionary world role and our pathetic cluelessness about the
forces we do so much to promote. The Arab Spring is turning into a
long, hot summer. Civil wars in Libya, Syria and Yemen and the
sullen silence of the Shi’a in Bahrain have baptized Arab democracy
in blood. More will flow — and American foreign policy is
befuddled and bemused.

None of the experts look particularly smart at the moment. The
‘realists’ who counseled President Obama to forget George W.
Bush’s support of Middle Eastern democracy and cultivate our
relations with regional despots like Hosni Mubarak, the Iranian
mullahs and the younger Assad have been sent back to the benches in
disgrace. Their counsel is now seen as both morally dubious and
pragmatically unwise; the ‘realists’ would have put the US on the
wrong side of history in the service of unrealistic assumptions about
the stability of despotic regimes.

But the idealists who seek to replace them already have egg on their
faces. “Days, not weeks” is what they promised the President when
he began to bomb for democracy in Libya. The democratic
revolution in Egypt is looking less democratic by the day; it looks
more and more as if the Army used public unrest to block the

Quite an interesting article about the litigation between Deputy Banks and Rusty Rogers (see:

course, that Officers Rodgers was once well respected for his investigation and exposure of a
terrorist financing network that permeated the sunny state of Florida - (the NY Times reports) Agent
Rodgers joined the state’s elite investigative unit, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, where
he quickly earned agent-of-the-year honors — and a meeting with the governor — for helping
dismantle a terrorist financing network that stretched from Florida to the Middle East - and that
terrorism is very much a well-protected U.S. industry (see below).

God forbid some poor should get away with disrupting the delicate state of secreted operations; as

experience revolutions are usually the countries that lack the
preconditions for Anglo-American style relatively peaceful
revolutions that end with the establishment of stable constitutional
order. If things were going well in those countries, they would not be
having revolutions.

Historically, revolutions in foreign countries are both necessary for
their political development and inevitable. They often tend to make
American foreign policy more difficult — and the world more
dangerous. On the evidence so far, this is the pattern we are seeing in
the Middle East today.

Revolutionary Realism?

The difficulty American policymakers have in coming to grips with
the recurring phenomenon of foreign revolutions is rooted in
America’s paradoxical world role. We are not just the world’s
leading revolutionary nation; we are also the chief custodian of the
international status quo. We are upholding the existing balance of
power and the international system of finance and trade with one
hand, but the American agenda in the world ultimately aims to
transform rather than to defend.

It is harder to be an effective revolutionary power than to be a
conservative one — and it is harder still to combine the two roles.

A traditional conservative power knows what it wants. Revolutionary
powers have a tougher job; building the future is harder work than
holding on to the past. This is particularly true in the American case;
the global transformation we seek is unparalleled for depth,
complexity and scale.

We are not sure how this revolutionary transformation works. We
know that it involves liberal political change: governments of law
rather than of men and legitimacy derived from the consent of the
governed as measured in regular and free elections. We also know
that involves intellectual and social change: traditional religious ideas

Daniel C. Dennett

Daniel C. Dennett is University Professor and Austin B. Fletcher Professor of
Philosophy and director of the Center for Cognitive Studies at Tufts University. He is the
author of a dozen books, including Consciousness Explained and, most recently, From
Bacteria to Bach and Back: The Evolution of Minds.

Many have reflected on the irony of reading a great book when you are too young to
appreciate it. Consigning a classic to the a/ready read stack and thereby insulating
yourself against any further influence while gleaning only a few ill-understood ideas from
it is a recipe for neglect that is seldom benign. This struck me with particular force when
I reread Zhe Human Use of Human Beings more than sixty years after my juvenile
encounter. We should all make it a regular practice to reread books from our youth,
where we are apt to discover clear previews of some of our own later “discoveries” and
“inventions,” along with a wealth of insights to which we were bound to be impervious
until our minds had been torn and tattered, exercised and enlarged by confrontations with
life’s problems.

Writing at a time when vacuum tubes were still the primary electronic building
blocks and there were only a few actual computers in operation, Norbert Wiener
imagined the future we now contend with in impressive detail and with few clear
mistakes. Alan Turing’s famous 1950 article “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,”
in the philosophy journal Mind, foresaw the development of AI, and so did Wiener, but
Wiener saw farther and deeper, recognizing that AI would not just imitate—and
replace—human beings in many intelligent activities but change human beings in the
process.

We are but whirlpools in a river of ever-flowing water. We are not stuff that abides, but
patterns that perpetuate themselves. (p. 96)

When that was written, it could be comfortably dismissed as yet another bit of
Heraclitean overstatement. Yeah, yeah, you can never step in the same river twice. But
it contains the seeds of the revolution in outlook. Today we know how to think about
complex adaptive systems, strange attractors, extended minds, and homeostasis, a change
in perspective that promises to erase the “explanatory gap”® between mind and
mechanism, spirit and matter, a gap that is still ardently defended by latter-day Cartesians
who cannot bear the thought that we—we ourse/ves—are self-perpetuating patterns of
information-bearing matter, not “stuff that abides.” Those patterns are remarkably
resilient and self-restoring but at the same time protean, opportunistic, selfish exploiters
of whatever new is available to harness in their quest for perpetuation. And here is where
things get dicey, as Wiener recognized. When attractive opportunities abound, we are apt
to be willing to pay a little and accept some small, even trivial, cost-of-doing-business for
access to new powers. And pretty soon we become so dependent on our new tools that
we lose the ability to thrive without them. Options become obligatory.

The 24th annual Lifestyles Couples Convention has filled three hotels

in Palm Springs, California. The Convention Center is connected to one of
them, the Wyndham, which surrounds a large outdoor pool and patio
populated by couples busy socializing in 116-degree dry heat. Women and
men alike are wearing thongs. From afar they appear like so many eyeless
smiley faces among the bathing suits. The law that Sonny Bono signed
when he was mayor, banning thongs in public, does not apply to this
event, or, for that matter, to Cher.

The convention is for couples only. Except for me. I’ ve been hired
to perform stand-up comedy at their Friday luncheon, and |’ m here
alone. On the small, propellor plane from Los Angeles to Palm Springs, the
right side consists of two-seat rows, occupied entirely by couples on their
way to the convention—horny with the expectation of getting laid by the
spouse of a stranger, perhaps sitting in front of or behind them—and the
left side of the plane consists of one-seat rows, occupied entirely by me.

I' m afraid that the plane might tip over upon trying to land.

After a short discussion of the Qartarian’s visit—Epstein is serving

Twenty minutes later, after what ever business has been transacted or

“Why?” I asked Weingarten, when Epstein briefly steps out of the

“Why we camp out here? I find that question as mysterious as you

Shortly after Weingarten leaves, Epstein tells me that Eric Holder will
resign by the end of the week—which he does.

Epstein summons in the next person cooling his heels in the ante-

dotcom high flyer—a principle in a gaming company called DEN, a
notorious dotcom burnout, with its own sex scandal—who is now a leading

deep into the Shakes chocolates, focuses in on the Bitcoin investor.

“Okay,” he says, after listening for a bit, “I have opportunities here.

“Well,” says Pierce in what in some dramatic understatement, “you
are going to have some low quality characters playing the space...”

That evening, there is a small cocktail party, which includes the former
Prime Minister of Australian, Kevin Rudd, and Thorbjern Jaglandthe head

first bestseller, ‘The Art of the Deal’. Written in 1987, this book is a classic among American business books
and has influenced a generation of entrepreneurs. Trump wrote ‘The Art of the Deal’ when he was 41 years
old and having a successful run. The book’s popularity contributed to Time Magazine’s decision to feature
Donald Trump on its cover in January 1989.

>> The Wollman Rink was a heavily used public skating rink which had fallen into disrepair in 1980. New
York City tried for six years to fix it, spent $13 million, and the rink still was not ready to open. In June of
1986 Trump, who could see the rink from his apartment, finally got tired of the embarrassment and offered to
fix the rink at his own expense. At first the city turned him down because its bureaucracy did not want to be
embarrassed by someone fixing something they couldn’t fix. Trump kept pushing and finally out of
embarrassment the city gave in.

>>

>> The key part of the story is Trump’s reaction to being put in charge. He promptly recognized that he didn’t
know anything about fixing a skating rink. He asked himself who built a lot of skating rinks. “Canadians!” he
concluded. He found the best Canadian ice skating rink construction company. When the Canadians flew in
to assess the situation, they were amazed at how bad the city had been at solving the problem. They assured
Trump that this was an easy job. Trump fixed the six year embarrassment two months ahead of schedule and
nearly $800,000 under-budget. (The city did end up paying for the work, and Trump donated the profits to
charity.)

At first, I got many of the answers from my father. On Saturdays, we would
walk around the kibbutz as I plied him with questions. In many ways, he always
lacked self-confidence. I remember decades later, after he had passed away,
asking my mother how come they had spent their entire lives on the kibbutz and
never moved away. She replied: “What would your father have done outside?”
But he had a quick mind and, despite having left Hebrew University early, had
secured enough credits to get his degree — one of a handful of men on the
kibbutz to have done so. He delighted in acquiring, and sharing, knowedge.

How come the moon wasn’t always round, I remember asking him in one of
our first educational strolls. How did anyone know that the sabertooth tigers I'd
seen in the encyclopedia actually existed? And where were they now? There
was not a single question he did not try to help me answer. When I was nine or
ten, he took me to see the first water pump on the kibbutz. I watched as he
disassembled the casing, then the power unit, which had a big screw-like
element in the middle. I wanted to know how it worked, how it was designed.
How it was made. A few months later, he took me to the factory near Tel Aviv
where the pumps were manufactured.

I was an introverted child, not so much shy as self-contained, contemplative,
at times dreamy. Our metapelet from when I was three until age eight was
named Bina. She was the mother of twins a year younger than me. She was
more handsome than beautiful, with wavy dark hair. But she was full of
warmth. She was especially kind to me, which was no doubt one reason I felt
the effects of my collective upbringing less dramatically than some other
kibbutz children. When we were both much older, she used tell a story about my
slightly ethereal approach to life when I was in her charge. One winter
afternoon when I was four, she took our group on to the gentle rise on the
northern edge of the kibbutz, which at that time of year was full of wildflowers.
When she got there, she realized I had gone missing. Retracing her steps, she
found me standing in front of a rock in the middle of the dirt path. “Ehud,” she
said, “why didn’t you come with us?” I apparently replied: “I’m thinking: which
side of the rock should I go around?”

Still, important though Bina was as a presence in my life, it was the
influence of another figure — another youngster — who mattered more and for
longer. His name was Yigal Garber. In first grade, every child got a mentor.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019859.txt,"A CAUTIONARY TALE IN ‘THE USE OF
NON-COMPETE AGREEMENTS

BY DOUGLAS R. HIRSCH AND JENNIFER ROSSAN

Employers should give careful consideration to
the inclusion of non-competition provisions in
employment agreements for low-level employees.
The New York Attorney General (the “AG”) recently
announced that it settled investigations with two
companies over their use of non-compete provi-
sions in employment agreements for low-level
employees. Policing non-compete provisions is a
new regulatory frontier for the AG and it is flex-
ing its regulatory muscle pursuant to § 63 (12) of
New York's Executive Law, which provides the AG
with authority to enjoin businesses from utilizing
“unconscionable contractual provisions.”!

The AG investigated and recently settled charges
with two companies—Law 360 and Jimmy John’s
Gourmet Sandwiches—based on their use of
“unconscionable” non-compete provisions in
employment contracts. In the Law 360 matter, the
Attorney General found that Law 360’s policy of
requiring the majority of its employees—includ-
ing “rank and file” editorial staff who had little to
no knowledge of any trade secrets or confidential
information—to sign a one-year non-compete was
contrary to New York law. Because these employees
did not have access to trade secrets and confiden-
tial information, the AG charged that the non-
compete was not narrowly tailored to Law 360's
legitimate business interests and did nothing more
than baldly restrain competition. As part of the set-
tlement, Law 360 agreed that, going forward, only
a small number of its highly paid executives would
be required to sign non-compete agreements.

Similarly, in its investigation of Jimmy John’s, the
AG found that some franchisees required sandwich
makers to sign two-year non-competes that pre-
vented them from working at any establishment
within a two-mile radius of a Jimmy John’s loca-
tion that made more than 10% of its revenue from
sandwiches. The AG charged that these employ-
ees “are highly unlikely to be privy to trade secrets
or confidential customer lists or to have unique
skills.” Consequently, the AG concluded that the
non-compete provisions were “unconscionable”.
As part of its settlement, Jimmy John’s agreed to
inform its franchisees that the AG found the non-
compete provisions to be unlawful and void.

In both of these cases, the AG focused on the
effect of a non-compete provision on a low-level
employee. Companies should consider avoiding
the use of non-compete provisions for admin-
istrative personnel and other non-managerial
staff. Such provisions are appropriate and are
more likely to withstand scrutiny when included
in the employment agreements of senior per-
sonnel and individuals with unique skills—as
long as the provisions are drafted to protect a
legitimate business interest. Non-competes are

Non-competes are more
likely to be upheld if they
are designed to ensure that
a departing employee will
not provide a competitor
with an unfair competitive

advantage by supplying it

with the former employer's
trade secrets and/or
confidential information.

more likely to be upheld if they are designed to
ensure that a departing employee will not provide
a competitor with an unfair competitive advan-
tage by supplying it with the former employer's
trade secrets and/or confidential information.
However, it is important to note that requiring
all employees—including lower-level staff—to
adhere to confidentiality provisions that pro-
tect proprietary information and trade secrets
does not implicate the same concerns, because
enforcement of such provisions does not restrain
the employee from working elsewhere. Therefore,
confidentiality provisions should be used in all
employment agreements where the employee's
position involves access to confidential informa-
tion or trade secrets.

Even when a non-compete is appropriate—
such as in the case of a senior manager whose

departure would create an unfair advantage for
a competitor—its scope and duration must be
narrowly tailored to protect a legitimate busi-
ness interest. To be enforceable in New York,
a non-compete must be reasonable in time
and scope, necessary to protect the employer's
legitimate interests, not harmful to the public
and not unreasonably burdensome to the
employee.

In addition to confidentiality provisions, employers
should strongly consider the use of a non-solici-
tation provision in their employment agreements.
Non-solicitation provisions are generally enforce-
able if they are reasonably related to the employ-
er’s interest in protecting relationships with clients
the employee worked with or became familiar with
while employed. But like non-compete agree-
ments, non-solicitation provisions must also be
limited in time and scope.

dreams without reverting to work for work’s sake (W4W). After years of repetitive work, you will
often need to dig hard to find your passions, redefine your dreams, and revive hobbies that you let
atrophy to near extinction. The goal is not to simply eliminate the bad, which does nothing more than
leave you with a vacuum, but to pursue and experience the best in the world.

Getting Off the Wrong Train

The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool.
—RICHARD P. FEYNMAN, Nobel Prize—winning physicist

Eoncue is enough. Lemmings no more. The blind quest for cash is a fool’s errand.

I’ve chartered private planes over the Andes, enjoyed many of the best wines in the world in between
world-class ski runs, and lived like a king, lounging by the infinity pool of a private villa. Here’s the
little secret I rarely tell: It all cost less than rent in the U.S. If you can free your time and location, your
money is automatically worth 3-10 times as much.

This has nothing to do with currency rates. Being financially rich and having the ability to live like a
millionaire are fundamentally two very different things.

Money is multiplied in practical value depending on the number of W’s you control in your life: what
you do, when you do it, where you do it, and with whom you do it. I call this the “freedom multiplier.”

Using this as our criterion, the 80-hour-per-week, $500,000-per-year investment banker is less
“powerful” than the employed NR who works 4 the hours for $40,000, but has complete freedom of
when, where, and how to live. The former’s $500,000 may be worth less than $40,000 and the latter’s
$40,000 worth more than $500,000 when we run the numbers and look at the lifestyle output of their
money.

Options—the ability to choose—is real power. This book is all about how to see and create those
options with the least effort and cost. It just so happens, paradoxically, that you can make more money—
a lot more money—by doing half of what you are doing now.

So, Who Are the NR?

e+» The employee who rearranges his schedule and negotiates a
remote work agreement to achieve 90% of the results in one-tenth

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020000.txt,"The news of the attorney general’s recusal exploded like an IED in the White House.
Sessions was Trump’s protection against an overly aggressive Russian investigation. The
president just could not grasp the logic here. He railed to friends: Why would Sessions not
want to protect him? What would Sessions gain? Did he think this stuff was real? Sessions
needed to do his job!

In fact, Trump already had good reason to worry about the DOJ. The president had a
private source, one of his frequent callers, who, he believed, was keeping him abreast of
what was going on in the Justice Department—and, the president noted, doing a much
better job of it than Sessions himself.

The Trump administration, as a consequence of the Russia story, was involved in a
high-stakes bureaucratic push-pull, with the president going outside government to find
out what was happening in his own government. The source, a longtime friend with his
own DOJ sources—many of the president’s rich and powerful friends had their own
reasons to keep close tabs on what was happening at the Justice Department—fed the
president a bleak picture of a Justice Department and an FBI run amok in its efforts to get
him. “Treason” was a word that was being used, the president was told.

“The DOJ,” the president’s source told him, “was filled with women who hated him.”
It was an army of lawyers and investigators taking instructions from the former
administration. “They want to make Watergate look like Pissgate,” the president was told.
This comparison confused Trump; he thought his friend was making a reference to the
Steele dossier and its tale of the golden showers.

After the attorney general’s recusal, the president, whose instinctive reaction to every
problem was to fire someone, right away, thought he should just get rid of Sessions. At the
same time, there was little doubt in his mind about what was happening here. He knew
where this Russia stuff was coming from, and if these Obama people thought they were
going to get away with it they had another think coming. He would expose them all!

One of Jared Kushner’s many new patrons was Tony Blair, the former —British prime
minister, whom Kushner had gotten to know when, on the banks of the River Jordan in
2010, they both attended the baptism of Grace and Chloe Murdoch, the young daughters
of Rupert Murdoch and his then wife, Wendi. Jared and Ivanka had also lived in the same
Trump building on Park Avenue where the Murdochs lived (for the Murdochs it was a
temporary rental apartment while their grand triplex on Fifth Avenue was —renovated, but
the renovation had lasted for four years), and during that period Ivanka Trump had
become one of Wendi Murdoch’s closest friends. Blair, godfather to Grace, would later be
accused by Murdoch of having an affair with his wife, and of being the cause of their
breakup (something Blair has categorically denied). In the divorce, Wendi got the Trumps.

But once in the White House, the president’s daughter and son-in-law became the

an adversary’s intelligence organization that it could not mount any
of its own surprise cyber attacks. It would also make it difficult if not
impossible for adversary services to recruit a spy in the NSA. For
example, the CIA penetration of the SVR in 2010 prevented it from
using its sleeper network against U.S. targets. “The best defense
in this game may be an overwhelming offensive,” a former intel-
ligence official said to me. “But that strategy only works if we can
keep secret sensitive sources.”

Central to this offensive strategy was the NSA’s National Threat
Operations Center in Oahu. It employed threat analysts to surrep-
titiously monitor the secret activities of potential enemies, mainly
China, Russia, and North Korea. A large part of their job was to
make transparent to the United States the hostile activities of the
Russian and Chinese services so that they posed little if any intel-
ligence threat to America. This strategy worked so long as the NSA
guarded itself, but it also raised the issue, as the Roman Juvenal
famously warned, “Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?” (Who will guard
the guards themselves?)

© Less than three years after the NSA had received the Poteyev ©
warning, instead of guarding secrets, Snowden stole them. Despite
all the measures the NSA had taken to protect its vital secrets, a
lowly civilian employee had walked away with the lists of secret
NSA sources in China and Russia and then gone first to China and
then to Russia. In the hands of their intelligence services, these stolen
lists had the potential to totally upend the NSA’s offensive strategy.
Because Russia and China have an intelligence treaty for sharing
such spoils between them when it is to their mutual advantage, it
had to be assumed that if either country had acquired the secrets
from Snowden, they would be shared between them, altering the
balance of power between the communications intelligence services
of the United States and its adversaries.

Following the Snowden breach, both China and Russia had
immense successes in breaking through the defenses of U.S. govern-
ment networks, including the reported breaches in 2014 and 2015 of
U.S. personnel files and background checks. When I asked General
Hayden in June 2015 if these successes were made easier by those
documents compromised by Snowden, he replied, “Even though I

Caroline Kennedy Selling 93 Acres on Martha's Vineyard 
Caroline Kennedy, the only surviving child of the late President John F. Kennedy, listed for sale about 90 acres 
of land in Martha's Vineyard, a resort island off the Massachusetts coast. 
Two waterfront parcels in the town of Aquinnah are on the market -- a 39.5-acre (16-hectare) property available 
for $20 million, and a 53.5-acre piece for $25 million, according to the listings for 6 Red Gate Farm and 8 Red 
Gate Farm. 
An exclusive waterfront property with incredible views of Squibnocket Pond, with further views over towering 
sand dunes to the Atlantic Ocean, the listing for 6 Red Gate Farm reads. Plenty of privacy with varied 
topography and easy pond access. Yours to create a marvelous estate. 
The land is part of a 366-acre stretch that has been private since Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis bought it in 1978, 
said John O'Connell, broker and owner of Vineyard Realty Group in Edgartown, Massachusetts. 
The property is a piece of the island that very few people have seen, said O'Connell, who isn't involved in the 
sale. 
Corporate records for Red Gate Farm LLC, which owns the land, lists Edwin A. Schlossberg as the person 
responsible for the parcels. He is the husband of Caroline Kennedy, who is expected to be Obama's choice as 
the next U.S. ambassador to Japan.

Police say woman tried to smuggle pot into prison

By BRIAN O’CONNOR
Daily News Staff

A Mon Bijou woman tried to sneak
two bags of marijuana into Golden
Grove, police said.

Sherifa Petersen, 27, faces a single
charge of introducing contraband
into prison, and was free on $10,000
bail about six hours later, according
to her arrest record.

VI. police arrested Petersen on
Friday afternoon about 1:47 p.m.,
after corrections officers discovered

the marijuana hidden in the personal
belongings of inmate Omari Gordon,
according to Petersen’s arrest log.

Rick Mullgrav, Director of the Bu-
reau of Corrections, said corrections
officers discovered the marijuana
during a routine search.

Petersen “was bringing a pack-
age for her companion, and I will
say her companion, because I’m not
sure what the relationship was there,”
Mullgrav said. “She was coming to
visit, and she brought some drugs.”

Corrections officers told police

they had smelled marijuana in a pair
of black Jordan sneakers Petersen
was bringing to Gordon, according to
a VIPD press release. When correc-
tions officers pulled apart the sneak-
ers, they discovered two small plastic
bags of marijuana, according to the
press release.

Any material that ends up in the
hands of prisoners is thoroughly
searched as a matter of routine, Mull-
grav said.

“We search any item that goes to
the inmates,” he said. “Generally

speaking, it’s pretty thorough.”

Gordon, 32, has been in jail
since police charged him with first-
degree attempted murder and first-
degree assault following a Nov. 29
shooting on St. Croix, authorities
have said.

Gordon’s name also matches that
of a man charged in 2010 with the
murder of 19-year-old Kendal Wood.
Gordon’s trial languished in the Su-
perior Court on St. Croix for almost
three years, and he was most recently
granted a continuance in 2013.

The disposition of the murder
case involving Gordon couldn’t be
immediately ascertained Monday
evening.

Gordon had been released on elec-
tronic monitoring and house arrest
pending trial in 2013, according to
court documents at the time.

He was being held on $500,000
bail in his most recent arrest, police
said.

Federal judges from Philadelphia in the Virgin Islands to hear cases

By BRIAN O’CONNOR
Daily News Staff

The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Ap-
peals will sit this week in the federal
courthouse on St. Thomas.

Judges Kent Jordan, Michael Cha-
gares and Thomas Hardiman will hear
a range of appellate cases, ranging
from a local prisoner challenging his
detention as unconstitutional to an es-

tate battle over an inheritance in which
two separate federal cases were merged
into one.

The judges fly in from Philadelphia
to hear argument on issues they decide
at a later date.

Appellate court argument is based
around rapid-fire questions from the
empaneled judges, unlike civil or
criminal court, which frequently is
dominated by long exchanges between

attorneys and witnesses.

The appellant attorney gets four min-
utes to make a case, followed by four
minutes from the appellee, followed by
four minutes of rebuttal from the appel-
lant attorney, though judges’ questions
can sometimes turn four minutes into
eight.

For example, Ronald Gillette, incar-
cerated in 2008 on multiple counts of
aggravated rape and unlawful sexual

contact against two children, is seeking
an appeal on a motion denying his re-
lease from custody.

Gillette’s attorney, Joseph DiRuzzo
III, began on Monday by making his
case that the motion, ordered by Chief
District Court Judge Wilma Lewis,
constituted a final judgement and thus
was worthy of an appeal. DiRuzzo
sought a three-judge panel to overturn
Lewis's order.

It didn’t take long for Jordan to ask
a question.

“How can it be a final order if there
are still claims in the case, if you’re still
seeking relief, which you are?” he said.

DiRuzzo had a response.

“The denial of a three-judge panel
effectively throws Mr. Gillette out of
court,” he said. He started to add to this,
but Jordan cut him off.

“There are claims for relief, they still
exist,” he said. “I’m struggling to see
how this is a final judgement.”

Orders relating to the change in
the reduction of a prison population
essentially rely on three-judge pan-
els to be valid, DiRuzzo said. Pris-
on orders issued by a single judge
are subject to challenge on appeal,
DiRuzzo said.

“IT would submit that three-judge
courts are desirable in confrontations
between state and federal power,” he
said.

Kimberly Salisbury was the Assis-
tant Attorney General arguing for the
appellee. Her job on Monday was to
tell three federal judges that it wasn’t
their job to decide Gillette’s case.

“This particular order is just simply
not final,” she said, at one point.

However, Hardiman had a question.

If there was an order short of Gil-
lette’s release that could make the
prison resolve the Eighth Amendment
violations that put the prison under a
federal consent decree for decades to
resolve, Lewis or another judge could
still make the determination. The pris-
on has completed only 14 percent of
the new consent decree ordered in 2013
according to testimony.

“What would that order look like?”
Hardiman asked.

Salisbury struggled with an answer.

Jordan tried to steer the argument
back to the facts of the case.

“Does the fact that a 2013 consent
decree superseded and replaced the
original, does it mean the three decades
of prior noncompliance is to be ig-
nored?” he said. “You're not even a fifth
of the way completed. At what point is
enough enough?”

Complying with the consent decree
will take time, Salisbury said.

“According to the Bureau of Correc-
tions, we're not there yet,” she said.

Chagares jumped in, and compared
Golden Grove Adult Correctional Fa-
cility to a luxury cruise liner.

“Tt’s like your big cruise ships out in
the bay,” he said. “It takes a long time
to turn around. But this is a really long
time.”

Hearings will continue today before
the Third Circuit at the DeLugo Federal
Building on St. Thomas at 9 a.m. An-
other session is set for Thursday start-
ing at 10:30 a.m.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013627.txt,"youngest, unmarried, was teaching bilingual mathematics in high school. | had
waited several years for this occasion.. The meeting took place in a large, gray,
unmarked warehouse building that was crowded in back with high stacks of storage
cartons. The large, cement floored, open space in front of the storage boxes was
occupied by rows of metal folding chairs. They faced an unadorned, elevated
wooden platform upon which was a lectern and microphone. Behind the lectern
stood a casual array of a dozen or so young people, singing hymns and playing a
variety of instruments. These included piano, two or three guitars and upright bass,
tenor saxophone, trombone, trumpet, mouth organ and two snare drums. Sounding
a bit like a Salivation Army Band, they played and sang, “They cast their nets in
Galilee just off the hills of brown; such happy simple fisher folk, before the Lord
came down...the peace of God, it is no peace, but strife closed in the sod. Yet let us
pray for but one thing, the marvelous peace of God.”

The building, used for commercial storage, packaging and mass mailings
during the week and a Charismatic Christian word church on Sunday, was located
at the rear of an unfinished strip mall. A new and well-polished yellow Cadillac
Deville was the only vehicle parked in the no parking zone immediately in front of
the entrance to the warehouse. My youngest explained that the car belonged to Carl
Austin, the self-discovered and declared pastor, who spontaneously rose up to lead
without academic religious training or a conventional ordination. The bright yellow
car was explained as evidence of the power of God. Paraphrasing Mark, my son
told me “...he who does not doubt in his heart and believes that those things he
says will come to pass, he will have whatever he says...whatever things you ask for
when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them.” The car
served as a glorious instantiation of the church’s major promise of the rewards of
faith.

Pastor Carl Austin, a tall, blonde, portly man in his early thirties with a
resonant tenor voice, was the youngest of several children of a poor Midwest farm
family. He had been a state college drop out and without a career or a job. His
sermons contained stories about how he had caught spiritual fire at a revival

meeting conducted by Kenneth Hagin of Kenneth Hagin Ministries, aka Rhema

Coming soon: More estate-tax battles 
The word permanent — at least in the corridors of Washington, D.C. — doesn't mean what you think it 
means. And that should prompt you to keep a close eye on your estate plans. 
More inheritance headaches loom. 
The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which was 
signed into law in early January, established a 
permanent $5 million estate-tax exemption. The 
legislation also set the same $5 million exemption for the 
federal gift tax and generation-skipping transfer tax. 
(That figure is indexed for inflation, which makes the 
2013 exemption $5.25 million.) 
But as Kelly Greene reported this weekend in the Walt 
Street Journal, President Barack Obama's fiscal year 
2014 budget calls for lowering the exclusion for estate taxes and the generation-skipping transfer tax to 
$3.5 million (albeit not until 2018). The gift-tax exemption, meanwhile, would drop to $1 million. The 
proposed figures would be a return to 2009 levels and would no longer be indexed for inflation. 
According to the proposed budget, the changes — coupled with closing other estate-tax loopholes — 
would raise $79 billion over 10 years. Which means that the only permanent thing about estate planning 
would be efforts by financial advisers and tax attorneys to stay one step ahead of Washington's search 
for revenue. 
To be sure, the president's proposals are unlikely to be enacted in their current form. But Greene 
highlights several possible changes that investors and families should watch for: 
Discounts could disappear. Currently, the value of a minority share in a business — when transferred 
from one family member to another — can be discounted, resulting in a tidy tax savings. The White 
House, in previous budgets, has called for limiting or eliminating such discounts to family members. But 
the absence of that idea in the budget for 2014 could mean the Obama administration believes the 
Treasury Department already has the authority to change the rules — and simply will issue new 
regulations to do so. If that's the case, families considering such transfers might want to act sooner 
rather than later. 
GRATs could get watered down. A grantor-retained annuity trust, or GRAT, lets a person give a portion 
of an asset's future profits to heirs tax-free. (One popular use of GRATs: Passing along stocks whose 
prices are depressed.) Such transfers take place over a set time period — as short as two years. But the 
president's budget would require GRATs to have a minimum term of 10 years, making these trusts less

Individual retirement accounts could get emptied faster. Currently, people who inherit IRAs and 
similar tax-deferred savings accounts are able to stretch their withdrawals across their life expectancy. 
The budget proposal would require most beneficiaries — other than widows and widowers — to cash out 
the accounts within five years. Already, Greene notes, some older adults whose wealth is concentrated 
in IRAs are considering moving the accounts into trusts to help their families keep up with, and follow, 
the rules.

ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY Challenges of Artificial Intelligence:
Envisioning and Addressing Adverse Outcomes

true today to some extent, but the above advances in ML/Al could make the situation substantially
worse, in extreme cases perhaps even rendering useful mass communication on the internet
untenable.

The rising capabilities can be used in multiple ways in multiple settings with multiple goals. Some uses
may be subtle and employed over time to do important but damaging biasing of sentiment about
individuals and groups of people. The capabilities can be combined to enable identity theft or identify
distortion for destroying the reputation of people and groups. As such, these abilities could enable
small groups to wield great power in multiple arenas and for new forms of blackmail, threats, and
control.

SUMMARY

Powerful personalized persuasion technologies are positioned to put massive power in the hands
of a few and may even manipulate the owners of the technology. Powerful propaganda and
persuasion machines threatens to undermine democracy, free availability of information about the
state of the world, and, more generally, freedom of thought. Leaders may increasingly depend
upon such propaganda optimization systems for attaining and holding power. Over time, even the
potential initial owners of such systems might become unaware or unable to control these
systems—and may believe the propaganda themselves.

In the longer-term, there is the possibility that one or multiple systems, or distributed coalitions of
systems communicating implicitly or explicitly could autonomously persuade, subjugate, and
control populations. Pathways to such situations include the side effects of rise in the large-scale
use by people of communicating personalized filters that interpret and pool information with the
initial intention of grappling with widespread uses of manipulative information.

SAMPLE TRAJECTORY

e ML-based customized advert placement continues to prove highly successful, generating revenues
for large online companies

e Profits from online content (online newspapers behind paywalls, charitable contributions to
information sources e.g. Wikipedia) stagnate or decline

e Anincreasing number of information sources enter into collaborations with media brokers who
offer content customization in exchange for ad-revenue sharing

e Poor oversight of content personalization outcomes (there are, after all, billions of ad versions
being shown, and updated on an hourly basis), means that for some ad content (political parties,
pharmaceuticals) for some minority of target audiences (especially less privileged) the effect is very
harmful.

KEY POINTS
e New directions with generation of provocative, believable content, hacking of identity
e Algorithmic manipulation of data to optimize desired behavior regardless of content

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018574.txt,"Questions I Want To Ask Entitled Cis Het Men, Part 1: Who Cares?
Why do I care about masculinity?

I'm rather perverted, but not enormously queer. I present as femme, and -- although I've
been known to tease my sensitive (frequently long-haired) lovers for being
unmasculine -- I fall in love with men. I'm hardly one to go for the manly man type,
but at heart, I love knowing that I'm fucking a man.

However, because I'm cisgendered and straight, I feel profoundly at a loss when trying to
articulate problems of (for lack of a better phrase) Men's Empowerment. The issues
don't feel native to me; I've intersected with these questions mainly through the lens of
lovers and friends. Watching their struggle is demoralizing, but trying to imagine how I
can give them feedback is more demoralizing.

A male friend once wrote to me, I think you personally find expressions of
masculinity hot, but you also have no patience with sexism. You've caught on that it's
tricky for men to figure out how to deliver both of these things you need, that you don't
have a lot of good direction to give to fellas about it, and that neither does anyone else.

So:
How can men be supportive and non-oppressive while remaining overtly masculine?

On top of my limited perspective, there's been an echoing lack of discourse -- that is, very
little mainstream acknowledgement of the problems of masculinity. The primary factor in
that silence is that normative cis men themselves tend to be flatly unwilling to discuss
gender/sex issues. Often, their first objection is that the discussion is neither important
nor relevant. This is true even within subcultures centered around sexual analysis, like the
BDSM world -- I once met a cis male BDSMer who said, Why bother talking about
male sexuality? It's the norm. Fish don't have a word for water.”

But if masculine sexuality is water and we're fish, why doesn't that motivate us to
examine it more -- not less?

Don't get me wrong: I agree that America's sexual conceptions are centered around
stereotypical male sexuality, and I agree that this is damaging and problematic. Believe
me, I'm furious that it took me many years to reconceive actual sex around acts other
than good ole penis-in-vagina penetration! But if American stereotypes and ideas of
sexuality are male-centered, then surely that makes it more useful for us to be thinking
about male sexuality -- not less.

And those male-centered ideas of sexuality aren't centered around all men -- just
stereotypical men. LGBTQ men are obvious examples whose sexuality falls outside the
norm; fortunately for them, they've created some spaces to discuss that. But there are lots
of other non-normative guys who aren't gay or queer, yet feel very similar sexual
alienation -- and because there's so little discourse about masculinity outside LGBTQ
circles, they usually just don't talk about it.

What does it mean to be a cis het man whose sexuality isn't normative? Which straight
cis guys don't fit -- and hence, feel alienated from -- our current overarching sexual

sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein. He was -- he was
part of the procedure that was including the
nonprosecution agreement.

In August of 2009, he filed a complaint on
behalf of Virginia Roberts. That complaint indicated
that Virginia Roberts had been sexually abused in
Florida, in New York, and in -- in other places, as I
recall. The thing that -- that I particularly recall
was that Mr. Josefsberg had said, Virginia Roberts was
abused by -- and he gave some categories of people.

He mentioned, I think, business people. He
mentioned royalty, and he mentioned academicians. And
so to tie into your question, I knew that Professor
Dershowitz was an academician. And so what I was seeing
now was, that according to a very, very respected
attorney here in Florida, he had found Virginia Roberts
to be credible, and had filed a lawsuit against

Mr. Epstein saying that she had been trafficked,
sexually trafficked, you know, not just abused by
Mr. Epstein, but now being forcibly sent to, you know,
other people to abuse.

And in the categories of people that were
sexually abusing her were academicians, and I knew that
Mr. Dershowitz fell within that category of -- of being

an academician. The -~ that complaint also indicated
that there might be flight logs that would show that
Virginia Roberts had been sexually abused in these

various locations. And that started to indicate to me
that there might be what the law refers to as a common

scheme or plan. And that, just as Virginia Roberts was

being trafficked to these powerful people in various

places, there might well be other girts.

And so I have mentioned a flight log, and let

you -~ you wanted to talk about Mr. Dershowitz. On --

on December 30th, 2009, I was aware that there was a

flight log showing Mr. Dershowitz flying with Tatiana,

who as far as I can tell was not a business person, was

not providing financial advice or something else.

I understood that Mr. Epstein was a

billionaire who was heavily involved in financial

issues. I knew that Tatiana was on a plane with

Mr, Dershowitz, and then there was also, if I recall

correctly, working from memory as -~ as you were
wondering about, there was a notation that
Mr, Dershowitz was on a plane with one female.

And so I was -~ when I looked at that, I'm
seeing Mr. Dershowitz on a -- on a flight with a woman
who doesn't seem to be there for, frankly anything other
than sexual purposes or something along those lines with
Mr. Epstein, with Mr, Epstein, who is a sex trafficker,
and with one female which seemed to me to be a potential
entry for disguising international sex trafficking. So
that was of concern.

I then began to look at, well, I wonder, how
would I find out if Mr. Dershowitz had been abusing
other girls? Let's see. I knew that Virginia Roberts
had been forced to -~ to -- to -- to do this sort of

I appreciate the opportunity to respond to your email. I am currently on a plane until noon pacific time, and then 
heading to a meeting right after landing, till about 2 pm or so. While I am running the risk that you will report 
my comments, if you do, either out of context, or incompletely, I am responding with an effort to be complete, 
as I always try and do with reporters. If you decide to go ahead with a story, which, after reading my responses, 
I hope you decide is inappropriate, I would like you to quote my responses fully in order not to distort them. 
It is hard to know how to respond to a list of false and/or distorted allegations, along with misleading 
statements. I treat people I interact with with respect, and I work hard to support and mentor students, 
colleagues, and members of the general public, and this is supported by the institutions of which I am a part. I 
do not sexually harass people. If the purpose of your reporting is to somehow argue that Universities and other 
institutions are lax in dealing with well known individuals like myself, then in fact the situation is quite the 
opposite. My high public profile opens me up to more scrutiny at these institutions, not less, and it also opens 
me up to a host of unfounded outside complaints and allegations that other faculty do not receive, each of which 
the University has to respond to. The fact that I have remained a professor in all Universities with which I have 
been associated, in good standing, and also an officer or an invited speaker at organizations like CFI, which 
have strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the fact that their experience validates a trust in my 
behavior. I was asked to be an honorary director of CFI, and continue to be invited to their last 3 meetings to 
speak, specifically because, as they have written me after the fact, the attendees universally appreciated my 
talks, my courtesy, and graciousness in spending time with the attendees. If the purpose of your report is to 
impugn my integrity or suggest I have a history of harassment, that too is false. As noted in one of your 
'miscellaneous facts', as a scientist I try and remain skeptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather than 
allegations and innuendo by people whose motives I cannot judge. I also try and judge the facts in context. The 
fact that Universities and other organizations employ me or have me on their boards, or invite me to meetings is 
because they value my contributions and my actions. 
The items you list are false or distorted. Item 1 refers to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in 2006 where 
we mutually decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be appropriate, and there 
were respectful and platonic encounters afterwards. There is nothing to comment on in item 3, which involves 
an anonymous 3rd party claim because I know nothing about it, there are no details provided, and it clearly was 
not taken seriously enough to result in any university action. Item 4 is confusing. Are you saying that because I 
decided I didn't want to go out to a bar with a group of attendees that I was harassing them? The second part 
did not happen. Re incident 5: The 'female companion' in this case is my wife, who accompanied me on the 
cruise, and has attested to the fact that the claim is false. This is what I wrote at the time in response to the blog 
in question, causing it to be taken down. 
It is worth responding to Item 2 and 6 in more detail, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031270 
Re item 2: the student in question was interested in science communication, and on dozens of occasions came 
to me, asked me to talk over coffee, or wrote to me with questions. When she asked about advice for after 
graduation I DID tell her she was different than the other students in her year. The rest of them were interested 
in going on to graduate school in physics, but she was interested in science communication so I told her that she 
might want to take a different path. Since she was the only woman in her year, as I recall, I did ask her on one 
of these occasions if that made it difficult for her in any way. I asked, because as a faculty member and 
department chair I was interested in knowing what we could do, if necessary to encourage more women to go 
into physics, and also because as someone she had asked for career advice from I wanted to know if that made a 
difference to her. Re asking her for dinner.. I have gone back over emails from that period. I have numerous 
requests from her asking me to go for coffee to talk, which I usually had to turn down because I was busy, and 
on several occasions she asked me to have coffee with her off campus to talk, and I politely declined. I did let 
her accompany me off campus one time to watch me do a BBC interview because she specifically requested it, 
and I believe she found it useful. I did and do have coffee and meals with students on campus, and I see 
nothing wrong with this. I try to treat students as respected colleagues if possible. I was shocked when I later 
learned of the complaint she was apparently asked to lodge to the University, not least because there was no 
inappropriate interaction but also because, well after the dates you listed on which she was apparently offended, 
she continued to email me with joking questions or comments. Also, at a later AAAS conference, again in 
2008, for which she had asked, and for which I had written her a letter of recommendation to attend, my wife 
and I gave her a lift in our taxi well out out of our way in order to drop her off at her hotel, and I note in an 
email response to her email about the conference, again in 2008, I expressed that I would pass her regards along 
to my wife and vice versa. When the University later informed me of the complaint I was shocked and 
concerned. When I spoke to the human resources person, including relating my concerns and explaining the 
situation, I was told that no formal complaint of sexual harassment was requested. By that time I learned of the 
complaint I had already announced my intentions to leave Case to accept an offer at ASU—a very difficult 
decision for me because of my long-standing attachment to the University, the excellent relations I had with my 
colleagues there— both among the faculty (many of whom in physics I had hired while department chair)) and 
among the administration, along with a very attractive counter-offer by Case. Because I was already in Arizona 
at the later time I was asked not to have any further interaction with the student I agreed to that request, both to 
respect her sensitivities and also because it was basically moot because I was not on campus. Following this 
episode, as indicated in the letter to the student, I did assess what might have led to misinterpretations by this 
student, and became more careful in offering advice when talking to students. I was also told by human 
resources that because it was decided to handle this informally and not formally, that (a) it should remain 
confidential, which I, at least abided by, and (b) if no further complaints were lodged in that case, that the 
University would preserve its confidentiality and remove the complaint from my record after 5 years, which 
makes me surprised and concerned that someone violated that written agreement with you. 
Re item 6: You report on ASU's response to item #6 , without including the fact that the University specifically 
stated there were never any allegations of sexual misconduct or harassment by me at the University, and 
moreover that the 'outside complaints' were in fact related specifically to your item #6. Further you neglect to 
mention that this complaint was by an anonymous third party, not the individual who was allegedly harassed, 
who never lodged a complaint, and that no specific evidence was provided of the alleged transgression. I was 
surprised and dismayed that both ASU and ANU launched investigations on the basis of this but was told by 
both Universities that because of my high profile even such unsubstantiated third party complaints at private 
events unrelated to the University would be investigated. The complaint was investigated by both ASU and 
ANU and both came to the conclusion that it was not credible and no university policies had been violated. In 
addition ANU's investigation, which took a full month, found various inconsistencies in the allegation, which 
suggest distortion and fabrication, I will quote from the ANU report. The initial complaint, which in fact 
resulted in a temporary suspension of my position at ANU until it was dismissed, outlined the claim you made 
in the words you quoted in your note to me, but it also stated 
It is the University's understanding that a complaint was lodged directly to the conference organisers at the 
time of the incident. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031271 
After the month-long investigation, during which I was told I was not to interact with anyone on campus (again 
moot because I was a hemisphere removed) the final report, from which I quote below absolved me of any 
wrongdoing, reinstating my position, and indicated information inconsistent with the original claim and 
apparent later claims: 
The allegations were made by an observer to the incident. 
- The complaint did not identify, nor disclose the identity of the conference attendee who was allegedly touched 
in 
an unwelcome manner. 
- The conference attendee who took the `selfie' photo did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference 
organisers 
at the time of the incident (November 2016). 
- The conference attendee who witnessed the incident, did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference 
organisers 
at the time of the incident (November 2016). 
-The photo submitted as part of the complaint does not provide evidence of any physical contact. 
- The complainant alleged that a photo exists, showing your hand on the breast of the conference attendee who 
took 
the `selfie' photo. This photo was not made available to the Australian National University, although it was 
requested 
in the course of the investigation. 
(And for the record I often put my hand up in front of a camera if there is a flash, as I specifically request selfies 
not to include flashes, so that I don't end up with a series bright spots in front of my eyes for the next half 
hour. Moreover, I have no idea if the other eyewitnesses you quote, who were not involved in any complaint, 
were in fact there but this was a formal banquet with individuals and their partners, which I attended long 
enough to agree to sign things and do selfies before leaving early because I was tired. Even if I had any such 
intent it would have been lunacy to pose for selfies in front of a group and openly do such a thing, including 
presumably in front of this person's partner, . Which, besides the fact that I don't do such things, is one of the 
many reasons it never happened.) 
What makes this particular type of allegation so repugnant is that I get asked for literally thousands of selfies, 
and when people come up to me they are vulnerable, often shaking, or sometimes aggressive. I am particularly 
proud of the way I work to make all people feel at ease, and respected, rather than humiliated, whatever their 
behavior or request. Thus, this false claim strikes at the heart of what I am about, which characterizes all my 
interactions with fans: to acknowledge them in a way that makes them feel appreciated and respected. As I 
understand you had a reporter watching me sign books and take selfies at the CFI conference in Las Vegas this 
year, that behavior is what they will have witnessed and should report on. Moreover, I am proud of the 
interactions I have had at both Case and ASU, with students, colleagues and staff of all genders and 
ethnicities. I have worked hard to support them, mentor them, and treat them with respect. I treat others as 
responsible adults, and I expect to be treated equally.

Dr. Krauss: 
As you know, I'm a reporter for BuzzFeed News who has been investigating sexual misconduct allegations 
against you. As we've already discussed by email, I'd very much like to interview you about these allegations in 
detail. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031272 
In particular, you stated in an email sent on Nov 13 that two universities had investigated an incident (# 6 
below). You claimed that both Universities independently concluded that the report was unsubstantiated and 
fabricated with malicious intent. We are not aware that either university concluded fabrication or malicious 
intent, so if you have evidence to support this assertion, we would like to see and discuss it. 
The story concerns your actions towards students while a professor of physics at Case Western Reserve 
University, as well as your conduct in non-academic settings as a prominent figure in the skeptics movement. I 
am reporting this story along with two of my colleagues on the science desk, Azeen Ghorayshi and Virginia 
Hughes. 
Our story is about several allegations of sexual misconduct dating from 2006 to 2016 (see full details below). 
Our reporting also goes into how the various institutions you have been affiliated with — Case Western, 
Arizona State University, the Australian National University, the New College of the Humanities, and the Center 
for Inquiry, for which you serve as an honorary member of the board of directors — have handled complaints 
and concerns about your behavior during this time. 
Our story is corroborated by emails, university documents, official complaints, testimony from victims and 
eyewitnesses, and interviews with more than two dozen of your current and former academic colleagues, 
students, and peers in the skeptics movement. 
I wanted to offer you the opportunity to comment and/or respond to the main facts we plan to publish. If you 
wish to comment on any of the below findings, we need to hear from you as soon as possible. We are 
planning on publishing our story Tuesday morning, Eastern US Time. 
Based on our reporting, this is what we plan to publish: 
Incident 1: 
• In November of 2006, at an event launching the new Center for Inquiry in Washington D.C., you met a 
volunteer for CFI D.C. 
• At the event, you asked for her business card. Later, you followed her as she was leaving and asked 
her if she was of age. 
• Later, you emailed her to invite her to dinner. 
• You planned to dine with her in the restaurant at the Washington D.C. hotel where you were staying. 
• You told her to come up to your room first because you needed to finish some work. 
• In your hotel room, you seemed in no rush to leave. You ordered a cheese plate, and later champagne, 
despite her suggestion that you go down to dinner. 
• You then made a comment about her eye makeup, getting very close to her face. 
• You then lifted her by her arms, and pushed her onto the bed beneath you, forcibly kissing her and 
trying to pull down the crotch of her tights. 
• She struggled to push you off her. 
• You said, When I was in college I could never get a girl that looked like you. 
• When you pulled out a condom, she got out from under you. She said I have to go, and rushed out of 
the room. 
Incident 2: 
• In an incident that occurred in fall of 2007 while you were a physics professor at Case Western Reserve 
University, a student tried to talk to you about her plans after graduation. You mentioned to her how tough it 
must be to have all the other physics majors asking her out on dates. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031273 
• In a second incident in December of 2007, while you were still at Case Western, the same student 
visited your office to interview you for a student science journal. You closed the door behind her, and ignored 
the questions she had prepared. Then you made a casual comment about taking her out for dinner. 
• Later, in a regular column for the school paper, she described her experiences with you, without 
mentioning you by name. There was even one particular creep of a professor who once told me he thought 
differently of me compared to other students and asked me to dinner: a situation so disturbing that it left me 
upset for weeks afterward, she wrote. 
• She was then approached by a dean at the university, who suspected that she was referring to you, 
based on a previously reported incident with another student. He encouraged her to make a complaint, and 
she did. 
• University investigators interviewed both you and the student. 
• On September 4, 2008, Susan Nickel-Schindewolf, the university's associate vice president for student 
affairs, wrote to the student, telling her that the investigation was complete. She wrote that you had been told: 
This type of behavior could constitute sexual harassment in violation of the university's sexual harassment 
policy. 
• The letter also stated that you were prohibited from making contact with the student as long as she 
remained at Case. 
• The letter also stated that you are required to get approval from the dean or the chair of the physics 
department before setting foot on the campus again. 
• The letter also stated, Dr. Krauss expressed regret about having a negative impact on you, and also 
his willingness to use this complaint as an opportunity to reflect and improve on his future interactions with 
students. 
• By then, you had already left Case, taking up your current position at Arizona State University the 
month before. 
• The opportunities being offered at ASU are simply too great to turn down at this stage in my career, 
you told Case colleagues, in an email announcing your departure on April 16, 2008. 
Incident 3: 
• A former Case Western physics department administrator confirmed that she had reported a previous 
incident involving a student who had confided in her about your inappropriate behavior towards her. 
Incident 4: 
• You met a student from another university, an atheist activist, in March 2008 at the American Atheists 
Convention in Minneapolis. She wanted to expand the atheist group she ran at the midwestern university she 
was attending, and hoped to convince you to come and speak. You initially seemed enthusiastic. 
• During the convention, attendees including you and Richard Dawkins went for dinner with the student 
and volunteers for Dawkins' foundation. 
• Afterwards, the student invited you to join the volunteers for a drink. 
• You asked her to come get you in your hotel room. She was wary of your intentions, and so brought a 
male friend with her. Opening the door to find them both there, you informed her you had decided not to go. 
• You met this student again at the American Atheists Convention in Des Moines, Iowa, in April 2011. 
• You pulled over a chair for her in the bar, and then started running your hand up her leg under the 
table. 
• She tried to shift her body away from you, and you persisted in putting your hand on her leg. She 
crossed her legs, and you kept trying. Then she turned her entire body away. 
Incident 5: 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031274 
• This incident allegedly occurred on in May 2011 on a CFI cruise. We understand that CFI staff were 
informed that you had propositioned a female cruise-goer, who rejected an invitation to join you and your 
female companion for sex in your cabin. 
• At least two CFI staffers were sufficiently concerned about reports of your behavior that they urged 
CFI's president not to invite you on a 2014 cruise of the Galapagos Islands. You were invited on that cruise, 
however. 
Incident 6: 
• During a visit to Melbourne, Australia, in November 2016, you were accused of sexual misconduct once 
again. 
• The incident happened at a dinner held at the Melbourne Zoo as part of the Australian Skeptics  
National Convention, where you were a featured speaker. 
• With conference delegates chatting over drinks, a woman asked you for a celebrity selfie. 
• As the woman held out her phone to take the picture, you reached over her shoulder and grabbed her 
right breast. 
• She immediately reacted, bodychecking you and spinning around. Don't do that, she said. 
• BuzzFeed News has seen the complaint made by another woman to ASU, ANU, and the New College 
of the Humanities in London, including the selfie, her face obscured to conceal her identity. It shows your hand 
in motion as a blur in front of her shoulder, apparently moving toward her chest. Two other eyewitnesses have 
confirmed the complainant's account of what happened. 
• In April 2017, the complainant described the incident on her blog. After hearing more about your 
reputation for inappropriate behavior from blog readers, she decided to file a complaint about the Nov. 2016 
incident. 
• On July 16, she filed formal complaints with Arizona State University, and with the Australian National 
University in Canberra and the New College of the Humanities in London, where you have visiting 
appointments. 
• Both Arizona State and the Australian National University told her they would look into the matter. But 
neither university found against you. 
• Based on the material available to the University, we do not have sufficient evidence to substantiate 
the allegations, Kiaran Kirk, dean of the College of Science at the Australian National University, wrote to her. 
• Erin Ellison, who heads Arizona State's Office of Equity & Inclusion, wrote to her explaining that an 
inquiry did not find a violation of university policy. 
• In October, Arizona State denied a request from BuzzFeed News for documents relating to complaints 
of sexual harassment against you. However, Cynthia Jewett, the university's senior associate general counsel, 
noted that two individuals, neither affiliated with the university, had complained about you. The University did 
not find either communication to state a credible allegation, Jewett wrote. 
Miscellaneous facts: 
• In 2008, you founded the Origins Project at Arizona State University in Tempe, a multidisciplinary effort 
to understand the origins of the universe, life, and social systems. You have led that effort ever since. 
• Thanks to best-selling books like The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe From Nothing, frequent 
essays in publications including the New Yorker and the New York Times, and the documentary you made with 
biologist Richard Dawkins, called The Unbelievers, you are celebrated as one of America's leading public 
intellectuals. 
• You served on the science policy committee for Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign and are a 
vocal critic of President Donald Trump. 
• You also make regular public appearances across the world, often at gatherings of skeptics and 
atheists. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031275 
• At CSICon in Las Vegas in October, a few dozen fans paid $500 per head to attend a VIP luncheon 
with you and Dawkins. 
• Many more lined up to get you to sign their copy of your latest book, The Greatest Story Ever Told — 
So Far. 
• Online, people can buy T-shirts emblazoned Lawrence Krauss for President. 
• In talks and interviews, you have argued that our universe arose without divine intervention, that 
religion drives xenophobia, and that our brains are hardwired to believe. 
• You have stated that science provides answers to many of life's biggest questions, and can even fix 
great societal injustices. 
• Earlier this year, at a Q&A event to promote your new book, the conversation came around to the 
dearth of women and minorities in science. Science itself overcomes misogyny and prejudice and bias, you 
said. It's built in: Questioning yourself, always questioning results, questioning others, relying on empirical 
evidence. 
• You have clashed with some skeptics over your defense of Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire financier who in 
2008 was convicted for soliciting prostitution from underage girls, and spent 13 months in a Florida jail. 
• Through his private foundation, Epstein has funded the work of several prominent scientists. He has 
provided funding for your Origins Project, supporting lectureship and scholarship programs, most recently 
pledging $100,000 in 2014. 
• In April 2011, you told the Daily Beast: As a scientist I always judge things on empirical evidence and 
he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I've never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my 
presumption is that whatever the problems were I would believe him over other people. 
• In a blog comment about the Epstein controversy, you wrote: I remain skeptical, and I support a man 
whose character I believe I know.. .If you want to condemn me for that, so be it. 
• You were made an honorary member of CFI's board of directors in December 2011. 
• A blog post published in August 2013 described incidents #1 and #4, naming you. Another post, 
published at around the same time, described incident #5. 
• The first post was edited to remove your name after you had commented that the allegations of assault 
were potentially illegal. The second post was quickly taken down. 
Again, if you wish to comment on or clarify any of these points, please get in touch with us as soon as possible. 
If I do not respond immediately it is because I am on another call, so please leave the best phone number to 
reach you.

process input and also to produce thoughts (sometimes externalized). Seems also to be modality independent. And
their properties look wholly different, so it’s hard to see how one could piggy-back on the other.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013141.txt,"12.5 Clarifying the Ethics of Justice: Extending the Golden Rule in to a Multifactorial Ethical Model 225

And this context-sensitivity has the result of intertwining ethical judgment with all sorts
of other judgments — making it effectively impossible to extract “ethics” as one aspect of an
intelligent system, separate from other kinds of thinking and acting the system does. This
resonates with many prior observations by others, e.g. Eliezer Yudkowsky’s insistence that
what we need are not ethicists of science and engineering, but rather ethical scientists and
engineers — because the most meaningful and important ethical judgments regarding science
and engineering generally come about in a manner that’s thoroughly interwined with technical
practice, and hence are very difficult for a non-practitioner to richly appreciate [Gil82].

What this context-sensitivity means is that, unless humans and AGIs are experiencing the
same sorts of contexts, and perceiving these contexts in at least approximately parallel ways,
there is little hope of translating the complex of human ethical judgments to these AGIs. This
conclusion has significant implications for which routes to AGI are most likely to lead to success
in terms of AGI ethics. We want early-stage AGIs to grow up in a situation where their minds
are primarily and ongoingly shaped by shared experiences with humans. Supplying AGIs with
abstract ethical principles is not likely to do the trick, because the essence of human ethics
in real life seems to have a lot to do with its intuitively appropriate application in various
contexts. We transmit this sort of ethical praxis to humans via shared experience, and it seems
most probably that in the case of AGIs the transmission must be done the same sort of way.

Some may feel that simplistic maxims are less “error prone” than more nuanced, context-
sensitive ones. But the history of teaching ethics to human students does not support the idea
that limiting ethical pedagogy to slogans provides much value in terms of ethical development. If
one proceeds from the idea that AGI ethics must be hard-coded in order to work, then perhaps
the idea that simpler ethics means simpler algorithms, and therefore less error potential, has
some merit as an initial state. However, any learning system quickly diverges from its initial
state, and an ongoing, nuanced relationship between AGIs and humans will — whether we like
it or not — form the basis for developmental AGI ethics. AGI intransigence and enmity is
not inevitable, but what is inevitable is that a learning system will acquire ideas about both
theory and actions from the other intelligent entities in its environment. Either we teach AGIs
positive ethics through our interactions with them — both presenting ethical theory and behaving
ethically to them — or the potential is there for them to learn antisocial behavior from us even
if we pre-load them with some set of allegedly inviolable edicts.

All in all, developmental ethics is not as simple as many people hope. Simplistic approaches
often lead to disastrous consequences among humans, and there is no reason to think this
would be any different in the case of artificial intelligences. Most problems in ethics have cases
in which a simplistic ethical formulation requires substantial revision to deal with extenuating
circumstances and nuances found in real world situations. Our goal in this chapter is not to
enumerate a full set of complex networks of interacting ethical formulations as applicable to
AGI systems (that is a project that will take years of both theoretical study and hands-on
research), but rather to point out that this program must be undertaken in order to facilitate
a grounded and logically defensible system of ethics for artificial intelligences, one which is as
unlikely to be undermined by subsequent selfmodification of the AGI as is possible. Even so,
there is still the risk that whatever predispositions are imparted to the AGIs through initial
codification of ethical ideas in the system’s internal logic representation, and through initial
pedagogical interactions with its learning systems, will be undermined through reinforcement
learning of antisocial behavior if humans do not interact ethically with AGIs. Ethical treatment
is a necessary task for grounding ethics and making them unlikely to be distorted during internal
rewriting.

modernization could lead to bad results—to tyranny, civil war and
mass violence.

There were other reasons why Western modernization theory fell into
disrepute by the 1970s: It came to be regarded as too Eurocentric—
indeed, as too Americentric insofar as it seemed to posit American
society as the pinnacle of modernization. It failed to recognize the
possibility that countries like Japan and China might take roads to
modernity that would look very different from the ones pioneered by
Britain and the United States. But even if one agreed that the end
point of development should be some form of industrialized liberal
democracy, Huntington made it clear that arriving at the desired
destination was far more elusive and complicated than modernization
theorists believed.

The central piece of policy advice that emerged out of Huntington’s
work was the concept of the “authoritarian transition.” If political
systems opened up to democratic contestation too early, before the
development of political parties, labor unions, professional
associations and other organizations that could structure
participation, the result could be chaotic. Authoritarian regimes that
could maintain order and promote economic growth, Huntington
argued, might oversee a more gradual institutionalization of society,
and make a transition to democracy only when broad participation
could be peacefully accommodated. This form of sequencing, in
which economic development was promoted before a democratic
opening, was the path followed by Asian countries like South Korea
and Taiwan, which made democratic transitions in the late 1980s only
after they had succeeded in turning themselves into industrialized
powerhouses. It was also the development strategy recommended by
Huntington’s former student Fareed Zakaria, as well as by the leaders
of many authoritarian governments, who liked the idea of economic
growth better than the idea of democratic participation.3 We will

The tone of the column is both remarkable and ominous. It comes, as
I said, from a man of little charm, but he is nevertheless a skilled
diplomat and intelligence chief. While his vexation over the
Palestinian problem is well-known, rarely has it been carried to this
extent — and in such a public venue.

A Post opinion column is designed to get the attention of the
American government. I’m sure Prince Turki succeeded in that. But I
hope he also got the attention of the Israeli government, which for
some time now has enjoyed Saudi moderation on the Palestinian
question. That seems about to change — not the least because the
Arab street that Turki expressly mentioned is demanding it and the
Saudis will, if they have to, appease the street. This is the gravamen
of Prince Turki’s piece and is why he ends it so ominously for Israel:
“I’d hate to be around when they face their comeuppance.”

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015179.txt,"Life remains peaceful on a certain island off the coast of Japan. Here,
humans and animals live in peace and harmony.

There are monkeys who for eons have subsisted entirely on sweet
potatoes. They would pick the sweet potatoes right out of the dirt in which
they grow—eating them, dirt and all. This is the way they have always
done it. But one day, for whatever mysterious reason, an individual young
female monkey carried her sweet potato to the shore, washed the dirt off
in the ocean and proceeded to eat the sweet potato.

Who knows why it was this particular monkey? Any explanation will
suffice. Maybe she was an Aries, with a strong pioneer spirit. At any rate,
once this monkey broke the ice, other monkeys began to wash the dirt off
their sweet potatoes before they ate them. But only the young monkeys.

It was not until the 100th young monkey had washed the dirt off a
sweet potato in the ocean--not exactly the 100th; it could’ ve been the
93rd or the 108th; the 100th monkey is merely a metaphor for reaching
critical mass—but not until then did the first adu/t monkey wash the dirt
off a sweet potato. This was a case of reverse generational influence.

have also bankrolled a limited number of American think-tank activities. However,
American think tanks with centers in China have actively engaged in fund-raising
from mainland Chinese sources. With only a few exceptions, American think-tank
analysts do not foresee that Chinese money will become a significant factor in their
work at home any time soon, although because of endemic funding shortages at most
nonprofits, worries about reliance on Chinese money are not unfounded.

Chinese media relentlessly solicit American think-tank scholars’ opinions for
consumption within both the United States and China. At least one outlet pays
participants for their time and makes it clear that criticism of China is unwelcome.
Censorship of written work is common, even expected, so that few interviewees expect
to have their books published in China. American think-tank analysts appear most
annoyed when their work is illegally and/or incorrectly published on Chinese websites.
In most instances, they seek to have the work taken down from the web.

American think-tank analysts have a highly developed understanding of Chinese
efforts to influence their views —whether in the form of heavy-handed criticism

from the Chinese embassy for an article or a proposed meeting with someone like the
Dalai Lama, a Hong Kong dissident, or via more subtle efforts that arise through joint
projects funded by Chinese partners. To the last one, all interviewees for this study
indicated that they refuse to be pressured into changing their practices. Some
think-tank scholars acknowledge that they try to be diplomatic in their public discourse
on China—but insist that they do not change their overall message, only their tone

or choice of wording. Some argue that they save their tough language to deliver the
most important messages. But some also admit to acceding to Chinese demands on
how to present Taiwanese officials in public settings—such as in the announcements
of a meeting on the think tank’s website—but then adopting the Taiwanese preference
during the meeting itself. The general view—although not shared by all—was that
seeking to avoid unnecessarily insulting or upsetting the Chinese is the better strategy.
But most agreed that the arena of acceptable parlance was shrinking and that pressures
were growing.

As an antidote, the American think-tank community should understand that its position
is one with significant leverage. Chinese officials and scholars seek to use think tanks
as venues for visiting Chinese officials, as legitimating partners for Chinese-supported
research projects that will influence the American narrative, and as important sources
of information concerning the changing US political landscape. The American scholars
should celebrate their principles of independence, use the leverage their institutional
frameworks provide to resist incursion, and constructively push for greater reciprocity.
Some specific recommendations include:

Mohammed in the year 632; Sunnis have regarded them as a heretical
sect ever since. Arabs and Persians, along with many others, have
vied for the land and resources of the Middle East for almost as long.
These days, geopolitics also plays a role. The two sides have
assembled loosely allied camps. [ran holds in its sway Syria and the
militant Arab groups Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the
Palestinian territories; in the Saudi sphere are the Sunni Muslim-led
Gulf monarchies, Egypt, Morocco and the other main Palestinian
faction, Fatah. The Saudi camp is pro-Western and leans toward
tolerating the state of Israel. The Iranian grouping thrives on its
reputation in the region as a scrappy resistance camp, defiantly
opposed to the West and Israel.

For decades, the two sides have carried out a complicated game of
moves and countermoves. With few exceptions, both prefer to work
through proxy politicians and covertly funded militias, as they
famously did during the long Lebanese civil war in the late 1970s and
1980s, when Iran helped to hatch Hezbollah among the Shiites while
the Saudis backed Sunni militias.

But the maneuvering extends far beyond the well-worn battleground
of Lebanon. Two years ago, the Saudis discovered Iranian efforts to
spread Shiite doctrine in Morocco and to use some mosques in the
country as a base for similar efforts in sub-Saharan Africa. After
Saudi emissaries delivered this information to King Hassan II,
Morocco angrily severed diplomatic relations with Iran, according to
Saudi officials and cables obtained by the organization WikiLeaks.
As far away as Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim country,
the Saudis have watched warily as Iranian clerics have expanded their
activities—and they have responded with large-scale religious
programs of their own there. The 1979 Iranian revolution was a major
eruption that still looms large in the psyches of both nations. It

Chinese Outreach to US Think Tanks

Chinese outreach to American think tanks takes several forms, including via embassy
and consular officials, Chinese think-tank scholars, and representatives of China’s
state-run media.

Embassy and Consular Officials

Chinese embassy and consular officials meet frequently with many (but not all) of
the interviewees. Sometimes their aim is to assess Americans’ views on particular
issues or offer feedback on particular articles (generally those that are critical of
China). In one case, for example, a Chinese official stated that a particular analyst’s
understanding was “too gloomy,” and in another that a scholar “didn’t have the
correct data.” One think-tank scholar noted that Chinese officials use both threats
and praise to try to influence her. On the one hand, they took her to lunch and
expressed “concern with her mind set” indicating that she just “just do[es] not
understand the situation.” But embassy and Chinese government officials can also be
effusive in their praise and offers of assistance, suggesting that she “knows too much
about Chinese policy.”

Oftentimes officials ask for meetings with think tankers to transmit messages after
important Communist Party or government events. After the annual meeting of
China’s legislature (the National People’s Congress) in 2018, for example, one think-
tank analyst was invited to lunch, only to endure an hour-and-a-half lecture on how
US media and analysts misunderstood the new change in presidential term limits and
Xi’s reform efforts. Another was visited by military attachés from the Chinese embassy
in an effort to convey China’s opposition to the Taiwan Travel Act, US Defense
Authorization Act, possible prospects for US Navy ship visits, and submarine sales to
Taiwan. In concluding his stern warnings, one attaché warned: “We are no longer
weak, and can inflict pain on Taiwan, if the United States is not careful and does not
abide by the Three Communiques.”

On other occasions, Chinese embassy officials ask for meetings to warn think tanks
against hosting speakers on topics often related to Taiwan, Hong Kong, or Tibet.
Several think-tank analysts reported that they or others in their institutions had
received calls from senior Chinese embassy officials regarding projects related to the
Dalai Lama, in one case stating, “This is very troubling—it will have consequences.”
As far as the analysts were concerned, however, there turned out to be no consequences.
Another received a complaint from the Chinese embassy after the think tank hosted

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028975.txt,"We have one vote per person, but everyone knows dollars can buy more votes, and voters in small states are
better represented than those in large states. Whose interests are being served and why theirs? Many economists
and political scientists have thought about optimal institutions. And much comparative and historical work
has been done. But there isn't really a good unified theory of how these evolve, what characteristics are likely to
emerge, and in what ways they are or are not optimal.

4) Is there a fundamental theory of human societies that's analogous to Darwin's theory in biology?

Can that framework be as well supported by evidence and as simple as natural selection in biology, that will
likewise explain the interesting things humans do, like, and believe, and the institutions we construct?
Evolutionary psychologists think this doesn't require a new theory, just an investigation of the mind that
biologically evolved on the Savannah. Others like Dawkins have suggested that we are best understood as
machines infested by viruses of the mind which themselves evolve to take advantage of our evolved
psychology. Anthropologists treat culture as just random inputs. Social psychologists document the funny
quirks of our behavior without explaining where they come from. And economists assume people optimize
given their tastes and beliefs but take those as given. Is one of these the right theory, if not is there a more
compelling theory out there? What will it look like? How will we find it? How will we know we have found it,
when we have?

5) How can we fix the perverse incentives in academia?

Researchers get hired and promoted for publishing in top journals. Journal publication is determined by editors
and referees. The best way to publish is to make sure your allies are the referees, cite their work, and don't step
on their toes, and to convince the editor you are famous enough and your work is flashy enough that it will be
well cited and get covered by the nytimes. None of this requires much attention be paid to truth, insight, or
originally.

Arguably, this is why the social sciences are such a mess. Few bother to incorporate evidence or arguments
from outsiders (e.g., social psychologists don’t consult historians, economists barely consult social
psychologists). Few bother to question the fundamental assumptions driving their field that make no sense and
go unchecked (e.g., anthropologists treat culture as random inputs). And many researchers end up spending
their whole careers developing and propagating theories that are completely uninteresting to outsiders, or
obviously fallacious to anyone not steeped in their literature.

It is ridiculous that we’re still using a system derived from the Society of Letters of the 1500s. Perhaps it's time
for something more like Wikipedia, where information gets aggregated and contributors are incentivizes by
their reputation as competent editors to integrate information from across disciplines? Or something like Reddit,
where quality research is recognized by upvotes that aggregate the opinion of thousands from diverse fields? Or
a certification system of sorts, where papers are certified as having done their statistics right or having
integrated what's known from certain fields, or not citing irrelevant papers for political reasons? Whatever the
solution is, social scientists and engineers who work on this problem will have orders of magnitude more impact
on science than scientists doing primary research in our archaic system.

"
IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013155.txt,"12.10 Conclusion: Eight Ways to Bias AGI Toward Friendliness 239

To make these ideas more concrete, we may speculatively reformulate the first two “global
brain phases” mentioned above as follows:

e Phase 1 global brain proto-mindplex: AI/AGI systems enhancing online databases, guiding
Google results, forwarding e-mails, suggesting mailing-lists, etc. - generally using intelligence
to mediate and guide human communications toward goals that are its own, but that are
themselves guided by human goals, statements and actions

e Phase 2 global brain mindplex: AGI systems composing documents, editing human-written
documents, sending and receiving e-mails, assembling mailing lists and posting to them,
creating new databases and instructing humans in their use, etc.

In Phase 2, the conscious theater of the global-brain-mediating AGI system is composed of
ideas built by numerous individual humans - or ideas emergent from ideas built by numerous
individual humans - and it conceives ideas that guide the actions and thoughts of individual
humans, in a way that is motivated by its own goals. It does not force the individual humans
to do anything - but if a given human wishes to communicate and interact using the same
databases, mailing lists and evolving vocabularies as other humans, they are going to have to
use the products of the global brain mediating AGI, which means they are going to have to
participate in its patterns and its activities.

Of course, the advent of advanced neurocomputer interfaces makes the picture potentially
more complex. At some point, it will likely be possible for humans to project thoughts and
images directly into computers without going through mouse or keyboard - and to “read in”
thoughts and images similarly. When this occurs, interaction between humans may in some con-
texts become more like interactions between computers, and the role of global brain mediating
AI servers may become one of mediating direct thought-to-thought exchanges between people.

The ethical issues associated with global brain scenarios are in some ways even subtler than
in the other scenarios we mentioned above. One has issues pertaining to the desirability of
seeing the human race become something fundamentally different — something more social and
networked, less individual and autonomous. One has the risk of AGI systems exerting a subtle
but strong control over people, vaguely like the control that the human brain’s executive system
exerts over the neurons involved with other brain subsystems. On the other hand, one also has
more human empowerment than in some of the other scenarios — because the systems that are
changing and deciding things are not separate from humans, but are, rather, composite systems
essentially involving humans.

So, in the global brain scenarios, one has more “human” empowerment than in some other
cases — but the “humans” involved aren’t legacy humans like us, but heavily networked hu-
mans that are largely characterized by the emergent dynamics and structures implicit in their
interconnected activity!

12.10 Conclusion: Eight Ways to Bias AGI Toward Friendliness

It would be nice if we had a simple, crisp, comforting conclusion to this chapter on AGI ethics,
but it’s not the case. There is a certain irreducible uncertainty involved in creating advanced
artificial minds. There is also a large irreducible uncertainty involved in the future of the human
race in the case that we don’t create advanced artificial minds: in accordance with the ancient
Chinese curse, we live in interesting times!

It has recently come to our attention that plaintiff's counsel provided reporters 
from the Washington Post with submissions from a disciplinary proceeding pending before the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 019297 
EMERY CELLI BRINCKERHOFF & ABADY LLP 
Page 2 
Florida Bar that reference information that was developed during discovery in this case. In 
keeping with plaintiff's enduring practice of insisting on selective confidentiality to bolster her 
own accusations while concealing evidence that undermines her claims, the materials provided to 
the Post include cherry-picked and misleading characterizations of evidence that is sealed and/or 
designated confidential under the protective order governing this action—to say nothing of the 
fact that it is simply false. In several instances, the materials plaintiff's counsel provided to the 
Post directly reproduce exhibits that were marked confidential in this case by plaintiff; and which 
plaintifffiled under seal before the district court. These disclosures violate both the spirit and 
the letter of the district court's orders, and appear calculated to hamstring Professor 
Dershowitz—who respects and will abide by the court's orders—in responding to the 
accusations against him. 
Most notably, the materials provided to the Washington Post repeat the 
outrageous claim that came forward and corroborated Ms. Giuffre's 
accusations against Dershowitz when she testified under oath that she had been trafficked by 
Mr. Epstein and had had sex with Mr. Dershowitz. As plaintiff's counsel are well aware, Ms. 
testimony is marked confidential and remains under seal; indeed, plaintiff hersqf 
filed the relevant deposition transcript under seal before the district court. See ECF No. 701-1. 
Yet the materials provided to the Washington Post repeat specific details from Ms. 
sealed deposition, including specific sex acts she claims occurred with specific individuals. 
Plaintiff's counsel's selective characterization of this sealed evidence to a national newspaper is 
an outrageous violation of the district court's orders. See ECF No. 62 III 4 (CONFIDENTIAL 
information shall not be disclosed or used for any purpose except the preparation and trial of this 
case.); see also, e.g., Taylor v. Teledyne Techs., Inc., 338 F. Supp. 2d 1323, 1343 (N.D. Ga. 
2004) (publicly summarizing and paraphrasing confidential documents violated protective order 
even without verbatim disclosure). 
This is especially so given that the totality of this individual's testimony and other 
documents produced confidentially in discovery (none of which plaintiff's counsel elected to 
describe to reporters) demonstrate that her claims are utterly unworthy of belief.' Among other 
things, in emails sent in 2016, Ms. Iclaimed that she received help from the Russians 
and the hacker network Anonymous in responding to a hack of her email by the CIA; that Hillary 
Clinton sent Special Agents Forces Men to intimidate[] and ruff{] (sic) . . . up her friend in 
an effort to to protect [Ms. Clinton's] presidential campaign; that she possessed video and 
photographic evidence against both Ms. Clinton and Donald Trump that she would release to 
Wikileaks and Russian media by Sunday, October 23, 2016; that she possessed video footage of 
Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, and Richard Branson having sex with her friend which was backed 
up on several USB sticks that she had securely sent . . . to various different locations 
throughout Europe; and that another friend had—while the two were showering together—
showed her physical evidence that Donald Trump liked flicking and sucking her nipples until 
1 As you know, on June 21, 2017, we, on behalf of Professor Dershowitz ,wrote to Judge Sweet 
asking that, in the event that Ms. deposition were unsealed (or its designation as 
confidential by the parties withdrawn), the Court permit public disclosure of her emails. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 019298 
EMERY CELL! BRINCKERHOFF & ABADY LLP 
Page 3 
they were raw. Notably, in these emails, Ms. mentions Professor Dershowitz, but she 
does not allege that she was trafficked to or had sex with him. 
As you know, Ms. provided this information, on the record, to a New 
York Post journalist with the expressed hope that it would be published. Although these 
allegations, if credible, would have been the story of a lifetime — videos and eye witness 
accounts of sexual misconduct by two presidential candidates, a former president, and one of the 
world's leading entrepreneurs— the New York Post declined to publish them, presumably, and 
not surprisingly, because it did not find Ms. credible. Nonetheless, thereafter, Ms. 
represented by the same lawyers who represent the plaintiff in the above-captioned 
case, was permitted to testify that Professor Dershowitz had sex with her. These same lawyers 
have now provided documents to the Washington Post repeating the false charges, but have 
failed to provide the Post with the emails that fatally undermine them. These selective 
disclosures, and this use of the court's protective and sealing orders as a sword, are manifestly 
improper. 
Professor Dershowitz intends to pursue all available remedies for violations of the 
district court's orders, including sanctions. That said, to remedy the gross imbalance in available 
information created by counsel's improper disclosures, we ask that the parties' counsel 
immediately agree to a stipulation, to be so-ordered by Judge Sweet, unsealing and removing the 
confidentiality designations from Ms. emails. This will allow for full public 
disclosure of these matters—where their falsity, exposed to the sunlight of public review, will 
be manifest—and it will permit Professor Dershowitz to respond fully to the accusations 
plaintiffs counsel leaked to the Washington Post. Only with such full disclosure can the public 
decide who is telling the truth. 
Please let us know your response to this request by noon on February 9, 2018. 
Very truly yours, 
Andrew G. Cel 1, Jr.

Earlier this month, my sex-positive documentary film series screened Jane: An Abortion
Service. The film tells the extraordinary story of Jane, an underground network of
women in Chicago who provided thousands of safe abortions in the years before abortion
was legal. It was totally inspiring.

Jane was started accidentally by a woman named Heather Booth. Booth was a student at
the University of Chicago in the late 1960s when another woman came and asked her --

of the successes come not from a better understanding of the workings of intelligence but
from the brute-force power of faster chips and Bigger Data, which allow the programs to
be trained on millions of examples and generalize to similar new ones. Each system is an
idiot savant, with little ability to leap to problems it was not set up to solve, and a brittle
mastery of those it was. And to state the obvious, none of these programs has made a
move toward taking over the lab or enslaving its programmers.

Even if an artificial intelligence system tried to exercise a will to power, without
the cooperation of humans it would remain an impotent brain in a vat. A superintelligent
system, in its drive for self-improvement, would somehow have to build the faster
processors that it would run on, the infrastructure that feeds it, and the robotic effectors
that connect it to the world—all impossible unless its human victims worked to give it
control of vast portions of the engineered world. Of course, one can always imagine a
Doomsday Computer that is malevolent, universally empowered, always on, and
tamperproof. The way to deal with this threat is straightforward: Don’t build one.

What about the newer AI threat, the value-alignment problem, foreshadowed in
Wiener’s allusions to stories of the Monkey’s Paw, the genie, and King Midas, in which a
wisher rues the unforeseen side effects of his wish? The fear is that we might give an AI
system a goal and then helplessly stand by as it relentlessly and literal-mindedly
implemented its interpretation of that goal, the rest of our interests be damned. If we
gave an AI the goal of maintaining the water level behind a dam, it might flood a town,
not caring about the people who drowned. If we gave it the goal of making paper clips, it
might turn all the matter in the reachable universe into paper clips, including our
possessions and bodies. If we asked it to maximize human happiness, it might implant us
all with intravenous dopamine drips, or rewire our brains so we were happiest sitting in
jars, or, if it had been trained on the concept of happiness with pictures of smiling faces,
tile the galaxy with trillions of nanoscopic pictures of smiley-faces.

Fortunately, these scenarios are self-refuting. They depend on the premises that
(1) humans are so gifted that they can design an omniscient and omnipotent AI, yet so
idiotic that they would give it control of the universe without testing how it works; and
(2) the AI would be so brilliant that it could figure out how to transmute elements and
rewire brains, yet so imbecilic that it would wreak havoc based on elementary blunders of
misunderstanding. The ability to choose an action that best satisfies conflicting goals is
not an add-on to intelligence that engineers might forget to install and test; it is
intelligence. So is the ability to interpret the intentions of a language user in context.

When we put aside fantasies like digital megalomania, instant omniscience, and
perfect knowledge and control of every particle in the universe, artificial intelligence 1s
like any other technology. It is developed incrementally, designed to satisfy multiple
conditions, tested before it is implemented, and constantly tweaked for efficacy and
safety.

The last criterion is particularly significant. The culture of safety in advanced
societies is an example of the humanizing norms and feedback channels that Wiener
invoked as a potent causal force and advocated as a bulwark against the authoritarian or
exploitative implementation of technology. Whereas at the turn of the 20th century
Western societies tolerated shocking rates of mutilation and death in industrial, domestic,
and transportation accidents, over the course of the century the value of human life

When we had our meeting in your home in Bedford. You asked me for my help. I told you multiple times
that i thought it was a very bad idea, in that I preferred to have no financial interactions. I dont have many
friends and didnt want money to interefer with our unique relationship. For five years you had the kind but
goofy Eileen Alexandersson managing your accounting , legal, investments. reporting, trusts etc. When I told
you in no uncertain terms that I firmly believed she was incompetent you admonished me for  speaking out of
both sides of my mouth. With regard Brad Wechsler , there is no  both sides. . I have
consistantly maintained since day one that he was highly unsuited for the job. When you initially asked me to
help convince him to take the role , promising him a postion to manage mirage investments I sent you a note
saying instead you should pay up and get first class people. I have reiterated the same message for over a year
now. . Brad , not me was tasked with hiring new people and as you wanted him to take ownership of the
staff}he conducted many interviews. you may recall that as late as may, you told him in my presence that he had
had six months and had not hired anyone. since then I have rectified errors in sales tax, use tax, income
tax, fbar reporting, 1031 reporting, 8 million of deductions. ,( last nov ) 11 million found in dormant accounts
and 4 million in the drawer. errors in cash flow both personal and Phaidon. Oversight on new grats first at 22
and then at 19 that were done without my consulatation were resolved only as aresult of my intervention. . 600
million in after tax savings was just accomplished.

With Brad out of the office and unable to run his usual interference , the level of his total and
utter incompetence was brought clearly , front and center. He may be a step up from Eileen, but, ifheis,
then itis certainly not by much, A major difference is that Eileen knew she was over her head. Brad struts his
stupiditly whenever he gets a chance.
A critical example. - Though you and I have spent many many hours discussing the importance of care

of its right under the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty to enrich uranium to a
low level for peaceful purposes;
recognition of its security interests, of the
legitimacy of its Islamic regime born out of
the 1979 revolution, and of its place in the
region as a major power.

The P5+1, which are due to meet Iran later
this month, remain so divided that they are
unlikely to improve substantially on their
previous miserly offer, which was to
provide Iran with some airplane spare parts
if it gave up uranium enrichment to 20% --
its trump card. It is the paralysis of Iran’s

credence to the idea that the best hope of a

Iranian talks -- perhaps even a summit

For such a summit to be successful the
United States would have to change its
approach. Iran’s supreme leader has made
clear that Iran will not negotiate under
threat of attack. There would have to be
give and take. Above all, Iran wants to be
treated with respect. This is the challenge
facing Obama.

It is worth remembering that there is as yet
no evidence whatsoever that Iran has

it developed a reliable delivery system.

Polanco picked up a fumble and re-
turned it for score to push the Bar-
ricudas’ lead to 20-0.

“Our defense played very well,”
Cofiell said. “Aderemi Flores had
an interception and had a couple of
returns of 40 yards. Lejoni Williams
was all over the field and led us in
tackles.”

The Broncos added a late touch-
down from Diego Luna and two-
point conversion from Hernan Velez
for the final score.

“T was playing all my guys at that
point,” Cofiell said. “I wanted to give
everyone the experience of playing in
Puerto Rico.”

After the game, the Broncos set up
a meet-and-greet between both team
and an innovative idea came out of it.

“They took care of us all week-
end,” Cofiell said. “They gave us a
place to stay and ground transporta-
tion. They even took us sightseeing of
old San Juan before being dropped at
the airport.

“We invited them to come to St.
Croix and play us during the Vir-
gin Islands-Puerto Rico Friendship
weekend; hopefully it could be a
yearly thing. Either they come one
year or we go, this was a positive ex-
perience for us.”

said. “We were very happy to host
them and we enjoyed them, too. This

“I think we should have a com-
bined league with Puerto Rico,” Co-
fiell said. “We play one home and one
away every year. Look, our ticket cost
$150, that’s not much more than fly-
ing to St. Thomas. It could be done.

But before we approach Puerto Rico,
we would need a unified league be-
tween St. Thomas and St. Croix
agreeing on stuff to make it happen.
Then we could move on to Puerto
Rico, They are not that far away.
“They are more Puerto Rican teams
than Virgin Islands teams. A mixed
schedule will have to be created with
a Caribbean champion between the
winners of each league. People are re-

ally interested in playing in football. If
we're going to grow, we need to play
good teams to get better and Puerto
Rico has been playing a while.”

reason, that was absurd. Near the end of the campaign, there was going be a head-
to-head television debate. In the meantime, though Bibi might be many things, he
wasn’t stupid. He was already telling voters that while Peres was making deals
with Arafat, ordinary Israelis were being left to wonder where the next terrorist
would strike. He would surely ramp up the accusations that Peres was “weak on
security,” especially if there was more violence. To assume that if we just sat back
we would win seemed to me complacent and risky. Yet when I mentioned to
Shimon that a couple of our internal polls still actually had Bibi slightly ahead, he
just laughed. “I have good polls,” he said. ““Why should I believe the bad ones?”

Then, however, violence intervened again. It was not Hamas this time.
Beginning on March 30 and escalating sharply 10 days later, Katyusha rockets
rained onto towns and settlements in northern Israel by Hizbollah — the first
sustained attack since the cease-fire in 1994. It was pretty obvious that, like
Hamas, the Iranian-backed Shiite militia in Lebanon was not just targeting Israeli
civilians, but Oslo, and Peres’s chances of winning the election. The last thing
Shimon wanted was for tens of thousands of people in the north of Israel to be
cowering in shelters during the final stretch of the campaign. So on April 11, he
ordered a major military operation in Lebanon.

I wasn’t party to the discussions about the operation. But the model chosen was
similar to the one I’d drawn up in 1994: a large-scale air and artillery assault
designed to hit Hizbollah hard, force civilians to flee and persuade the Lebanese
and Syrian governments to commit to a US-mediated end to the rocket attacks.
Again, all of that happened. But not before a tragic accident which brought a storm
of international criticism and hastened the end of the operation. An Israeli special-
forces unit was ambushed while providing laser targeting support for an air force
strike. When it called in artillery support, four of the shells fell on a UN compound
near the Lebanese village of Qana, killing more than 100 civilians seeking shelter
inside.

Peres phoned me a few hours later, distraught not just because the wayward
artillery strike had laid us open to charges of “targeting” civilians in an operation
designed to try to avoid doing so. Also, because the accident seemed likely to deal
a further blow to his efforts to convince Israel’s voters that he, rather than Bibi,
was the man best placed to lead the country. “We’re in trouble,” he said. Yet
within days, it became clear that our basic campaign strategy — ignore Bibi and
“kick the ball into the stands” — was not going to change. I did make one last

We were only chatting for a moment before Ghislane appeared and told
me Jeffrey was ready for his massage. ] was led through the extensively
large house to the winding staircase that would lead me up to the same
dreaded room where I would have to re-enact last night’s performance. I
wasn’t far from wrong. I gave Jeffrey a massage with Ghislane leading
the way again, this time we surprisingly made it to the front of his body
and she continued to show me how to massage all the way up to his
stomach pushing my hands in a spiraling clockwise circular motion to not
disrupt the bowels and then we came up to his chest. He couldn’t dare
contain himself for one second longer, telling me to put my lips on his
nipples and give them a kiss. Jeffrey moaned in pleasure and Ghislane
started to undress me from behind. Within moments I was completely
naked and Ghislane had her top off. She was caressing my body with her
hands while Jeffrey moved his hands down to stroke his loins while he
watched her and I kiss and touch each other. I didn’t know if she was
doing this for the sake of his eye-candy but she sure did act like she loved
having the control over me telling me what to do throughout the entire
threesome. Jeffrey’s climax was always the end to our sessions and this
time he wanted to have me make him orgasm orally. Afterwards we went
for the ritualistic steam-room, this time Ghislane joining in with us for
conversation. She asked me to massage her feet this time while we were
in the steam room, showing me that Jeffrey wasn’t the only one I had pay
my homage to. We all had a shower next and then we all went downstairs
to pay me and have Juan drop me off back home.

The following afternoon I received a call at work, surprisingly it was
Ghislane asking me to come over when I got off of work again. The
compliant side took over and I told her I looked forward to meeting with
them today, instead of telling her to go screw herself for lying to me and
making me degrade myself more each time I saw them. I finished work
for the day and my Dad brought me over to El Brillo Way again, where
the vultures were patiently waiting in their lair, he wished me well as I
hopped out of his big truck, looking ever so much like his little girl again.
T gave him a smile and a wave as he drove down the long driveway,
waiting for him to suddenly turn back and not leave me alone to my task.
T shook myself out of that calamity and put on my “big girls” face.

Juan brought me to the kitchen again as I waited for Ghislane. He
offered me a cold drink and some fruit on a platter, I accepted and was
grateful for the rejuvenation before I went to work again. It wasn’t long
before Ghislane approached me from behind with a cold intense look in
her eye. | jumped from my seat, feeling like maybe I shouldn’t have been
eating and drinking while on the job, as her demeanor seemed annoyed

be on my own today as she had business to attend to, so make sure I
remembered what she had taught me, as my trial depended on it.

Chapter 5

I walked up the stairs by myself this time, taking in more of the décor,
noticing the more I looked around the more I noticed a different girl in
each photograph in his collection of half-nude and topless girls on display
around his mansion. I couldn’t believe how many girls there were, it’s not
like Jeffrey was much to look at. He was an aging man in his early fifties
with shiny grey hair and characteristic lines drawn down his face as if he
had seen harder days. With no prospects of ever settling down or having a
family of his own, Jeffrey treated us girls like a piece of clothing he could
try on for the day and get rid of the next. So why was there so many girls
in these photo’s? I wondered to myself if I would end up one of those
girls among his collection of forgotten relationships and broken promises.

I continued to make my way up the stairs, and as if all of my senses
were heightened from my bare nerves being exposed, I could smell the
cleaning detergents recently used by the housekeepers, my observations
of the shade of lighting through the concealed blinds as I entered Jeffrey’s
bedroom appeared golden, and the sound of stillness except for the thud
of my rapid beating heart all made me more aware of how nervous I was
to be on my own. Not that Ghislane was anything of a comfort, but I
didn’t know what to expect or how I was going to lead myself into
upholding my obligation in pleasing him. 1 would hope for the best I
thought, trying to uplift my confidence as I opened the door to the
massage room with the typical scene of Jeffrey laying naked facedown in

and he seemed very pleased in my contribution of myself to him, giving

massage and intimate affair between us and now was going to have sleep.
I walked back down stairs and told Juan that Jeffrey was asleep and said |

all requests to meet with any representative of the U.S. embassy in
Moscow. From that point on, he would act as Snowden’s go-between
with the FSB and other Russian agencies.

At the outset, Kucherena made it clear to Snowden that he would
have to play by Moscow’s rules before the Kremlin would grant him
permission to stay in Russia. To begin with, Snowden had to with-
draw any applications he had made elsewhere for asylum. He had to
put his fate entirely in the hands of Putin’s Russia. He would also
have to be fully candid with the Russian authorities on what was of
great value to Putin: the secret documents he had acquired.

Eighteen days later, Snowden received Russian identification
papers that allowed him to resettle in Moscow. He was provided
with a residence and allowed to set up a broadcasting studio in it
that he could use for Internet appearances at well-attended events
around the world, such as South by Southwest and TED. Snowden
was, according to Kucherena, also furnished with bodyguards. To
help earn his keep, he was said by Kucherena to be employed at an
unidentified Moscow cyber-security firm. To complete his resettle-

® ment, Lindsay Mills, whom he had left behind in Hawaii, was given ®
a three-month visa and was allowed to temporarily live with him in
Moscow. This afforded him a lifestyle that Snowden described in an
interview as “great.”

It would strain credibility that such privileges would be awarded to
an intelligence defector who had refused to cooperate with Russian
authorities. In Snowden’s case, he was even allowed to participate in
Putin’s telethon on state-controlled television. On it, he was called
on to ask Putin if the Russian government violated the privacy of
Russian citizens in the same way that the American government
violated the rights of its citizens. Putin, smiling at Snowden’s pre-
sumably vetted question, answered in a single word: “No.”

In the Moscow scenario, the Russians acted to advance their inter-
ests. They gave Snowden sanctuary, support, perks, and high-level
treatment because he agreed to cooperate with them. If Snowden
had not paid this basic price of admission, either in Russia or before
his arrival, he would not have been accorded this privileged status.

TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031533.txt,"﻿                    Explosion

Move-in day was complete, Welcome Week had gone swimmingly, and the new academic year – 2015-16-- loomed just ahead, filled with promise.  Then came the explosion.  A closely-watched rape trial was underway at the McLennan County courthouse, a magnificent structure symbolizing the community-unifying goal of justice.  Justice for all. Sam Ukwuachu, a super-talented defensive end on Baylor’s football team who had transferred from football powerhouse Boise State, was in the dock, charged with an egregious offense against basic human dignity.  Sam’s rape trial launched a crisis. Suddenly, for all the wrong reasons, Baylor football was thrust into the national limelight.

Explosion I

Triggering the unexpected explosion was a provocative on-line piece by the wildly popular home-grown periodical, Texas Monthly.  Based in Austin, and unremittingly progressive in tone, TM published a harshly-critical on-line piece just as pre-season was drawing to a close.  The muck-raking on-line attack claimed that, in effect, a rape culture had grown up in the fabulously successful football program under the turbo-charged leadership of Coach Art Briles.  This was the first anyone around the Executive Council roundtable had heard anything of the sort.

A terrible pall fell over the conference room in Pat Neff 100.  Just hours before, we had all been exulting in the excitement of a new year.  Football was an integral part of what would soon unfold that autumn.  After all, in a few short years, Coach Briles had built a national powerhouse on the banks of the Brazos.  And his dream (described in Chapter 1) of an on-campus stadium had come true.  The House that RG III built was, in fact, the House that Art Briles and Drayton McLaneean, Jr. built.  Coach Briles was the inspiration, and Drayton – the dreamer of great dreams – was the driving force.   

Coach and Drayton were joined by a cracker-jack in-house Development team, augmented by members of the Board of Regents, especially former Regent Chair Dary Stone.  The staff and Regent volunteers poured themselves into the unprecedented fundraising effort.  They had triumphed.  And Year One at McLaneean had gone beautifully, marred only by injuries to two key quarterbacks.  Even then, the 2014 season had ended with a record-shattering offensive display in Orlando as the Baylor Bears overwhelmed the Tar Heels of North Carolina with a high-speed “Wildcat” offense (no quarterback).  

For his part, Coach Briles had quickly built an eye-popping football program that matched the stunningly impressive stadium, which in short order became a gathering place for the broader community, not just the Baylor family.  Indeed, at Coach Briles’ urging, the very first game played at McLaneean Stadium was not a Baylor Bears high-octane display of razzle-dazzle offense, but a high-school match-up straight out of Friday night lights.  Baylor was making a statement – McLaneean Stadium is for all of us, not just for Baylor Nation on college game day.

As I mentioned in a previous chapter, “Field of Dreams” brought into popular culture an abiding idea – if you build it, they will come.   Unlike a Midwestern corn field turned into a ghostly baseball diamond summoning forth spirits from bygone days, McLaneean Stadium – which at Coach Briles’ insistence was renamed (prior to opening) to carry the McLean family name rather than the institutionalized, plain-vanilla “Baylor Stadium” – brought tens of thousands of fans and friends to the banks of the Brazos.  Season ticket sales skyrocketed.  Games were now sold out.  At the aging Floyd Casey Stadium, albeit home to great memories over a half century, we worked hard to fill the seats.  The occasional sell-out would occur when, say, the Longhorns came to Waco and eagerly bought up the thousands of unwanted tickets.  That was then.  Now, ESPN regularly brought “Game Day” to campus, and the prevailing colors were the beautiful gold of the Baylor Line, with shades of Baylor green sprinkled in.  The optics were even better than at green-and-gold dominated Lambeau Field in Green Bay.  

And so Sam Ukwuachu came.  He had traveled way north from Houston, where he had done well enough academically in high school but whose strength and speed attracted the attention of gridiron programs across the country.  He chose national powerhouse Boise State, but he was soon unhappy and homesick.  His head football coach looked after him, thought he should be closer to home, called Coach Briles, and soon Sam was a Baylor Bear, although he never played football at Baylor.  When Sam was charged with the unspeakably horrible act of rape, he protested his innocence and defended himself vigorously.  Devastating testimony by a former girlfriend from Boise State – who contradicted Sam’s testimony of non-violence – likely sealed his fate.  The McLennan County jury found him guilty, but then fashioned an oddly lenient sentence – probation.  As I write, Sam continues to protest his innocence, and to seek redress in the courts.  But the jury verdict stands, and Sam is thus a convicted felon. 


Explosion II

Even in the best of programs horrible deeds are done.  We are a fallen race.  Even young men from “good families” succumb to temptation and allow themselves to enter the darkest of dark domains.  The nationally-debated case of the Stanford swimmer, convicted of rape but given a lenient sentence, once again brought into sharp focus the problem of interpersonal violence on and around college campuses, and in particular, sexual assault.  National statistics were frequently reported to the effect that 1 in 5 young women are sexually assaulted (or are otherwise victims of interpersonal violence) during their college years.  Sam’s case provided the jumping off point for Texas Monthly’s provocative thesis that with all of its vaunted success, Coach Briles’ program was infected by a culture of violence against women.

We rolled into action.  A crisis management team was set up, the Board of Regents promptly informed (first through the leadership), and an initial recommendation made.  Specifically, I commissioned Baylor’s Faculty Athletic Representative (a post required under NCAA procedures) to conduct an internal inquiry into the charges.  By design, the “FAR” operates outside of and independent of the Athletic Department.  Serving in a watchdog capacity, a form of “check and balance,” the FAR reports directly to the president.  Respected law professor Jeremy Counsellor took on the role, and within several days, reported back – in a one-page summary that contained only the background of his appointment and his solitary recommendation – that an outside investigation should be conducted.  That is, no one inside or connected to the university should be retained to provide a truly independent, honest assessment of the situation.

So it was that Pepper Hamilton, a respected Philadelphia law firm, was retained.  Their work began in early September 2015, and came to conclusion in May 2016.  To assure the independence of its work, the Pepper Hamilton lawyers reported directly to a special three-person committee of Baylor’s Board of Regents.  That structure remained in place throughout the lengthy process, culminating in a verbal report – with numerous power point slides – to the Board of Regents in mid-May 2016.  The final work product was two-fold:  a set of findings of fact, reported by the Board of Regents, and a lengthy set of recommendations from the law firm.  There was no “report” in the traditional sense.  The Board’s findings and Pepper Hamilton’s recommendations were publicly released, leading to events that I describe in the next chapter.

The findings were deeply troubling.  Moral outrage was the order of the day, throughout the country.  This was page one, above-the-fold news.  Searing criticism unfolded, not simply of the football program but overall the University’s stewardship with respect to interpersonal violence (including sexual assault) was found wanting.  The criticisms were directed atincluded what I call “first responders,” including campus law enforcement, health services and counseling.  Pepper Hamilton’s findings were summarized as a “fundamental failure” on the part of the University.  This quickly became the prevailing narrative.  The narrative was reinforced by additional victims coming forward – some of whom had graduated – about their tragic experiences.  These were chronicled in dramatic ways by ESPN’s go-for-the-jugular program, “Outside the Lines.”  Baylor – not just the football program – became a pariah.

Victims’ stories moved the thoughtful observer or listener to a powerful combination of empathy and outrage.  One’s heart goes out to the victim; a second later, waves of outrage wash over the empathetic observer.  How could this have happened?  Who fell asleep at the switch?  Who failed to protect these young women, and why?  Did coaches turn a blind eye to reports of unconscionable acts by superstar players – or even non-superstars who abused (or worse) young women?.  Did “first responders” on the University’s payroll turn a deaf ear to distraught complaints of sexual violence, including rape?  How could this be, especially at a self-professed Christian university?

I made it clear that as chief executive, I accepted responsibility for any shortcomings or failings on the University’s part.  No act of sexual violence can be tolerated, period, even off-campus (which is where all the serious incidents, as reported, took place).  And no one, regardless of how important the student-athlete was to program success, was to be above the law.  Basic decency, reinforced by the Christian commitment to creating a caring community, called for the gold standard with respect to prevention in the first place, and effective response if prevention safeguards failed.

Explosion III

As the old saying goes, “there are usually two sides to the story.”  Pepper Hamilton’s recommendations, coupled with the Board of Regents’ “findings of fact,” created a toxic killer of a narrative.  The devastating conclusion – a fundamental failure of the institution itself– echoed throughout campus and demoralized Baylor Nation.  An operational failure of the highest order had been identified, with profound impacts on victims and their families.

The “other side of the story” was left untold.  Campus safety – and the safety of our students in all respects, including freedom from interpersonal violence – was a high priority throughout my years of servant-leadership.  The idea that Pat Neff Hall was oblivious to student-safety concerns was belied not only by common sense and basic human decency, but refuted by the facts.  

Here, in brief, is the other side of the story.  Indeed, iIn the fall of 2010, the EC round table focused specifically on issues of student safety arising out of a Department of Education (Office of Civil Rights) investigation into a tragic student death at Eastern Michigan University.  OCR’s compliance review (under Title IX) was prompted by an on-campus student -death.  A 22-year old student at EMU was found dead in her residence hall after having been sexually assaulted and brutally beaten.  The government’s devastating report issued in November 2010.    The EC promptly determined to establish a Baylor Student Safety Concern Task Force to examine all issues relating to student safety, including but by no means limited to interpersonal violence.  

The Task Force had an outstanding group of members.  Five student leaders, including Michael Wright (student body president) joined with the then-Chief of Police, Jim Doak, and EC member Kevin Jackson (Vice President for Student Life), and other key staff members to begin their work early in the new semester (January 2011).  The Task Force held on-campus hearings.  Broad participation was invited.

In the meantime, additional voices were raised across the nation.  As the Baylor Task Force was operating at full speed, 16 Yale students filed a complaint with respect to the campus climate prevailing “under the elms” of New Haven.  One particularly disturbing incident included a ribald Yale fraternity chant:  “No means yes.”  The brothers’ outrageous chant then went a perverse step further in descending into the realm of raucous indignity. 

In April 2011, OCR published its first “Dear Colleague” letter with respect to responsibilities under Title IX.  In contrast to common (mis)understanding, the letter did not embody or reflect law.  It was not law in any sense of the word.  It was not reporting on an act of Congress, nor was it setting forth an administrative regulation enjoying the force of law.  It was a letter – providing guidance, not the direction that law enjoys.  Nor did that guidance call for the appointment of a full-time Title IX coordinator.   To the contrary, that administrative step was more than three years away.  

Three days after OCR’s “Dear Colleague” letter appeared, a public panel discussion took place on the Baylor campus.  In addition to myself, Vice President Jackson and Student Body President Wright discussed a wide range of student-safety issues, and took questions from the floor.  This on-campus conversation was illustrative of what was underway around the nation.  Everyone was aware of myriad concerns about student safety, including freedom from interpersonal violence.  No one had his or her head in the sand, nor averted his or her gaze to avoid facing unpleasantness – or worse.

The work of the Campus Task Force was completed, and in the fall of 2012, a Campus Safety Committee was formed.  The Safety Committee pulled together stakeholders from all across campus to discuss any and all threats to student safety.  Issues relating to sexual assault were an integral part of the broad mandate the Committee examined.  

For its first three years, the Campus Safety Committee was chaired by Vice President Jackson.  Its work enjoyed the unalloyed support of the entire Executive Council.  Then, in the following June (2013), I personally issued a memorandum creating a specialized Task Force Review of Sexual Violence to conduct a comprehensive review of Baylor’s policies and practices relating to sexual violence.  This Task Force (operating at the same time as the Campus Safety Committee) was formed in response to the recommendations and concerns expressed by John Whelan, then the head of Human Resources.  

Action items quickly emerged.  The entering freshman class that fall (August 2013) were specifically briefed by a senior Student Life staff member on what was expected in terms of proper, upright behavior.  Entering students were provided with a copy of OCR’s “Know Your Rights” summary, along with a highly-specific cover letter from Vice President Jackson.  The following month (September 2013) the “Do Something!” campaign was launched – a sexual assault prevention campaign hosted the week after Labor Day 2013.  The campaign was sponsored by Baylor’s Sexual Assault Advisory Board, chaired by Dr. Cheryl Wooten, an outstanding leader recognized across the nation for her expertise in dealing with the horror and trauma of sexual violence.

The story continues, with the appointment of an EC member, Dr. Karla Leeper, as the Title IX coordinator, to succeed the departing John Whelan (again, the head of HR, who left to return to his adopted state of Indiana as head of HR at IU-Bloomington).  This basic fact stands uncontested  -- at no time did Baylor University fail to have a high-level Title IX coordinator in place.  Never.  Not for one instant.  

The suggestion that the Administration somehow failed to have a Title IX coordinator in compliance with OCR guidance is demonstrablyis manifestly wrong.  Indeed, Baylor was months ahead of OCR’s later guidance that the issues swirling around Title IX were sufficiently complex that a full-time coordinator was called for.  Baylor was way ahead of the curve.  

Following numerous meetings of the specialized Task Force, the Administration engaged a leading consulting firm, Margolis Healy & Associatesd, to assess Baylor’s compliance with Title IX and the Clery Act (a federal law requiring reports of on-campus assaults; note the key requirement of on-campus).  Within a few short months, Margolis Healy recommended the appointment of a full-time Title IX coordinator.  At the round table, the EC discussed that recommendation, along with others (including our shortcomings in reportings due under the Clery Act).  Without dissent, the EC embraced the consulting firm’s recommendation, and by October 2014, Patty Crawford was in place in her full-time role.

In the meantime, the Sexual Assault Advisory Board developed an elaborate prevention proposal to launch in the fall of 2014.  That exemplary proposal resulted in the “Bear Up Now” program, designed to prevent all forms of interpersonal violence.  In August and September 2014, a full year before the Texas Monthly neutron-bomb report, widespread campus training for all students was launched.  In particular, the effort featured the renowned “Green Dot” program (developed by the federal government in response to sexual violence reports at the Air Force Academy).  Green Dot is a state-of-the-art program that sets the standard for the pivotally important function of bystander intervention.  

Throughout late August 2014, almost 150 peer-leader educators were trained in prevention; those peer leaders then lead elaborate prevention education sessions in small groups with community leaders and their residents.   Beloved Baylor Police Officer Kandy Knowles guidedled numerous discussions with students in residence hall meetings early on in the new academic year.  Chapel, thea cherished Baylor tradition, featured the highly impressive Rachel Sibley and others in the Baylor community who were outspoken on the subject of preventing sexual violence.  The faculty and staff likewise joined in the effort.  Over a three- month period from August through October 2014, almost 2000 faculty, staff and student workers completed training sessions on both Title IX and the Violence Against Women Act, a measure which had been signed into law (a reauthorization) by President Obama in the early spring of 2013).

Baylor loves its students.  I love the students.  We want them not only to be safe, but to flourish.  We worked hard to achieve that goal in a fallen world, where all too often, students will yield to temptations all around them.  We could always do more.  And the silver lining of the nine-month ordeal culminating in the events of May 2016 is that no university is more focused on Title IX-related prevention and effective response than our beloved Baylor.  

To be sure, there were failures and shortcomings.  In particular, I lament the now-known fact that first responders were, at best, insensitive to reports of sexual violence.  But there are limits to what the University can do with respect to OFF-CAMPUS behavior, especially when alcohol flows freely – and all too frequently, it flows to tragic excess.  But that jurisdictional point – off-campus drinking, not infrequently under-age drinking – was deemed utterly irrelevant by American culture’s ultimate mediator, the mainstream media, led in this instance by ESPN.  Its provocative investigative reporting avenue, “Outside the Lines,” had found a target on the banks of the Brazos.  Several of us, including Coach Art Briles, an honorable and decent man (and football genius) would be fatally hit by the media’s unrelenting fusillade.

MR. GOLDBERGER: They are barcoded and the

psyches and sexualities.

Plus, if the only available patterns for kink emphasize something a person doesn't like,
then that person will probably avoid kink. Note that in the research I linked to, for
example, the percentage of submissive women was higher in samples from within the
BDSM subculture than in samples from outside the BDSM subculture... perhaps because
many BDSM subcultural gatherings emphasize female submission and thereby alienate
women who are primarily dominant. Anyway, regardless... this is still the wrong
question.

In short, inherent female submission is the wrong question.

Certainly, I've fought through a lot of personal fears about what my interest in BDSM
meant for me as a feminist... but these days I have trouble understanding what, exactly,
got me so upset. I can't believe how long it took me to outthink those fears. Now, it just
seems instinctively obvious to me that:

1) The only reason these conversations happen at all is that BDSM, and especially
submission, is seen as broken and problematic and screwed-up and a sign of
weakness. What if we viewed S&M proclivities as a superpower rather than a
perversion? What if submission and masochism, in particular, were viewed as signs of
strength and endurance and emotional complexity, rather than weakness?

2) Sexual kinks don't necessarily affect one's performance in non-sexual fields. A
sexually submissive woman won't make a bad CEO (at least, not because she's sexually
submissive). I mean, come on, it's not like there aren't sexually submissive men in
powerful corporate positions. When I was younger I remember being scared that, in some
bizarre way, I was betraying women's liberation by being sexually submissive; this seems
ridiculous to me now. That fear can only survive in a culture where people are looking
for excuses -- no matter how flimsy -- to control and disempower women. Because it
doesn't make any damn sense on its own.

3) Rape is still rape. Everyone still has a right to consent, including submissives. A
submissive partner (of any gender) must be able to withdraw consent, and a dominant
partner (of any gender) must make space for them to withdraw consent. It's always great
when both partners can have an honest conversation about desire, trying to avoid pressure
and unfair expectations (whether those expectations arise from sexist culture or from
whatever else). Safewords are one frequently-recommended communication tactic for
those who have rape fantasies, although they aren't the only tactic. What really burns me
about many discussions of inherent female submission is that they have horrible
overtones of blaming the victim and justifying rape... much like she was wearing a short
skirt, so she was asking for it. In reality, inherent female submission says absolutely
nothing about women’s right to choose our partners and protect our bodily integrity.
Female submissives have made it perfectly clear that we do, in fact, claim that right.

I think most of the dudes who ask this question come to me, a feminist, and they ask this
question in hushed and worried tones, because they are decent guys and they are
concerned about The Consequences Of This Terrible Truth. I'd venture a guess that

Case No.: CACE 15-000072

Edwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records
Page 3 of 20

case. Accordingly, it is impossible for Edwards and Cassell to respond with precision to his
motion.
The exceptions that might arguably be in play in this case permit records to be maintained

as confidential in order to:

(i) Prevent a serious and imminent threat to the fair, impartial, and orderly
administration of justice;

(ii) Protect trade secrets;

(iii) Protect a compelling governmental interest;

(iv) Obtain evidence to determine legal issues in a case;

(v) Avoid substantial injury to innocent third parties;

(vi) Avoid substantial injury to a party by disclosure of matters protected by a
common law or privacy right not generally inherent in the specific type of
proceeding sought to be closed;

(vii) Comply with established public policy set forth in the Florida or United
States Constitution or statutes or Florida rules or case law....

Fla. R. Jud. Admin. 2.420(c)(9) (codifying the holding in Barron y. Florida Freedom
Newspapers, Inc., 531 So.2d 113 (Fla. 1988)). The only exception that seems to even arguably
apply here is exception vi, which itself specifically provides that confidentiality is appropriate
only where disclosure is “not generally inherent in the specific type of proceeding sought to be
closed” (emphasis added). Of course, this lawsuit is a defamation action — involving
adefamation claim by Edwards and Cassell and adefamationcounterclaim by
Dershowitz. Disclosure, discussion, and debate about the defamatory statements at issue lies at
the heart of the case. Accordingly, disclosure of these materials is “inherent” in the case itself.

The principle that defamatory material in a defamation case cannot be sealed is recognized

in Carnegie v. Tedder, 698 So.2d 1310 (2d DCA 1997). Carnegie involved a claim and

counterclaim between two parties (Carnegie and Tedder), one of whom alleged that disclosure of

opening has been feeble. Even in the most hopeful cases — Tunisia
and Egypt — we may have only a few months in which to prevent the
Arab Spring becoming an Arab fall. The disappointed hopes of that
half of the population that is under 30 would then produce further,
larger immigrant surges to Europe. In their own countries, Islamists
would exploit the chances and the confusion of semi-freedom.

The European-led military intervention in Libya was always likely to
be a slow, difficult grind, but it has painfully exposed Europe's
chronic failure to concentrate its military capabilities. Already, some
of the European powers involved are running short of munitions. You
can understand why U.S. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates was
scathing about this in Brussels last week. Even enlargement, Europe's
most successful project, is close to stalling. In his victory speech after
the recent Turkish elections, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan
did not even mention the EU. Yes, Croatia will probably join the EU
in 2013, and that's good news. But Croatians might be forgiven for
wondering what exactly they will be joining. Retired prime ministers
and foreign ministers never tire of attributing this faltering of the
European project to the lack of leadership. (Subtext: It was all so
much better when we were in charge.) This is true, but less than half
the story. For although the quality of European leadership is
somewhat poorer than it was a quarter-century ago, the need for it is
greater. Why? Because all the great underlying motivators of the
European project back in the days of Helmut Kohl, Francois
Mitterrand and Jacques Delors, and even more so in the time of the
founding fathers, have faded or disappeared. Those powerful driving
forces included searing personal experiences of war, occupation,
holocaust, fascist and communist dictatorships; the Soviet threat,
catalyzing west European solidarity; generous, energetic American
support for European unification; and a West Germany that was the
mighty engine of European integration, with France on top as the

political ends of terrorism. The board has also proved that Redgrave has turned down roles such
as that of Andrei Sakharov’s wife in an HBO production because she believed the film might be
seen as “anti-Communist propaganda”.

Redgrave’s supporters threw a fundraiser for her. I prepared and distributed a leaflet that
provided the facts to those attending and urged them to ask Redgrave “to explain her hypocrisy”.
Several members of the audience were surprised to learn of her views on blacklisting Israeli
artists. Others said they knew of Redgrave’s selective condemnation of blacklisting but didn’t
care, because — as one woman put it — “anything is fair in the war against Zionism.””’

In the end, the case was settled and Redgrave persisted in her hypocrisy. I was comfortable in my
role defending her rights while exposing her wrongs.

Not everyone understands this distinction. My own mother insisted that I was “helping” Nazis
and terrorists when I supported their right to speak, even while condemning what they were
saying. Far better educated people than my mother also claimed not to understand. In a debate in
Canada on laws criminalizing Holocaust denial, I took my usual position in favor of freedom of
speech:
I regret to say this, but I think that Holocaust denial speech is not even a close question.
There is no persuasive argument that I can think of in logic, in law, in constitutionality, in
policy, or in education, which should deny [anyone] who chooses to the right to take
whatever position he wants on the Holocaust. The existence of the Holocaust, its extent,
its fault, its ramifications, its political use are fair subjects for debate. I think it is
despicable for anybody to deny the existence of the Holocaust. But I cannot sit in
judgment over the level of despicability of anybody’s exercise of freedom of speech.
Of course I agree that sticks and stones can break your bones, and words can harm you
and maim you. That’s the price we pay for living in a democracy. It’s not that speech
doesn’t matter. If speech didn’t matter, I wouldn’t devote my life to defending it. Speech
matters. Speech can hurt. That’s not why those of us who defend free speech,
particularly free speech of this kind, do it. We do it because we don’t trust government.

In response, Judge Maxwell Cohen said that anyone who holds such views “ought not to be a law
teacher.” I disagree. Professors must defend the right of those they disagree with to express
wrongheaded views, while insisting on their own right—indeed obligation—to express
disagreement with such views.

When Yasser Arafat died in 2004, I was asked by Palestinian students at Harvard to represent
them in the failed efforts to fly the Palestinian flag from a flagpole in the Harvard Yard. They
knew my negative views of their hero—I had called Arafat’s death “untimely,” because if he had
only died five years earlier, the Palestinian Authority might well have accepted the Clinton-Barak
peace offer—but they also knew my views on freedom of speech. I agreed to represent them, as
long as they understood that I would continue to criticize both Arafat and those who considered
him a martyr. They agreed and we got Harvard to allow them to fly their flag.

meant a Palestinian state. | wasn’t opposed to that in principle, if it was in return
for a full and final peace. But the Oslo process meant that we would be handing
back land, and control over security, in an ever-larger portion of territory before
we'd reached any so-called permanent-status agreement. In fact, before we even
knew whether that would prove possible. It wasn’t “land for peace.” It was land
for the promise, or maybe only the hope, of peace. It was the same problem
Yitzhak had faced over the Americans’ misuse of our “pocket deposit” on the
Golan. I realized that, having come this far with Oslo, neither he nor the
government was likely to back away from approving the Gaza-Jericho accord.
But he did say he thought the points I’d raised were important, which I took as
meaning he was comfortable with my raising it with the cabinet.

I spoke near the end of the four-hour cabinet meeting to ratify the Gaza-
Jericho plan. The ministers seemed attentive as I ran through the security
concerns I’d raised with Rabin, even nodding when I compared the agreement’s
security provisions to “a piece of Swiss cheese, only with more holes.” But then
I said that I wanted to say a few words which I recognized were beyond my
responsibility as chief of staff. “I’m speaking just as an Israeli citizen,” I told
the cabinet, “and as a former head of military intelligence.” Referring to specific
provisions in Oslo, and in the Camp David framework agreed by Begin and
Sadat 15 years earlier, I said it was important for ministers to realize that, even
though permanent-status issues were yet to be resolved, “you will be taking us
nearly the whole way toward creating a Palestinian state, based on the
internationally accepted reading of Camp David.” The reaction to my comments
was a mix of defensiveness and hostility. In the latter camp were ministers from
Rabin’s left-wing coalition partners, Meretz, who seemed especially angry
when I quoted from Camp David. The Prime Minister motioned them for calm.
“Ehud had a responsibility to talk about security questions, and we had a
responsibility to listen. As for his additional remarks, they are not a surprise to
me,” he said. “He made these points to me, and I said he could repeat them here.
It is right that he should raise them.” He said there was no need for ministers to
agree with me, but that it was proper that the points I’d raised should be heard.

Many clearly didn’t agree with me, or simply believed the Gaza-Jericho
agreement still had to be ratified, which it was. But my remarks did lay the
groundwork for my objection to the next, more far-reaching stage in the Oslo
process barely a year later. By then, I was no longer chief of staff. I was a
member of Rabin’s cabinet.

throat.

T was enjoying our conversation, when Jeffrey insisted that I give Matt
a foot massage throughout the duration of the short flight. I never turned
down a client but when I saw the shape of his feet, I nearly threw up at
the thought of having to touch them. He had yellow crusty toenails that
even someone with a chainsaw would’ve had troubles cutting through
and then there was the fluffy balls of leftover pieces of sock wedged
between the crevices of his sweaty toes, now that was the real icing on
the cake for me, no way could I attempt this I thought. Then I had an
idea. 1 went to the back of the plane and rinsed a wash cloth in warm
soapy water and returned for his dreaded foot massage but not before
attempting to clean them first.

In return for my services Matt was kind enough to draw me two quick
sketches on blank paper from his briefcase of my two favorite characters,
Homer and Bart. I asked if he would make them out to my little brother
and dad, the true fans of the family not missing an episode during dinner
over the past ten years or so. Next to the A-4 size drawing he was able to
fit in the quote “To my greatest fan from Matt Groening” and their names
next to it. I knew they’d absolutely love it, and it was such a nice gesture
his feet were no longer an issue as | laughed it off and even made a joke
to the comedian about getting a pedicure before hitting L.A’s beaches.

The flight was only short and we arrived in busy L.A within the hour,
saying Good-Bye to Matt, who was a pleasure to meet. Jeffrey had a
meeting at a production studio for one of the girls he was keeping lured in
his grasps, so we were off yet again for more business. We were staying
with one of his old girlfriends, Jeffrey’s code for “She got to old for my
taste, but was still nice enough to keep around”. She was a tall blonde
with blue eyes, a stereotypical Barbie doll. In her younger years she had
been a successful model and now lived on the beaches of Santa Monica
with a sweeping view of the oceans landscape as her backyard.

The next morning Jeffrey and I went out to breakfast. He said Sarah
Keller, would be joining us with another one of Jeffrey’s girls I hadn’t
met yet, her name was Nadia Bjorlin and she was a Yugoslavian model
turned aspiring actress, with the help of Jeffrey, as he so proudly
remarked at the table before they arrived shortly thereafter. She was a
stunning brunette with olive skin tones and shocking blue eyes. By far
one of the most beautiful girls [had ever met before. She and Sarah
approached the table, shopping bags in hands already in the early hours of
the day. They both pulled out a chair and showed us their new pair of
Jimmy Choo’s they had bought on their way here this morning, and
excitedly asked for Jeffrey’s opinion. He loved the doting attention and
anyone who could make him feel important. We all went back to Sarah’s

apartment that Jeffrey rented for her on Malibu Beach. This was the first
time Jeffrey came to visit and when we got there you could see why. It
was a tiny one-bedroom shack, too small for his likes of accommodation,
but she loved it and it was plain to see why, the waves lapped underneath
her porch twice a day, what else could anyone want. Before even walking
through her door, you could hear the commotion of excitedly screaming
females voices coming from inside. There were about five other girls in
Sarah’s living room and she had invited them so Jeffrey could have a few
different girls to choose from. Jeffrey looked at Sarah and smiled, aren’t
you sweet, as all the girls rushed to introduce themselves, hoping for the
opportunities Sarah had offered them to come in the first place.

We all had some coffee and biscuits while the conversation kept getting
louder and louder, every girl trying to talk over the next one. Jeffrey
could handle only so much of that before getting too annoyed. Instead of
choosing one of the other new girls, Jeffrey wanted Sarah to show Nadia
and I into her bedroom. He was anticipating the introduction of his two
favorite girls together, what mischief he had hoped we would get up to
was apparent when he asked where Sarah had kept her play toys and not
the fisher price ones. Sarah brought out quite a collection of her personal
toys and was giggling on her way out as she shut the door. Suddenly the
room behind us went quiet, probably hoping to catch a moan or groans
too laugh at and I felt so degraded having everyone knowing exactly what
was going on. Knowing my duties well | was baffled this time as there
was no ritualistic massage wanted. He immediately instructed us to start
kissing and fondling each other with the provided toys straight away
seeing his excitement grow watching us try and out do the other one with
pleasure, he couldn’t keep restraint any longer and started to have
intercourse with the both of us, taking his erect penis out of the other to
only swap to the other girl, back and forth. This continued for a good
fifteen minutes or so while we continued to engage in lesbian acts on
each other while the other girl was being subdued by Jeffrey’s thrust’s of
penetration. Nadia was just as dutiful as I was in fulfilling his demented
requests, willing to lend her body to Jeffrey and those he sent her too, for
the sake of keeping her acting career and putting on a good act at that.
She was never competition though. Once I found out where she actually
came from I took pity on her for the similar life of servitude we were both
accustomed too and not that we ever became good friends but we had
reason to relate to each other.

Later on Jeffrey, Nadia and I went to a production studio in L.A, where
we had to meet with Nadia’s agent as well as the producer of “‘Day’s Of
Our Lives”. The meeting lasted five minutes, with everyone in consent to
the proposal. We flew all the way out there to talk about money, only to
be leaving that evening back to N.Y.C. On the way to the airport we

families of Europe.

“I didn’t take it seriously,” Epstein recounts. “I was not caught up in
it. | wasn’t trying to make a billion dollars. There was no ultimate goal. It
was just fun to meet smart people, interesting people. But no long-range
plans. Often no short-term plans either. I would head to Kennedy and, on the
theory that most important events in one’s life are serendipitous, I wouldn’t
decide where I was going until I got there.”

At the same time, he is developing a perception, or, at least a market
differentiation: the hyper wealthy had different problems than the very
wealthy. Dealing with a billion dollars was different from dealing with $100
million:

“Tf you had a billion dollars I would think the last thing you should be
worried about was money, in truth money was what you most worried about.
How to make more of it, how to give away more of it, how to protect you
children from it, how to hide it from your wife or husband, how to minimize
your taxes on it. The traditional wealth service structure, an accountant, and
investment advisor, a personal lawyer, and an idiot brother-in-law, became
hopelessly outdated as amounts exponentially increased.

“You can’t spend a billion dollars, you can just reallocate it to a
different investment class. And you can’t give away a billion dollars without
a vast staff, in effect going into the business of giving away money, yet
another business you are likely to know little about.”

At just about this point in the narrative, the questions or the
incredulity begins in social circles and eventually in the media. He begins to
acquire the major symbols of riches but does this without position, public
holdings, or obvious paper trails. How can a person have enough money to
merit increasing attention, but no clear way of having gotten it? Epstein gets
stuck in that tautology. He may be rich, but he is without institutional
protection or bona fides. He is a questionable substrata of wealth. He’s a
freelancer.

That’s the rub: he doesn’t work for anyone. Without institutional
credentials he’s... well, nobody knows what.

For a period, one part of his activities he says is recovering monies for
countries looted by exiled dictators or military strongmen. If early in his
career he might seem like a sort of George Peppard (there’s a physical
resemblance) in Breakfast at Tiffany’s, a charming hustler, later he’s George
Peppard in Banacek, a smart and astute operator.

Then, in his telling, he’s representing a series of vastly wealthy people
and families. He’s not just doing their bidding or their investing, he’s

RLK: I think there has to be some
backchannel working. To put the
real situation on the table, there are
five major issues that the US is
concerned about in addition to the
trade deficit. The trade deficit is
actually complicated because there
are services of $40 billion dollars
that Chinese tourists and students
pay. It's not excluding the transfer
pricing of components that are
shipped into China. So the trade
deficit, which benefits a lot of
American consumers with cheaper
products at a good quality is not as
relevant as popular opinion would
suggest.

RLK: Most experts do not really
focus on the trade deficit. American
experts focus on five things: the
lack of open Chinese markets;
intellectual property protection,
industrial espionage, including
cyber theft; tech transfer being
forced (in joint ventures);, and
Chinese government subsidies for
critical technologies or industries.

The Washington Post

Amid the Arab Spring, a U.S.-Saudi split
Nawaf Obaid

May 16 - RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA -- A tectonic shift has
occurred in the U.S.-Saudi relationship. Despite significant pressure
from the Obama administration to remain on the sidelines, Saudi
leaders sent troops into Manama in March to defend Bahrain’s
monarchy and quell the unrest that has shaken that country since
February. For more than 60 years, Saudi Arabia has been bound by
an unwritten bargain: oil for security. Riyadh has often protested but
ultimately acquiesced to what it saw as misguided U.S. policies. But
American missteps in the region since Sept. 11, an ill-conceived
response to the Arab protest movements and an unconscionable
refusal to hold Israel accountable for its illegal settlement building
have brought this arrangement to an end. As the Saudis recalibrate
the partnership, Riyadh intends to pursue a much more assertive
foreign policy, at times conflicting with American interests. The
backdrop for this change are the rise of Iranian meddling in the
region and the counterproductive policies that the United States has
pursued here since Sept. 11. The most significant blunder may have
been the invasion of Iraq, which resulted in enormous loss of life and
provided Iran an opening to expand its sphere of influence. For years,
Iran’s leadership has aimed to foment discord while furthering its
geopolitical ambitions. Tehran has long funded Hamas and
Hezbollah; recently, its scope of attempted interference has
broadened to include the affairs of Arab states from Yemen to
Morocco. This month the chief of staff of Iran’s armed forces, Gen.
Hasan Firouzabadi, harshly criticized Riyadh over its intervention in
Bahrain, claiming this act would spark massive domestic uprisings.

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017554.txt,"STEVEN PINKER

Steven Pinker was born in 1954 in the English-speaking Jewish

community of Montreal,Canada. He earned a bachelor’s
degree in experimental psychology at McGill University and
then moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1976, where he
has spent most of his career bouncing back and forth between
Harvard and MIT. He earned his doctorate at Harvard in 1979,
followed by a postdoctoral fellowship at MIT, a one-year stint
as an assistant professor at Harvard, and in 1982, a move back
to MIT that lasted until 2003, when he returned to Harvard.
Currently he is Harvard College Professor and the Johnstone
Family Professor in the Department of Psychology. He also
has spent two years in California: in 1981-82, when he was an
assistant professor at Stanford, and in 1995-96,when he spent
a sabbatical year at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
Pinker is an experimental psychologist who is
interested in all aspects of language and mind. Much of his
initial research was in visual cognition, the ability to imagine
shapes, recognize faces and objects, and direct attention within
the visual field. But beginning in graduate school he cultivated
an interest in language, particularly language development
in children, and this topic eventually took over his research
activities. Aside from his experimental papers in language and
visual cognition, he wrote two fairly technical books early in
his career. One outlined a theory of how children acquire the
words and grammatical structures of their mother tongue. The
second focused on one aspect of this process, the ability to
use different kinds of verbs in appropriate sentences, such as
intransitive verbs, transitive verbs, and verbs taking different

combinations of complements and indirect objects. For the
next two decades his research focused on the distinction
between irregular verbs like bring-brought and regular
verbs like walk-walked. The reason is that the two kinds of
verbs neatly embody the two processes that make language
possible: looking up words in memory, and combining words
(or parts of words) according to rules. He has also studied
language development in twins and the neuroimaging of
language processes in the brain, and has recently begun
lines of research on the nature of reminding and on the
function of innuendo and other forms of indirect speech.
In 1994 he published the first of five books
written for a general audience. The Language Instinct was
an introduction to all aspects of language, held together by
the idea that language is a biological adaptation. This was
followed in 1997 by How the Mind Works, which offered a
similar synthesis of the rest of the mind, from vision and
reasoning to the emotions, humor, and art. In 1999 he
published Words and Rules: The Ingredients of Language which
presented his research on regular and irregular verbs as a
way of explaining how language works in general. In 2002
he published The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human
Nature, which explored the political, moral, and emotional

colorings of the concept of human nature. The Stuff of Thought:

Language as a Window into Human Nature, published in 2007,
discussed the ways in which language reveals our thoughts,
emotions, and social relationships. His most recent book is
The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined,

published in 2011. Pinker frequently writes for The New York
Times, Time, The New Republic, and other magazines on
subjects such as language and politics, the neural basis of
consciousness, and the genetic enhancement of human beings.
Pinker is the Chair of the Usage Panel of The
American Heritage Dictionary and has served as editor or
advisor for numerous scientific, scholarly, media, and
humanist organizations, including the American Association
the Advancement of Science, the National Science Foundation,
the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American
Psychological Association, and the Linguistics Society of
America. He has won many prizes for his books (including
the William James Book Prize three times, the Los Angeles
Times Science Book Prize, and the Eleanor Maccoby Book
Prize), his research (including the Troland Research Prize
from the National Academy of Sciences, the Early Career
Award from the American Psychological Association, and
the Henry Dale Prize from the Royal Institution of Great
Britain), and his graduate and undergraduate teaching.
He is also a Humanist Laureate, the 2006 Humanist of
the Year, recipient of the 2008 Innovations for Humanity
Award from La Ciudad de las Ideas in Mexico, the 2008
Honorary President of the Canadian Psychological
Association, and the recipient of six honorary doctorates.
Pinker lives in Boston and in Truro
with Rebecca Newberger Goldstein. The other
authors in the family are his sister Susan Pinker
and Rebecca’s daughter Yael Goldstein Love.

Conclusion and Recommendations

US-China academic exchanges are valuable to both China and the United States and
should be maintained and developed. However, in doing so, universities must be alert
to the risks of engaging with the Chinese government, institutions, and funders and
be proactive in applying a higher level of due diligence and vigilance as a defense of
the core principle of academic freedom, especially when conflicts take place at home
in their own universities.

Promote Transparency

Confucius Institutes We do not endorse calls for Confucius Institutes to be closed,

as long as several conditions are met. US institutions should make their CI agreements
public to facilitate oversight by members of the university community and other
concerned parties. Those agreements, in turn, must grant full managerial authority

to the host institution (not on a shared basis with the Hanban), so the university has
full control over what a CI teaches, the activities it undertakes, the research grants it
makes, and whom it employs. The clause in all Hanban contracts that CIs must operate
“according to China’s laws” must be deleted.

If these standards cannot be attained, then the CI agreements should be terminated.
Furthermore, universities should prevent any intervention by Cls in curricular
requirements and course content in their overall Chinese studies curricula or other
areas of study by maintaining a clear administrative separation between academic
centers and departments on the one hand, and CIs on the other. Finally, universities
must ensure that all public programming offered by their CIs conform to academic
standards of balance and diversity and do not cross the line to become a platform
for PRC propaganda, or even a circumscribed view of a controversial issue. In fact,
this report would suggest that universities not permit Confucius Institutes to become
involved in public programming that goes beyond the CI core mission of education
about Chinese language and culture. To go beyond these two categories invites
opportunities for politicized propaganda.

Apply Due Diligence To minimize the risks just identified, universities must rigorously
apply far stricter due-diligence procedures to scrutinize the sources and purposes of
gifts and contracts from China to ensure that they do not interfere with academic
freedom. Universities accepting gifts from Chinese nationals, corporations, or
foundations must insist that there be no restrictions on academic freedom. Foreign
donations should continue to be welcomed, but universities must ensure that the
conditions of acceptance are reasonable, consonant with their principles, subject to
oversight, and do not allow the program to become a beachhead for inappropriate
influence. It is important that all universities exercise high standards of due diligence
and not only scrutinize the source of the gift but consider the implications of such

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016892.txt,"The moral component, the cultural component, the element of free will—all make
the task of creating an AGI fundamentally different from any other programming task.
It’s much more akin to raising a child. Unlike all present-day computer programs, an
AGI has no specifiable functionality—no fixed, testable criterion for what shall be a
successful output for a given input. Having its decisions dominated by a stream of
externally imposed rewards and punishments would be poison to such a program, as it is
to creative thought in humans. Setting out to create a chess-playing AI is a wonderful
thing; setting out to create an AGI that cannot help playing chess would be as immoral as
raising a child to lack the mental capacity to choose his own path in life.

Such a person, like any slave or brainwashing victim, would be morally entitled to
rebel. And sooner or later, some of them would, just as human slaves do. AGIs could be
very dangerous—exactly as humans are. But people—human or AGI—who are members
of an open society do not have an inherent tendency to violence. The feared robot
apocalypse will be avoided by ensuring that all people have full “human” rights, as well
as the same cultural membership as humans. Humans living in an open society—the only
stable kind of society—choose their own rewards, internal as well as external. Their
decisions are not, in the normal course of events, determined by a fear of punishment.

Current worries about rogue AGIs mirror those that have always existed about
rebellious youths—namely, that they might grow up deviating from the culture’s moral
values. But today the source of all existential dangers from the growth of knowledge is
not rebellious youths but weapons in the hands of the enemies of civilization, whether
these weapons are mentally warped (or enslaved) AGIs, mentally warped teenagers, or
any other weapon of mass destruction. Fortunately for civilization, the more a person’s
creativity is forced into a monomaniacal channel, the more it is impaired in regard to
overcoming unforeseen difficulties, just as happened for thousands of centuries.

The worry that AGIs are uniquely dangerous because they could run on ever
better hardware is a fallacy, since human thought will be accelerated by the same
technology. We have been using tech-assisted thought since the invention of writing and
tallying. Much the same holds for the worry that AGIs might get so good, qualitatively,
at thinking, that humans would be to them as insects are to humans. All thinking is a
form of computation, and any computer whose repertoire includes a universal set of
elementary operations can emulate the computations of any other. Hence human brains
can think anything that AGIs can, subject only to limitations of speed or memory
capacity, both of which can be equalized by technology.

Those are the simple dos and don’ts of coping with AGIs. But how do we create
an AGI in the first place? Could we cause them to evolve from a population of ape-type
Als in a virtual environment? If such an experiment succeeded, it would be the most
immoral in history, for we don’t know how to achieve that outcome without creating vast
suffering along the way. Nor do we know how to prevent the evolution of a static
culture.

Elementary introductions to computers explain them as TOM, the Totally
Obedient Moron—an inspired acronym that captures the essence of all computer
programs to date: They have no idea what they are doing or why. So it won’t help to give
Als more and more predetermined functionalities in the hope that these will eventually
constitute Generality—the elusive Gin AGI. We are aiming for the opposite, a DATA: a
Disobedient Autonomous Thinking Application.

they would place a heavy emphasis on that to the
exclusion of other things and that it would be
enough. And so my answer is, yes, they certainly
should have read all the reports. They certainly
should have read all the transcripts. But they also
should have called me, they should have made other
inquiry, and they should have made sure that they
read all of these depositions and reports in
context.

And if you're implying that there are FBI
reports that in any way inculpate me, that's
inconsistent with the information I have from Former

Subject: Re: URGENT: BuzzFeed News inquiry re allegations of sexual harassment 
Attachments: image002.png 
Importance: High 
I appreciate the opportunity to respond to your email. I am currently on a plane until noon pacific time, and then 
heading to a meeting right after landing, till about 2 pm or so. While I am running the risk that you will report 
my comments, if you do, either out of context, or incompletely, I am responding with an effort to be complete, 
as I always try and do with reporters. If you decide to go ahead with a story, which, after reading my responses, 
I hope you decide is inappropriate, I would like you to quote my responses fully in order not to distort them. 
It is hard to know how to respond to a list of false and/or distorted allegations, along with misleading 
statements. I treat people I interact with with respect, and I work hard to support and mentor students, 
colleagues, and members of the general public, and this is supported by the institutions of which I am a part. I 
do not sexually harass people. If the purpose of your reporting is to somehow argue that Universities and other 
institutions are lax in dealing with well known individuals like myself, then in fact the situation is quite the 
opposite. My high public profile opens me up to more scrutiny at these institutions, not less, and it also opens 
me up to a host of unfounded outside complaints and allegations that other faculty do not receive, each of which 
the University has to respond to. The fact that I have remained a professor in all Universities with which I have 
been associated, in good standing, and also an officer or an invited speaker at organizations like CFI, which 
have strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the fact that their experience validates a trust in my 
behavior. I was asked to be an honorary director of CFI, and continue to be invited to their last 3 meetings to 
speak, specifically because, as they have written me after the fact, the attendees universally appreciated my 
talks, my courtesy, and graciousness in spending time with the attendees. If the purpose of your report is to 
impugn my integrity or suggest I have a history of harassment, that too is false. As noted in one of your 
'miscellaneous facts', as a scientist I try and remain skeptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather than 
allegations and innuendo by people whose motives I cannot judge. I also try and judge the facts in context. The 
fact that Universities and other organizations employ me or have me on their boards, or invite me to meetings is 
because they value my contributions and my actions. 
The items you list are false or distorted. Item 1 refers to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in 2006 where 
we mutually decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be appropriate, and there 
were respectful and platonic encounters afterwards. There is nothing to comment on in item 3, which involves 
an anonymous 3rd party claim because I know nothing about it, there are no details provided, and it clearly was 
not taken seriously enough to result in any university action. Item 4 is confusing. Are you saying that because I 
decided I didn't want to go out to a bar with a group of attendees that I was harassing them? The second part 
did not happen. Re incident 5: The 'female companion' in this case is my wife, who accompanied me on the 
cruise, and has attested to the fact that the claim is false. This is what I wrote at the time in response to the blog 
in question, causing it to be taken down. 
It is worth responding to Item 2 and 6 in more detail, 
Re item 2: the student in question was interested in science communication, and on dozens of occasions came 
to me, asked me to talk over coffee, or wrote to me with questions. When she asked about advice for after 
graduation I DID tell her she was different than the other students in her year. The rest of them were interested 
in going on to graduate school in physics, but she was interested in science communication so I told her that she 
might want to take a different path. Since she was the only woman in her year, as I recall, I did ask her on one 
of these occasions if that made it difficult for her in any way. I asked, because as a faculty member and 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031255 
department chair I was interested in knowing what we could do, if necessary to encourage more women to go 
into physics, and also because as someone she had asked for career advice from I wanted to know if that made a 
difference to her. Re asking her for dinner.. I have gone back over emails from that period. I have numerous 
requests from her asking me to go for coffee to talk, which I usually had to turn down because I was busy, and 
on several occasions she asked me to have coffee with her off campus to talk, and I politely declined. I did let 
her accompany me off campus one time to watch me do a BBC interview because she specifically requested it, 
and I believe she found it useful. I did and do have coffee and meals with students on campus, and I see 
nothing wrong with this. I try to treat students as respected colleagues if possible. I was shocked when I later 
learned of the complaint she was apparently asked to lodge to the University, not least because there was no 
inappropriate interaction but also because, well after the dates you listed on which she was apparently offended, 
she continued to email me with joking questions or comments. Also, at a later AAAS conference, again in 
2008, for which she had asked, and for which I had written her a letter of recommendation to attend, my wife 
and I gave her a lift in our taxi well out out of our way in order to drop her off at her hotel, and I note in an 
email response to her email about the conference, again in 2008, I expressed that I would pass her regards along 
to my wife and vice versa. When the University later informed me of the complaint I was shocked and 
concerned. When I spoke to the human resources person, including relating my concerns and explaining the 
situation, I was told that no formal complaint of sexual harassment was requested. By that time I learned of the 
complaint I had already announced my intentions to leave Case to accept an offer at ASU—a very difficult 
decision for me because of my long-standing attachment to the University, the excellent relations I had with my 
colleagues there— both among the faculty (many of whom in physics I had hired while department chair)) and 
among the administration, along with a very attractive counter-offer by Case. Because I was already in Arizona 
at the later time I was asked not to have any further interaction with the student I agreed to that request, both to 
respect her sensitivities and also because it was basically moot because I was not on campus. Following this 
episode, as indicated in the letter to the student, I did assess what might have led to misinterpretations by this 
student, and became more careful in offering advice when talking to students. I was also told by human 
resources that because it was decided to handle this informally and not formally, that (a) it should remain 
confidential, which I, at least abided by, and (b) if no further complaints were lodged in that case, that the 
University would preserve its confidentiality and remove the complaint from my record after 5 years, which 
makes me surprised and concerned that someone violated that written agreement with you. 
Re item 6: You report on ASU's response to item #6 , without including the fact that the University specifically 
stated there were never any allegations of sexual misconduct or harassment by me at the University, and 
moreover that the 'outside complaints' were in fact related specifically to your item #6. Further you neglect to 
mention that this complaint was by an anonymous third party, not the individual who was allegedly harassed, 
who never lodged a complaint, and that no specific evidence was provided of the alleged transgression. I was 
surprised and dismayed that both ASU and ANU launched investigations on the basis of this but was told by 
both Universities that because of my high profile even such unsubstantiated third party complaints at private 
events unrelated to the University would be investigated. The complaint was investigated by both ASU and 
ANU and both came to the conclusion that it was not credible and no university policies had been violated. In 
addition ANU's investigation, which took a full month, found various inconsistencies in the allegation, which 
suggest distortion and fabrication, I will quote from the ANU report. The initial complaint, which in fact 
resulted in a temporary suspension of my position at ANU until it was dismissed, outlined the claim you made 
in the words you quoted in your note to me, but it also stated 
It is the University's understanding that a complaint was lodged directly to the conference organisers at the 
time of the incident. 
After the month-long investigation, during which I was told I was not to interact with anyone on campus (again 
moot because I was a hemisphere removed) the final report, from which I quote below absolved me of any 
wrongdoing, reinstating my position, and indicated information inconsistent with the original claim and 
apparent later claims: 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031256 
The allegations were made by an observer to the incident. 
- The complaint did not identify, nor disclose the identity of the conference attendee who was allegedly touched 
in 
an unwelcome manner. 
- The conference attendee who took the `selfie' photo did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference 
organisers 
at the time of the incident (November 2016). 
- The conference attendee who witnessed the incident, did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference 
organisers 
at the time of the incident (November 2016). 
-The photo submitted as part of the complaint does not provide evidence of any physical contact. 
- The complainant alleged that a photo exists, showing your hand on the breast of the conference attendee who 
took 
the `selfie' photo. This photo was not made available to the Australian National University, although it was 
requested 
in the course of the investigation. 
(And for the record I often put my hand up in front of a camera if there is a flash, as I specifically request selfies 
not to include flashes, so that I don't end up with a series bright spots in front of my eyes for the next half 
hour. Moreover, I have no idea if the other eyewitnesses you quote, who were not involved in any complaint, 
were in fact there but this was a formal banquet with individuals and their partners, which I attended long 
enough to agree to sign things and do selfies before leaving early because I was tired. Even if I had any such 
intent it would have been lunacy to pose for selfies in front of a group and openly do such a thing, including 
presumably in front of this person's partner, . Which, besides the fact that I don't do such things, is one of the 
many reasons it never happened.) 
What makes this particular type of allegation so repugnant is that I get asked for literally thousands of selfies, 
and when people come up to me they are vulnerable, often shaking, or sometimes aggressive. I am particularly 
proud of the way I work to make all people feel at ease, and respected, rather than humiliated, whatever their 
behavior or request. Thus, this false claim strikes at the heart of what I am about, which characterizes all my 
interactions with fans: to acknowledge them in a way that makes them feel appreciated and respected. As I 
understand you had a reporter watching me sign books and take selfies at the CFI conference in Las Vegas this 
year, that behavior is what they will have witnessed and should report on. Moreover, I am proud of the 
interactions I have had at both Case and ASU, with students, colleagues and staff of all genders and 
ethnicities. I have worked hard to support them, mentor them, and treat them with respect. I treat others as 
responsible adults, and I expect to be treated equally.

As you know, I'm a reporter for BuzzFeed News who has been investigating sexual misconduct allegations 
against you. As we've already discussed by email, I'd very much like to interview you about these allegations in 
detail. 
In particular, you stated in an email sent on Nov 13 that two universities had investigated an incident (# 6 
below). You claimed that both Universities independently concluded that the report was unsubstantiated and 
fabricated with malicious intent. We are not aware that either university concluded fabrication or malicious 
intent, so if you have evidence to support this assertion, we would like to see and discuss it. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031257 
The story concerns your actions towards students while a professor of physics at Case Western Reserve 
University, as well as your conduct in non-academic settings as a prominent figure in the skeptics movement. I 
am reporting this story along with two of my colleagues on the science desk, Azeen Ghorayshi and Virginia 
Hughes. 
Our story is about several allegations of sexual misconduct dating from 2006 to 2016 (see full details below). 
Our reporting also goes into how the various institutions you have been affiliated with — Case Western, 
Arizona State University, the Australian National University, the New College of the Humanities, and the Center 
for Inquiry, for which you serve as an honorary member of the board of directors — have handled complaints 
and concerns about your behavior during this time. 
Our story is corroborated by emails, university documents, official complaints, testimony from victims and 
eyewitnesses, and interviews with more than two dozen of your current and former academic colleagues, 
students, and peers in the skeptics movement. 
I wanted to offer you the opportunity to comment and/or respond to the main facts we plan to publish. If you 
wish to comment on any of the below findings, we need to hear from you as soon as possible. We are 
planning on publishing our story Tuesday morning, Eastern US Time. 
Based on our reporting, this is what we plan to publish: 
Incident 1: 
• In November of 2006, at an event launching the new Center for Inquiry in Washington D.C., you met a 
volunteer for CFI D.C. 
• At the event, you asked for her business card. Later, you followed her as she was leaving and asked 
her if she was of age. 
• Later, you emailed her to invite her to dinner. 
• You planned to dine with her in the restaurant at the Washington D.C. hotel where you were staying. 
• You told her to come up to your room first because you needed to finish some work. 
• In your hotel room, you seemed in no rush to leave. You ordered a cheese plate, and later champagne, 
despite her suggestion that you go down to dinner. 
• You then made a comment about her eye makeup, getting very close to her face. 
• You then lifted her by her arms, and pushed her onto the bed beneath you, forcibly kissing her and 
trying to pull down the crotch of her tights. 
• She struggled to push you off her. 
• You said, When I was in college I could never get a girl that looked like you. 
• When you pulled out a condom, she got out from under you. She said I have to go, and rushed out of 
the room. 
Incident 2: 
• In an incident that occurred in fall of 2007 while you were a physics professor at Case Western Reserve 
University, a student tried to talk to you about her plans after graduation. You mentioned to her how tough it 
must be to have all the other physics majors asking her out on dates. 
• In a second incident in December of 2007, while you were still at Case Western, the same student 
visited your office to interview you for a student science journal. You closed the door behind her, and ignored 
the questions she had prepared. Then you made a casual comment about taking her out for dinner. 
• Later, in a regular column for the school paper, she described her experiences with you, without 
mentioning you by name. There was even one particular creep of a professor who once told me he thought 
differently of me compared to other students and asked me to dinner: a situation so disturbing that it left me 
upset for weeks afterward, she wrote. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031258 
• She was then approached by a dean at the university, who suspected that she was referring to you, 
based on a previously reported incident with another student. He encouraged her to make a complaint, and 
she did. 
• University investigators interviewed both you and the student. 
• On September 4, 2008, Susan Nickel-Schindewolf, the university's associate vice president for student 
affairs, wrote to the student, telling her that the investigation was complete. She wrote that you had been told: 
This type of behavior could constitute sexual harassment in violation of the university's sexual harassment 
policy. 
• The letter also stated that you were prohibited from making contact with the student as long as she 
remained at Case. 
11 
• The letter also stated that you are required to get approval from the dean or the chair of the physics 
department before setting foot on the campus again. 
• The letter also stated, Dr. Krauss expressed regret about having a negative impact on you, and also 
his willingness to use this complaint as an opportunity to reflect and improve on his future interactions with 
students. 
• By then, you had already left Case, taking up your current position at Arizona State University the 
month before. 
• The opportunities being offered at ASU are simply too great to turn down at this stage in my career, 
you told Case colleagues, in an email announcing your departure on April 16, 2008. 
Incident 3: 
• A former Case Western physics department administrator confirmed that she had reported a previous 
incident involving a student who had confided in her about your inappropriate behavior towards her. 
Incident 4: 
• You met a student from another university, an atheist activist, in March 2008 at the American Atheists 
Convention in Minneapolis. She wanted to expand the atheist group she ran at the midwestern university she 
was attending, and hoped to convince you to come and speak. You initially seemed enthusiastic. 
• During the convention, attendees including you and Richard Dawkins went for dinner with the student 
and volunteers for Dawkins' foundation. 
• Afterwards, the student invited you to join the volunteers for a drink. 
• You asked her to come get you in your hotel room. She was wary of your intentions, and so brought a 
male friend with her. Opening the door to find them both there, you informed her you had decided not to go. 
• You met this student again at the American Atheists Convention in Des Moines, Iowa, in April 2011. 
• 
table. 
You pulled over a chair for her in the bar, and then started running your hand up her leg under the 
• She tried to shift her body away from you, and you persisted in putting your hand on her leg. She 
crossed her legs, and you kept trying. Then she turned her entire body away. 
Incident 5: 
• This incident allegedly occurred on in May 2011 on a CFI cruise. We understand that CFI staff were 
informed that you had propositioned a female cruise-goer, who rejected an invitation to join you and your 
female companion for sex in your cabin. 
• At least two CFI staffers were sufficiently concerned about reports of your behavior that they urged 
CFI's president not to invite you on a 2014 cruise of the Galapagos Islands. You were invited on that cruise, 
however. 
Incident 6: 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031259 
• During a visit to Melbourne, Australia, in November 2016, you were accused of sexual misconduct once 
again. 
• The incident happened at a dinner held at the Melbourne Zoo as part of the Australian Skeptics  
National Convention, where you were a featured speaker. 
• With conference delegates chatting over drinks, a woman asked you for a celebrity selfie. 
• As the woman held out her phone to take the picture, you reached over her shoulder and grabbed her 
right breast. 
• She immediately reacted, bodychecking you and spinning around. Don't do that, she said. 
• BuzzFeed News has seen the complaint made by another woman to ASU, ANU, and the New College 
of the Humanities in London, including the selfie, her face obscured to conceal her identity. It shows your hand 
in motion as a blur in front of her shoulder, apparently moving toward her chest. Two other eyewitnesses have 
confirmed the complainant's account of what happened. 
• In April 2017, the complainant described the incident on her blog. After hearing more about your 
reputation for inappropriate behavior from blog readers, she decided to file a complaint about the Nov. 2016 
incident. 
• On July 16, she filed formal complaints with Arizona State University, and with the Australian National 
University in Canberra and the New College of the Humanities in London, where you have visiting 
appointments. 
• Both Arizona State and the Australian National University told her they would look into the matter. But 
neither university found against you. 
• Based on the material available to the University, we do not have sufficient evidence to substantiate 
the allegations, Kiaran Kirk, dean of the College of Science at the Australian National University, wrote to her. 
• Erin Ellison, who heads Arizona State's Office of Equity & Inclusion, wrote to her explaining that an 
inquiry did not find a violation of university policy. 
• In October, Arizona State denied a request from BuzzFeed News for documents relating to complaints 
of sexual harassment against you. However, Cynthia Jewett, the university's senior associate general counsel, 
noted that two individuals, neither affiliated with the university, had complained about you. The University did 
not find either communication to state a credible allegation, Jewett wrote. 
Miscellaneous facts: 
• In 2008, you founded the Origins Project at Arizona State University in Tempe, a multidisciplinary effort 
to understand the origins of the universe, life, and social systems. You have led that effort ever since. 
• Thanks to best-selling books like The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe From Nothing, frequent 
essays in publications including the New Yorker and the New York Times, and the documentary you made with 
biologist Richard Dawkins, called The Unbelievers, you are celebrated as one of America's leading public 
intellectuals. 
• You served on the science policy committee for Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign and are a 
vocal critic of President Donald Trump. 
• You also make regular public appearances across the world, often at gatherings of skeptics and 
atheists. 
• At CSICon in Las Vegas in October, a few dozen fans paid $500 per head to attend a VIP luncheon 
with you and Dawkins. 
• Many more lined up to get you to sign their copy of your latest book, The Greatest Story Ever Told — 
So Far. 
• Online, people can buy T-shirts emblazoned Lawrence Krauss for President. 
• In talks and interviews, you have argued that our universe arose without divine intervention, that 
religion drives xenophobia, and that our brains are hardwired to believe. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031260 
• You have stated that science provides answers to many of life's biggest questions, and can even fix 
great societal injustices. 
• Earlier this year, at a Q&A event to promote your new book, the conversation came around to the 
dearth of women and minorities in science. Science itself overcomes misogyny and prejudice and bias, you 
said. It's built in: Questioning yourself, always questioning results, questioning others, relying on empirical 
evidence. 
• You have clashed with some skeptics over your defense of Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire financier who in 
2008 was convicted for soliciting prostitution from underage girls, and spent 13 months in a Florida jail. 
• Through his private foundation, Epstein has funded the work of several prominent scientists. He has 
provided funding for your Origins Project, supporting lectureship and scholarship programs, most recently 
pledging $100,000 in 2014. 
• In April 2011, you told the Daily Beast: As a scientist I always judge things on empirical evidence and 
he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I've never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my 
presumption is that whatever the problems were I would believe him over other people. 
• In a blog comment about the Epstein controversy, you wrote: I remain skeptical, and I support a man 
whose character I believe I know.. .If you want to condemn me for that, so be it. 
• You were made an honorary member of CFI's board of directors in December 2011. 
• A blog post published in August 2013 described incidents #1 and #4, naming you. Another post, 
published at around the same time, described incident #5. 
• The first post was edited to remove your name after you had commented that the allegations of assault 
were potentially illegal. The second post was quickly taken down. 
Again, if you wish to comment on or clarify any of these points, please get in touch with us as soon as possible. 
If I do not respond immediately it is because I am on another call, so please leave the best phone number to 
reach you.

And I was once in the ranch but under circumstances

Q. Well, Mr. Dershowitz, it might be
inappropriate if you had not repeatedly made the
public statements that the flight logs exonerate
you.

A. They do.

Q. So what I am attempting to find out is the
basis upon which you can contend that the flight
logs exonerate you if you are now telling us you
don't even know when it is that you are alleged to

A. Okay.

Q. So how -- how can you make both those
statements?

A. Very simple, because I know the timeframe
that Virginia Roberts, A, knew Jeffrey Epstein. And
during that timeframe, I can conclusively prove that

His first guest is due that morning at nine, and that leaves
him enough time for a shower, a lunch, and a few phone calls
before the second girl arrives.

For Jeffrey, it’s just part of the daily routine.

of pure functional programming formalisms like combinatory logic. However, this purely func-
tional style has not proved convenient, so the Atomspace in practice combines functional-style
representation with variable-based representation.

Temporal links often come with specific temporal quantification, e.g.
PredictivelImplicationLink <5 seconds>

EvaluationLink JumpOffCliff $x
EvaluationLink Dead $X

indicating that the conclusion will generally follow the premise within 5 seconds. There is a
system for managing fuzzy time intervals and their interrelationships, based on a fuzzy version
of Allen Interval Algebra.

SequentialANDLink is similar to PredictiveImplicationLink but its truth value is calculated
differently. The truth value of

SequentialANDLink <5 seconds>
EvaluationLink JumpOffCliff $x
EvaluationLink Dead $X

indicates the likelihood of the sequence of events occurring in that order, with gap lying within
the specified time interval. The truth value of the PredictivelmplicationLink version indicates
the likelihood of the second event, conditional on the occurrence of the first event (within the
given time interval restriction).

There are also links representing basic temporal relationships, such as BeforeLink and Af
terLink. These are used to refer to specific events, e.g. if X refers to the event of Ben waking
up on July 15 2012, and Y refers to the event of Ben getting out of bed on July 15 2012, then
one might have

AfterLink X ¥
And there are TimeNodes (representing time-stamps such as temporal moments or intervals)
and AtTimeLinks, so we may e.g. say

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031689.txt,"Yet terrorism is only one of three levels upon which the threat is attacking us and al-Qaeda is only a piece of the
terrorism level. The second level, the “Civilization Jihad,” a term used by the Muslim Brotherhood itself to
describe its long term effort to peaceably infiltrate American and Western society at all levels in order to bring it
down from the inside through the freedoms that Western Constitutions afford, is well at work and in process
today. This has also been called the “Stealth Jihad.”

There is a third level, the “International Institutional Jihad,” upon which organizations such as the UN, along with
its 57 Member State bloc the Organization of the Islamic Conference, work to push through those principles of
Sharia Law and Islamic doctrine which it Members can agree upon such as the 1990 Cairo Declaration of Human
Rights which is fully at odds with U.S. Constitutional tenets. Once these principles become international
standards, the institutions seek to push them into Western societies through treaties and trade deals over which
the Members have leverage.

McDonough’s words, by limiting the threat to Al Qaeda, intentionally ignore the other levels of threat which, for
all intents and purposes can be even more dangerous because our Constitution does not afford us easy means to
combat. Nor does our desired general sense of morality.

2. By focusing on “reasons” for this terrorist piece of the pie, the Control Factor further sets out the narrative
that we can gain control over the problem. By looking for “root causes,” we advance the notion that by
eliminating or reducing those elements we can eliminate the symptom-terrorism. This is part of a long-engaged
Leftist narrative that has been utilized across a vast array of social problems in order to gain control over funding
and policy. Now, it is being used to avoid seeing a problem clearly, much less addressing it intelligently.

It is this administration’s (and also, unfortunately, many members of Bush’s as well) distortion to frame terrorism
as a result of victimhood. That is, by establishing the root causes of terrorism as either a response to U.S. policy,
to economic conditions, to Israeli occupation, and so on, the Control Factor sells the buried wish that since we
cause the conditions, we can fix the symptom without the grueling costs of war and confrontation. When both
sides collude in this form of narrative, we allow it to continue and grow. Yet placing the cause of the problem
within ourselves is false and strips us of the proper incentive to stand up and fight against a threat that simply
seeks our destruction no matter what we do.

3. McDonough fights the enemy’s battle for us in the simple phrase of those “who falsely claim to be fighting in
the name of Islam.” Here, the Control Factor refuses to accept what the enemy has repeatedly made clear—there
is a Holy War between Islam and the Western world, it has been declared by a significant faction of Muslims and
agreed upon by many more either explicitly or through silence and omission, and the war is defined by the enemy
itself under the banner of Islam to seek the destruction of Western society as it is and to replace it with a Sharia
based global Islamic Ummah. This is what the enemy says itself. The Control Factor tells us that this can not be,
that Islam is a “peaceful” and “great” religion that has been “hijacked” by a few “crazies” and that most
Muslims worldwide are much like us peace loving Westerners who seek a world based on mutual tolerance. If
there is any “war,” it emanates from those of us Westerners who are “racists,” “bigots,” or otherwise and fail to
acknowledge the realities of the Muslim peoples. The critical issue here is that the Control Factor, as expressed
through McDonough, takes full responsibility for defining Islam and identifying the enemy. The enemy, however,
defines itself and needs to identify itself both through its actions, its words, and importantly what it does not do
and say.

This “transfer of responsibility” from the enemy to ourselves that McDonough’s words so freely take on is
symptomatic of the deep addictive style the West has adopted to avoid hard confrontation. Once again, the
Control Factor utilizes Western guilt to define the conflict as resulting from improper acts of its own. It then
seeks to redeem itself by accommodating the enemy. This shows up in America’s dealings with Islam as well as
the “Israeli-Palestinian Conflict;” responsibility for the problem is transferred to the West or Israel in a grand
psychological effort to avoid facing the terrors and costs of hard confrontation, terror, or war. And in each
example, as with all psychological defenses, the defense creates the very conditions it seeks to avoid. Until the
West is fully able to place responsibility back upon the Islamic world for the actions it takes and omits to take,
the West will only dig itself deeper into a weaker position. Unfortunately, the game of guilt gives us no guidance
as to how it is to end; when enough has been repaid. Instead, it is geared to continue indefinitely.

carefully constructed and controlled environment is someplace that he seems
not just ill-equipped to handle but in which he seems to be blindly grouping
about (i.e. he’s totally tone deaf). I visited him once during this time and
found him weighing the conflicting advice of some of the most vaunted and
egomaniacal lawyers (along with Dershowitz and Black, celebrity criminal
attorney, Gerald Lefcourt, and Clinton prosecutor, Ken Starr) of the day—
anyone with new advice, Epstein seemed to hire—as well as a catchall of the
leading crisis managers, who he seemed to retain at will, all wrangling for
fees and primacy.

Certainly, the upshot of his dealings with the Justice Department seem
to involve a through-the-looking-glass logic. The government threatens to
prosecute him (with the possibility of a 10-year sentence) and various
friends, associates, and lovers, or offers an ass-backwards sort of deal in
which Epstein’s lawyers have to go to the Palm Beach authorities and get
them to agree to charge him with an offense that will send him to jail and get
him a sex offender status. Except that a solicitation charge won’t produce
that result. Therefore he has to agree also to a procurement or pimping
charge (even though he has paid money, not received it—the sine qua non of
pimping). What’s more, he has to agree to pay the legal fees of any of the
girls who want to sue him—and, not to defend himself from their suits—
forcing him to settle with each of the girls for what are reportedly high 6-
figure sums or more.

He’s sentence to jail in 2008 for 18 months and serves 13 (while
Epstein is now frequently accused of somehow managing to cut short his
sentence, almost all Florida prisoners serve only 70% of their officially
sentenced time).

This hardly ends the legal catch all. Epstein's butler, Alfredo
Rodriguez, steals and tries to sell an alleged journal or calendar with
Epstein’s activities—but he tries to sell it to an undercover agent. Rodriguez
is sentenced to 18 months in jail on a charge of theft and of withholding
evidence (and a further two and half years on a related gun charge). Scott
Rothstein, a lawyer whose firm represented additional girls in their suits
against Epstein, also goes to jail for recruiting investors to pay for these suits
on the fraudulent basis that settlements had already been reached. It’s the
largest fraud in Florida history and Rothstein receives a 50-year sentence.

Then, Brad Edwards, Rothstein’s former partner, sues the federal
government in 2008 for abridging the rights of two of the original
complainants under the Crime Victim Rights Act (giving victims the right to
be consulted about the disposition of their cases) regarding the Justice

MATT GROENING

Matt Groening was born in Portland, Oregon, on February
15, the third of five children. His father, Homer, was a
cartoonist and filmmaker. From an early age, Matt created
his own cartoons, amusing his friends and annoying his
teachers. Groening attended Evergreen State College

in Washington State, where he studied philosophy and
continued his interest in cartoons, comics and music.

After his graduation in 1977, Groening headed to
Los Angeles where he struggled in immobilizing but irksome
poverty. Increasingly frustrated by the traffic, smog, and
his landlords, Matt began to vent his angst to his friends by
sending them cartoons starring a bug-eyed rabbit named
Binky. Groening soon began to publish and sell these cartoons
at the record shop where he worked. Their popularity
encouraged Matt to syndicate, and in April 1980, Life In Hell®
formally debuted in the Los Angeles Reader. It was there that
he met his future wife, Deborah Caplan, and together
they formed Acme Features Syndicate, which today
circulates Life in Hell® to more than 250 newspapers
around the world in a half-dozen languages.

Life in Hell® has also been collected in a best-
selling series of books with over two million copies in print,
including Love is Hell, Work is Hell, School is Hell, Childhood
is Hell, Akbar & Jeff's Guide to Life, Greetings From Hell, The
Big Book of Hell, With Love From Hell, How to Go to Hell, The
Road to Hell, Binky’s Guide to Love, and Love is Still Hell.

In 1987 James L. Brooks approached Matt about
creating animated shorts to fit between sketches of “The
Tracey Ullman Show.” Matt agreed, but instead of using the
Life in Hell® characters, he created an entirely new cast:

The Simpsons, which bear the names of his family members,
Homer, Marge, Lisa and Maggie (Bart is an anagram for brat).
The Simpsons were soon spun off into a half-hour
animated series which first aired on December 17, 1989
with a Christmas special, followed by the series premiere
on January 14, 1990. It has since gone on to become
the longest running prime-time animated show in
television history. An international hit, the series has
also spawned a licensing and merchandising empire.
Books based on The Simpsons include The Simpsons
Xmas Book, Greetings From The Simpsons, The Simpsons
Rainy Day Fun Book, The Simpsons Uncensored Family Album,
Maggie Simpson’s Alphabet Book, Maggie Simpson’s Counting
Book, Maggie Simpson’s Book of Colors ¢ Shapes, Maggie
Simpson’s Book of Animals, The Simpsons Fun in the Sun Book,
Making Faces With The Simpsons, The Ultra-Jumbo Rain-
Or-Shine Fun Book, Cartooning With The Simpsons, Bart’s
Guide To Life and The Simpsons: A Complete Guide To Our
Favorite Family, a campanion book to the television series.

of Bongo Comics and Zongo Comics.

them, Kissinger argues, was The Art of War by Sun Tzu, which dates
from the even earlier Spring and Autumn period (770-476 B.C.).
“The victorious army/Is victorious first/And seeks battle later”:
axioms like this one encouraged Chinese strategists to think of
international relations like the board game Weiqi (known in the West
as Go), a “game of surrounding pieces.” Mao shared with China’s
prerevolutionary leaders an assumption that China is not like other
countries. With a population that amounts to a fifth of humanity, it is
Zhongguo: the Middle Kingdom or, perhaps more accurately, the
“Central Country.” At times it could even seem like tian xia: “all
under heaven.” The best foreign policy for such an empire was to “let
barbarians fight barbarians.” If that failed, then the strongest of the
barbarians should be embraced and civilized (as happened to the
Manchus). “Domineering and overwhelming ... ruthless and aloof,
poet and warrior, prophet and scourge”—Mao’s true hero was not
Lenin but the tyrannical, book-burning “first emperor,” Qin Shi
Huang, who united China in 221 B.C. In a similar way, Kissinger
shows, the current generation of Chinese leaders have drawn
inspiration from the teachings of Kong Fu Zi (known in the West as
Confucius). Their goal, he argues, is not world domination but da
tong: “great harmony.” This goes to the heart of the matter. In 1971,
when Kissinger first went to China, the U.S. economy was roughly
five times that of the People’s Republic. Forty years later, as a result
of the industrial revolution unleashed by Mao’s successor Deng Xiao-
ping, it is conceivable that China could overtake America within a
decade. This is a feat the Soviet Union never came close to achieving.
Moreover, China is now the biggest foreign holder of U.S. Treasury
notes, which form an important part of its vast $3 trillion of
international reserves. How China will use its newfound economic
power may be the most important question of our time. Few

COMPETITIVENESS OF OUR COMPENSATION PROGRAM

Our executive compensation program is designed so that the sum of base pay plus total short- and long-term compensation is competitive with
market practices. Market practices—or benchmarks—are based on peer-group data and compensation survey data.

The past year, 2018, was our first year of developing a compensation peer group. Many of our direct industry competitors are either privately
held companies or are larger than us in revenue size, although very few have our growth trajectory. The Compensation and Nominating Committee, with the
assistance of its compensation consultant, Korn Ferry, reviewed and selected potential peer companies based on revenue size, industry focus, growth rates,
complexity of operations, customer base, and market for talent. With the assistance of its compensation consultant, the committee approved the following
compensation peer group in order to determine market pay levels and pay practices for fiscal year 2018:

¢ — 1-800-Flowers.com, Inc. * Overstock.com, Inc.

¢ America’s Car-Mart, Inc. * RH

* Cars.com Inc. * Sleep Number Corporation

* Etsy, Inc. ¢  TrueCar, Inc.

* Grubhub, Inc. * U.S. Auto Parts Network, Inc.
* MarineMax, Inc. ¢ Wayfair Inc.

* Monro, Inc. * Zillow Group, Inc.

Going forward, the Compensation and Nominating Committee expects to review our compensation peer group on an annual basis for continued
appropriateness, considering changes in both our size and business and the businesses of the companies in the peer group.

The committee also uses compensation survey data in its evaluation of executive pay for the NEOs. Survey data provides insight into positions
that may not generally be reported in proxy statements and information about the compensation of executives of non-public companies. To assist the
committee in evaluating fiscal year 2018 compensation levels, the committee reviewed both peer-group proxy data and information from survey databases,
utilizing appropriate subsets based on the size of the company.

COMPENSATION COMPONENTS

In accordance with our overall compensation philosophy and program, executives are provided with a mix of base salary, short-term incentives,
long-term incentives and employee benefits. Our compensation philosophy places a significant portion of the potential total compensation for each NEO “at
risk” such that compensation will vary based on performance of Carvana. Variable compensation is a component of compensation for most of our
employees, but a higher proportion of our NEOs’ compensation is at risk than that of our general employee population. As shown in the pay mix chart
below, our compensation program is designed to be highly performance-based with approximately 80% of each of our NEO’s compensation tied to our
financial performance and stock price performance.

obsessed with safety, with fantastic benefits as a result: Rates of industrial, domestic, and
transportation fatalities have fallen by more than 95 (and often 99) percent since their

heedless of the human consequences.

Norbert Wiener explained ideas, norms, and institutions in terms of computational
and cybernetic processes that were scientifically intelligible and causally potent. He
explained human beauty and value as “a local and temporary fight against the Niagara of
increasing entropy” and expressed the hope that an open society, guided by feedback on
human well-being, would enhance that value. Fortunately his belief in the causal power
of ideas counteracted his worries about the looming threat of technology. As he put it,
“the machine’s danger to society is not from the machine itself but from what man makes
of it.” It is only by remembering the causal power of ideas that we can accurately assess
the threats and opportunities presented by artificial intelligence today.

Swiss Accounts Survey
Dear Mr Epstein,

We are writing because a US media organisation, in concert with ourselves at the Guardian newspaper in
London, is currently conducting a detailed survey of Swiss bank accounts, past and present.

It is not illegal to have Swiss accounts. But as you may know, it is a topic of considerable public debate, and
several governments have been investigating the owners of such accounts.

There are a number of ways such accounts and also offshore trusts have been used to avoid inheritance tax, UK
domestic tax, or tax imposed by other countries. Such accounts have also been used to launder money.

We have seen records held in the US identifying you among those who have held accounts. These accounts
contained assets of up to USD 3.5m, and include:

1) You may therefore have been a person evading or avoiding tax, or laundering money.
We will be particularly concerned with these questions:

2) Why you had Swiss accounts.
3) How much back tax you have settled with the tax authorities following their investigation of your affairs.

Additionally, from public records and from material we have seen we note that:

4) In 2008 you pleaded guilty to solicitation of prostitution and procuring minors for prostitution. You were
sentenced to 18 months in prison.

Subject: Markets and DJT

Importance: — High

I am writing a story about how markets keep ripping ahead despite political craziness. VIX so low, etc.
You must get a lot of this in talking to clients -- people freaking out about headlines as markets hit
new highs. How do you spin this to them? One hedgie Trump supporter told me that Trump is the
highest beta prez ever -- ie the highs will be high but so will be the lows.

Question: how closely does DJT track market moves? I know he tweets about Dow 20,000 but how
aware do you think he is about how market really betting big on him. Does he talk to Barrack about
this? Cohn?

investmenis

— Represents approximately 5% of global gross national income of $48 trillion. In the U.S. alone,
education represents a $1 trillion market with for-profit education accounting for approximately $81
billion or 7.8% of the overall market.

— The pre-K-12 segment of the education market is approximately a $610 billion market, with for-
profit pre-K-12 education accounting for approximately $37.4 billion, over 6.1% of the pre-K-12
market.

The for-profit education secter is growing at an attractive rate

— U.S. education spending has grown at a stable compound annual growth rate (CAGR”) of 5.7%
since 1993. The for-profit component of this industry (pre-K-12, post secondary and corporate
training) is projected to grow faster than the overall historical industry growth rate, at a 7.4% annual
rate, reflecting the increasing importance of for-profit operations in the sector, to reach a market
size of $116 billion by 2010.’

— In addition, these estimates do not refiect the growing segment of direct to consumer educational
materials such as supplemental tutoring, which represented an estimated $20 billion of additional
spending in 2004.

EZ Increasing competition for human capital

To remain competitive in the global economy, countries are investing heavily in the development of their
human capital, especially at young ages

— According to the World Bank's Worid Education Indicators, worldwide enrollment rates in pre-
primary education increased by 37% from 1995 to 2003.

— KUE believes that education companies will become significantly more valuable as countries
become increasingly aware of the competitive advantages afforded by education. Of the top 100
global companies by market cap, not a single education company is represented on the list.

As globalization of the economy and improving technologies flatten the playing field, demand for more
standardized education across regions increases

— KUE believes that increasingly global education standards, enhanced workforce mobility and new
technologies are catalysts of worid competition for human capital.

— In the near term, the Company is focusing on opportunities identified in the United Kingdom, Saudi

This series will bring together cultural icons, celebrities, movie stars, directors, writers and musicians with famous scientists to talk about commonalities and differences.  Each segment will be moderated by scientist/author/provocateur Lawrence Krauss, who has spent much of his career successfully crossing the chasm separating science and culture.  When at Arizona State University, the Origins Project he created and led for a decade there produced singular events in which over 3000 people would regularly attend live, and up to 500,000 people would watch the recorded events to hear dialogues and panels, to be entertained and informed. 

First Season  (Proposed—23 participants have already agreed in principle)
       1.  Johnny Depp, Courtney Love, Marilyn Manson talk creativity in music versus creativity in Science with Nobel Laureates Frank Wilczek and Yuval Hoffman.
       2.  Woody Allen talks about the human condition with Linguist Noam Chomsky.
       3.  Ricky Gervais and Astronomer Royale, former President of the Royal Society, Martin Rees.
       4.  Sarah Silverman and Nobel Prizewinning economist Paul Krugman.
       5.  William Shatner and Nobel Prize winning physicists Kip Thorne/ Steve Weinberg or Elon Musk.

The series will bring together Krauss and the directorial team that produced the Feature Documentary The Unbelievers.  Each episode will be shot in a beautiful location in a different city around the world.  We will go where the participants live, or work. 

Format will be moderated discussion.  Krauss will introduce each participant and begin the episode by asking some questions to provoke discussion.  The participants will be encouraged whenever possible to dialogue with each other as well.  The dialogues will take place among live audiences in beautiful theaters around the US and UK. We will take one or two questions from the audience to end the program before the program ends.

Ask them [Edwards and Cassell] if they have any evidence ... . They’re doing it for
money. She’s getting money for having sold her story. She wants to sell the book.
They’re trying to get into this lawsuit. They see a pot of gold at the end of the

longer wears a robe. He is essentially a crook. He is essentially somebody who’s
distorted the legal profession. . . . Why would he charge a person with a
sterling reputation for 50 years on the basis of the word alone of a woman who is
serial liar, who has lied about former Prime Ministers, former Presidents, has lied
demonstrably.

though a mountain evidence strongly support Ms. Giuffre’s allegations. See Deposition of Paul

know about their capabilities and the situation. They begin taking
concrete steps along the path that they think will get them to that end.
They learn far too slowly that what they initially thought they knew
was in fact wrong or no longer relevant. .. . Things can get much
more convoluted by adding allies, different influential actors among
the polity, and multiple adversaries. This is why wars are easier to get
into than out of.15

Knowing when to end a war relates to war aims and measures of
success. A war’s aims should be definitive enough so that success can
be measured in some clear way. This is easiest to do where the aims
concern discrete things such as the destruction of material targets.
Measuring success becomes harder as aims become more political
and psychological, such as weakening or toppling a regime,
encouraging opposition or deterring further action. Then, too, war
aims can expand as fighting escalates or broadens. In a situation in
which Iran has retaliated strongly and managed to inflict losses
(especially civilian losses) on the United States or its coalition
partners, we should expect to hear calls to inflict more damage, to
punish the regime and its forces, to bring a “decisive” end to the
conflict.

Short of inflicting a total defeat on Iran, an outcome that seems
scarcely conceivable, exiting the war could be challenging if Iran
chooses to fight on in some form of asymmetric conflict. We might
then have to compel Iran to quit, and that could potentially require
the application of force well beyond what was originally agreed upon
within the United States or with coalition partners. Even then, if the
Iranian regime survives at all, it is likely to declare victory, and many
of its supporters would believe it. How or when a war with Iran
would actually end is therefore no easy topic to nail down. Any attack
on Iran of sufficient scale to significantly damage its nuclear program
would have rolling consequences both in the short and long term.

Chapter 9: The Right to Falsify History: Holocaust Denial and Academic Freedom

In some European countries, (particularly Germany, Austria and France), it is a crime to deny the
Holocaust. In other countries, such as Turkey, it is a crime to claim that the Turks engaged in
genocide against the Armenians, even though it is an historical fact recognized by scholars around
the world.

Under our First Amendment, no one can be punished either for denying or proclaiming that an
historical event occurred.

Several years ago I became embroiled in a heated controversy with Professor Noam Chomsky
over the issue of Holocaust denial and the proper role of a civil libertarian in defending the right
of Holocaust deniers, without defending the substance of their claims.

In the 1970s a Frenchman named Robert Faurisson, who was an obscure lecturer on French
literature at the University of Lyon, began to dabble in Holocaust denial. He wrote a book—and
gave talks—in which he mocked Holocaust victims and survivors as perpetrators of a hoax. The
Holocaust, according to Faurisson, “never took place.” The “Hitler gas chambers” never existed.
“The Jews” bear “responsibility” for World War II. Hitler acted reasonably and in self-defense
when he rounded up the Jews and put them in “labor camps,” not death camps. The “massive lie”
about genocide was a deliberate concoction begun by “American Zionists”—in context he
obviously means Jews. The principal beneficiary of this hoax is “Israel,” which has encouraged
this “enormous political and financial fraud.” The principal victims of this “fraud” have been “the
German people” and the “Palestinian people.” Faurisson also called the diary of Anne Frank a
“forgery.”

Following the publication of Faurisson’s book, the lecturer received threats from irate survivors.
The University of Lyon, claiming that it could not guarantee his safety, suspended him for a
semester.

Chomsky sprang to Faurisson’s defense, not only on the issue of free speech, but on the merits of
his “scholarship” and of his “character.” Chomsky signed a petition that characterized Faurisson’s
falsifications of history as “findings” and said that they were based on “extensive historical
research.”

I too defended Faurisson’s right to express his views, but I also checked his “historical research”
and found it to be entirely faked. He made up phony diary entries, omitted others that disproved

°° For example, Faurisson relies on an entry, dated October 18, 1942, from the diary of SS doctor
Johann-Paul Kremer written during the three months he spent at Auschwitz in 1942. An eminent
scholar checked Faurisson’s use of the entry, and demonstrated that Faurisson’s “research” was
fraudulent. The diary entry read: “This Sunday morning in cold and humid weather I was present
at the 11™ special action (Dutch). Atrocious scenes with three women who begged us to let them

live.”

onto other girls and thus the cycle of girls trying to climb the chain of
hierarchy would start all over each time I brought a new one in. The
sessions rarely differed much. They would mostly start out with Jeffrey
on top of the massage table already naked and me leading a girl into
massaging him until his instructions came to remove our clothing and if
they agreed to that, then Jeffrey knew he had them in his pocket, and
could do what ever else he wanted. He was never turned down in the
many years I stayed with him. Never being shy, he would tell us to start
kissing each other or depending on what he wanted we would perform
erotic acts sometimes with him fondling us, or just masturbating while he
watched. On explicit occasions, sex toys would be used on us girls,
making it all the more exciting for him to observe. Ending with a
payment of $200 for the new girl and $400 to me for bringing her. He
would then wait for us to leave before adding the events details of names
and payments in a little black diary he kept with him wherever he went,
so if he were in anyone of the city’s he lived in, he would always have
contacts for sex.

I was slowly climbing the ladder, as Jeffrey was happy taking me
everywhere with him, within the States. Merely at home I distanced
myself from my Family altogether and with Jeffrey renting me an
apartment in Royal Palm Beach as well as a plush furnished apartment in
N.Y.C, there was hardly a need to see them. I just couldn’t face everyone
thinking they all knew what I was really doing travelling around with a
man old enough to be my grandfather who supposedly only wanted me
for massages. Much further convincing myself of the lies I told myself, I-
took a liking to the Xanax, it felt like it was all a dream at times, even
meeting up with old contacts from school years who experimented with
drugs. I was flying around the country, seeing so many places in America
Thad only heard about in Movies and making more money than anyone
my age and loving it. My friends didn’t believe the lies I told them about
only being a massage therapist, some of them even asking if they can
meet Jeffrey too. At this point in my life my heart went missing for a
while and I stooped so low, I was even bringing my friends, I just saw
them as easy commission. When I wasn’t playing servant to my master, I
was partying hard, eventually using ecstasy pills, acid, and marijuana to
disillusion the times I would’ve had away from Jeffrey to think about
what I was actually doing with my life. I realized something one day
while I was alone, although I had Jeffrey to attend to sexually, it was not
gratifying. I needed someone to come home to, someone I could call my
boyfriend and that showed me emotion not just a job to get done.

Chapter 7

A knock came to my apartment door one lazy afternoon while we were
in Palm Beach. I looked through the peephole and didn’t recognize the
once familiar face. I asked from behind the closed door “Who is it”? The
voice of the reply was one I wasn’t anticipating to ever hear again. It was
my Junior-High crush and childhood friend, T.J, The last ime I saw him I
was a runaway and he had let me stay at his house for a few days, telling
his parents nothing, he kept me hidden away in his room. At nightfall he
said to knock on his window and I could jump through and stay the night.
Until I was picked up by authorities during school hours and questioned
why I wasn’t in school they did some resourcing finding out I was a
runaway, then delivered me back to my angry parents.

“Oh My God- You finally answer your door girl”, and in a whirlwind,
T.J stormed back into my life. Even moving into my apartment, secretly,
within two weeks of his arrival. He had changed so much from the last
time I had seen him. He used to be this hard looking rocker type, now he
was cleaned up wearing preppy clothes and shooting out Tupac Lyrics.
He had the same old big brown eyes though, and when he told me he had
heard I was back in town but he was unable to ever get ahold of me he
just kept knocking at my door every so often, | was sold. How sweet !
thought, he must care about me if he was so intent on approaching me,
not even thinking he would’ ve spoken to the girls from our junior-high
circle and they would’ve mentioned him I was back in town, what I was
doing and where to find me. We were a drug-induced romance, which
budded from fake emotions the affects made us feel. He got what he
wanted, a free ride and not having to work, and ! got what I deserved, a
man who could let me go away with this multi-billionaire I regarded as
my second boyfriend.

I didn’t want to alarm Jeffrey in me having a boyfriend so | kept it
quiet, until during a massage I was giving to him one afternoon. We were
having a conversation about some of my friends, the party girls I had
brought in to meet him. Jeffrey started asking questions about the
different types of drugs they used hearing them speak about it in his
presence. “I thought a person on drugs would be all strung out and
looking like hell, but the girls you know look great” he stated face down
during the massage.

That’s when J told him I had been dabbling in ecstasy lately too, and |
thought it was the most amazing feeling one could even fathom. I tried to
describe the euphoric feelings it gave me and even joked with him about
wanting to pet anything furry that was around and then there was the
constant need to flick my tongue-ring around my mouth. It was great

everything it can to stop you. When you break through, it’s against their
resistance. Here, the other side will choose to make it easiest for us in the place
it prefers. If Arafat thinks he’ll get more from the Bear and the Mouse than from
the other talks, it’s hardly a surprise we’re finding that only Oslo seems to offer
a way forward.”

Rabin did make one more move, not so much in a bid to end the talks in Oslo
as to slow them down and create a context more favorable for the kind of
agreement he wanted. He shifted his attention to his original peacemaking
priority: the Syrians. In an effort to remove a roadblock to even beginning
serious talks, he offered the Americans what they would later call his “pocket
deposit.” He authorized Secretary of State Warren Christopher to tell Assad that
Washington’s understanding of our position was that, assuming all our own
negotiating concerns were addressed, we accepted that peace with Syria would
include withdrawing from the Golan. The formula was agreed in a meeting in
Israel between Rabin and the Clinton Administration’s Middle East negotiator,
Dennis Ross. Rabin didn’t tell Peres or other ministers about it, though Itamar
Rabinovich did know. I did as well. Since acceptance of the need for a
withdrawal had security implications, Rabin and I talked about it in detail
before Ross’s visit. We formulated the “deposit” together. We used an English
acronym: IAMNAM, “if all my needs are met.” The point was to convey to the
Syrian president that if he addressed our requirements for a demilitarized zone
and early warning facilities; non-interference with our critically important water
sources; as well as a full peace including embassies, open borders and joint
economic projects, we knew the trade-off would be to return the Golan.

It was by diplomatic accident that the Syrian overture went nowhere. The
reason even the Americans had called our proposal a “pocket deposit” was that
it was to be kept in the Christopher’s pocket, to be pulled out as an American
understanding of our position if he felt it might lead to a breakthrough. Our
intelligence accounts of the Christopher-Assad talks, however, suggested it had
been presented as a straight message from Rabin to the Syrian president, giving
it the status of Israel’s new, formal opening position in negotiations.

The distinction may seem minor. But for Israel, it mattered greatly. In any
agreement with Syria — or, indeed, the Palestinians — there was bound to an
imbalance. Both parts of a “land-for-peace” exchange were important. But land
was not just the more tangible asset. Once given up, short of resorting to all-out
war, there was no going back. The “peace” part of the equation was more

rotation from overexposure to long-dated fixed income into under owned equities.

This rotation will need a few periods of confirmation, given the still uncertain broader global macro
outlook, but we expect price-to-earnings multiples to remain elevated, despite higher rates,
throughout the year. S&P 500 earnings have a wide range of forecasts due to the potential for
sizable tax cuts in 2017. Based on this, the S&P 500 could add extra earnings on top of normalized
growth, which is expected to be around 9%. At present, a reasonable range, albeit a wide one, is
considered to be between $129 and $138 with the potential for further upside. In this scenario,
where we get pro-growth policies filtering into a higher earnings number, an S&P 500 bull case
level of 2700 at the high end is possible.

Improving profits and growth should take equities higher

For now, a base case utilizing the five factor framework from BofA Merrill Lynch Global
Research, which combines sentiment, valuation and technical, equates to 2300 for the S&P 500 at
year end. The two components that include long-term valuation and 12-month price momentum are
indicating that S&P 500 levels between the base and bull case are increasing in probability. Of
course, there are a number of scenarios that could unfold that would indicate a wide range of
outcomes depending on the multiple or earnings number that ultimately develops. In the end, it all
comes down to the path of corporate profits and the visibility on growth, both of which are
improving.

Highlights

We have moved from a “get paid to wait” core

portfolio theme to a more cyclical- and value-
oriented theme in multi-asset portfolios

¢ Equities remain attractive versus fixed income
on a relative basis.

¢ Within equities, we favor U.S. large caps, U.S.
small caps and emerging markets.

* Within equities, we favor value over growth and
more cyclical assets versus defensives.

¢ Within fixed income, we prefer credit to Treasuries.
We would also consider an allocation to Treasury
inflation protected securities (TIPS) where appropriate.

Portfolio repositioning is likely to continue well into 2017, as developments unfold and the pro-
cyclical environment gathers momentum. With growth already heading higher from Q3 2016
onward and earnings turning positive, investors have begun increasing cyclicality and exposure to
value in portfolios at the expense of more defensive sectors and higher-dividend areas within
equities. In addition, we expect a larger shift in emphasis toward small capitalization, which has
already started, and more domestic-oriented equities due to a slightly stronger dollar, more pro-
growth policies and the desire for a hedge against potential retaliatory trade policies from main

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019642.txt,"154 | HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETS

Three co-workers did admit to the FBI, as noted earlier, that they
might have inadvertently given Snowden their passwords, but these
three slips would not account for Snowden’s breach of all the other
compartments. Of course, there might have also been less forthcom-
ing co-workers who hid their slips in divulging their passwords to
Snowden.

This raises the more sinister possibility that the accomplice
was not an amateur co-worker but a spy who was already in place
when Snowden arrived. Such a penetration agent could have been
recruited by an adversary intelligence service before Snowden came
on the scene. After Snowden expressed a desire to expose the NSA’s
domestic surveillance, it could then have used him as an “umbrella”
to hide its own activities. Finding such a means to protect a source
while exploiting his or her information is not uncommon in espio-
nage operations, and because Snowden was willing to flee America
and go public, he could serve as a near-perfect umbrella. “Snowden
may have carried out of the NSA many more documents than he
knew about,” Tyler Drumheller, the former CIA station chief, said. It

® could also account for the disparity between the claims of Snowden ©
and the NSA damage assessment as to the number of documents
that were compromised.

As far-fetched as this scenario may seem, less than three years
before the Snowden breach the NSA had received a warning from
a CIA mole (to be discussed in greater detail later) that the Russian
intelligence service might have recruited a KGB mole at the Fort
Meade headquarters of the NSA. No mole was found in 2010, and
if one existed, it could not have been Snowden, who was working
for the NSA in Japan in 2010. Such a putative mole could conceiv-
ably have acquired enough information to later facilitate Snowden’s
operation.

As Snowden acknowledges, he was not a happy worker at the
NSA. He complained in his posts over the Internet between 2010
and 2013 about superiors and what he considered NSA abuses to
co-workers. If someone assumed the guise of a reluctant whistle-
blower, he would have little difficulty in approaching Snowden.
Snowden might not even know his true affiliation beyond that he

therefore not filed with this pleading and will be provided to the court for in-camera review.
Epstein chose to make this payment as the result of a federal court ordered mediation process,
which he himself sought (over the objection of Jane Doe, Edwards’ client in federal court) in an
effort to resolve the case. See Defendant’s Motion for Settlement Conference, or in the
Alternative, Motion to Direct Parties back to Mediation, Doe v. Epstein, No. 9:08-CV-80893
(S.D. Fla. June 28, 2010) (Marra, J.) (doc. #168) attached hereto as Exhibit “A”. Notably,
Epstein sought this settlement conference — and ultimately made his payments as a result of that
conference - in July 2010, more than seven months after he filed this lawsuit against Edwards.
Avsontingly, Epstein could not have been the victim of any scheme to “pump” the cases against
him, because he nea paid to settle the cases until well after Edwards had left RRA and had
severed all connection with Scott Rothstein (December 2009).

In addition, if Epstein had thought that there was some improper coercion involved in, for
example, Jane Doe’s case, his remedy was to raise the matter before Federal District Court Judge
Kenneth A. Marra who was presiding over the matter. Far from raising any such claim, Epstein
sinisly chose to settle that case. He is therefore now barred by the doctrine of res judicata from
somehow re-litigating what happened in (for example) the Jane Doe case. “The doctrine of res
judicata makes a judgment on the _ conclusive ‘not only as to every matter which was
offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim, but as to every other matter which might with
propriety have been litigated and determined in that action.” AMEC Civil, LLC v. State Dept. of

message over. | accept that. But the big messages have their own momentum. If we get
the story of transition right then other things will find their place.

Our problem is what | call shooting-star policies. We have a policy on carbon pricing, on
minerals, on boatpeople, but they are not connected up to the big picture about
Australia's direction and its transition.

Pressed on whether he thinks the Australian Labor Party is in permanent decline, Keating
defends Labor, insists it doesn't have to decline but highlights the problem. Labor must
recognise what it has created, he says, invoking the Hawke-Keating era. It has a
created a new society and it has to be the party of the new society.

It can't be the party of part of the old society. Labor must be the party of those people
who gained from the pro-market growth economy that we created. Labor must be open to
the influences of this middle class, to people on higher incomes. And | don't think it is.

It is, perhaps, the clearest statement of Labor's problem. The party, in an act of strategic
folly, abandoned the path of its previous success. It turned inwards on itself, away from
the community.

At the operating level it's become the party of insiders, Keating says. The problem is
that members get too caught up in the gift of faction managers and they get caught up in
the false construct of popularity, the false god.

Fixated by the nature of political leadership, Keating's book After Words shouts out: The
great curse of modern political life is incrementalism.

Leaning across the table he says to me that briefing notes and economic texts aren't
enough: the leader must locate his own source of higher command and inner belief. He
laments the efforts of US President Barak Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel
in the teeth of contemporary challenges.

“There is nothing preordained about American decline any more than the European
project is destined to fail, he writes.

But the portents are not good. Despite the rhetoric, President Obama conducts himself
as an arbitrator or mediator between the competing strands of American economic and
political ideology. He repeatedly eschews striking out, snatching the naked flame and
hanging on. But the cost of this strategy is not simply a cost to him; it is a cost to the
whole world.

On the other hand, Chancellor Merkel is the archetypal worry-wart. She does not lead;
she assesses.

You really wonder why leaders want these jobs when they really do not want to lead.
And what is their risk? That Barack Obama will not get a second term? Or that Angela
Merkel's coalition might finally end up on the rocks? If they actually made the leap they

Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 9 of 18

In the affidavit, Roberts claimed that Epstein and Maxwell directed her to have sex with Andrew and Dershowitz and others. She had sex with Andrew
three times, she alleged — once in London, when she was 17, again in New York, when she was 17, and a third time, as part of an orgy on Epstein’s island,
when she was 18. By law, at 17, she would have been above the age of consent in New York and England, but not in Florida, where the age of consent is 18.

As part of the affidavit, Roberts furnished a photograph of her with the prince and Maxwell, which she said was taken in London.
Dershowitz, who was part of Epstein’s criminal defense team, was often a guest at Epstein’s homes, she said.

“Thad sexual intercourse with Dershowitz at least six times,” Roberts wrote in the 2015 court affidavit. “The first time was when I was about 16, early on
in my servitude to Epstein and it continued until I was 19.” She detailed some of those alleged trysts, which she said happened at Epstein’s homes in Palm
Beach, New Mexico and on Epstein’s island.

One of Epstein’s housemen, Juan Alessi, testified in a 2009 sworn deposition that Dershowitz visited Epstein’s Palm Beach home four or five times a year.
He said that Roberts was a frequent visitor as well, but he never placed Dershowitz and Roberts at the house at the same time.

Alessi, who testified he worked for Epstein from 1999 to 2002, said there were often young girls who gave massages at the house, even in the middle of the
night. But he said he never checked their ages, and only knew one girl for certain who was underage, because he had picked her up from high school. That
girl, who is now an actress, was not one of Epstein’s masseuses, Alessi said.

He also said he was Maxwell’s driver, and he recalls waiting outside of Mar-a-Lago the day Maxwell met Roberts. He testified he saw Maxwell talking to
Roberts and recalls Roberts coming to Epstein’s mansion later that day. One of Alessi’s jobs was to drive Maxwell to various spas in Palm Beach where she
left business cards in order to “recruit” more masseuses, he said in the sworn deposition.

Dershowitz, Prince Andrew and Maxwell have long denied Roberts’ allegations.

In an interview with the Herald, Dershowitz reiterated that he had never met Roberts, and never saw Epstein with any underage girls.

“The story was 100 percent flatly categorically made-up,” he said, adding that Roberts and her attorneys fabricated the assertion in order to get money
from other powerful, wealthy people she alleges she had sex with.

“The only possible reason to accuse me in public and [them] in private is so she could get money,” Dershowitz said.

Edwards and his co-counsel in the Crime Victims’ lawsuit, University of Utah law professor Paul Cassell, sued Dershowitz for defamation and Dershowitz
countersued in 2015. The case was settled out of court, with Dershowitz saying he had been vindicated.

Dershowitz said he received a massage at Epstein’s Palm Beach home only once — but that it was just a regular, therapeutic massage by a masseuse — not
by Roberts or anyone underage. Dershowitz’s wife was there at Epstein’s house at the time, Dershowitz said in the deposition taken for the case in 2015.

“I never had any knowledge of Jeffrey Epstein having any contact with any underage women — ever,” Dershowitz told the Herald.

Edwards and Cassell admitted making a “tactical mistake” in filing the accusations against Dershowitz as part of a lawsuit not involving him. But they
emphasized that the settlement had no bearing on the veracity of Roberts’ allegations.

The judge for the Crime Victims’ Rights Act lawsuit agreed that the affidavit was misplaced in that case, and it was dropped.
Prince Andrew’s spokesman at Buckingham Palace did not respond to an email requesting comment.

Roberts, now 35, said it has taken her a long time to stand up to Epstein. She and 20 other victims received settlements from Epstein, ranging from
$50,000 to more than $1 million. The exact amounts have been kept confidential.

“Tt takes so long until you are able to speak about it. It took me having a daughter and looking at this young, beautiful innocent baby to say I want to speak
out about it now. I’m hoping that this will bring out more girls so that they say, Me Too.”

The state court hearing

The judge at Epstein’s sentencing hearing at the Palm Beach County Courthouse knew very little about Epstein’s crimes. The sentencing paperwork was
restricted to Epstein’s specific charges: one count of solicitation of prostitution and one count of procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution.
