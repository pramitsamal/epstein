Synthetic Biology Provides Alternative Cannabinoid Production Method; Life Science Tools
Well Positioned To Benefit From QA/QC Testing Opportunity (Schenkel)

As an alternative to cultivation-based methods, cannabinoids can be produced using either
chemical or synthetic biology approaches. Synthetic biology methods, which harness
fermentation to produce cannabinoids, are particularly attractive considering they can
potentially produce a variety of cannabinoids while being highly scalable, efficient, and
environmentally friendly.

While QA/QC testing standards for CBD currently vary greatly by state (if any exist

at all), we expect Life Science Tools companies to benefit from this nascent market
opportunity as testing regulations are implemented and standardized. Similar to medical/
recreational cannabis testing, instruments such as mass spectrometers and liquid/gas
chromatographs are utilized to analyze CBD samples. Key vendors for mass spectrometry
and chromatography instruments include Agilent, Danaher (SCIEX), PerkinElmer, Shimadzu,
Thermo Fisher, and Waters Corporation.

CBD From a Retailer and Payor Perspective (Rhyee)

Healthcare: Drug Retailer Perspective: CBD products appear to be gaining traction with
independent pharmacies, many of whom are already selling or planning to sell CBD oils.
Independent pharmacies likely find the high-margin profile of CBD oils attractive, which

we suspect is similar to those of more traditional over-the-counter drugs, as well as the
differentiation it affords independents relative to larger chain pharmacies. For those selling
CBD oils today, the focus is on quality, particularly as it relates to bioavailability. Large
pharmacy chains, such as CVS and Walgreens, don’t currently sell CBD oil, but WBA noted it
is monitoring the CBD market.

Healthcare: Payor Perspective: Generally speaking, managed care does not cover OTC
products, with the same being true for Medicare and Medicaid. Based on our conversations
with a number of payors, whether CBD oils will be covered as a medical benefit by
government sponsored health programs is determined by the Center for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS) and state governments. Currently, CBD products are not a covered
benefit, or an extra benefit, that has been approved by CMS or states, and it isn’t known

at this time whether CMS or states governments are considering reimbursement for CBD
products. Separately, Payors noted three factors complicating commercial coverage of
CBD oils, including (1) legal issues, as CBD oils derived from THC (cannabis) isn’t legal if

it contains equal to or more than 0.3% THC; (2) lack of regulation by the FDA; and (3) its
availability as an OTC medication.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027960.txt,"“We’re not starting from scratch,” I assured the sayeret officers, and I could
see some of them nodding in agreement. We had a proven record of success,
under Avraham and the four other commanders before me. We would be able to
rely on the qualities that had proved our doubters wrong in our first intelligence
missions. “We have to stay true to the spirit of Sayeret Matkal,” I said. Every
one of the officers knew what I meant: teamwork, the way we valued brains and
creativity, more than formal lines of authority. The rigor we applied to training
for, preparing for, and executing each mission. And, no less importantly, to
criticizing, and trying to fix, everything that had gone wrong on an operation, or
we'd failed to anticipate.

Though I expected to be leading many of the operations myself, I knew that
we'd succeed or fail on the strengths of the officers around me. I was incredibly
fortunate on that score. Some, I already knew well from my time as Digli’s
deputy. Smart, self-confident, se/f-starting officers like Amiram Levin, the
stocky kibbutznik from the north with whom I’d worked most closely and most
often as deputy. Avshalom Horan — Avsha — who’d convinced me to risk
completing the mission on the road from Suez to Cairo. Giora Zorea, who, like
me, had come up through the unit and was one of our most experienced team
leaders. And Danny Yatom. Born not far from Mishmar Hasharon, but a city
boy, from Netanya, he was smart, level-headed and a sure-handed organizer,
and with whom I’d somehow clicked from time he arrived in the sayeret. I made
him my deputy for my first year in command.

There were two others as well, both related to Moshe Dayan, but with a self-
assurance all their own: Uzi Dayan, the son of Moshe’s brother, who had been
killed in the 1948 war when Uzi was only months old; and Mookie Betzer, who
was married to Uzi’s cousin. I’m not sure which of the two joined the sayeret
first. Mookie, I believe. But their family ties, far from extraordinary, were part
of how Sayeret Matkal had developed from the start. It had been friends
bringing friends. But also, not infrequently, a cousin bringing a cousin, or a
brother bringing a brother.

This was the case with two other officers, whom I knew less well at first but
who would become key members of my team. In their case, it was the younger
one who joined first. Binyamin Netanyahu — Bibi, as everyone called him — had
been a member of Amiram Levin’s team when I was Digli’s deputy. He’d also
been a part of one of our several — thankfully harmless — failures along the canal
at the beginning of the War of Attrition. The plan was to cross in rubber boats
held together by nylon cord, with the assistance of Shayetet 13, Israel’s

Stock view: Expect solid 1Q top-line, but 2Q can be rough for guidance

Priceline’s metric trends and commentary, along with 1Q booking and room night
guidance, indicate that the company continues to capture strong market share growth in
the category, with little impact from hotel direct booking initiatives or competitive OTA
marketing spend. We expect a strong 1Q, with perhaps a little less upside than usual
due to the late 4Q reporting date.

Looking forward to 2Q, we have our usual caution on guidance as 2Q is the most back-
end loaded quarter for bookings and revenues. However, in 2017 the Easter shift is a
positive factor and will help 2Q revenues and earnings. We also expect 1Q bookings and
room night growth upside to translate into higher 2Q gross profit growth, and
management indicated that there is less marketing ROI pressure expected in 1H'17 than
in 2H'16. Overall, we expect Priceline’s strong business trends to continue, and would
use extra conservatism in guidance as a buying opportunity.

Given strong execution and higher exposure to more fragmented International markets,
Priceline remains our top long-term idea in Online travel. However, on a near-term
basis, we think Expedia could see a bigger stock benefit from an acceleration in room
night growth over the summer.

Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q: Room night growth

We expect Priceline to report 26% y/y room night growth (deceleration v. 31% in 4Q),
ahead of the company’s outlook of 20-25% hotel room night growth. Priceline has a
history of guiding 1Q conservatively, looking at Priceline’s historical 1Q results for
Bookings, revenue and EPS vs guidance suggests modest upside to our bookings growth
forecast of 22% and reported 1Q’17 EPS closer to $9.55 (13% upside vs. the midpoint)
vs. our estimate of $9.08 and the Street’s estimate $8.75.

Biggest 1Q issues/risks:
¢ Concerns on threat of increasing marketing competition with Expedia and

¢ Potential pressure on US inbound traffic given the Trump travel ban (unlikely to

« Marketing deleverage — our model assumes 340bps of y/y online marketing

programs and longer booking windows

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012920.txt,"4 1 Introduction

these algorithms and structures are integrated; and so far the integration has not been done
in the correct way.

The human brain appears to be an integration of an assemblage of diverse structures and
dynamics, built using common components and arranged according to a sensible cognitive archi-
tecture. However, its algorithms and structures have been honed by evolution to work closely
together — they are very tightly inter-adapted, in the same way that the different organs of
the body are adapted to work together. Due to their close interoperation they give rise to the
overall systemic behaviors that characterize human-like general intelligence. We believe that
the main missing ingredient in AI so far is cognitive synergy: the fitting-together of differ-
ent intelligent components into an appropriate cognitive architecture, in such a way that the
components richly and dynamically support and assist each other, interrelating very closely in
a similar manner to the components of the brain or body and thus giving rise to appropriate
emergent structures and dynamics. This leads us to one of the central hypotheses underlying
the CogPrime approach to AGI: that the cognitive synergy ensuing from integrating
multiple symbolic and subsymbolic learning and memory components in an appro-
priate cognitive architecture and environment, can yield robust intelligence at the
human level and ultimately beyond.

The reason this sort of intimate integration has not yet been explored much is that it’s difficult
on multiple levels, requiring the design of an architecture and its component algorithms with
a view toward the structures and dynamics that will arise in the system once it is coupled
with an appropriate environment. Typically, the AI algorithms and structures corresponding
to different cognitive functions have been developed based on divergent theoretical principles,
by disparate communities of researchers, and have been tuned for effective performance on
different tasks in different environments. Making such diverse components work together in a
truly synergetic and cooperative way is a tall order, yet we believe that this — rather than some
particular algorithm, structure or architectural principle — is the “secret sauce” needed to create
human-level AGI based on technologies available today.

1.5 Extraordinary Proof?

There is a saying that “extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof” and by that stan-
dard, if one believes that having a design for an advanced AGI is an extraordinary claim, this
book must be rated a failure. We don’t offer extraordinary proof that CogPrime, once fully
implemented and educated, will be capable of human-level general intelligence and more.

It would be nice if we could offer mathematical proof that CogPrime has the potential we
think it does, but at the current time mathematics is simply not up to the job. We’ll pursue
this direction briefly in Chapter 7 and other chapters, where we'll clarify exactly what kind
of mathematical claim “CogPrime has the potential for human-level intelligence” turns out to
be. Once this has been clarified, it will be clear that current mathematical knowledge does not
yet let us evaluate, or even fully formalize, this kind of claim. Perhaps one day rigorous and
detailed analyses of practical AGI designs will be feasible — and we look forward to that day —
but it’s not here yet.

Also, it would of course be profoundly exciting if we could offer dramatic practical demon-
strations of CogPrime’s capabilities. We do have a partial software implementation, in the
OpenCogPrime system, but currently the things OpenCogPrime does are too simple to really

implementation of a strict liquidity coverage ratio. Specific to WFC, risks are enhanced
regulatory scrutiny and capital standards as a Global SIFI, and issues surrounding its
cross selling.

Zions Bancorp (ZION)

We use a three-factor valuation framework (P/E, P/TBV, DCF) to arrive at our $36 price
objective and assign a 1.2x multiple to 2017E TBV. Our 16x P/E multiple, which we apply
on 2017E EPS along with debt extinguishment upside, is 1x higher than its historical
median due to low interest rates. Our DCF assumes a two-stage cost of capital of
16.1% and 11.6% and a terminal growth rate of 8%.

Upside risks to our price objective are more robust economic recovery and less onerous
post cycle reserve requirements. Downside risks are a slowdown in housing price
appreciation and a prolonged low interest rate environment.

What Quesnay wrote, in his entry for “man” in Diderot’s Encyclopedia of 1750, was

“Those who make manufactured commodities do not produce wealth...they
spend their receipts in order to obtain their subsistence. Thus they consume
as much as they produce...and no surplus of wealth results from it.”

Quesnay, like Petty a century before, came to economics from medicine. He was
personal physician to Madame de Pompadour, and then to the royal family. His
argument was that value is added in agriculture alone, not in manufactures. His
conclusion that only landowners can afford to pay taxes did not enchant the landed

aristocracy of Versailles.

Mill’s Essays! includes

“as much as is necessary to keep the productive worker in perfect health and

fitness for his employment, may be said to be consumed productivity. To this

should be added what he expends in rearing children to the age at which they
become capable of productive industry.”

Mill’s Principles of 1848, which I quoted earlier, said the same:

“What they consume in keeping up their health, strength and capacities of
work, or in rearing the productive laborers to succeed them, is productive
consumption.”

Sraffa’s parallel idea is expressed in his 1960 paper Production of Commodities by

Means of Commodities.

My impression is that Quesnay’s “surplus of wealth” means value added, and that he
thought maintenance consumption should be deducted from revenue in finding it.
Mill can’t have meant what I think Quesnay did, in view of Mill’s evident belief that

output is investment plus consumption. Rather, when I like Quesnay argued that

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025294.txt,"invited the woman to Chelsea's 2010 wedding

Clinton's connection to Epstein, who worked as a financier and education philanthropist before more than
40 women came forward with claims about him being a sexual predator, has been long-established, but
The Enquirer also tells how the former president was also friends with some of Epstein's seedy

acquaintances.

The lawsuit claims that Clinton was friends with an unnamed woman who ‘kept images of naked underage
children on her computer, helped to recruit underage children for Epstein... and photographed underage

females in sexually explicit poses’.

While he cut off ties with Epstein, this woman's abuses apparently did not end their relationship as she
was reportedly one of the 400 guests at Chelsea Clinton's 2010 wedding.

Latest ladies: Clinton was pictured posing for a photo with Barbie Girl (left) and Ava Adora

(right), two known prostitutes who work at the Bunny Brothel in Nevada

Though the lawsuit may be bringing up sexual skeleton's from Clinton's past, he has added to the drama of

late by posing for a photo with two known prostitutes at a fundraiser in Los Angeles last month.

The drama of his extramarital affairs is apparently just one concern for Clinton family loyalists, as a Wall

Street Journal article released today details how

‘I'm not in the political camp; I'm in the friends camp. And the friends camp definitely has concerns about

her running,’ the former Secretary of State's friend Linda Bloodworth-Thomason told the paper,

"
IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021398.txt,"these portrayals are rooted in the
different aspects of human connections,
and each is grounded in a social context.
Social connection can be intimate,
relational, or collective. For the member
of the Vineyard Church, connection with
God is an intimate two-way relationship,
while in Jonathan Edwards’s sermon in
the Great Awakening, the connection is
relational and involves the coherence (or
lack of it) of the individual with God’s
approval. And the Christian theological
view of connection as a higher order can
be conceived in terms of one’s belonging
within a whole that God’s constancy
makes larger than oneself.

While religion certainly speaks to
individual connection to others and to
the divine, religious practices can also
serve an evolutionary and social function
by strengthening the human capacity for
attending to the personhood of those
who are sick and diminished. The
objectivity of medical science all too
often leads to an objectification of the
patient or, more frequently, the patient’s
disease. The social brain’s capacity to
see others as minds rather than objects
makes it possible to assign meaning to
patients and the ways in which they lack
wholeness.

Crescat scientia; vita excolatur

The possibility that religion and
science can enrich one other, even as one
sets aside truth claims about such
matters as the existence of a deity, is by
no means obvious. But we have come to
see that science can describe what
religion does in rigorous ways that
benefit religion, and religion can serve a
meaning-making function that science
itself disclaims. Gilpin notes that rifts
between science and religion “have
centered on whether one can make
scientific sense of the notion of divine

mind, purpose, or intention.” Our
network sidestepped this question from
the beginning, focusing instead on
related matters such as the consequences
of believing in such a mind, and of
seeing into that mind, for the one doing
the divining.

Those are questions amenable to
empirical investigation, and it is at that
juncture that we can see benefit from our
discussions. As Berntson says, “beliefs
color the way we perceive the world,
they direct and shape our actions, and
define our personalities.” Studying and
debating about how they do so has been
gratifying and immensely enjoyable.
We have engaged in no theological
debate, but have focused on questions
about human beings, their beliefs, their
behaviors, and how those things affect
and are affected by multiple levels of
human connection.

How we conceptualize our
relationships to persons and things
outside our selves has implications for
our health and well-being. Specifically,
we have seen that viewing our
relationships in terms of meaningful
connections with other minds can have
positive implications for individual — as
well as social — health and function. The
more that we can learn about those
implications, the more our increase in
knowledge has the potential to enrich
human life.

Virginia, Jack Scarola and Brad Edwards
Hi Virginia.
V: Hi Jack! Hi Brad! How you guys doing?
JS: We’re doing fine, thank you. I’m sorry for all of the trouble and before we go any
further, let me tell you, if I have your permission, I have started a tape recorder and I
want to be able to tape this conversation from the very beginning. Is that alright with
you?
V: Sure, that’s fine, Jack. No problem
JS: Ok, good, thank you. I appreciate that. Let me start off by introducing myself. I know
that Brad has spoken to you about me but I am Brad’s lawyer, and I assume that you can
confirm that you and I have never had any communication before. Is that right?
V: That’s correct.
JS: Alright. I have, however, gotten some information from Brad about conversations that
you have had with him, and that will enable me, hopefully, to make this a little bit more
efficient and take up a minimum amount of your time while still getting the information
that we think is going to be helpful to us and to any jury that might ultimately have to
hear these facts.
So, let me begin by asking you first to tell us what your full name is.
V: Virginia Louise Roberts. That’s my maiden name. My married name is Virginia Louise
*

JS:
Could you spell your last name for us? That is your married last name:
V:
JS:
Airight, thank you, and where are you living right now?
V: I live in Australia.
JS:
And how long have you resided in Australia.
V: Thisismyl9 th year.
JS:
That is where you are right now, correct? We’ve reached you in Australia for this phone
conversation?
V: That is correct, yes.
JS:
And what time is it in Australia right now?
V: I think it’s about 9:00 now.
JS: Ok. That’s 9am, correct?
V: That’s correct.
JS: Airight. Virginia, the reason for this conversation is because it is our understanding that
you know a man by the name Jeffrey Epstein, and I want to begin by asking you please to
tell us about the circumstances of your first meeting Mr. Epstein.
V: Ok. I was introduced to Mr. Epstein by Ghislaine Maxwell. I was working at Donald
Trump’s spa in Mar-a-Lago and I was prompted by Ghislaine to come to Jeffrey’s
mansion in Palm Beach that afternoon after work to make some extra money and to learn
about massage. She met me at the spa, and I was reading a book about anatomy, so I was
already interested in massage therapy as it was and not having any of the education or
you know anything behind me, I thought this was a great opportunity to work for her and
go. So, I went to Jeffrey’s mansion about 5 or 6 in the afternoon. My dad drove me
there. My dad worked at Mar-a-Lago with me, and he met Ghislaine and she seemed like
a nice, proper English lady, and she knows, I mean, you know, one time then _once
before I left to travel overseas, she just seemed really nice and like she would like to help
me out. So my dad left, and I had no problem getting home that night, one of her drivers
would take me back after my trial. So she led me upstairs, and into Jeffrey’s bedroom,
and past that is Jeffrey’s massage room, which has got his steam room and a shower and
a massage table, and there is actually an extra room that has, that nobody knows about it,
it’s kinda like a secret room and it’s got a whole bunch of decorative pictures of
pornographic literature and sex toys and I can ? what happened in there.
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 3 of 23
JS:
When you say that the room was hidden, Virginia, how was the room concealed?
V: It wasn’t like a door that you would normally go into, like some kind of special opening,
you open that and then a little door, so it looks like it’s a little closet so-to-speak, but
when you walk in there, it’s obviously a lot bigger than just a closet. It wasn’t too big,
but it was bigger, you know. It wasn’t a gigantic room, it was just like a small room,
which you know, it probably could fit some shoes in there, it had racks of shoes, boxes,
some sweatshirts neatly folded, and the ceiling to the floor was covered in pornographic
pictures of the girls that he had met.
JS:
Whenyou say...
V: So anyways, that was getting there, and I was introduced to Jeffrey, he was laying naked
on top of the massage table, and obviously for one, I’m a 15 year old girl and seeing him
on the table was weird but, also learning about anatomy and massage, I thought this
would be part of it. So obviously, I thought it was part of the massage program, so I said
ok, this is fme. And, he then instructed me on how to touch the body, Jeffrey’s body,
how to massage him, and for the first hour, it was actually a real massage, maybe not an
hour, maybe like 40 minutes or something, but of something like that _and that’s when he
turned over on the other side and to expose himself fully. So then Ghislaine told me that
she wanted me to undress and began to take off my shirt and skirt, my white uniform
from Mar-A-Lago, she also took off her shirt and got undressed, and so I was there with
just my undies on, and she was completely bare, and made some kind of little flake about
the underwear that I was wearing because it wasn’t my normal sexy girl underwear and
just like, I don’t know, had red hearts on it or something like that; just your normal, you
know, real cute underwear. Anyways, so during all of this I’m kind of like what’s going
on, how do I act, what do I say, I was so afraid of, not afraid or fearful for my life but
_unsure of how all this started and wanting to obtain a profession_ I was so afraid
thinking about upsetting and disappointing them, I don’t know, it’s a weird situation by
far and I was expected to _Lick his nipples, instructed on how to do so by J.E_ and give
him oral sex while he wanted to fondle me, and then at the end, I was told by Ghislaine to
get on top and straddle Jeffrey sexually, and when we were done, we went and had a
shower in the room and Jeffrey told me to wash him up and down, you know with a bar
of soap and make sure he was all cleaned up. And then he took me downstairs and took
me to two of the guards and told John to bring me home. John was the butler at the time.
JS: Let me interrupt you for just a moment there if I could, Virginia. You mentioned as you
were recounting those details that you were 15 years old at the time. What is your date of
birth?
V: August9th, 1983
JS:
And can you tell us please, as best you’re able to estimate it, what the date was when this
first encounter occurred?
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 4 of23
V: I’ve got it written down. It’s like - I’m not good with math — hold on — I thought I wrote
it down but I didn’t. I’m not too sure, I think it was 1998 off the top of my head and
around June of 1998, I would say as I was turning 16 at the end of the summer.
JS: Alright. You talked about the room where Jeffrey had the pornographic photographs.
Did you actually see that room on the occasion ofyour first visit there?
V: No, I got to see that room a few visits after but I was just trying to describe that room to
you guys so you knew exactly what room I was talking about.
JS: Another question for you, and I don’t mean to be prying into your personal life, and if I
ask you any questions at all that you’re uncomfortable answering, then you just tell me
that and we’ll move on, because I appreciate your cooperation and the last I thing I want
to do is impose upon that cooperation, but can you tell us please just generally what kind
of sexual experience you had had prior to this confrontation with Jeffrey?
V: Yeah, sure. A close family friend has sexually abused me, and I was on the streets at 13
years old. I was picked up by a 67 year old man named Ron _Eppinger_ who did exactly
what Jeffrey did with me abuse and violate my youthfulness — & I was with him for 6
months. So, he was gone and then I had this boyfriend who was like my school friend
from young days but we just kept in contact with each other and we were on and off
constantly, and that was Tony Figeroua_, and there was also another younger guy was
near my age, Michael, I can’t remember his last name, but yeah, there, I mean, there
wasn’t like a string of men or anything, but there was Ron, like I told you, and he was the
first guy expecting me to do so-called disgusting affairs. Jeffrey actually knew Ron,
which was quite weird when I told Jeffrey the story about Ron, and Jeffrey had actually
met him, and yeah. Anyway, just another story, and yeah, there were a couple of men,
but that gives you an idea.
JS: Now when you described the photographs in the room as pornographic, tell me just a
little bit about the photographs, if you would please? First, how many of them were
there?
V: At least 100, and like I said, they covered the room from the ceiling, not the ceiling but
from the top of the edge of the wall to the bottom of the floor. I want to say at least a
hundred, even more, there could have been more in the boxes _Some of them were A4_
photographs, like the large size, some of naked women posing, you know, positions, sexy
positions. Others were, you know, some girls had bikinis on, and it wasn’t so
pornographic, but it was all women, and it was all in a sexual nature.
JS:
Were there photographs where more than one person appeared?
V: Oh yeah, plenty of them. There were lots of naked photographs, I mean I was just trying
to give you a visual range. There was anything from 5x6s to 4x8s to 8x4s. Some of them
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 5 of 23
had frames, some of them were out of frames, but they were all, like I said, they were all
women, they were all sexual in nature.
JS:
Was it your impression that there were a hundred photos of a hundred different people or
were there multiple photos of the same woman or girl?
V: There was definitely a lot of different girls. I mean it wasn’t easy to sit there and say,
you weren’t finding 5 girls out of some photos, no. Were there a hundred different ones?
There could have been pictures of some girls, I really couldn’t get close necessarily to
actually recognize faces or anything like that. But if you, you know, the range of them
were all different, majority of them were different, yeah.
JS:
Did there ever come a point in time when you became aware that a photograph of you
had been added to the collection?
V: Yes, there was. Ghislaine took several nude photographs of me for Jeffrey. So, yeah,
there were pictures of me and there were pictures, he wasn’t shy, that wasn’t the only
place in his house that he kept the photos. He liked photos all over his house. If you
looked in his den or on his desk or in on the hail table, a giant hall table in his house,
there were at least a hundred photos of girls in frames. Not all of them were naked, a lot
of the ones that were all around his house were not naked girls posing pornographically,
some were pictures of celebrities and politicians he had known_or things like that or had
pants on or whatever, but yeah, there was a lot of mixed photographs in the outside ones.
JS: Were there any photographs of girls or young women that you knew or that you
subsequently came to know that you saw in the house?
V: Yeah, yeah, there was. There was pictures of Nadia Bjournik , pictures
Sarah Keller, pictures Emmy, pictures of me, pictures of the regulars, but a lot of the
girls, sometimes Jeffrey could have like 7 girls a day, and he would only see those girls
once if he got bored. I don’t know. These weren’t my days. I heard he’s gotten a lot
sloppier since I left. So, I don’t know anyways, but when I knew him, there was just a, it
seemed, there was such an influx of girls coming in and out, so did I recognize a lot of
them? Maybe, maybe not, but then they were all definitely beautiful, they were all
ranging in age, some of them young, some of them older in their 20’s, I mean it was just
they were all beautiful.
JS: You’ve told us about the first visit. Was there any discussion on the occasion ofthat first
visit about your returning?
V: Yes, they were very pleased with me and after the encounter was fmished, the sexual
encounter, he went and told me I did well and I have a lot of potential to become a
massage therapist and if I’d like I could return tomorrow, you know, and do the same
thing and get paid $200/hi, so Jeffrey insisted that I come after work, and over the next
few days, I guess the relationship grew into more, and within a couple of weeks, not even
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 6 of 23
a couple of weeks, maybe a week, I had quit Mar-a-Lago and I was working for Jeffrey
full time.
JS: Ok, let’s talk about your job .at Mar-a-Lago, if we could. You said that your Dad was
working there. What was his position at Mar-a-Lago?
V: He was a maintenance supervisor I think is what it was called? He like managed the
tennis courts and air conditioners and things like that.
JS:
What is your Dad’s full name?
V: Sky William Roberts.
JS:
And is he still living here in South Florida now?
V: No, he’s not, he’s in California.
JS: Ok. Is your Dad aware of what is currently going on with regard to your having made
public statements about your relationship with Jeffrey?
V: Yes, he is well aware of it. I told my family even before all this stuff came out, because
they were the first ones contacted by the journalists from Mail on Sunday. I know that
they the Mail on Sunday printed that I had gone out and tried to, I mean I think one of the
photos said that I was angry that I saw Jeffrey and the Prince walking together and that is
why I came out and went public with everything. Not true. I mean, I am angry about
how they are still up to their old ways together and that they’re still hanging out but I
didn’t contact the Mail on Sunday and I didn’t bring it out. I figured that everyone was
going to bring it out anyway and I better bring it out the right way. He’s known
everything from the start, and my family is very supportive with everything going on.
JS: I’m kind of going to jump around a little bit and I apologize for that, but since the subject
has come up, tell me first of all why you are providing this cooperation to us, and I am
certainly very appreciative of it, but I want you to tell us why it is you’ve chosen to spend
time with us on the telephone and provide this information that you’re now providing.
V: I’m out to help the bigger picture, you know, I think all of us can make a big difference in
a lot of other people’s lives and I think that this has gone on long enough and it’s a big
slap in my face that he can get away with hurting me so bad let alone so many other girls
and laugh about it. I guess I talked to you guys out because I want to see the right thing
happen, not just to him, but I want people in the world to understand this is not the way
of life, you know, it’s not acceptable to go out procure young girls and make them think
that, this is the way you should be living and that’s all. Yeah, I guess my reason for
doing it is to help the bigger picture, you know, I’m a big believer in karma and I believe
that good things will come back to you, so I guess that’s why I’m doing this.
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 7 of 23
JS:
Just for the record, neither Brad, nor I, nor anyone representing that they have anything to
do with us has made any promises to you. Is that correct?
V: That is correct. I’ll tell you, since this is our first conversation, that nobody has made me
feel like I’ve been bribed or bought or had to say anything. I’ve told you anything that I
know from my own self, not some things somebody told me. If anything, Brad’s been
extra careful not to tell me anything and let me do all the talking, so it’s quite opposite I
think.
JS: Airight. Let’s get back then to the story of your relationship with Jeffrey, and we’ve
talked about your first encounter with him and how it evolved from that into your full
time employment with Jeffrey, but what were you doing at Mar-a-Lago before you quit
Mar-a-Lago?
V: I was just a locker room attendant and sometimes I did babysitting for the rich and
famous. So, I wasn’t anything big. I worked in the spa area. That’s why I was studying
anatomy, because I was really really interested in becoming a _massage therapist, and at
the locker room, I didn’t do much. I mean I was making tea for a living, I would, you
know, make sure the toilet paper had a little triangle in it after everybody went to the
toilet, or wipe down the water from the basin, you know, it was a very easy peasy job.
JS:
Did you get that job through your Dad?
V: Yes, my Dad got me the job.
JS:
Ok, and you were only 15 years old at the time, were they aware of how old you were at
Mar-a-Lago?
V: Of course, definitely. We had to go through extensive, you know, we even had to get
drug tested and id test and so on and so forth. I mean, Mantas (?) is very strict on
employment, yeah, everybody knew.
JS: Ok. Was there ever any conversation with Ghislaine about how old you were before you
were taken to Jeffrey’s mansion?
V: No. She didn’t ask me how old I was from the start, but when I did get to Jeffrey’s
mansion, it was discussed how old I was.
JS:
With whom?
V: During the entire hour of what I call the legitimate massage I was giving him, it was cat
and mouse games getting information from me to find out who I am, am I a willing
participant in these kind of things, and how would I react if they were about to take the
next step. But they got information off of me, they got my age, they got my, a little bit of
my history so they knew I was, you know, not very stable at home, and they knew that,
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 8 of23
you know, I was actually interested in making my life better by studying so what they
were offering me was a chance to become a legitimate masseuse but it was getting
trained. They would have people show me how to work the body and be called a
massage therapist and get me books on it, and you know, keep me interested, and every
time, you know, I was with Jeffrey, literally was about massages, I don’t mean just going
in and have sex with him. I mean massage, because it would always start out with
massage and then it would lead into sometimes other things.
JS: Airight, once this evolved, into full time employment, what did full time employment
mean?
V: That was entirely having to travel with Jeffrey in every city. When he was in Palm
Beach, I stayed at my apartment, and he would call me to his house once or twice a day
sometimes, and that’s, you know, do things with him. Sometimes we’d go out shopping,
sometimes we’d go out and watch a movie. You know, simple things like that, go to an
expo or a fair, whatever it was. But when we were in other cities, I was at my
apartment, I lived with him full time. What I mean by full time is even in the middle of
the night, I could get a ring on my phone next to me and tell me to come in his room, you
know, so it was literally full time.
JS:
When you say that when you were in Palm Beach you were living in your apartment,
were you living on your own or were you living with members of your family at that
time?
V: No, after I quit Mar-a-Lago, Jeffrey offered to get me an apartment in Palm Beach
somewhere, Royal Palm Beach, and it was a nice apartment. He furnished it for me, it
was absolutely beautiful, but yeah, that’s the only time I would spend time away from
him really.
JS:
This apartment was on Royal Palm Beach Boulevard or out in the Village of Royal Palm
Beach?
V: I so honestly don’t remember. I’ve been trying to rack my brain because the FBI was
asking the same thing and were trying to fmd it, but yeah, I’m Not sur_. I didn’t get to
spend as much time in it, I was only there about an entire week out of every month
probably, but the majority of the time I was with Jeffrey anyways. It was somewhere in
Royal Palm Beach. I don’t know about Royal Palm Beach drive. I don’t even remember
the Royal Palm Beach drive anymore so I’m not too sure.
JS: Ok, let me see if I can draw the distinction for you and maybe that will help you to help
us? Royal Palm Beach is a village that is...
V: No, no, no, I got Royal Palm Beach, I just didn’t know the Royal Palm Beach Drive, like
what street it’s off of. Were you talking about a street?
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 9 of 23
JS: Yes, I was talking about a street. Royal Palm Drive is on the island of Palm Beach, and
it’s a street that is lined with large royal palm trees, and I’m wondering if this was an
apartment on the island or was this an apartment out west oftown...
V: No, it was actually in Royal Palm Beach, not on the island.
JS:
Airight.
V: I would be driven, it was closer to my family than it was closer to him. I wanted to be
close enough to everybody else so that when I was in town, I could just go see them
quickly.
JS:
Ok. So we’re not talking about Royal Palm Boulevard. We’re talking about the town of
Royal Palm west of town. Jeffrey got you an apartment out there.
V: That’s correct.
JS:
When he was in Palm Beach, you were generally not staying at the mansion, you were
staying at the apartment that he got for you out west of town.
V: That’s correct.
JS:
Ok.
V: I mean then there was times, I don’t wanna say that every time I stayed at my apartment.
There was times we’d fly back from some city maybe too late at night to really want to
go back home, so you know, it’s like 12:00 at night or 1:00 in the morning. I was just
staying in the yellow room, or something like that; one of the guest rooms in Palm Beach.
But majority of the time, I would definitely want to get back to my own apartment.
JS: Alight. What were the general hours of your full time employment when ...?
V: There was not set hours. It wasn’t like logging, and you know, hitting the shift button,
nothing like that. The way I would get paid would be, ok, if I was in Palm Beach, I
would get $200 an hour to massage Jeffrey or some of his friends and then go home. So
it would be like that. If I was traveling with him, it would be per massage, so I would be
getting paid per day. So I wouldn’t be getting paid on an hourly rate. He wouldn’t say
ok, today you’re going to work for me from 7:00 in the morning until 8:00 at night. It
never like that. I was on call all the time.
JS:
When you were here in Palm Beach, were you actually getting paid only for the time
spent massaging Jeffrey or were you getting paid from your arrival at his house until you
left the house?
V: From the time the massage started.
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 10 of 23
JS: From the time the massage started. Ok.
V: Sometimes we’d go there and I would wait for a while or talk with G’hislaine and Jeffrey
about something or we’d meet somewhere and talk about something. A lot of times, I’d
meet him upstairs in his room where he was ready for me. But then there was a lot of
times where it didn’t start right away, so he couldn’t really pay me from the time I got
there sometimes unless it was just paid from the time I massaged him til the time the
massage was over.
JS: Airight. Did your duties for Jeffrey ever include anything other than providing him
massages and sex in connection with the massages? Did he ever give you any other
responsibilities to perform?
V: I was asked to do the same things that I did to Jeffrey to a few of his fellow colleagues as
well. Those were my duties. He looked at it this way is that I was going to be a
professional massage therapist, and maybe I needed some clientele, so he had me perform
erotic massages on a few people.
JS:
Did that start here in Palm Beach County?
V: It did. The first one did.
JS: Ok, and how long after you first met Jeffrey did he first ask you to provide services for
one ofhis friends?
V: About 9 months, I think it was. It wasn’t a full year, it wasn’t 6 months, but between 6
months and a year, which is why I’m saying 9 months.
JS:
And when you provided services to a friend of Jeffrey’s, who paid you for those services?
V: Jeffrey would. I would get paid the next time I saw Jeffrey, so if I was invited to the
Breakers Hotel to give a massage, I would give a massage, I would go home, and the next
day when I saw Jeffrey, he would pay me for what I did. So, it was paid always by him,
it was set up by him, so he always knew what to pay me. I did get tips and things like
that, if you call it that, you know, like a hundred dollar tip or something from a few of
them, you know, yeah.
JS:
Was there..
V: There was always payment from Jeffrey.
JS:
Was there ever any discussion with Jeffrey about what was expected to happen when you
provided massage services to one ofJeffrey’s friends?
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 11 of23
V: In a roundabout way, yes. In so many ways, Jeffrey really really had to train me, and that
was why Ghislaine said that she and Jeffrey enjoyed me so much was because they never
really had to speak much to me to tell me what they wanted me to do. You know, I
wasn’t waiting for you know, their directions. Jeffrey would tell me to go give an erotic
massage to friends. He wouldn’t give me much detail about it, but he would say to treat
them like you treat me.
JS:
Did he refer to it as an erotic massage or are those your words?
V: Erotic massage is my words. That’s exactly what it was, but he would tell me to treat
them how he wanted it, so I’d do what he wanted without having to say to me words
more. I mean, I complied with what he wanted because it was somewhat of a, I don’t
know, I don’t know how to say it, it was just very mindboggling how I let him have so
much control or power over me basically. The massages would be routine to what Jeffrey
wanted with my so called new clientele, and with their own words would ask me to
provide them with sexual pleasure after the massage.
JS:
Did you ever report back to Jeffrey about what happened when you provided massages to
his friends?
V: Of course, of course, and I knew that his friends were reporting back to him as well
because there were times where he would instigate conversation by saying you know, so
and so had a great time, you did wonderful, you know so and so gave me a call and told
J.E how it went...
JS:
Did Jeffrey ever elicit details from you? “Tell me what happened, describe in detail what
went on?”
V: No, but he would have a laugh, he had a laugh with me a few times about some of their
different mannerisms, I guess you would say, like some of them, one guy had a foot
fetish and that was really weird and I mentioned it to Jeffrey, and we would have a laugh
over it. He didn’t want to know details. He wasn’t asking me “so tell me what did you
guys do exactly.” No, he just basically gave me a slap on the back and said, you know,
good job. And we had some kind of conversation about it. I can’t recall any conversation
off the top of my head. I really don’t know one. It’s been that long. But yeah, we did
talk about it briefly.
JS:
Can you give me an estimate as to the number of friends for whom Jeffrey provided and
paid for your services?
V: There was about, you know, I don’t know, 8 guys possibly.
JS:
And are you able to name those people for me?
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 12 of 23
V: No, not at this stage. I just, some of these people are really influential in power, and I
don’t want to start another shitstonn with a few of them. I’ll tell you that there was some
erotic massages given to, I’m just afraid to say it to you.
JS:
Ok, Virginia.
V: It’s like geez, I don’t know if I want to, I’m really scared of where this is gonna go.
JS: Alight. I understand that, and as I told you from the beginning, if I ask you a question
that you are uncomfortable answering, you just tell me that, and I will move on, and I
understand that at least right now, you are uncomfortable answering, and I am certainly
going to respect that.
V: Thank you so much, Jack.
JS: No, that’s quite alight. I am very appreciate of the cooperation you are providing, and I
don’t want you at any time to feel that we are taking unfair advantage of that cooperation,
so give me the information that you’re comfortable giving me, and if we get to a point
where you’re uncomfortable, I will respect that and we’ll move on from there.
V: Ok.
iS: I want to talk a little bit about the traveling that you did with Jeffi~ey. About how long
into your relationship with him did that first start?
V: Immediately. I started traveling immediately. Not internationally until I think about,
Gosh, I can’t remember even, I think it was a year later that we started doing international
travel. Maybe like 9 months to a year again. Not too sure to be honest.
JS: So that would have been approximately the summer of 1999? Somewhere around there?
V: Yes. Somewhere around there. Somewhere around a year, somewhere around there, I
can’t pinpoint it exactly. But like I said, we started doing domestic traveling
immediately, so my first destination with him was New York and Santa Fe and the
Carribean, California, I would take trips with him occasionally. Sometimes we would go
to St. Louis or New Orleans or Santa Cruz. We were traveling just about everywhere I
think.
JS:
How did you travel?
V: Well, we took Jeffrey’s private jet, and unless I was being sent somewhere by myself for
what we were just talking about before, then I would travel on a what do you call, a
public jet, whatever it is...
iS:
commercial flight?
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 13 of23
V: Yes. Just a normal flight, an e-ticket.
iS:
Like the rest of us common folk.
V: But when I was traveling with Jeffrey, the majority of the time would be on the black jet.
iS:
Now, when you say there would be times when you would travel by yourself because he
was sending you somewhere, tell me about that. How did that come about?
V: So, one of his colleagues would be at the Carribean or Santa Fe or even New York, or
wherever, and he would call me up on those days where I am not working with him or in
Palm Beach with him, and he would ask me to get on the next plane to so and so and go
meet so and so, and that’s when I would take e-tickets. His secretary or special assistant,
whatever, would organize it for me and give me the details and I would just walk up the
line and they’d let me right through.
JS: Can you give me any ideas as to how many times it happened that Jeffrey would send
you off to meet some friend of his at some location outside of Palm Beach?
V: How many times it happened? I’m not too sure. Probably about 10-15 times.
JS: Ok. And on those occasions, how much time would you spend with one of Jeffrey’s
friends when you were sent to a location that you would have to travel to?
V: Only a couple of days. Only 2 days, that’s it.
iS:
And how were you paid for those trips?
V: I would be paid in cash upon my arrival back with Jeffrey. So, whenever I was back with
Jeffrey, he would count up how many days I’ve had, sometimes give me even more than
what I deserved, not deserved, but what I earned and give me a little extra.
iS:
Was there a daily rate for those trips or was that per massage also?
V: Per massage. With Jeffrey, I would be honest. I wouldn’t tell him I did 15 massages if I
didn’t. He knew he could trust me. He could always come back to the other person that
he sent me to give massages and ask them as well, so you know, it was always by per
massage.
iS: Alight. When we’ve been talking about massages, tell me exactly what it is we’re
talking about when we speak about massages.
V: Same thing I would do to Jeffrey. Again, it would start out as a massage, which would
start with them being naked, and me giving him a legitimate massage to begin with, so
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 14 of23
I’d start with his feet, go up to his calves, up his legs, buttocks, back, his neck, his head,
his arms, yada yada, and then it would be time to flip over, and some of the men would
want me to continue on massaging the front side of them and they would instigate me to
begin having sex with them or foreplay, whatever you want to call it.
iS: So routinely, these massages involved sexual activity. Is that accurate?
V: That is accurate.
iS: Ok. Let’s talk about the travel that you were involved in when you were on Jeffrey’s
private plane. Generally speaking, who were the passengers on the plane when you
traveled.
V: Well, Larry was the pilot, and then there was a short, small solid guy, I don’t know his
name, but he was a co-pilot, and then he changed and there was another guy brought in
later on. Generally speaking, there was always Jeffrey, sometimes Ghislaine, sometimes
Emmy, sometimes a whole bunch of other girls, sometimes famous people, sometimes
some politicians or yeah, just about anybody could fly on his plane. There was never no
any set routine who would come and who would go. It was an influx of people on
Jeffrey’s airplane.
is: I want to deal with these things separately in order to respect some of the reservations
that you have, so I’m going to ask you who the people were that you remember flying
with Jeffrey on his plane when you were personally present without regard to whether
there was any sexual activity that occurred on the plane or not. So I’m not asking you to
implicate any of these famous people in improper conduct, but just tell me what the
names of the people are that you remember that you consider to be famous people.
V: Ok, there was Naomi Campbell, Heidi Kium, there was Bill Clinton. There was Al (?)
Gore, there was a whole bunch of models, I wouldn’t really honestly be able to give their
names. There was Matt Groning the producer of the simpons cartoon, Jack CCousteau’s
granddaughter a lot of interior designers, architects, politicians. I am just trying to think
of as many names as possible for you. Off the top of my head, that’s as good as I can get
for now.
iS: Ok, alright, that’s fine. And again, I am not implying by my questions, nor do I want
your answers to be interpreted as your suggesting that any of those people that you have
just identified were engaged in any improper activities on any particular flight, but I want
to talk to you now about what went on on occasion on the airplane. Ok?
V: Ok. It was a lot of the same thing that went down on the ground. A lot oftimes, it would
be just be me and ieffrey, or me and Jeffrey and Ghislaine, or me and Jeffrey and some
other girl, sometimes Emmy, Sarah, and Nadia Bjournik. There would be sexual conduct,
there would be foreplay, there was a bed in there, so we could basically reenact exactly
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 15 of23
what was happening in the house. It would start off with massaging or we would start off
with foreplay, sometimes it would lead to, you know, orgies.
iS:
Were there occasions when you were in ieffrey’s company, whether on the ground or in
the air, where there were other girls present whom you knew to be under age 18?
V: Yes. There was a constant influx of girls coming in and going out. And we were all very
young. On occasion, there was some older girls, and I don’t mean older as in like in their
30s or anything, I mean like 28, 29, something like that, just very rarely. The majority of
the girls that Jeffrey actually met or had on his plane or in his house were under age.
iS:
Do you know how it is that Jeffrey established with any ofthese underage girls?
V: Yes, I do. He would send me personally or with other girls to clubs or shops, to pick up
anywhere, I mean we were constantly on the look for other girls that might satisfy
Jeffrey.
iS:
What instructions were you given about what to look for?
V: Young, pretty, you know, a fun personality. They couldn’t be black. If they were any
other descent other than white, they had to be exotically beautiful. That was just about it.
iS:
Who gave you those criteria?
V: They both gave us the instructions, and it wasn’t just me, Jeffrey asked most girls to bring
a friend and make extra money. They would use us young girls So that way it probably
looked a lot more safer to a girl that we were procuring to younger girls that were already
doing it. That was the way that Jeffrey had it.
iS:
Were you given any instruction at all on how to approach these girls?
V: Yes. Jeffrey and Ghislaine both taught me to, depending on the circumstances,
depending on the girl, you could offer them a job as a massage therapist or you could tell
them you have a really rich friend with, you know, great contacts in the acting world or
modeling world and he loves pretty girls, you should come back and meet him, make
some money, you know, we had a whole bunch of ways to be able to procure girls.
JS:
Can you give me any idea as to the total number of underage girls that you know engaged
in sexual conduct with Jeffrey during the period of time you had your relationship with
him?
V: I would have no way of estimating that whatsoever. I mean, there could be a hundred,
there could be more, honestly I’m not too sure how many girls, really. I wish I did know.
I mean like I said there were so many over the course of 4 years with Jeffrey.
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 16 of23
iS: Let me see if we can try to narrow it down a little bit. Is there any doubt in your mind
that it was more than 10?
V: Yes, there was definitely more than 10.
iS: Ok, what I want you to do is to give me the highest number that you are comfortable in
saying there were definitely more than X number of underage girls that I know Jeffrey
Epstein engaged in sex with while I had a relationship with him. How would you fill in
that blank? Definitely more than how many?
V: I’d say definitely more than a hundred.
iS: Alight. Did ieffrey ever help to pick out your clothes?
V: Oh yes. I mean he wasn’t out to dress me like a porn star or anything. He would always
dress me very classy, but ‘we’d just go shopping all the time together.
is: Did he ever express any style preferences in terms of how he wanted you to dress?
Besides dressing classy, I’m, you know, any other suggestion to you about how he
wanted you dressed?
V: He didn’t, like I said, wasn’t trying to dress me in any prostitute way or anything like
that. It was nice, classy outfits I was wearing like Gucci, Dolce Gabbana, Chanel, things
like that. He was buying me a lot of very, very nice clothing. It was provocative. I mean
I was wearing miniskirts, and tight short shorts and little shirts that showed my belly and
my cleavage and everything, but they were very expensive clothes.
iS:
Was there every any dress up role playing?
V: Yes. There was. Lots of it. Jeffrey loved the latex outfits Ghislane had for us girls, he
had bondage outfits, he had all different kinds of outfits, but his favorite was the
schoolgirl.
iS:
Tell me about that.
V: Well, you know, Ghislaine would take me to dress me up to surprise i.E or Jeffrey would
ask me to get dressed up, that would include wearing a tiny little skirt with nothing
underneath, a white collared shirt that you would be wearing to school with a tie in it, tied
up _in a bow, my hair in pigtails, stockings on up to my knees, and I would go in there
and act like a kid and we’d do role playing sexing.
iS: Did ieffrey ever brag to you about the age of any of the girls with whom he had
relationships?
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 17 of23
V: Yes, he did. He did all the time. The worst one that I heard from his own mouth was this
pretty 12 year old girls he had flown in for his birthday. It was a surprise birthday gift
from one of his friends and they were from France. I did see them, I did meet them.
Jeffrey bragged afterwards after he met them that they were 12 year olds and flown over
from France because they’re really poor over there, and their parents needed the money
or whatever the case is and they were absolutely free to stay and flew out. Those were
the worst ones. He was constantly bragging about girls’ ages or where he got them from
or their past and how terrible their past was and good he is making it for them.
iS: Where were the 12 year old girls flown to from France? Where did they come to?
V: Palm Beach.
iS:
And were they flown in on Jeff’s private plane or did they get transported?
V: No. They were transported by somebody else.
iS: Ok. Was the sexual activity that went on on the airplane conducted in such a way so that
any of the crew was aware of what was going on?
V: They were told to knock if they had to come out, if the crew had to come out. They were
told, you know, to come out as little as possible, so they weren’t out there hanging out
watching everything, no, but it doesn’t take an idiot to put two and two together to say
well there’s a whole bunch of half dressed teenagers on board with this old man who is
constantly being massaged by them and he wants me to keep the door shut for what
reason? I mean, only they could put that together, but yeah, they knew.
iS:
Did Mr. Epstein ever talk to you about people of power and influence owing him favors?
V: He would laugh about it, you know, I never really knew what to take serious from Jeffrey
because he was such a funny character at times. You never knew if what he was saying
was true or not. Yeah, lots of people owed him favors from what he told me. He’s got
everybody in his pocket, and he would laugh about he helps people for the sole purpose
in the end they owe him something. That’s why I believe he does so many favors in the
first place.
iS:
When and how did you first become aware that Mr. Epstein was in trouble with the law?
V: I was first informed by, I think someone from the FBI called me first and started to ask
me questions, and I started to answer the questions but then fear took over, and I just said
look, I don’t know what’s going on, I’ve got a young family that I don’t want to risk, you
know, please don’t bother me about this again, and it was real short simple conversation,
and within a week or 2, I had gotten a call from Jeffrey’s attorney, and then a week later,
Jeffrey himself.
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 18 of 23
is:
Ok, well let’s back up before we get to those conversations and tell me approximately
when it was that you were contacted by the person who you believe was with the FBI.
V: Ok. It’s hard for me to pinpoint, if I had to pinpoint it, it would be in 2007 sometime.
iS: Alight. And you were living in Australia at that time, correct?
V: Correct.
iS:
You were contacted by telephone?
V: That’s correct, by my cell phone.
iS:
Ok and do you have any idea how your name came up leading to that contact.
V: No idea. No idea whatsoever. When I did ask, I was told that some girls had revealed
my name, I guess, and that’s how everybody, the FBI knew to contact me.
iS:
OK.
V: But I don’t know ofthand or sorry, I just walked into the wrong room.
iS:
Ok.
V: Sorry go on.
iS: Yes & I’ll never tell her you said that. Virginia, how long was it after that phone call
from the FBI person were you contacted by Mr. Epstein’s lawyers.
V: Like a week. It was back to back to each other. I remember being so scared after talking
to the FBI thinking what’s happening, what’s going on. It’s been like 6 years, 7 years at
that stage, how did they find me & what do I have to do with this? So yeah, I do
remember that very well, and it was only about a week later I was called by his attorney.
iS:
Who was it that contacted you, do you remember?
V: I want to say Bill Riley, but he might have been from the FBI. No, it was Bill Riley. Bill
Riley. Not sure ifthat’s his correct name, but that’s what is coming to mind
JS:
What do you remember about that conversation?
V: I remember a Mr. Goldberger as well, I remember, there might have been two of them.
iS:
Airight.
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 19 of23
V: I can’t remember which one it was. I want to say Bill Riley is the good one.
iS:
Airight, so either Bill Riley or a Mr. Goldberger or both of them contacted you, and what
do you remember about that?
V: I don’t know if it was the same guy who contacted me that week later who put me in
touch with Jeffrey. I think he was on the phone and he put speakerphone on with Jeffrey.
So he connected me with Jeffrey. I don’t know if it was the same guy or different, but I
definitely know that Bill Riley was the first guy to contact me. I’m pretty sure about that.
JS:
Ok. Tell me about that conversation.
V: He asked me what I knew about what’s going on with Jeffrey and apparently, there was
an investigation being held about some of the girls who had come out and said that
Jeffrey had sexual contact with them under the age of a minor and that he was
discrediting lot of these girls and making them out to be drug addicts and prostitutes and
what have you so they wouldn’t be looked upon as worthy in the court’s eyes so to speak.
And you know, he told me in the first five minutes that, you know, if I stay quiet, that
“I’ll be looked after”. And that was the exact way it was said. It wasn’t like you know,
I’m gonna pay you a zillion dollars or anything if you be quiet, but if I stay quiet, I would
“looked after”. And I remember saying I don’t want any part to do with this. You know,
this is not something I want to be a part of, I’ve got a young family. I wish the best for
everybody in this, you know, take care kind of thing. A week later, I was called after the
hearing by one of Jeffrey’s lawyers. I can’t tell you exactly which one it was but he had
Jeffrey on the other line and he connected Jeffrey and I, and Jeffrey tried to make some
simple conversation, “How are you? How have things been?” You know what I mean,
catching up.
JS:
Do you know if the lawyer, did the lawyer stay on the line while Jeffrey was speaking to
you?
V: I’m pretty sure he did. That’s why I think ieffrey was on speaker phone because it
sounded a lot different, and I was never taken off the line to begin with or connected to
another line, so I was pretty sure Jeffrey was on speaker phone and the lawyer was
making the call. After the simple conversation, it led to what was going on again and you
know, Jeffrey couldn’t believe it. You know, he thought he helped all these girls out. He
didn’t think he was wrong in any circumstance here at all. A lot of these girls were drug
addicts and just after drug money. You know, he was really putting down these women
or these girls I should say, not giving them the credit they deserved, and then he exactly
repeated what the lawyer said the week before is that he would look after me if I stayed
quiet, and if I need any help, you know, his lawyers would represent me and he would get
legal help for me, whatever I need, he would do, and I told him exactly, I said, “Jeffrey,
I’m the mother of two children at that stage. I’m away from everything there, I don’t
want to be a part of it. I’m not going to speak to anybody and I don’t want to speak to
anybody, I don’t want to be involved.” That was the last time I heard from him. And the
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 20 of 23
next thing I knew, I was sent my victim’s letter, my notification of being a victim through
the US Attorney’s Office and that’s when I knew it was well out there enough not to have
Jeffrey’s lawyers come back on me and discredit me in the same way he had done to all
the other girls. So, I called up Joseph Bird who was the recommended lawyers on my
paperwork that they had given me and started going from there.
JS:
So you contact Mr. ioseph Bergs’ office and then you were dealing with his office from
that point forward.
V: That’s correct.
iS: Tell me about the ending of your relationship with Jeffrey. That is, at what point in time
did your full time employment end and how did that happen?
V: Ok. So, it hadn’t really ended. I walked away from it all. Jeffrey sent me to Thailand
where I met my husband and escaped to Australia, never to return back to the states.
About 6 months prior to that, he came up with a proposition that I thought was really
disgustingly sick. And it really showed me for the first time in 4 years I had been with
him that nothing was going to change and I was always just going to be used by him(?)
which I did not like. He offered me a mansion and some of his money every month, I
forget what he called it, a monthly income of what he made to bear one of his children.
The proposition was that if anything ever happened between Jeffrey and I, that I would
have to sign my child over to him basically and that the child would be his and
Ghislaine’s, and I would be looking after it as long as nothing happened between Jeffrey
and I. So, I was kind of freaked out by all of that. I pushed Jeffrey more to please get me
some more training, you know, and I was getting older and not of as much interest to
Jeffrey anyways. I was 19 now, and he likes a female a lot younger. So he sent me to
Thailand, in September 2002. I was first supposed to meet a girl there and bring her
back with me, but I never met up with her. I proceeded get a short course in Thai massage
so that was to shut me up about my training so I went there, and one of my friends from
school invited me to watch a fight, like a muay thai fight, which is like a form
kickboxing. So I went and watched it, and I saw this guy that was a really good fighter,
and a girl’s word, looked really hot, so I asked my friend who knew him to introduce me.
We got introduced and fell in love immediately, 3 days later Rob proposed and 7 days
later I was being married in a buddist temple. I called Jeffrey and told him I’m sorry, I’m
never coming back. I’ve gotten married, I’ve fallen in love. I thought he’d wish the best
for me but he was kind of rude and he just said “have a good life” and hung up the phone,
and that was the last time I’d talked to him ever until all this started again.
iS: Ok. Virginia, is there anything else that you would like to add to what you have told us
up to this point in time?
V: I’d like to know that this time around something’s going to be done about it and that
Jeffrey and a lot of his colleagues, no matter how rich they are, will know that there is
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page2l of23
law and that there is people that still believe in it. So that’s it. Thank you guys for
listening to me, hearing me out and helping me. It’s kind ofhard to get through.
iS:
Thank you very much. Yes, I’m sure it has been very difficult and I am very appreciative
of the courage you have shown in doing what you have done, which really brings me to
the last subject, and that is what was it that motivated you to go public with all of this?
V: Sharon Richard contacted me. I like her, I do, I like her a lot. I know she’s a journalist,
and journalists are normally bloodsucking leeches, but I like her for that, but she is an
honest bloodsucking leech. She told me a lot about what was still going on, and she
showed me a picture of Jeffrey with a little girl who looks like she could have been 12
years old. I mean it was disgusting. I agreed to talk with her, I never agreed to do
anything until she showed me some pictures, and at that stage, being a mother of 3
children and having a daughter who I would do anything for to protect, I would put my
neck on the line to make sure she never has to go through what I had to go through, and
knowing all of this, and knowing that he’s still out there doing the same exact thing with
no regrets, no remorse, no worry about what he’s doing to those girls, and all those girls
feeling the same way that I did, so I, you know, I’m doing it because I believe in my heart
of hearts it’s the right thing to do. It’s what I would want somebody to do for my
daughter or my sister or my friend, and it saddens me to know that it’s still going on right
now. It’s like the seashell story. I don’t know if you’re heard the story about the little kid
who throws back a starfish, you know, the little brother tries to ask his sister, “why do
you throw them in, they’re all gonna die anyways, the little girl says “well, it’s this one
that I can help, and this one that I can help,” and that’s what I feel like I’m doing. I’m
making a small dent in this big world we live in.
iS: I certainly appreciate that courage, and I have heard that story, and you’re absolutely
right, that one person may not be able to make a difference for everyone, but one person
can make a difference for someone, and hopefully, you are making a difference for
someone, and we’re gonna do the best we can to make sure you are making a difference
for as many people as possible.

Clinton owes me favors”?
V: Yes. I do. It was a laugh though. He would laugh it off. You know, I remember asking
Jeffrey what’s Bill Clinton doing here kind of thing, and he laughed it off and said well
he owes me a favor. He never told me what favors they were. I never knew. I didn’t
know if he was serious. It was just ajoke.

When you say you asked him why is Bill Clinton here, where was here?
V: On the island.
iS:
When you were present with ieffrey Epstein and Bill Clinton on the island, who else was
there?
V: Ghislaine, Emmy, and there was 2 young girls that I could identify. I never really knew
them well anyways. It was just 2 girls from New York.
JS:
And were all of you staying at ieffrey’s house on the island including Bill Clinton?
V: That’s correct. He had about 4 or 5 different villas on his island separate from the main
house, and we all stayed in the villas.

V: Yes.
Were sexual orgies a regular occurrence on the island at Jeffrey’s house?
JS: If we were to take sworn testimony from the people I am going to name, and if those
people were to tell the truth about what they knew, do you believe that any of the
following people would have relevant information about Jeffrey’s taking advantage of
underage girls? So I’ll just name a name, and you tell me yes if they told the truth, I
think they’d have relevant information or no, I don’t think they would, or I don’t know
whether they would or not. Ok? You understand?

we got wrong in the statement, you can write back and you can make changes in the

Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 3 of 18

LOCAL

Sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein was surrounded by powerful people. Here’s a sampling

He was permitted to hire his own private psychologist for his required sex-offender counseling, and after his release from jail, his subsequent year of
probation under house arrest was filled with trips on his corporate jet to Manhattan and to his home in the U.S. Virgin Islands — all approved by the courts
with no objections from the state.

On the morning of his sentencing in 2008, none of Epstein’s victims were in the courtroom to protest his soft jail term or the unusual provisions of his
incarceration and probation — and that was by design.

Palm Beach multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein is a free man, despite sexually abusing dozens of underage girls according to police and prosecutors. His
victims have never had a voice, until now.

By

Emails and letters contained in court filings reveal the cozy, behind-the-scenes dealings between federal prosecutors and Epstein’s indomitable legal
team during the run-up to his federal plea deal, as they discussed ways to minimize his criminal charges and avoid informing the girls about the details of
the deal until after the case was resolved.

That arrangement benefited Epstein in a number of ways. Unlike other high-profile sex crime cases, federal prosecutors agreed to keep his sentencing
quiet, thereby limiting media coverage. His underage victims — identified in FBI documents — weren’t told about the plea deal so they weren’t in court,
where they could voice their objections and possibly sway the judge to give Epstein a harsher sentence or reject the agreement altogether.

Most important, Epstein’s crimes would be reduced to felony prostitution charges, giving him the ability to argue that the girls weren’t victims at all —
they were prostitutes.

Four accomplices named in Epstein’s non-prosecution agreement — Nadia Marcinkova, Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross and Lesley Groff — were also given
immunity from federal prosecution. Marcinkova was a young girl when Epstein brought her from Yugoslavia to live with him. Several victims told police
that she was involved in orgies with Epstein and underage girls. Ross, Groff and Kellen, now known by her married name, Vickers, were schedulers who
arranged his underage sex sessions, according to the FBI and police.

Marcinkova and Kellen, through their attorneys, declined to comment for this story. The Herald was unsuccessful in reaching Ross and Groff.

Turkey coup bid: Fethullah Gulen's lawyers
fear attack on his life

e 25 minutes ago

Lawyers for US-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen say they fear an attack on his life, in the wake of the failed coup
attempt on 15 July in Turkey.

Turkey has issued an arrest warrant for Mr Gulen, accusing him of orchestrating the coup attempt. It has called on the US to
extradite him.

Mr Gulen denies any involvement.

Turkey has cracked down heavily in the wake of the coup attempt. On Friday the governing AK Party ordered an internal purge
of Gulen supporters.

More than 270 people died in events surrounding the coup attempt.

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023878.txt,"132 Teaching Minds

Teaching people how to influence people involves putting them
in situations where it is possible to influence people and seeing how it
goes. There is nothing to learn exactly. We try behaviors and see what
works. What works for one person may not work for another. One way
or another, we learn how to get what we want, or we learn to hang
out with people who will respond to our needs. This is basically a sub-
conscious process. We are so busy working on this at a very young age
that we may not have any idea what it is we know or how to improve
what we do. Of course, there is a conscious part as well. Someone can
tell us that we will catch more flies with honey than with vinegar,
and we can, if we think about it, adjust our behavior. But aphorisms
about what works and what doesn’t work aren’t always correct and
are highly idiosyncratic. Although there are books about how to win
friends and influence people, the reality is that, apart from adopting a
phony personality, people are who they are, more or less.

But this does not mean they can’t be taught what works. It usually
does mean that they can be taught what works as a result of their own
experience. And, they can be taught what doesn’t work as a result of
their own experience. But this isn’t at all easy. If it were, psychiatrists
would not be able to make a living. You can tell a person to change
his behavior, you can even tell him exactly what to do when, but he is
likely not going to be able to do what you say.

The way influence is taught currently is probably the way it has to
be taught, then, by use of mentors who look at your behavior and talk
you through why you do what you do. This same mentoring method
can be used in corporate settings. Simulations may not be so effective
because while we may know and be able to say the right answer, this
doesn’t mean that we can execute the desired behavior in reality.

HOW TO TEACH TEAMWORK

Teamwork is learned by working in teams. It is a mixed process be-
cause, here again, we behave in ways that are not so conscious but
we can make conscious changes. Leaders learn to manage teams by
thinking about what works and what doesn’t. Quarterbacks must
learn to manage their teammates. If they don’t, it really doesn’t mat-
ter how well they can throw the ball. Team members have to want
to work hard for the leader, and the leader has to know how to mo-
tivate each team member. People are different so what works for one

Need For Alternative Methods To Produce Cannabinoids

Cannabis plants can exhibit wide variation in the quantity and type of cannabinoids they
produce. However, cannabinoids are only produced in limited quantities regardless of
the strain; in total, cannabinoids account for <1% of the dry weight of the cannabis
plant.

Selective breeding has led to strains of the cannabis plant that produce relatively large
amounts of the intermediary forms of THC and CBD. While THC content varies
substantially among cannabis strains, it generally represents 15-35% of the cannabinoid
content of the plant, and CBD is typically 1-12%. The relative abundance of these
compounds have allowed them to be well studied and their diversity of applications
have created a large commercial market.

After THC and CBD, the remaining cannabinoids are found only in trace amounts in the
plant. Compounds such as THCV, CBG, and CBC have elicited therapeutic interest, but
because they are only present in minute amounts they have been difficult to extract and
purify and impossible to produce at commercial scale. This has limited their study up to
this point.

Alternative Methods For Producing Cannabinoids

To combat the limited availability of cannabinoids using cultivation-based methods,
alternative approaches have been developed that use chemical and biotechnological
synthesis to produce cannabinoids.

Chemical Synthesis

Chemical synthesis methods use organic chemistry to produce cannabinoids; however,
the process has several drawbacks. Chemical methods have largely failed to be cost
effective for commercial scale cannabinoid production because of the complexity
required to produce the cannabinoid molecules, and extensive purification is needed to
obtain a high quality product. Commercial chemical synthesis also generates large
amounts of organic waste, takes several weeks to produce kilogram quantities, and is
expensive. As such, practical methods for the chemical synthesis of many cannabinoid
molecules has not been developed.

Biotechnological Synthesis (Synthetic Biology)

An emerging alternative to traditional cultivation and chemical synthesis is the use of
biotechnology-based approaches to produce cannabinoids. These synthetic biology
approaches produce cannabinoids through modifying the metabolism of genetically
engineered organisms. This converts the organism into a biological factory, producing
the desired cannabinoid in large quantities.

Compared to chemical methods, biosynthesis methods are more cost effective, scalable,
and environmentally friendly.

Compared to traditional methods, biosynthesis of cannabinoids is potentially more
sustainable, more reliable, faster, and less expensive. Biosynthesis does not require as
much water or energy input, is not subject to weather or other exogenous factors, takes
~3-5 days to yield an end product vs. traditional methods taking up to 4 months, and is
theoretically less expensive. Additionally, growing cannabis often involves using several
hard-to-remove impurities (e.g., pesticides), that could potentially create significant
safety issues and other undesirable dynamics. Furthermore, purity and regulatory

struck her across the face, but he used the hand in which he had his Beretta. The
gun went off, and the bullet grazed Bibi in his upper arm.

When Uzi Dayan had finally got in through the rear door, he’d run up
against a stocky, suntanned man blocking in his way, and fired — thankfully,
only into his midsection. He turned out to be one of the passengers, a film-
maker from Austria. Still, there was the other woman hijacker to deal with.
Several of the passengers pointed to the floor just ahead of Uzi, where she lay
curled up, holding a grenade with the pin out. Ordering her loudly, sternly, not
to move, Uzi wrapped his hand over hers, extracted the grenade from her grasp
finger by finger, replaced the pin, and had one of his men lead her out of the
plane and down the stairs.

All the hijackers had been either killed or captured.

Tragically, in the initial crossfire, a 22-year-old passenger named Miriam
Holtzberg, had been hit. Although the man whom Uzi had mistakenly shot
recovered, she did not. Yet all of the remaining passengers and crew were now
free and safe, alive and unharmed.

I felt a mix of emotions when it was over: pride, a sense of achievement
against all the odds. And huge relief at having succeeded in ending the ordeal of
the captives. Without my saying so, everyone in the unit understood that my
inaugural comments as commander, about our need to become a full special-
forces unit, were no longer a distant wish. Still, I knew this was only one step,
and I wanted to make sure we kept our feet on the ground. The day after the
Sabena rescue, Israeli newspapers devoted acres of newsprint to how the
operation had succeeded. Since Sayeret Matkal’s existence was still an official
secret, the headline writers called us, variously, a “special” unit, a “select” unit
and even in one case, because of our El Al coveralls, “angels in white.” We did,
briefly, celebrate back at the sayeret base. But as with every other operation, we
went through a self-critical assessment of what we could have done better. How,
if we had to do another hostage-rescue operation, could we make sure none of
the passengers was harmed? How could we improve co-ordination among the
assault teams? And minimize the risk of shooting each other. Why had I, as
commander of the operation, had to wait for someone else to suggest the idea of
disguising ourselves as aircraft technicians? And why had we failed to train
with Berettas and other pistols as well as Uzis?

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029672.txt,"Romantic and idealistic as that view may seem to some, the thought is revelatory of the fact that the greater part of
human aspiration has been informed by individual intuition and privately generated passions, more than it has
through logic or scientific revelation. The moral basis of our public life, our social organisation, has come from
within us - by aspiration and by light, not by some process of logical deduction.

Immanuel Kant referred to our inner impulses as “the higher self, an unconscious search for truth, going deeply
into ourselves to establish who we are and what we should be.

Beauty is about the quest for perfection or an ideal, and that quest has to begin with aesthetic imagination -
something informed by conscience, carved by duty. Kant called it “the inner command, the ethical construct one
creates to guide one from within.

But we need tools to mine good intentions: inspirations, ones which await the creative spark, the source of all
enlargement. Creativity is central to our progress and to all human endeavour.

Music provides the clue: unlike other forms of art, music is not representational. Unlike the outcome of the
sciences, it was never discoverable or awaiting discovery. A Mahler symphony did not exist before Mahler created
it.

E.T.A. Hoffman, a contemporary of Beethoven's, famously said: Music reveals to man an unknown realm, a world
quite separate from the outer sensual world surrounding him, a world in which he leaves behind all feelings
circumscribed by intellect in order to embrace the inexpressible.

This is not to turn our back on reason. Or to argue that modernism, with all its secular progress through education,
industrialisation, communications, transport and the centralised state, has not spectacularly endowed the world as
no other movement before it. But a void exists between the drum-roll of mechanisation with its cumulative power of
science and the haphazard, explosive power of creativity and passion. Science is forever trying to undress nature
while the artistic impulse is to be wrapped in it.

While these approaches are different - perhaps often diametrically opposite - they inform related strands of thinking
in ways that promote energy and vision.

This is what | have found when these forces are contemplated in tandem. When passion and reason vie with each
other, the emerging inspiration is invariably deeper and of an altogether higher form. One is able to knit between
them, bringing into existence an overarching unity - a coherence - which fidelity to the individual strands cannot
provide.

In the world | have lived in, the world of politics, political economy and internationalism, the literature exists in
abundance. But what is far from abundant are the frameworks for the intuitive resolution of complex problems that
require multi-dimensional solutions.

But from where do we glean this extra dimensionality?

For me, it has always been from two sources: policy ambition in its own right and from imagination - the dreaming.
Policy ambition arising from Kant's higher self, and imagination promoted by those reliable wellsprings - music,
poetry, art and architecture - blending the whole into a creative flux.

found to be true. At the core of thinking, you find generalization and
explanation. But it is important to remember that what starts the
process of generalization and explanation is failure. Without failure
we don’t try to generalize and explain because we have nothing to
generalize and explain. Thinking, therefore, looks like this:

Make a prediction
Prediction fails

Make a generalization
Explain your generalization
Make a new prediction

Let me explain how this works and why one cannot think well if one
cannot do this. To explain, I will tell a personal story relating to my
own thinking and learning with respect to two of the twelve cognitive
processes. I will explain afterwards why I have chosen to tell stories
and why I have used personal ones.

DESCRIBING

Let’s start with describing. There is, of course, an art to describing.
Anyone who writes and anyone who speaks publicly is learning all the
time about describing. Since I was a professor for 30 odd years, and
since I have written hundreds of papers and about 25 books, and since
I have given numerous keynote speeches around the world, I have
been thinking a great deal about describing for many years. I learn
something whenever I speak publicly because I can easily tell whether
I am being heard or not. Are the listeners on the edge of their seats or
are they half asleep (or literally asleep)? I learn when I write because I
read the reviews, and colleagues are always happy to tell me what was
wrong with what I wrote.

Once, I was given a lesson in public speaking by someone older
and wiser than me that I never forgot. I recently had been hired at
Stanford as a professor. I was pretty young (22) and full of myself. In
those days, the Computer Science Department ran a course for new
graduate students that served as an introduction to all the special re-
search possibilities in artificial intelligence for those who wanted to
enter that field. There were many faculty in AI at Stanford and each

Core strength

Robert Lawrence Kuhn says those who see China’s designation of Xi Jinping as core leader to be a vari

tion

of strongman rule misunderstand its significance for a people navigating their way through huge challenges

hen, at a recent
party plenum,
President Xi Jin-
ping (#2) was
designated as
“core” of the Communist Party's
Central Committee, some Western
media were quick to condemn the
rise of a new “strongman”. While
recognising the significance of Xi as
the core was correct, conjuring up
visions of an emerging dictator was
not.

T recalled my meeting with Xi
years earlier, when he wasstill party
secretary of Zhejiang (‘#f71) prov-
ince. Even then he was criticising
“empty talk” and advising, “We
should never overestimate our
accomplishments or indulge our-
selves in our achievements”.

I took note of how Xi stressed,
“We need to assess ourselves objec-
tively”. Hardly, in retrospect, the
ruminations ofa gestating dictator.

Tounderstand why Xiis nowthe
core, one must appreciate the
complex challenges of our times.
China is now facing multiple chal-
lenges: domestically -slow growth,
industrial overcapacity, endemic
pollution, imbalanced develop-
ment, income disparity, social
injustice, social service demands;
and, internationally—wars, regional
conflicts, sluggish economies, vola-
tile markets, trade protectionism,
ethnic clashes, terrorism, geopoliti-
cal rivalries, and territorial disputes
in the South and East China seas.

Most critically, because China
must deepen its reforms to achieve
its oft-promised goal of a “moder-
ately prosperous society” by 2020,
the resistance of entrenched inter-
est groups must be overcome. More
there is what some call a
pervasive “soft resistance” - local
officials who do not do their job and
economic elites who migrate.

If reform had been progressing
smoothly, then why strengthen
central authority by investing Xi
with the status of core leader? Xihas
encountered obstacles; if there
were no obstacles, there would be
no need fora core leader.

Thave been speaking to party
officials and theorists about Xi as
core leader. In fact, the necessity of
having a leadership core to main-
tain stability and expedite reform is
the first and foremost of what I
found to be four factors relating to
Xi's elevation.

Asecond factor is that not only
does Xi have the responsibility for
China’s transformation, he is also
accountable forit. Moreover, he has
shown courage in confronting and
dismantling a vast, corrupt system
of bribery, patronage and illicit
wealth accretion.

Athird factoris thatXias the core
does not end, and even may not di-
minish, the cardinal principle of

Xi Jinping as

core leader is
more a ratification
of reality than
ashift of
fundamentals

§ he pee

“democratic centralism”. The party
bolsters each of the concepts:
encouraging the democratic sclici-
tation of input and feedback from
members, lower-ranked officials,
and the public; and strengthening
centralism through Xi’s leadershi)
of the principal levers of power (his
positions as party general secretary,
head of state, chairman of the
Central Military Commission, and
head of the “leading groups” on
reform, national security and inter-
net security)

A fourth factor is that a core is
required to manage the party more
strictly and thereby give members
and the public more confidence.
Witness Xi’s relentless and unprec-
edented anti-corruption campaign,
which is altering how government
officials and industry managers
work and even think. Let no one
assume that Xi’s battle against
corruption has been risk-free.

Significantly, these four factors
undergirding Xi as the core leader
map onto his overarching political
framework, his strategic blueprint
called “The Four Comprehensives”
—a moderately prosperous society,
reform, rule of law, party discipline.

Xi’s core status arises, we're told,
through the collective will of the
party and the people. Becoming
party core is not an automatic
consequence of being general sec-
retary; a core leader must fit the
times and the status must be
earned.

Speaking at a press conference
following the 18th Central Commit-
tee's sixth plenum last month,
Huang Kunming (#!#%), executive
vice-minister of the committee's
Publicity Department, said that the
“central and local departments as
well as the military all expressed
their support” for Xi’s position as
party core, adding that this decision

was “based on the valuable experi-
ence of the party and we feel keenly
aboutit”.

Huang explained that “a core is
needed to ensure that the party will
be the governing party”, describing
it as significant for upholding the
Central Committee’s authority and
maintaining the central, unified
leadership of the party and for its
“staying true to its mission”.

Therefore, party theorists
explain, Xi as core leader is more a
ratification of reality than a shift of
fundamentals.

What does Xi as core mean ina
historical context? It was Deng
Xiaoping (9/7) who introduced
the concept when he designated
Jiang Zemin (1) as “core of the
third generation” of central leaders,
bolstering Jiang’s stature following
his unexpected appointment as
party leader in 1989. At the time,
China was facing the dual impedi-
ments of economic stagnation and
social uncertainty at home, and
economic quarantine and diplo-
matic isolation abroad. As Deng
pointed out: “Any leading group
should have a core; a leadership
with no core is unreliable.”

Only then did Deng retrospec-
tively apply the novel term to Mao
Zedong (84) and to himself, as
core of the first and second gener-
ations, respectively. (Of course,
Mao was so utterly dominant that
calling him core during his lifetime
would have seemed a demotion.
Deng remained core even when he
no longer held any official position.)

Today's world is more complex.
China faces threats at home and
abroad. Volatility grows and uncer-
tainty abounds ~ the Middle East
and Donald Trump are offered as
evidence. The need to secure
China’s stability is more essential
than ever, and thus to strengthen

Xi’'s authority is a primary reason,
I’m told, for designating Xi as core
leader. Party theorists say China
“urgently” requires a political nucl-
eus that is sophisticated and
nuanced, attuned to contemporary
times. Though conditions now
differ from those in 1989, Deng’s
admonition rings timelessly true.

However, that a core leader is
needed now does notmean one will
always be needed. When China
becomesa fully modernised nation,
perhaps by mid-century, condi-
tions may change again.

True loyalty is
telling leadership
in private what
one really
believes is in their
best interests

Thear frequently of the “painful
lessons of China's century of blood
and tears” and that for China not to
have a tested and authoritative
leadership core would be “unthink-
able”, Party inner talk says “Xi
Jinping has passed the test of the
people” to be China's political core,
leadership core, and a core of the
times.

Chinese scholars argue that
“core” is a unique characteristic of
Chinese political theory — however
inapplicable (even inexplicable) in
Western political theory. They call
Western concerns that Xi as core
leader means that “a new emperor
is born” wildly unfounded, even
paranoic. In feudal society, the
emperor ruled unconditionally

with arbitrary imperial power, and
insucha“command-obey’ system,
goes the argument, there is simply
noneed foracore.

Rather, given today’s party polit-
ical structure, the concept ofa core
both strengthens cohesion and
serves to prevent a personality cult,
not to promote one. Having a core
means acknowledging that the
party system is not the “emperor
system —absolute poweris rejected
—and that the optimum system, at
least for the foreseeable future, is a
combination of concentrated cen-
tralism and democratic collective
leadership.

Corroborating this functional
balance, in the communiquéissued
following the sixth plenum, the
“collective leadership system” is
reconfirmed. It states: “The imple-
mentation of collective leadership
and personal division oflabouris an
important component of demo-
cratic centralism and must always
beadhered to.” And itstresses: “Any
organisation or individual shall,
under any circumstance, not be
allowed to violate this system for
anyreason.” Thethree “any’s” seem
no accident.

Some analysts see contradic-
tions. On the one hand, the
communiqué calls for democracy
and constructive criticism internal-
ly within the party. On the other,
disobeying the central leadership is
forbidden, backed by vigilant
supervision and tough discipline.

Yet to read these statements as
contradictory is to misunderstand
what is happening here. Xi appreci-
ates the complex and arduous tasks
that lie ahead. He told me so a
decade ago, and it is obviously truer
today than it was then. The state-
ments are harmonised, first, by the
party's motivation toseekoptimum
peices forthecountry, and second,

y keeping most of the divergent
views internal.

True loyalty is telling leadership
in private what one really believes is
in their bestinterests, not pandering
and fawning by repeating what one
thinks leadership wants to hear.
Though there are concerns, no one
here worries that Xi will become
Mao.

China is now the world’s largest
trading nation and its second-larg-
est economy. China's diplomacy is
expanding and its military is grow-
ing. Fromits Belt and Road initiative
building infrastructure and facili-
tating trade in over 60 developing
countries to its leading role in the
UN peacekeeping forces, China, the
“Middle Kingdom’, is involved in
every meaningful matter of interna-
tional affairs.

So, what kind of China do we
want? Certainly not one with weak
central leadership and fragmented
citadels of power. With its huge and
imbalanced population, and its
diverse culture and traditions,
China today requires a leader with
sufficient strength and prestige to
secure social stability, drive eco-
nomic reform, and guide it in being
a responsible world power. Xi as
core leader should be good for
China and, thus, for the world.

Bring down the curtain on this idiotic political drama

feel you. It’s draining, to say the

least, especially when the
melodrama in Hong Kongis
dragging out; it has become
downright dreadful when we know
there is no respite in sight.

We were supposed to havea
brief break after last September's
Legislative Council polls, before the
next big event. Even though a large
number of people will be unable to
casta vote in the Election
Committee subsector elections,
less than a month away, and in the
chief executive election, scheduled
for late March next year, the city
should by now be focusing on
what's ahead.

But, thanks to the two recently
disqualified lawmakers, who lacked.
the necessary knowledge, ability
and respect for oath-taking, our
(albeit dystunctcnal) legislature
has basically been shut down fora
month. The ugly politics that
should have been insulated within

the chamber once again spilled out
onto our streets.

And what should have been
decided and concluded on
September4 isnow dragging on
indefinitely, with two or possibly
more by-elections added to the
election overload.

Hell-raising politics is not going
away any time soon, but the sheer
stupidity of the localist pair's
actions really is one for the books—

thecommon good.

What they did opened the door
for an invitation to the courts to
intervene. What they did presented
an opportunity foran
interpretation of the Basic Law by
the National People’s Congress
Standing Committee.

What they did, oltenatey may
well become the precedent for
other legislators to be similarly

barred. And that is why the duo's
pledge to spend every penny—and
lest we forget, this also means the
mounting cost to the public purse—
to “appeal atall costs” isbeyond
rich, coming from them.

Clearly, they have yet to wrap
their heads around the concept of
“personal responsibility”. Sixtus
Baggio Leung Chung-hang is
wrong in believing that their
disqualification from Legco
rendered the election meaningless.
They have no one but themselves
to blame for their defenestration. It
istheywho made the election
meaningless.

And, to add insult to the grave
injury they brought on the rest of
us, they are asking for donations. At
some point—ifwe're not there
already—we must take serious
offence to be taken as fools, again
and again. The curtain must now
be drawn on this overly played-out
second act.

The irony may be lost on the

pat butit's pretty obvious who has
een played for total fools. In case
theyhaven’tnoticed, the
lawmakers who served as the duo's
chaperones have stopped
babysitting them because there is
no value in being their keepers any
more. Escorting the duo's Legco
gate-crashing attempts served their
purpose: to usher the two straight
to their political end, and the votes
the two rendered meaningless are
now political spoils.

The two took the toxic brewand
there will be no stay of execution
that could stop those ready to
contest their seats.

Wemust fight our political
fatigue. We can ill afford to be
distracted by those who
continuously try to foolishly make

The basic law

of unintended
consequences

Mike Rowse says the continuing

political tussles in HK illustrate the

pain of being caught in a cycle of
actions and reactions, and we must
address the root cause of the grievances

the Basic Lawand the rule of law, and their

interaction. Perhaps neglected in the process has
been a different but relevant concept: the law of
unintended consequences, whereby an action gives
rise to outcomes unforeseen by the instigator.

Hong Kong's tortuous path towards political reform
isacase in point. The first reference to the idea of
universal suffrage for selection of the chief executive
comes in Article 45 of the Basic Law, promulgated back
in 1990. Looking towards 1997, its purpose was to
reassure. Naturally, attention turned to the subject in
the early part of this century. While people understood
that the move towards universal suffrage had to be in
accordance with the “principle of gradual and orderly
progress”, the reform package put forward in 2014 was
widely perceived as disappointing; the plan to stick
with an unrepresentative nominating committee
deciding who could enter the race was unpalatable.

The State Council's white paper on the governance
of Hong Kong, intended to set things straight, only
stirred things up and led to the Occupy Central
protests. The governmentlet the action linger, hoping
public anger would pay dividends in the 2016
Legislative Council election. While the 79 days of
disruption did bring the protesters momentary
opprobrium, memories quickly faded. In the election,
the pro-government share of the vote actually fell, and
the attack on the idea of independence led directly toa
near 20 percent share of the vote for a localist faction.
This was surely not the objective.

Now the government is trying to overturn the
election outcome. The practice of banning some
potential candidates from standing, then using all
means at hand to unseat some of those elected, is a
tactic more usually associated with third-world
countries following a military coup.

Has something been lost in
translation here? Perhaps
we need an interpretation
of the interpretation

In the short term, the judicial review sought by the
chief executive against the decision by Legco president
Andrew Leung Kwan-yuen to give Sixtus Baggio Leung
Chung-hang and Yau Wai-ching another opportunity
to take the oath has been successful. Mr Justice
‘Thomas Au Hing-cheung ruled in the High Court that
their oaths were invalid, they should notbe given a
second chance and their positions should immediately
be vacated, Many observers thought he might decline
toruleatall, and simply refer the matter back to the
Legco president. The problem with one arm of the
administration delving too deeply into the processes of
anotheris thatit inevitably generates more requests to
doso. And, sure enough, we now have legal challenges
against more legislators, plus. challenge against the
chief executive himself.

Given that, in the past, other Legco members who
had politicised their swearing-in and then done it
properly second time round were permitted to take up
their seats, did Leung and Yau havea “legitimate
expectation” that they would enjoy similar treatment?
The Legco president certainly thought so, hence his
origin: ruling Nowitis for ahigher court to decide.

Meanwhile, the National People's Congress
Standing Committee has sought to clarify Article 104 of
the Basic Law, which requires all people concemed to
“swear to uphold the Basic Law of the Hong Kong
special administrative region of the People’s Republic
of China and swear allegiance” to it. But the
interpretation is different: it talks of “a legal pledge ... to
the People’s Republic of China and its Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region” (emphasis added). Has
something been lost in translation here? Perhaps we
need an interpretation of the interpretation.

If, atthe end of the day, there are two (ormore)
vacant Legco seats, then we are in by-election territory.
Idon’t think the people are fooled for one minute
about whatis going on. In each constituen
impeccable opposition candidate will stand, wina
majority, and take the oath impeccably. Unfortunately,
this tragedy - or farce —will continue until the
government starts to address the underlying
grievances over the lack of meaningful political reform
instead of just hammering the symptoms, which
generates new grievances in the process.

In the wake of World War II, the United States and
many of its allies joined together to establish a host of new
international organizations. Those organizations, which
included the United Nations, the International Monetary
Fund, and the World Bank, were designed to allow mem-
ber countries to collectively pursue goals such as stabiliz-
ing the international economy, rebuilding war-torn na-
tions, and maintaining international peace and security.

Anticipating that those and other international organi-
zations would locate their headquarters in the United
States, Congress passed the International Organizations
Immunities Act of 1945, 59 Stat. 669. The Act grants
international organizations a set of privileges and immun-
ities, such as immunity from search and exemption from
property taxes. 22 U.S. C. §§288a(c), 288c.

The IOJA defines certain privileges and immunities by
reference to comparable privileges and immunities enjoyed
by foreign governments. For example, with respect to
customs duties and the treatment of official communica-
tions, the Act grants international organizations the privi-
leges and immunities that are “accorded under similar
circumstances to foreign governments.” §288a(d). The
provision at issue in this case provides that international
organizations “shall enjoy the same immunity from suit

Brad —

In your answers to ROGS, you list Milton Center for girls as facility that Jane Doe attended. Milton Center is a
Department of Juvenile Justice facility; therefore | will need to get her records from DJJ. DJJ will not release the records
without a signed release by Jane Doe. | have attached a general HIPPA release for your review. Would you please have
Jane Doe sign it? DJJ does not have a standard form.

Also, will you agree to one more week on Responses to Net Wirth ROGS??

Please let me know.

Hizbollah fighters were being armed and financed by the Iranians and by Syria
as well. They were mounting increasingly effective operations against the
Israeli troops we’d left in the security zone. Even closer to home, Palestinian
attacks on both troops and civilians, though on nowhere near the scale of the
first months of the intifada, showed no sign of ending. I had my own views on
both. In Lebanon, I still believed we should pull out all our troops and focus our
security arrangements on what really mattered: protecting the citizens of
northern Israel. As for the lessons to be learned from the intifada, my view that
we needed a political dialogue had inadvertently become public, from remarks I
made in Moshe Dayan’s honor at a memorial event a few months before
becoming chief of staff. “We are currently in a struggle with the Palestinians — a
long, bitter and continuing struggle,” I said. “A people cannot choose its
neighbors. But we will have to talk to the Palestinians about matters, especially
about issues that are vital to them.”

Still, I was the commander of the armed forces, not a politician. Though all
chiefs of staff had political influence, if only as part of the decision-making
process on all major security questions, making policy was for our elected
government. My main focus was on how to improve the military’s fitness to
respond. I’d lived through, and more recently fought in, all of Israel’s wars. I
felt that we had yet to apply some of the critical lessons from those conflicts.
Leading tanks into battle against the Egyptians’ deadly Sagger missiles in 1973,
and a decade later watching whole Israeli armored columns stalled and attacked
by small bands of PLO fighters or Syrian commandos in Lebanon, had hardened
my conviction that Israel needed a leaner, more mobile army, with more
specialised strike units, as well as more easily targeted, less vulnerable weapons
systems. I wanted to shift the emphasis to weaponry that relied on Israel’s
strengths in new technology, invention and engineering. In a sense, this was the
macroscopic equivalent of one of the guiding principles of Sayeret Matkal:
brains, not just brawn.

While cost-saving wasn’t the catalyst, I did realize that a change in strategy
would mean a change in how we allocated our resources. When Israel bought its
first Mirage jets from France in the 1960s, they cost about a million dollars
apiece. The price tag of an F-16 was now closer to fiftv million dollars. The cost
of a tank had increased tenfold. I wasn’t going to deprive the air force of state-
of-the-art aircraft, key to our ability to fight and win a war. But while we still
needed a strong armored corps, it was important to realize that units like the

Hi Jeff, 
I realize the last term sheet was a draft, my fault (my computer sync'd the draft with the same name). 
Here is a correct version, the last page is the signature page. It would be great if I could get this back 
tomorrow. Nothing is due until the recap is complete, hopefully in about 4 weeks. I am planning to start those 
discussions the end of next week. 
Things are going well. The more I learn the more excited I get. I will be at Tarana tomorrow 
discussing a window mount version to try to get to self-install. lgbps in a self-install package would be the last 
step. 
We will only need a tower ever 4-5km in the city, which is basically 2 or 3 rooftops for all of Boston. 
I met with American Tower today (I know their CEO and CTO) and they have plenty of room on the John 
Hancock. 
Fun Stuff and great to be doing something together!

of Information request with the Hong Kong Security Bureau ask-
ing for information about Snowden’s movements in May. Thomas
Ng, the secretary for security, turned down the request, adding that
Hong Kong authorities do not keep records of hotel registrations. I
had run into a dead end with the Hong Kong authorities on the issue
of Snowden’s “carer” and Snowden’s whereabouts for those eleven
crucial days.

At this point, I got some much-needed help from an old friend on
the Obama White House staff. Before I had left New York, I asked
him if he could find someone at the consulate in Hong Kong who
might brief me on the Snowden case. I didn’t hear from him until
just a few days before I was due to return to New York. He put me
in touch with a former employee of the Hong Kong consulate, who
he said was “fully informed” about the efforts of the U.S. mission to
locate Snowden in Hong Kong. This person was still living in Hong
Kong, and he agreed to meet with me on condition that I did not
mention either his name or his specific job in the U.S. mission in
Hong Kong. The venue was the terrace lounge of the American Club

® in Exchange Square in central Hong Kong, a posh club mainly for ®
expatriate Americans. It was on the forty-eighth floor, with a spec-
tacular view of Victoria Harbor. Once there, I had no problem find-
ing my source, identifying him by the description he had given me.
He was sitting alone at a discreet table in the corner.

After we ordered drinks, he told me ina soft voice about the Amer-
ican reaction to Snowden’s revelations in Hong Kong. “All hell broke
loose,” he said, describing the atmosphere at the U.S. mission after
Snowden’s video was posted on The Guardian's website on June 9.

Lasked about an assertion that Snowden had made concerning the
U.S. consulate in that extraordinary video. Snowden had said that he
could be seized at any moment by a CIA rendition team based at the
U.S. consulate “just down the road” from the Mira hotel.

“Was that true?” I asked.

He rolled his eyes and said, “Snowden has a pretty wild imagina-
tion. For one thing, the U.S. consulate is not down the road from the
Mira in Kowloon; it is here on Hong Kong Island. And there was no
CIA rendition team in Hong Kong.”

Two days after his 29 birthday dinner on June 21st, she described him playfully as a “goof.”
She wrote in her blog:”The universe is telling me something and I'm pretty sure it's saying get out,
Fuck you Hawaii.” In early July, she summed up her shaky situation with Snowden, in another
blog, writing: “I moved to Hawaii to continue my relationship with E. [but] it has been an
emotional roller coaster since I stepped off the plane.” She also found it odd that Snowden would
work on his computer at home hooded under a blanket, as she would later tell the FBI. She
diverted herself by organizing a pole dancing studio in the 400 foot garage of the house. She also
joined a New Age yoga studio called “Physical Phatness,” a local acrobatic performance group,
and, on Friday nights, pole-danced at the Mercury lounge in downtown Honolulu.

That same July, Snowden had other things on his mind, including an attempt to advance
himself. Although his position at Dell as a system administrator was a well-compensated one,
especially for a 29 year old with no formal education, it carried little prestige. He sat from 9 AM
to 5 PM in a windowless room watching a bank of monitors in the so-called “tunnel” at the NSA.
Many of those who worked him were, as he described them, “eighteen year old
soldiers. Presumably, they had little interest in discussing with him the weightier issues of the
world. Working as an outside contractor was also a dead-end job that hardly matched the vision
he had of himself in his Internet postings. In real life in a cubicle in the NSA, he decidedly was
not the “Wolfking Awesomefox” heroic image he had of himself in his dream vision.

Whatever his motive, he decided to apply for a position in the NSA itself. He apparently
believed that if he scored high enough in its entrance exam, the NSA would invite him to join it as
a Senior Executive Service officer, or SES, which was the civilian equivalent in rank and pay to a
flag officer in the US armed forces. To achieve this SES job, Snowden used his privileges as a
system administrator at Dell to hack into the NSA’s administrative files and steal the answers to
the NSA exam. As the NSA’s subsequent post mortem would find out, it was the first known
document that Snowden took at the NSA. But it was not the first time he had used his hacking
skills to attempt to advance himself. At the CIA in 2009, as he late said in Moscow, he had added
text to his annual evaluation in what he termed “a non-malicious way” to prove a point. His CIA
superior took a much darker view of that incident when the hack was detected, calling for an
investigation that, it will be recalled, ended Snowden’s CIA career. At the NSA his intrusion,
however, was not detected for almost a year. “He stole the [NSA] test with the answers, and he
took the test and he aced it,” former NSA Director Michael McConnell recounted in a 2013
interview, “He then walked into to the NSA and said you should hire me because I am this good
on the test.” The issue of why he attempted to gain entry into the upper ranks of the NSA in the
late summer of 2012 is less clear. If his Internet posting and Libertarian riffs are an indication of
his state of mind in 2012, he was hostile to the surveillance activities of the NSA. If so, it made
little sense he would seek a permanent career in the NSA. If this attempted career is considered in
light of the career move he made six months later in March 2013 which, as he himself admits, was
for the express purpose of getting at tightly-held documents stored on computers that were not

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011075.txt,"The one and twenty years could mean remaining life expectancy at age 50. But Petty
could easily have spelled that out, or the implied 71 year terminus. He does spell out
the ages of the three generations. Their average difference in age rounds to 21

years.

Petty’s readers, like Smith’s and Ricardo’s after, would have taken it for granted that
each generation provides for the next. “Few men having reason to take care of more
remote posterity” would have registered in the context of that provision. “Posterity”

usually meant and means descendants.

His description, like mine, is incomplete. He may mean that life expectancy is also a
factor in calculating the years purchase. If so, he apparently leaves that thought to
be followed up later. There is also room to argue that the grandfather looks two
generations ahead, so that the years purchase becomes 42 years. But that would
give the usus fructus at 2.3%. All the rates Petty reports elsewhere in the tract are
much higher. One generation length is what he seems to apply. My reading is that
the grandfather provides for the grandson by passing all to the son.

Petty’s overlapping generation insight has been one of his least noticed, just as with
Mill’s on output growth preceding and explaining capital growth. I first read of
Petty’s idea in a collection of Lionel Robbins’ lectures at London School of
Economics delivered in 1979-1980, but published in 2000. I learned from these
lectures that Gustav Cassel had published the same idea in his The Nature and
Necessity of Interest in 1903. I hunted that down. Robbins misremembered in telling
his students that Cassel had arrived at the idea independently. In fact Cassel and
Robbins both quote the same excerpts from A Treatise of Taxes that I just did. Cassel

inferred that interest rates cannot stably be less than 2% per year.

TripAdvisor total minutes in 1Q through February is up 10%, with mobile minutes up 5%

IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE 17th
JUDICIAL CIRCUIT IN AND FOR
BROWARD COUNTY, FLORIDA
CIVIL DIVISION
BRADLEY J. EDWARDS, and CASE NO. CACE 15-000072
PAUL G. CASSELL,
v.
Plaintiffs,
ALAN DERSHOWITZ,
Defendant.
/
RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT ALAN DERSHOWITZ’S MOTION FOR
CLARIFICATION OF CONFIDENTIALITY ORDER OR RELIEF FROM THAT ORDER
Non-Party Virginia Giuffre, by and through undersigned counsel, hereby responds to
Defendant Alan Dershowitz’s Motion for Clarification of Confidentiality Order or Relief From
that Order and states as follows:
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
On November 12, 2015 this Court issued an Order granting in part, non-party Virginia
Giuffre’s Motion to Quash the subpoena served by Defendant Alan Dershowitz and ordered
protective limits relating to her deposition. See Exhibit A, November 12, 2015 Order. On
December 18, 2016, this Court entered a Confidentiality Order holding that non-party Virginia
Giuffre’s deposition would be confidential. See Exhibit B, December 18, 2015 Confidentiality
Order. On January 16, 2016, Ms. Giuffre testified at her deposition in accordance with this
Court’s Order. The deposition was labelled confidential in accordance with this Court’s Order.
As the Court knows, Ms. Giuffre was a victim of sexual trafficking when she was a minor child.
Indeed, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida has specifically recognized
her as a “victim” of federal sex offenses. Unsurprisingly, her deposition contains highly sensitive
information about her experiences as a minor child, including detail descriptions of sexual crimes
committed against her.
ARGUMENT
1. Non-Party Virginia Giuffre Agrees That Her Deposition Should Be Provided
Confidentially To Law Enforcement to Investigate All The Crimes Committed
Against Her
Defendant Dershowitz seeks to have the Court grant an exception to the confidential nature
of the deposition so that it can be provided to the Office of the State Attorney and the Office of the
United States Attorney for investigative purposes. Specifically, Defendant Dershowitz states in
his motion that he is hoping to have law enforcement investigate whether Ms. Giuffre committed
perjury by stating in her previously filed affidavit that it is her recollection that she witnessed
former President Bill Clinton on Jeffrey Epstein’s island in the United States Virgin Islands
(“USVI”) 1 .
Setting aside Defendant Dershowitz’s baseless claims of perjury, Ms. Giuffre agrees that
her confidential deposition should be provided to law enforcement, including the United States
Attorney and the State Attorney in each jurisdiction where any alleged crimes occurred so that
they may investigate all of the crimes committed against her when she was a minor child. To
ensure that justice is served and that Defendant Dershowitz’s request is not just another charade
designed only to bully a sexual abuse victim, Ms. Giuffre asks the Court to impose the following
reasonable conditions relating to the disclosure:
�
Mr. Dershowitz agrees and is directed to cooperate with authorities and answer all
questions relating to the investigation of crimes against Ms. Giuffre.
1 Defendant Dershowitz conveniently ignores that publicly available flight logs of Jeffrey Epstein’s private
planes demonstrate that President Clinton travelled with Jeffrey Epstein and others to various locations
throughout the world including Europe, Africa and Asia. See Exhibit C, Excerpts of Flight Logs from
Jeffrey Epstein’s private plane.
2
�
�
�
�
Mr. Dershowitz agrees to make his client, Jeffrey Epstein, and others with relevant
testimony and with whom he has testified he shares a “common interest” – at least Epstein
and Maxwell – available to any law enforcement agency reviewing any alleged criminal
activities; or in the alternative, to attest to this Court that those necessary witnesses have
consented to full cooperation in the investigation Mr. Dershowitz is seeking permission to
initiate.
Mr. Dershowitz agrees to waive the statute of limitations in all jurisdictions for any
criminal conduct he participated in or was aware of relating to Ms. Giuffre so that law
enforcement can pursue any necessary charges. Defendant Dershowitz proclaimed that he
was willing to waive any statute of limitation for criminal conduct so this should not be an
issue. See Exhibit D, January 12, 2016 Deposition Transcript of Alan Dershowitz at 395.
“I had talked about the statute of limitations for criminal purpose was what I said, that I
would waive the statute of limitations for criminal purposes.”
Mr. Dershowitz agrees to provide the names and contact information for each State
Attorney and United States Attorney for which he has or is planning to provide
information relating to Ms. Giuffre; and agrees to jointly, with Ms. Giuffre’s counsel,
request that the State Attorney and United States Attorney, in the relevant jurisdictions,
investigate all potential criminal conduct. Both parties may provide any relevant
information they have that may assist the authorities with their investigation.
For all other purposes non-party Ms. Giuffre’s January 16, 2016 deposition transcript shall
remain confidential and sealed other than for confidential disclosure to law enforcement as
described above.
2. Mr. Dershowitz Has No “Evidence” of Perjury And Instead Is Simply Trying To
Bully This Victim
As explained above, Defendant Dershowitz wrongly suggests to this Court that non-party
Virginia Giuffre has committed perjury in an effort to taint the Court against this victim. His only
“evidence” of this alleged perjury is a self-serving opinion from his retained expert that an
“absence of records” in response to a FOIA request, establishes that former President Clinton was
never on Jeffrey Epstein’s island in the USVI. Defendant Dershowitz misrepresents the
government’s response. The government is only required to conduct a reasonable search of
readily accessible records. Accordingly, an “absence of records” response does not mean that
records do not exist. It simply means that in the course of the search, no records were found. See
Cunningham v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 961 F.Supp. 2d 226, 236 (D.C. 2013) (court reasoning that
“[t]he adequacy of a search is measured by a standard of reasonableness… The question is not
3
whether other responsive records may exist, but whether the search was adequate.”); Wilbur v.
C.I.A., 355 F.3d 675, 678 (D.C. 2004) (court explaining that “the agency’s failure to turn up a
particular document, or mere speculation that as yet uncovered documents might exist, does not
undermine the determination that the agency conducted an adequate search for the requested
records.”). Moreover, when dealing with a former President’s security detail travel, there are a
number of reasons why the government may not disclose those records.
As explained above, public flight records from Jeffrey Epstein’s private plane show that
President Clinton traveled with Jeffrey Epstein on multiple occasions. Nevertheless, if Defendant
Dershowitz wants to pursue this issue before the Court, then he needs to produce for deposition
testimony in this case and the proposed criminal investigation, the other witnesses that were
present on the island at the time former President Clinton was alleged to have visited, including
his client Jeffrey Epstein, and Ghislaine Maxwell, to whom he has testified he is party to a joint
defense agreement. It is worth noting on that point, that despite Mr. Epstein’s counsel’s
attendance at depositions in this case, and Defendant Dershowitz’s claim that Mr. Epstein is still
his client, Mr. Epstein has taken extreme measures to avoid being deposed in this case despite
being ordered to deposition by this Court.
Indeed, it is also noteworthy that during Defendant Dershowitz’s recent deposition,
counsel for Mr. Edwards and Mr. Cassell asked Defendant Dershowitz the following question:
“Was Virginia Roberts lying when she said Jeffrey Epstein socialized with Bill Clinton during the
relevant time period?” Depo Tr. Of Alan Dershowitz, Vol. 4, January 12, 2016 at 511. Before
Defendant Dershowitz could answer, Mr. Dershowitz’s legal counsel interposed an attorney-client
privilege objection. Id. Perhaps Mr. Epstein’s defense counsel can provide to the Court an
appropriate privilege log regarding that objection – and all the communications between Mr.
Epstein and Defendant Dershowitz that would have been revealed in answer to that question – so
that the Court will have the benefit of a full record in ruling on this motion.

"
IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011061.txt,"selection should probably do as well. We are all at peace with the fact that people

and other creatures care for their young.

Economics and evolutionary biology are much the same. Helen Keller, born blind
and deaf, might still have reasoned her way through much of both. Hamlet would
have loved them. | love them most when they test the limits of logic, and consult the
data only at the end. The theme from which both reason, as Herbert Spencer taught
in the nineteenth century, is what he called “survival of the fittest.” Another
philosopher, Karl Popper, found fault with this idea a century later. Popper was one
of those | mentioned who disapprove of truisms. | haven’t read Popper, but gather
that he thought it improper to define fitness as potential survival, and then measure
it as survival. That objection is close to being understandable from an anti-truism
viewpoint. But the reason why it is not quite a truism is instructive. Measurement
implies an “empirical” world of data in external and observable reality. Spencer’s
insight, really his paraphrase and generalization of Darwin’s, is not quite a truism
because it carries the hypothesis that “potential” has an empirical meaning.
Aristotle’s idea that potency precedes and explains act is called causality. Adam
Smith’s friend and fellow Scotsman David Hume scarcely doubted causality, but
argued correctly (I think) that it cannot be proved either by logic or by experiment.
The fittest prove themselves such by surviving if and only if Aristotle was right.

Natural selection simply means the untestable but little-doubted theory of causality.

Spencer or Darwin or Gertrude Stein might be faulted for insulting our intelligence
by stating the obvious. That shoe would fit Gertrude Stein. But Spencer and Darwin,
like the little boy in Hans Christian Andersen’s The Emperor’s New Clothes, were
stating the obvious unseen. Andersen’s point was that intelligence was not the thing
lacking or what the little boy supplied. It was about how tradition and mind-sets and
in-groups might sometimes need a look from outside. Peer review is not enough.
Sometimes it perpetuates nonsense. The little boy was not a peer, but he could tell
clothes when he saw them. (“Peer”, as any theorist knows, means someone who

pees on your theory.)

Opinion of the Court

to the rights in question. See Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer
Co., 892 U.S. 409, 427-480 (1968). Similarly, the Federal
Tort Claims Act states that the “United States shall be
liable” in tort “in the same manner and to the same extent
as a private individual under like circumstances.” 28
U.S. C. §2674. That provision is most. naturally under-
stood to make the United States liable in the same way as
a private individual at any given time. See Richards v.
United States, 369 U.S. 1, 6-7 1962). Such “same as”
provisions dot the statute books, and federal and state
courts commonly read them to mandate ongoing equal
treatment of two groups or objects. See, e.g., Adamson v.
Bowen, 855 F. 2d 668, 671-672 (CA10 1988) (statute mak-
ing United States liable for fees and expenses “to the same
extent that any other party would be liable under the
common law or under the terms of any statute” interpreted
to continuously tie liability of United States to that of
any other party); Kugler’s Appeal, 55 Pa. 128, 124-125
(1867) (statute making the procedure for dividing election
districts “the same as” the procedure for dividing town-
ships interpreted to continuously tie the former procedure
to the latter).

The IFC objects that the IOTA is different because the
purpose of international organization immunity is entirely
distinct from the purpose of foreign sovereign immunity.
Foreign sovereign immunity, the IFC argues, is grounded
in the mutual respect. of sovereigns and serves the ends of
international comity and reciprocity. The purpose of
international organization immunity, on the other hand, is
to allow such organizations to freely pursue the collective
goals of member countries without undue interference
from the courts of any one member country. The IFC
therefore urges that the IOIA should not be read to tether
international organization immunity to changing foreign
sovereign immunity.

But that gets the inquiry backward. We ordinarily

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011707.txt,"young Likud politicians, Dan Meridor and Ehud Olmert, with whom I had
become friendly. They, like me, were concerned about undermining the
Americans’ military and diplomatic coalition.

Shamir mostly listened, until very near the end. He then asked Dan Meridor,
Misha and me to join him in a separate room. He asked each of us for our
views. Misha, even more strongly then in front of the full cabinet, argued that
we could not allow night after night of missile attacks without responding.
Meridor reiterated his opposition, stressing the damage we’d risk doing to the
Americans’ war effort by possibly weakening Arab support for their attack on
Saddam. When Shamir turned to me, I said that if the government did decide on
military action, we were ready. From a purely military and security point-of-
view, I said, an attack made absolute sense. Even if we didn’t succeed in
destroying, or even finding, the mobile launch sites, putting a military force on
the ground would almost surely lead to a dramatic reduction in the number of
Scud launches. But, echoing Meridor, I added that a military response would
carry a price in our relationship with the Americans. My view was that, at least
for now, we should hold off.

When we rejoined the meeting, Shamir rapped his hand on the table. In the
startled silence that followed, he said he shared many ministers’ urge to hit back
against the Scuds. But he said: “At this stage, we’re not going to do anything.
We bite our lips and wait.”

Three nights later, his resolve was stretched almost to breaking point.
Missiles landed in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan, and nearly 40 homes
were damaged. A three-story house was flattened. In all, nearly 100 people were
injured, and three elderly residents died of heart attacks. On the night of January
25, another seven Scuds hit. Nearly 150 apartments were badly damaged, and a
51-year-old man was killed. The pressure on Shamir was all the greater because
the Ramat Gan attack had come within range of one of the Americans’ Patriot
batteries. The Patriots had been originally designed not as anti-missile weapons,
but to attack aircraft, and they seemed to have been ineffective. Nor were
American air strikes in Iraq stopping the Scuds. Though American jets had
taken out a few fixed launch sites, they were having no luck with finding and
destroying mobile launch vehicles.

Even Shamir now felt that unless the Americans got the mobile launchers,
we would have to attack military action. I was sent to Washington along with
Misha and David Ivri, a former air force commander, to deliver that message to
the Bush administration. From the first days after Saddam’s attack on Kuwait,

suffering as sex trafficking victims.

89. Dershowitz, personally, intentionally, and maliciously made false and damaging
statements of fact concerning Roberts, as detailed above, in the Southern District of New York
and elsewhere.

90. The false statements that Dershowitz made, personally on behalf of himself and
Epstein not only called Roberts’s truthfulness and integrity into question, but also exposed
Roberts to public hatred, contempt, ridicule, and disgrace.

91. At the time Dershowitz made his false statements, he and Epstein, knew full well
that they were completely false.

92.  Dershowitz’s false statements constitute libel, as he and Epstein knew that they
were going to be transmitted in writing, widely disseminated on the internet and in print.
Dershowitz intended his false statements to be published by newspaper and other media outlets
internationally, and they were, in fact, published globally, including within the Southern District
of New York.

93.  Dershowitz’s false statements constitute libel per se, including that they accused
her of a crime, and including that they exposed Roberts to public contempt, ridicule, aversion,
and disgrace, and induced an evil opinion of her in the minds of right-thinking persons.

94. Dershowitz’s false statements also constitute libel per se, inasmuch, among other
reasons, as they tended to injure Roberts in her professional capacity as the president of a non-
profit corporation designed to help victims of sex trafficking, and inasmuch as they destroyed her
credibility and reputation among members of the community that seeks her help and that she

seeks to serve.

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031448.txt,"I spoke with Mr. Argall by telephone on August 12, 2015, and inquired as to when I
could expect a third interim production. He informed me that the FBI reviewer assigned to the
Epstein file had not commenced the processing of any additional materials in the 2 2 months
following the May 29 production and, further, that any such review was not currently scheduled
and would not begin until, at earliest, October 2015. Given the lengthy delays due which
include second level FOIA reviews conducted in Southern Florida by either the USAO or FBI, it
predictably will take, at the very minimum, 5 4 months from the prior production in May until a
third “batch” would be provided (not the 60-90 days I had repeatedly been told was the ordinary
delay between separate 500 page productions on large files such as Mr. Epstein’s). At this pace
—a production of fewer than 500 pages out of the still unprocessed 11,000 pages each 5 ‘4
months — the remaining 22 “batches” will not be produced for ten more years. Mr. Argall also
advised that the reviewer assigned to the request was processing other files and that, in essence,
other than communicating with me (which Mr. Argall has done on a regular basis), he could not
suggest a way to expedite the pace other than by my advising Mr. Epstein to relinquish his FOIA
rights to the review of his entire file.

The FBI response to the above-numbered FOIA request has been utterly incompatible
with the language of the FOIA, which states that “[u]pon any determination by an agency to
comply with a request for records, the records shall be made promptly available to such person
making such request,” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(C)(i)(emphasis added), and with court opinions
defining the FOIA “basic policy” as focusing on “citizens” right to be informed about ‘what their
government is up to,” Dep't of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S.
749, 773 (1989). Additionally, the FBI’s delays in this matter violate the policy of President
Obama, announced on January 21, 2009, which directed each agency to “act promptly” and
make “timely disclosures of information.” Even further, the Attorney General in a Memorandum
for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies dated March 19, 2009, stressed that FOIA
“professionals should be mindful of their obligation to work ‘in a spirit of cooperation’ with
FOIA requesters,” that “unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles have no place in the ‘new era of open
Government,’” and that “timely disclosure of information is an essential component of
transparency [and] long delays should not be viewed as an inevitable and insurmountable
consequence of high demand.” (emphasis added). The pace of disclosure where Mr. Epstein has
received less than 1,000 of over 12,000 pages in the over 28 months since the OJP required the
FBI to process his FOIA request is in stark conflict with the mandates of both the President and
the Attorney General. More is required than for Mr. Epstein to simply wait, year after year, for
the FBI to comply with its FOIA obligations.

“In a recent opinion, Clemente v. FBI, 71 F.Supp.3d 262 (D.D.C. 2014), Judge Hogan found that
the “FBI is not ‘deluged with [a] volume of requests . . . vastly in excess of that anticipated by
Congress,”” that the “FBI has not shown exceptional circumstance or sufficient progress in
reducing its backlog to warrant an Open America stay,” and that although the plaintiff's request
“that the FBI process 5,000 pages a month is higher than the rate would be in an ordinary

case, ... the FBI has successfully processed documents at that rate in other cases.” Mr. Epstein
acknowledges the differences between his case and that of plaintiff Clemente, however, an
agreement that his file be processed at even 10% of the 5,000 pages a month ordered in the
Clemente case would speed up the production of his FOIA file by many multiples given that Mr.

clamoring for what is now offered. Ninety-eight percent of them
want to be programmers, Almost none of them want Ph.D.s.

I cannot go to a faculty meeting any more. I get into a fight
at every faculty meeting. I argue about teaching and education
and they think they know because they are professors. I cannot
subject myself anymore to their abuse.

These problems exist precisely because of the subject-based
education system. That system is about factual knowledge, and it is
this emphasis on factual knowledge that has given rise to the testing
mania that has swept the country. These problems exist because the
real mission of the university is very different than the general public
imagines.

Here is a quote and a story that I rather like:

A university is what a college becomes when the faculty loses
interest in students.—John Ciardi

Benjamin Franklin told the story of some Massachusetts
commissioners who invited the Indians to send a dozen of their
youth to study free at Harvard. The Indians replied that they
had sent some of their young braves to study there years earlier,
but on their return “they were absolutely good for nothing,
being neither acquainted with the true methods for killing deer,
catching beaver, or surprising an enemy.” They offered instead to
educate a dozen or so white children in the ways of the Indians
“and make men of them.”(From Benjamin Franklin, An American
Life, by Walter Isaacson)

What has changed? Key life skills no longer include catching beaver.
Otherwise, things are pretty much the same. Change “catching bea-
ver” to any modern daily skill, and Franklin’s story is just as valid
today.

What do students really learn at a great university? Parents never
really ask this question. They just know that their kid got into a good
college and that their child is lucky to go there.

Should you avoid sending your child to top schools because they
don’t teach so well there and really don’t plan to improve the situa-
tion any time soon?

Gregory was no exception.

But one evening the regular white comic at the Playboy Club got
sick, and Gregory took his place. It made 7ime magazine, and he was
invited to perform on the Jonight Show, but he declined unless, after
doing his stand-up act, he would be asked to sit down and talk with Jack

breaking through the color barrier with humor.

Eventually we became friends and fellow demonstrators. Now he

decorated all over with bunny symbols. Gregory was already on stage.

http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey-epstein-200303

One of Epstein’s first assignments for Hoffenberg was to mastermind doomed bids to take over
Pan American World Airways in 1987 and Emery Air Freight Corp. in 1988. Hoffenberg
claimed in a 1993 hearing before a grand jury in Illinois that Epstein came up with the idea of
financing these bids through Towers’s acquisition of two ailing Illinois insurance companies,
Associated Life and United Fire. “He was hired by us to work on the securities side of the
insurance companies and Towers Financial, supposedly to make a profit for us and for the
companies,” Hoffenberg reportedly told the grand jury. He also alleged that Epstein was the
“technician,” executing the schemes, although, having no broker’s license, he had to rely on
others to make the trades. Much of Hoffenberg’s subsequent testimony in his criminal case has
proven to be false, and Epstein has claimed he was merely asked how the bids could be
accomplished and has said he had nothing to do with the financing of them. Yet Richard Allen,
the former treasurer of United Fire, recalls seeing Epstein two or three times at the company. He
and another executive say they had direct dealing with Epstein over the finances. And in his
deposition of 1989, Epstein stated that he was the one who executed “all” Hoffenberg’s
instructions to buy and sell the stock. He called it “making the orders.” He could not recall
whether he had chosen the brokers used.

To win approval from the Illinois insurance regulators for Towers’s acquisition of the
companies, Hoffenberg promised to inject $3 million of new capital into them. In fact, in his
grand-jury testimony Hoffenberg claimed that he, his chief operating officer, Mitchell Brater,
and Epstein came up with a scheme to steal $3 million of the insurance companies’ bonds to buy
Pan Am and Emery stock. “Jeffrey Epstein and Mitch Brater arranged the various brokerage
accounts for the bonds to be placed with in New York, and I think one in Chicago, Rodman &
Renshaw,” Hoffenberg reportedly said. Then, said Hoffenberg, while making it appear as though
they were investing the bonds in much safer financial instruments, they used them as collateral to
buy the stock. “Epstein was the person in charge of the transactions, and Mitchell Brater was
assisting him with it in coordination on behalf of the insurance companies’ money,” Hoffenberg
claimed at the time.

At one point, according to Hoffenberg, a broker forged the documents necessary for a $1.8
million check to be written on insurance-company funds. The check was used to buy more stock
in the takeover targets. Meanwhile, in order to throw the insurance regulators off, the $1.8
million was reported as being safely invested in a money-market account.

United Fire’s former chief financial officer Daniel Payton confirms part of Hoffenberg’s
account. He says he recalls making one or two telephone calls to Epstein (at Hoffenberg’s
direction) about the missing bonds. “He said, ‘Oh, yeah, they still exist.’ But we found out later
that he had sold those assets ... leveraged them ... [and] used some margin account to take some
positions in... Emery and Pan Am,” says Payton.

Epstein’s extraordinary creativity was, according to Hoffenberg, responsible for the purchase by
the insurance companies of a $500,000 bond, with no money down. “Epstein created a great
scheme to purchase a $500,000 treasury bond that would not be shown ... [as] margined or
collateralized,” he reportedly told the grand jury. “It looked like it was free and clear but it
actually wasn’t,” he said.

answers under enormous pressure when, inevitably, things went wrong. It
required not just brawn, but brains.

A week before I began my final year at Hebrew University, I went to see Eli
Zeira, the senior intelligence officer who’d so brashly predicted the course of
the Six-Day War, in hopes of sounding out my prospects of picking up my
military career where I'd left off. Despite a yawning gap in rank and age — Eli
was nearly fifteen years older — I felt I could be open with him. Not only did I
know him from Sayeret Matkal, which came under his purview in the kirya. He
was a scientist manqué and was eager, as soon as I arrived in his office, to hear
about my physics studies. When I did manage to turn the conversation to the
army, I told him I was thinking of returning after I graduated. Yet before finally
deciding, I wanted his honest opinion about my chances, at some point, of being
given command of the sayeret. He began with a series of caveats. The choice of
future leaders of the sayeret was not be his to make. When the current
commander, Uzi Yairi, ended his term in roughly 18 months’ time, Id still be
too young to have a realistic chance. “Maybe even next time around,” he said.
And in any case, I would first need to get some experience in the regular army.
“But then,” he concluded, “my opinion is that you have a very good chance of
becoming commander of the unit.” That was more than enough. I figured that
whether it actually happened would now ultimately be down to me.

My last year at university was the closest thing I would have to a normal
student existence. I was called away only once. But it was for a battle which
would turn out to have a lasting impact on the course of our conflict with the
Arabs, and on the prospects of eventually finding a way to make peace. It was
Israel’s largest military action since the war, across our new de facto border with
Jordan. And it was directed at a new enemy: a fledgling army of Palestinian
fedayeen, called Fatah. It was led by a man that I, like almost all Israelis, had
never heard of at the time: Yasir Arafat. Born in Egypt, as a 19-year-old he had
fought against the establishment of Israel in the 1948 war. Although Fatah had
nominally existed for nearly a decade, it was only now emerging as a political
force, in large part because of the Arab armies’ humiliating defeat in the Six-
Day War. A Palestinian political leadership already existed, in the shape of the
Palestine Liberation Ogranization. But it was based in Cairo. Its chairman was,
for all practical purposes, an adjunct of President Nasser’s leadership role in the
Arab world. Though Arafat had not yet explicitly challenged this state of affairs,
his, and Fatah’s, rise after the war carried a powerful, message for the existing
Arab presidents and prime ministers: their brash promises of victory before the

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024118.txt,"authorized the Director of the ONDCP to designate areas within the United States that exhibit serious drug trafficking
problems and harmfully impact other areas of the country as High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTAs). The
HIDTA program aims to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of drug control efforts among local, state and federal
law enforcement agencies.

The Annunzio-Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act of 1992 gave protection from civil liability to any financial institution,
or director, officer or employee thereof, who/that makes a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) under any local, state or
federal law. The Annunzio-Wylie Act made it illegal to disclose when a SAR is filed. It also made it illegal to operate a
money transmitting business without a license where such a license is required under state law, and required all
financial institutions to maintain records of domestic and international funds transfers. In addition, this Act introduced
the “death penalty,” mandating that bank regulators consider taking action to revoke the charter of any banking
organization that is found guilty or pleads guilty to a charge of money laundering.

The Money Laundering Suppression Act of 1994 (MLSA) specifically addressed money services businesses (MSBs),
requiring each MSB to register and maintain a list of its agents. In addition to making it a federal crime to operate an
unregistered MSB, the MLSA encouraged states to adopt uniform laws applicable to MSBs. It also established
procedures that allowed banks to exempt certain customers from Currency Transaction Report (CTR) filing.

Continuing with the trend of developing a national strategy to combat money laundering, the Money Laundering and
Financial Crimes Strategy Act of 1998 called for the designation of areas at high-risk for money laundering and
related financial crimes by geography, industry, sector or institution. Some of these areas were later designated as
High Risk Money Laundering and Related Financial Crimes Areas (HIFCAs). The HIFCA program was created to
coordinate the efforts of local, state and federal! law enforcement agencies in the fight against money laundering.

The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 amended the BSA to require the U.S. Treasury
Secretary to prescribe regulations requiring certain financial institutions to report cross-border electronic transmittals
of funds, if the Secretary determines such reporting is “reasonably necessary” to aid in the fight against money
laundering and terrorist financing.

11. | What is the role of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and how does it fit into
AML laws and regulations?

The purpose of OFAC is to promulgate, administer and enforce economic and trade sanctions against certain

individuals, entities and foreign government agencies and countries whose interests are considered to be at odds

with U.S. policy. Sanctions programs target, for example, terrorists and terrorist nations, drug traffickers and those

engaged in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

Overviews and details of the OFAC Sanctions programs can be found on OFAC’s website at www.treas.gov/ofac.

OFAC regulations are not part of AML compliance per se, but since the OFAC Sanctions lists include alleged money
launderers and terrorists and USA PATRIOT Act requirements mandate that certain financial institutions vet customer
names against the OFAC list, institutions often consider the OFAC program to be a subset of their overall AML
program. For additional guidance, please refer to the Office of Foreign Assets Control and International Government
Sanctions Programs section.

12. How can one measure the effectiveness of an AML regime?

A number of factors can be considered when assessing the effectiveness of an AML regime, including the number of
money laundering/terrorist financing investigations, prosecutions and convictions, number and amount of
frozen/seized assets, identification of deficiencies in financial institutions in examinations by regulatory authorities,
and quality of coordination among financial institutions, regulatory and law enforcement authorities. For additional
guidance on tools and techniques used to assess the effectiveness of AML systems, please refer to the Financial
Action Task Force section.

13. How do U.S. regulations compare to international AML regulations?

The United States' role as a leader in the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing dates back 40 years
to the passage of the Bank Secrecy Act in 1970. Through the ensuing decades and especially following the terrorist
activities of September 11, 2001, the United States has reinforced its commitment through the passage of a number
of additional money laundering-related laws, issuance of extensive regulatory guidance and aggressive enforcement.

That said, the United States, as with many other major jurisdictions, is not in full compliance with the FATF
Recommendations. In fact, FATF in its most recent assessment of the United States’ anti-money regime, identified
several areas in need of improvement, including: customer due diligence relating to beneficial owners, authorized

by THOMAS D. WILLIAMS, PH.D.11 Mar 2018

As Steve Bannon continues his tour of Europe, energizing the anti-
establishment populist base, the mainstream media cannot help but
admit their admiration for his abilities, despite their dislike of his aims.

In this week’s issue, the left-wing German weekly Sern articulates the greatest fear of the European
establishment: that Bannon “could give the fragmented right in Europe a common ideology and rhetoric.”
Many thought that the reign of the “Dark Lord” had ended, writes Gernot Kramper, when Steve Bannon left
first the White House and then his role as executive chairman of Breitbart News. It turns out, however, that
Bannon’s adversaries had underestimated him, because he is “‘as dangerous as ever,” he confesses.

Kramper cannot conceal his respect for Bannon’s ability to move a crowd. He was greeted by “frenetic
applause” in his recent address before France’s National Front party, Kramper writes, demonstrating his
“Impressive potential,” which the writer describes as “dangerous.”

Bookstore owner calls police after customer 
confronted Steve Bannon 
By Morgan Gstalteduly 07, 2018 - 10:38 PM EDT 
A Richmond, Va., bookstore owner said he called the police on Saturday after former White 
House chief strategist Stephen Bannon was confronted in his store. 
Nick Cooke, owner of Black Swan Books, told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that a woman 
called Bannon a piece of trash. 
The woman then left the store after Cooke said he called 911. 
Steve Bannon was simply standing, looking at books, minding his own business. I asked 
her to leave, and she wouldn't. And I said, 'I'm going to call the police if you don't,' and I 
went to call the police and she left, Cooke said. And that's the end of the story. 
Bannon grew up in Richmond, the newspaper noted. 
The Richmond Police Department confirmed the call was made but the call was canceled 
before officers responded. 
We are a bookshop. Bookshops are all about ideas and tolerating different opinions and not 
about verbally assaulting somebody, which is what was happening, Cooke said.

feminist movement has failed us! That's not what happened, either. I identify as
feminist, and I don't believe that to be at odds with being a submissive masochist. Indeed,
I believe that the feminist movement helped my practice of BDSM: it's one of the factors
that gave me the strength and self-assurance required to figure out and discuss my sexual
needs.

Andrew and I did get back together; then we broke up again. Richard and I have had
other nights together. I wish this narrative ended cleanly. I wish I could say that I've
found a fairy-tale lover, that I'm now with a man who both hurts me till I cry and gives
me the relationship I want. (Why stop there? He could be rich and handsome and a great
cook, too!) But this is my story, not a fairy tale. Just as well; that means I still have space
to learn. I believe I've gotten better at communicating clearly. I believe I've gotten better
at sorting out the harsh emotions inspired by BDSM, working with -- and enjoying! --
those feelings in the context of a loving relationship. And I hope I no longer objectify my
sadistic partners to the extent that I objectified Richard. Still, I know I've got a ways to

go.

I see BDSM as a continuum -- similar to the theory that homosexuality is a continuum --
and sometimes I think that everyone's on the continuum to some degree. I don't think
Andrew is as far into the continuum as I am, and not as far as Richard, either. But there
are reasons I was with Andrew for nearly two years, yet never let myself fall completely
into Richard.

A certain kind of devoted relationship is important to me. I felt strongly about Richard,
and he was a good fit for BDSM, but he couldn't give me the relationship I want. I went
back to Andrew, though he was far less into BDSM, because I was able to love him. I
wonder, though: if I ever fall for a completely vanilla man, will I be able to compromise
that far? It seems unlikely. Maybe if that happens I'll have to remember my friend's
words and find a separate person, a non-lover who inflicts pain.

I'd rather not do that, but I can't imagine giving up BDSM. The idea feels equivalent to a
vow of celibacy. As my therapist said, I'm not looking to escape -- especially not now
that I've finally adjusted. It wasn't easy, but I feel that today I am triumphant. And I
believe, I hope, that knowing what I want is the surest path to falling straightforwardly --
happily -- in love.

below). You claimed that “both Universities independently concluded that the report was unsubstantiated and
fabricated with malicious intent.” We are not aware that either university concluded fabrication or malicious
intent, so if you have evidence to support this assertion, we would like to see and discuss it.

The story concerns your actions towards students while a professor of physics at Case Western Reserve
University, as well as your conduct in non-academic settings as a prominent figure in the skeptics movement.
| am reporting this story along with two of my colleagues on the science desk, Azeen Ghorayshi and Virginia
Hughes.

Our story is about several allegations of sexual misconduct dating from 2006 to 2016 (see full details below).
Our reporting also goes into how the various institutions you have been affiliated with — Case Western,
Arizona State University, the Australian National University, the New College of the Humanities, and the
Center for Inquiry, for which you serve as an honorary member of the board of directors — have handled
complaints and concerns about your behavior during this time.

Our story is corroborated by emails, university documents, official complaints, testimony from victims and
eyewitnesses, and interviews with more than two dozen of your current and former academic colleagues,
students, and peers in the skeptics movement.

| wanted to offer you the opportunity to comment and/or respond to the main facts we plan to publish. If you
wish to comment on any of the below findings, we need to hear from you as soon as possible. We are
planning on publishing our story Tuesday morning, Eastern US Time.

Based on our reporting, this is what we plan to publish:

Incident 1:

° In November of 2006, at an event launching the new Center for Inquiry in Washington D.C., you met a
volunteer for CFI D.C.

° At the event, you asked for her business card. Later, you followed her as she was leaving and asked
her if she was “of age.”

° Later, you emailed her to invite her to dinner.

° You planned to dine with her in the restaurant at the Washington D.C. hotel where you were staying.

° You told her to come up to your room first because you needed to finish some work.

° In your hotel room, you seemed in no rush to leave. You ordered a cheese plate, and later champagne,
despite her suggestion that you go down to dinner.

° You then made a comment about her eye makeup, getting very close to her face.

° You then lifted her by her arms, and pushed her onto the bed beneath you, forcibly kissing her and

trying to pull down the crotch of her tights.
° She struggled to push you off her.
° You said, “When | was in college | could never get a girl that looked like you.”

° When you pulled out a condom, she got out from under you. She said “I have to go,” and rushed out of
the room.

Incident 2:

° In an incident that occurred in fall of 2007 while you were a physics professor at Case Western Reserve
University, a student tried to talk to you about her plans after graduation. You mentioned to her how tough it
must be to have all the other physics majors asking her out on dates.

° In a second incident in December of 2007, while you were still at Case Western, the same student
visited your office to interview you for a student science journal. You closed the door behind her, and ignored
the questions she had prepared. Then you made a casual comment about taking her out for dinner.

He’s helping others get away with child-sex trafficking

Posted on August 20. 2010 by Betty Fokker

Let’s discuss that billionaire douche-face child-rapist, Jeffrey Epstein for a moment shall

we? He’s someone who likes to have sex with venerable underage girls, including 12 year old
girls who are trafficked into the US under the guise that they will become models. His partner in
crime was Jean Luc Brunel, owner and ‘talent scout’ of the MC2 “modeling agency’. Epstein
coincidently invested a million bucks in the MC2 kiddie-perating modeling agency and let
Brunel use his privet jet.

The FBI thinks Epstein has assaulted/molested about 40 or so young girls. So he’s going to
prison for the rest of his life right? Wrong.

When faced with the best defense lawyers money could buy, the prosecutors wimped out and
made a plea bargain so light it boggles the mind. This kid-raping bastard only had to please
guilty to two MINOR charges and gets a private cell, a cell he gets to leave on a “work release
program” by the way.

Now, I am not blaming his defense attorneys. They were doing their job and, under our
constitution, a festering anus like Epstein has the right to the best attorneys he can afford.

] am livid with the prosecuting attorneys. It was their job to do everything in their power to bring
this vomit-inducing shit-sack to justice. Instead, they decided to gutlessly pander to his wealth,
privilege, and powerful defense team. They rolled over and did everything but send in another
kid to give this fucker a hand-job. So this vermin got away with raping 12 year old girls because
the prosecuting attorneys couldn’t find a single testicle/ovary to share among them.

And do you know what their chicken-shit kowtowing to Epstein has wrought? It’s opened the
door for other child-sex traffickers to get fighter sentences for their crimes too. Why should they
have to pay when he didn’t? After all, it was just girls they were trafficking for sex with
disgusting older males (1 refuse to call something like Epstein a “man”; it insults men) ... they
weren't harming anything of any value in our culture!

I'm a feminist because I think girls & women have value. What a crying, fucking shame there
wasn't one feminist in the prosecutors office to go after this monster and punish him. What a pity
other hell-spawn might get away with trafficking girls for sex more easily because of the shit-
for-brains attorneys who let Epstein get away with his crimes.

My eyeballs are melting with rage.

Never mind. They aren’t melting. It’s just tears of helpless and despairing rage against an unjust
legal system and the cultural devaluation of women and girls.

$375-million entertainment district located between Monte Carlo and New York-
New York. The MGM Resorts/AEG collaboration will consist of an indoor arena that
will feature 20,000-seats, 50-luxury suites, more than two-dozen private loge boxes,
club seating, and other specially designed exclusive hospitality offerings and dining
pavilions. Expected to hold more than 100-events annually, The Arena will be hosting
concerts, red-carpet award shows, professional sports events such as basketball or
hockey, boxing, mixed martial arts, and other major functions. Construction is slated
for completion in Spring 2016 and will open concurrently with The Park.

The Grand Bazaar Shops (Bally's) — The $50-million outdoor retail complex is located
on the southeast corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Flamingo Road, in the front portion
of the property. Inspired by great markets from around the world, the shops contains
110-stores, including Swatch, Superdry, Havaianas, and Campo Marzio. More than a
third of the property will feature restaurants, bars and food outlets. The main feature of
the bazaar shops is an eye-catching tower called the Swarovski Crystal Starburst. The
tower is positioned over the brand’s store and displays a midnight show of lights and
music. The retail complex opened in January 2015.

City of Rock (MGM Resorts) — Opened in May 2015, City of Rock is located on the

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016114.txt,"Expanded role for the Oil Ministry under Vision 2030

The Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources has been expanded to become the
Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources. It will be dedicated for energy, in
addition to expanding to encompass responsibilities relating to electricity and industry.
It will also undertake the management of the National Industrial Cluster Development
Program (NICDP). The new Minister will chair the board of directors of the Royal
Commission for Jubail and Yanbu, the Industrial Development Fund, the Saudi
Organization for Industrial Estates and Technology Zones, the Saudi Geological Survey,
the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology, the Saudi Exports Development
Authority and the King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy.

Energy sector liberalization drives non-oil diversification

The wider role for the Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources is in line with
the expanded industrial responsibilities foreseen for Saudi Aramco in the Vision 2030. It
may also suggest a continued desire to liberalize the energy sector. The National
Industrial Cluster Development Program (NICDP), established in October 2012 by the
Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources and the Ministry of Commerce and
Industry, could likely gain further importance in the industrialization strategy adopted in
the Vision 2030. The NICDP will be managed by the Ministry of Energy. It seeks to
leverage Saudi Arabia’s comparative advantage in energy, petrochemicals and minerals
to create sustainable export oriented industries, initially focused on the automotive,
construction material, appliances, metal processing and flexible packaging sectors.

Restructuring the Cabinet and other government bodies

The Ministry of Commerce and Industry will become the Ministry of Commerce and
Investment and sees the appointment of a new Minister. The new Minister will chair the
board of directors of the General Authority for Investment, the General Authority for
Small and Medium Enterprises and the Saudi Standards, Metrology and Quality
Organization. The Ministry of Labor will be merged with the Ministry of Social Affairs to
form the Ministry of Labor and Social Development, and sees the appointment of a new
Minister. The Ministry of Water and Electricity has been disbanded. The Ministry of
Agriculture was renamed the Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture and
expands its responsibilities into these areas. Two new Ministers for Transport and
Health were appointed. The Ministry of Hajj has been renamed the Ministry of Hajj and
Umrah and sees the appointment of a new Minister.

The Saudi Fund for Development will now report to the Council for Economic and
Development Affairs. The General Authority for Entertainment and the General Authority
for Culture have been created. The Department of Zakat and Income Tax was renamed
the General Authority for Zakat and Income, and will report to the Ministry of Finance.

New Central Bank Governor maintains commitment to USD peg

Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) Governor Al-Mubarak has been replaced in his
post by SAMA Deputy Governor for Research and International Affairs Dr. Al-Kholifey. A
number of officials were also appointed into various government and advisory roles.
New SAMA Governor Al-Kholifey’s past policy pronouncements suggest continued
commitment to the USD peg.

Watch the Saudi Fund for Development

The Saudi Fund for Development (SFD) new direct link to the Council for Economic and
Development Affairs likely concentrates further authority in the Deputy Crown, in our
view. Given that the Public Investment Fund (PIF) last saw similar links being established
prior to plans being made for it to be turned into a Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF), this
could suggest further strategic changes may take place at the SFD.

Q&A on the USA, with a watchful eye on the risk of giant man-eating plants; Spain

So, how tight is US fiscal policy supposed to get next year?

Very, if you look at what is supposed to happen according to current law. In the chart, we show the annual change in the budget
deficit over the last 25 years. The impact of all provisions scheduled to expire and kick in during 2013 would be very large. But
if Congress and the President elect to extend current tax rates, retain lower payroll tax rates and extended jobless benefits, etc,
the adjustment would not be as big, and only reflect expiration of Recovery Act provisions, the recently passed Budget Control
Act, and some other smaller provisions. There are of course plenty of permutations in between.

What direction is the Congress heading, and what did Larry Summers and Brad DeLong have to say about this recently?
Political outcomes this fall will affect what Congress does, but I get the sense that they will punt fiscal adjustments into the
future if they can, and impose austerity of no more than 1% of GDP in 2013. Ifso, Congress can point to a March 2012 paper
by Summers and DeLong as justification. The bottom line from the paper: don’t tighten fiscal policy when interest rates are
near zero. The authors assert that (a) additional government spending can ease the long-term budget constraint in conditions
similar to today’s, and (b) tightening policy now would risk permanent loss of human capital, lower labor productivity growth
and lower trend growth. They have held these views for a while; the paper appears designed to convince others.

Advocates for more fiscal and monetary stimulus often point to the charts below. Rising Federal debt has not resulted in higher
interest rates, so why not keep borrowing more? As for the Fed, balance sheet expansion prevented deflation and hasn’t resulted
in an inflationary surge (core inflation measured over 3 months just came in below 2%), so why not keep doing it? Aren’t
these charts amazing?

They are amazing, but no one knows how long they can be sustained. Even Summers and DeLong concede that “even if it is
granted that the stimulus can be both timely and temporary, the question of how large it can be while preserving these attributes
remains for future research”. If one of these trends could not be sustained, my guess is that it would be fiscal constraints rather

e How strongly will the recently announced infrastructure projects boost growth?

CIO View (Probability: 70%*) Stabilization in economic momentum
¢ We continue to expect a sequential recovery in the growth momentum in the current quarter. Inventory reductions
should be less of a drag on growth and the government is rolling out more investment plans. At the same time,
political uncertainty should diminish after the power handover in November. We think that real GDP will grow 7% y/y
in 4Q (consensus: 7.7%) before improving mildly to 7.3% in 1Q 2013 (consensus: 7.9%).

¢ Indicators measuring inventory levels have fallen recently, showing that the destocking cycle is well advanced. In
addition, domestic prices for some major raw materials appear to have bottomed out, which should support a mild
rebound in production activity in the coming months. However, this may not be sustainable without a genuine
recovery in final demand. 70

¢ While the government has recently announced trillions of infrastructure investment projects, the spending will span Apr-10 Oct-10 Apr-11 det-11 Apr-12 Oct-12
several years and the source of funding remains unclear. In addition, real estate investment growth is likely to stabilize a

but not rebound strongly in the months ahead. We therefore do not expect a sharp rise in investment growth. Fiscal
support measures should help to stabilize economic growth, but are unlikely to result in a strong growth boost.

¢ The 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China will be held on 8 November, which is exactly the same

date as in the previous leadership handover in 2002. With the transition of the senior Communist Party leadership Investment staying supportive to growth
taking place in this meeting, political uncertainties should be reduced. Execution of policy easing measures could
improve, although a substantial new stimulus is unlikely in the near term. In terms of monetary policy, we do not 60

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017018.txt,"II.3B. Generation of historical n-grams corpora

To generate a particular historical n-grams corpus, a subset of book editions is chosen to serve as the
base corpus. The chosen editions are divided by publication year. For each publication year, total counts
for each n-gram are obtained by summing n-gram counts for each book edition that was published in that
year. In particular, three counts are generated: (1) the total number of times the n-gram appears; (2) the
number of pages on which the n-gram appears; and (3) the number of books in which the n-gram
appears.

We then generate tables showing all three counts for each n-gram, resolved by year. In order to ensure
that n-grams could not be easily used to identify individual text sources, we did not report counts for any
n-grams that appeared fewer than 40 times in the corpus. (As a point of reference, the total number of 1-
grams that appear in the 3.2 million books written in English with highest date accuracy (‘eng-all’, see
below) is 360 billion: a 1-gram that would appear fewer than 40 times occurs at a frequency of the order
of 10° ') As a result, rare spelling and OCR errors were also omitted. Since most n-grams are infrequent,
this also served to dramatically reduce the size of the n-gram tables. Of course, the most robust historical
trends are associated with frequent n-grams, so our ability to discern these trends was not compromised
by this approach.

By dividing the reported counts by the corpus size (measured in either words, pages, or books), it is
possible to determine the normalized frequency with which an n-gram appears in the base corpus. Note
that the different counts can be used for different purposes. The usage frequency of an n-gram,
normalized by the total number of words, reflects both the number of authors using an n-gram, and how
frequently they use it. It can be driven upward markedly by a single author who uses an n-gram very
frequently, for instance in a biography of 'Gottlieb Daimler’ which mentions his name many times. This
latter effect is sometimes undesirable. In such cases, it may be preferable to examine the fraction of
books containing a particular n-gram: texts in different books, which are usually written by different
authors, tend to be more independent.

Eleven corpora were generated, based on eleven different subsets of books. Five of these are English
language corpora, and six are foreign language corpora.

Eng-all

This is derived from a base corpus containing all English language books which pass the filters described
in section 1.

Eng-1M

This is derived from a base corpus containing 1 million English language books which passed the filters
described in section 1. The base corpus is a subset of the Eng-all base corpus.

The sampling was constrained in two ways.

First, the texts were re-sampled so as to exhibit a representative subject distribution. Because digitization
depends on the availability of the physical books (from libraries or publishers), we reasoned that digitized
books may be a biased subset of books as a whole. We therefore re-sampled books so as to ensure that
the diversity of book editions included in the corpus for a given year, as reflected by BISAC subject
codes, reflected the diversity of book editions actually published in that year. We estimated the latter
using our metadata database, which reflects the aggregate of our 100 bibliographic sources and includes
10-fold more book editions than the scanned collection.

Second, the total number of books drawn from any given year was capped at 6174. This has the net
effect of ensuring that the total number of books in the corpus is uniform starting around the year 1883.
This was done to ensure that all books passing the quality filters were included in earlier years. This

in-flight food remains in recession. Apparently, those who supply food to executive aircraft are seeing demand soar
after a slump, but says one caterer: No one is eating lobster. A quick turkey box lunch is the order of the day. Of
course, that has nothing to do with the industry being desperate to re-brand itself as time-saving and cost-efficient.

WHO MADE OFF WITH THE MONEY? IT's a year since the Bernie Madoff affair blew up and the hedge fund
king was found to have been ripping off his clients. If he was in Britain the old fraudster would still be at liberty as
lawyers pored over his case and the prosecution had barely cranked into operation. But the US is different [#x2039] his
case is done and dusted, and he's languishing in jail. Even so, by US standards, the Madoff conviction was going some.
Rumours persist that he pleaded guilty as quickly as he did and said the absolute minimum because he wasn't the main
crook of the piece [#x2039] the main business of his hedge fund was washing money for organised crime. As soon as
the balloon went up and he was arrested, he was warned by friends with Italian-American origins that his life, and the
lives of his family, would be at risk were he not to take the rap.

Peak globalization/inequality means higher real rates - short 10Y US real rates
Our fixed income team make the point that globalization has been a driving force behind
lower real rates as it has been good for EM growth and reserves. Those reserves then
found their way back into the US holding real rates lower. They argue that as the global
savings glut unwinds real rates have room to re-price. Peak inequality also means an
unwind of globalization as politicians seek to protect workers from the depressing
effect on wages coming from overseas. Donald Trump has already said he intends to
charge China with being a currency manipulator. Whether he does or not and what
action he takes to accompany it remains to be seen, but artificially low currencies
generating high current account surpluses are unlikely to go down well with the new
administration. That lends weight to the fixed income team’s arguments.

Peak inequality may also mean less migration across the world — think Trump’s
arguments on illegal immigration from Mexico and Theresa May’s desire to limit
migration into the UK post Brexit. Less migration likely means more upward pressure on
wages, which is the inflation expectations side of the argument. But Michael Hartnett
also thinks it means more action on fiscal policy. The UK government have implemented
a £24bn infrastructure fund in the Autumn statement. Donald Trump wants to trigger up
to $1tn of infrastructure spending in the US in addition to the tax cuts.

The fiscal boost should push real rates higher (at least in the short term). Some Fed
members have acknowledged this suggesting that equilibrium interest rate might be
moved higher by fiscal stimulus. The rates team also rightly says while they want to be
bearish rates given the speed of the move so far it is also right not to be foolish. Given
how much inflation expectations have moved they think there is better risk reward in
real rates. They argue the 10Y real rate is the most vulnerable to further moves higher in
rates. Although they have already risen from around zero in the summer to ~50bp now
they think 10Y real rates can reach 1%. So we add that trade to our 2-5-10s position.

Implications for other asset classes: Stronger USD, weaker EM?

The forces impacting on markets from the Trump victory have not been confined to
rates markets, although it is probably fair to say that most (although certainly not all) of
the impact stems from the move in rates. Higher US rates have meant a stronger USD,
an outperformance of short duration over long duration equities, a hit to EM debt and all
forms of carry trades.

Whenever Templeton might be ready to evaluate another application, I'm ready for another proposal

a grant writer, and so the time one of these suckers takes makes me think doing more advance

Mill’s proposition that persecution to preserve the existing order can
never be justified remains theoretical and may never be achieved;
even democratic governments must coerce their citizens for a variety
of reasons. Nevertheless, the ruler who moves society to a more
advanced stage of development is not only good but also perhaps the
most necessary of historical actors—to the extent that history is
determined by freewilled individuals as well as by larger
geographical and economic forces. And the good autocrat, I submit,
is not a contradiction in terms; rather, he stands at the center of the
political questions that continuously morphing political societies
face.

GOOD AUTOCRATS there are. For example, in the Middle East,
monarchy has found a way over the decades and centuries to
engender a political legitimacy of its own, allowing leaders like King
Mohammed VI in Morocco, King Abdullah in Jordan and Sultan
Qaboos bin Said in Oman to grant their subjects a wide berth of
individual liberties without fear of being overthrown. Not only is
relative freedom allowed, but extremist politics and ideologies are
unnecessary in these countries. It is only in modernizing
dictatorships like Syria and Libya—which in historical and
geographical terms are artificial constructions and whose rulers are
inherently illegitimate—where brute force and radicalism are
required to hold the state together. To be sure, Egypt’s Mubarak and
Tunisia’s Ben Ali neither ran police states on the terrifying scale of
Libya’s Qaddafi and Syria’s Assad nor stifled economic progress
with such alacrity. But while Mubarak and Ben Ali left their
countries in conditions suitable for the emergence of stable
democracy, there is little virtue that can be attached to their rule. The
economic liberalizations of recent years were haphazard rather than
well planned. Their countries’ functioning institutions exist for
reasons that go back centuries: Egypt and Tunisia have been states in

days of the peace process, he became a
key point of contact for the Americans,
the Israelis, the Arabs, and much of the
rest of the international community.

I came to know Erekat not only as a
negotiator, but as a person. He sent his
kids to Seeds of Peace, a conflict
resolution and coexistence organization
that I ran briefly after leaving the State
Department, and my daughter befriended
his and stayed with the Erekats in
Jericho. Saeb and I have yelled at each
other, defended our respective positions,
laughed, and mourned opportunities that
were never adequately explored. But
through it all, what he said about himself
was true: He wasn't as pro-Palestinian or
pro-Israeli as much as he was pro-peace.

That peace has proven elusive to this day.
But with all our differences -- and there
are many -- I believe Erekat believes in
its possibility. Who else would list as an
objective on his resume: Solve the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict based on a two
state negotiated solution through
diplomatic offices?

If, or perhaps when, another effort to
negotiate a deal is made, one thing is
clear -- Erekat will be in the middle of it.

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024124.txt,"Financial Crimes Enforcement Network

23: What is the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and what is its role in AML
regulation?
The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Treasury Department, was established in
1990 by Treasury Order 105-08. Its mission is to safeguard the financial system from abuses of financial crime. It is
the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the United States, formed to support law enforcement and the financial
community in the fight against money laundering, terrorist financing and other financial crimes through the collection,
analysis and sharing of BSA information. FinCEN seeks to provide adequate financial intelligence to law enforcement
without overburdening the financial community or compromising the privacy of individuals.

The many partnerships of FinCEN are not limited to the United States, but expand internationally to law enforcement,
financial institutions and regulatory authorities in foreign countries, as well.

While FinCEN relies primarily on federal functional regulators to examine financial institutions and enforce AML
compliance, the regulators look to FinCEN for guidance in the implementation of the BSA and USA PATRIOT Act.
FinCEN has issued regulations, in concert with federal functional regulators and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS),
related to BSA and AML compliance. FinCEN may issue enforcement actions for violations of the BSA and USA
PATRIOT Act through its Office of Enforcement jointly or unilaterally. The Office of Enforcement evaluates
enforcement matters, including the assessment of civil money penalties.

24. In what types of initiatives does FinCEN engage?

In 1992, as part of the Annunzio-Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act, FinCEN formed the Bank Secrecy Act Advisory
Group (BSAAG), a task force established to coordinate and inform the financial community about BSA-related
matters. The BSAAG includes senior representatives from financial institutions, federal law enforcement agencies,
regulatory agencies, and others from the public and private sectors. In 2009, the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task
Force (FFETF) was established as a multi-agency task force with federal, state and local partners to improve efforts
to investigate and prosecute significant financial crimes, recover proceeds for victims, and address financial
discrimination in the lending and financial markets.

FinCEN also has created several communication systems to facilitate the sharing of information among both
domestic and international entities. The BSA E-Filing System allows financial institutions to file electronic BSA forms,
such as CTRs and SARs, quickly and securely. The Gateway program enables law enforcement agencies and
financial industry regulators to have expedited access to BSA records filed with FinCEN. The Law Enforcement and
Financial Institution Information Sharing (LEFIIS) system allows law enforcement to receive feedback from financial
institutions on subjects of money laundering and terrorism investigations, and is used to facilitate information sharing
among financial institutions. FinCEN also developed the Egmont Secure Web (ESW), which is a private network that
allows connected FlUs to interface with FinCEN and each other to access information related to money laundering
trends, analytical tools and technological developments via e-mail.

Additional tools include the Geographic Threat Assessments and Nontraditional Methodologies Sections, a resource
center for emerging methods of money laundering and terrorist financing.

FinCEN also collaborates with other FIUs globally to exchange information supporting AML and counterterrorism
initiatives worldwide, and assists other countries with developing their FlUs. For additional guidance on FIUs, please

refer to the Key International Groups and Initiatives section.

25. What resources has FinCEN provided to the public?

Among the issuances and resources provided by FinCEN are the following:

e Statutes and Regulations - Resource that contains links to BSA and USA PATRIOT Act statutes and codified
regulations.

e Federal Register Notices — Links to final regulations issued after the date of codification as well as Notices of
Proposed Rulemaking (NPRs) in the Federal Register.

e Guidance — Clarification of issues or responses to questions related to FinCEN regulations (e.g., completion and
filing of Suspicious Activity Reports [SARs]; applicability of the definition of a money services business [MSB] to
a particular business activity; applicability of the Safe Harbor provision when sharing SARs under certain
circumstances).

2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *906

who had a right to attend trials subject to certain conditions even before the passage of the CVRA. 7°? Without the explicit
listing of this exception, some trial courts simply overlooked the victim's right to attend - most notoriously in the Oklahoma
City bombing trial. 7°4

[*907] Merely relying on Rule 615 to protect the victim's right to attend proceedings, however, would be inadequate. First, the
defendant's right to attend proceedings is deemed sufficiently important to merit treatment in a specific rule mn the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure - Rule 43. This proposed victim's rule, Rule 43.1, would even-handedly mirror that treatment for
victims.

Second, Federal Rule of Evidence 615 does not comprehensively address the victim's right to attend proceedings. For starters, it
would seem that the Advisory Committee Notes in the Federal Rules of Evidence now need a revision to reference the CVRA.
Otherwise, judges, prosecutors, and defense counsel might simply be unaware that a victim is now authorized by statute - the

CVRA - to be present. 75° Even if legal professionals realize the CVRA's ramifications, most crime victims are not lawyers and
lack experience in the criminal justice system. Therefore, their rights need to be laid out in the most direct manner possible by
listing their right to attend any public court proceeding in the criminal rules.

Finally, providing the details of the victim's right to attend is important for practical reasons. The CVRA qualifies the victim's
right to attend by requiring exclusion in those rare cases when the victim's testimony would be materially altered if the victim
heard other testimony at that proceeding. 78° The CVRA, however, contains additional procedural requirements that judges
must follow before excluding a victim in such situations: Before making a determination ... [to exclude a victim], the court
shall make every effort to permit the fullest attendance possible by the victim and shall consider reasonable alternatives to the
exclusion of the victim from the criminal proceeding. 78” Presumably, these reasonable alternatives include having the victim
testify first and then watching all the following witnesses testify, 75° something judges are authorized to require. 78? The Act
also requires that the reasons for any decision denying relief under this chapter shall be clearly stated on [*908] the record.
290 These procedural requirements are new and potentially complex. Moreover, issues surrounding victim attendance at
criminal proceedings are likely to occur frequently. Victims can appeal any exclusion order, and appellate courts must take up
those appeals expeditiously. 7?! Accordingly, it is important that lawyers, judges, and victims have the new rule and its
procedural requirements at their fingertips, rather than being forced to dig it out through some cross-reference to the United
States Code. For all these reasons, subsection (a) of the proposed rule simply tracks verbatim the substantive and procedural
requirements of the CVRA.

Proposed Rule 43.1(a) also limits the victim's right to attend public proceedings. It is clear that the CVRA intended to make
no change in the circumstances in which proceedings could be closed to the public. As Senators Kyl and Feinstein explained in
a colloquy regarding the law: The Government or the defendant can request, and the court can order, judicial proceedings to

282 See Fed. R. Evid. 615, Adv. Comm. Notes, 1998 Amendments.

83 See 42 U.S.C. 10606 (1990) (replaced by the CVRA).

bigger than all that,” Bannon told French populists.

Bannon showed that he “dominates the mood against the ‘elites,’ the ‘establishment’ and the ‘perverse system’
of greedy corporations and banks, and of course also against the press, which is led around ‘like a dog on the
Leash,’” Stamper writes.

And now he Mr. Bannon setting himself up as an instigator, if not an outright shepherd, of a movement that
crosses borders, languages and parties.

“Bannon is a master of apocalyptic rhetoric,” Stamper continues, effortlessly weaving together nationalist
interests with an international populist movement.

The American strategist showed his “true caliber” by expounding modern methods of political freedom through
blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies, Stamper said, leaving many of his hearers behind. Bannon has
demonstrated that if the right wants to rule the future, “it must dominate modern themes and rhetorically
position them,” he added.

Aspiring to be far more than an uncle who tells stories to his nephews of how he won the fight for the White
House, Stamper writes, “Bannon wants to become the super godfather of the international right.”

Although Bannon often looks a bit disheveled, “he should not be underestimated,” the writer warns. Past
business partners attribute impressive “strategic foresight” to the eccentric tactician, saying he was often “three
or four steps ahead” of his opponents in business. Because of his phenomenal memory, his nickname is “the
encyclopedia,” Stamper notes with a certain reverence, and in his speeches he will spontaneously cite “forgotten
thinkers, known only to a handful of specialists.”

“Bannon brings with him exclusive knowledge of power from the very heart of power,” Stamper writes, which
he will bring to bear on Europe’s fragmented populist populism.

According to Stamper, Bannon has established his “European headquarters” in Italy, from where he intends to
galvanize European populists.

The Italian political situation is completely to his liking, Stamper declares, with a political landscape
“dominated by populists, right-wing ideologues and the political puppeteer Berlusconi.”

implemented the same idea, in a much more comprehensive way than I had!) I suggested
that partners write out their fantasies and email them to each other, or write out
descriptions of their mutual sexual experiences -- long accounts, describing how they felt
about everything and what sticks out in their minds -- and send those to each other, too,
so they can get each others’ perspectives on what they've done.

(By the way, I still offer a much-improved version of that workshop on my list of events,
lectures, and workshops, just in case you're interested in bringing me in....)

God, it's so hard to talk about what we want. It's even hard to talk about talking about
what we want. I mean, it's hard enough to figure out what we want in the first place -- but
communicating it... eeek! And it's worth noting that this is not just a problem of having
good sex. As was pointed out recently on the blog for the wonderful sex-positive
anthology Yes Means Yes!:

[There is a] need to demystify and destigmatize communication about sex. If we can't talk
about what we like and what we want, we will always have problems making clear what
it is we're consenting to. If we can't be frank about what we do want, we put a lot of
weight on the need to communicate what we don't.

Giving everyone great sexual communication skills doesn't just give us all better sex -- it
fights rape. There's a noble cause for you!

... SO, that's my five-pointed analysis. And that's what I'm pushing for. My goals are not
Just to get people thinking that sex is awesome and sexual freedom is important. It's
going to be hard, and it's going to be an uphill battle, but I'm hoping that I can not only
help out with sexual liberation -- I'm hoping to improve it.

COMMUNICATION:

[theory] Sex Communication Tactic Derived From S&M: The
Annotated Safeword

As soon as I started researching S&M and thinking critically about the communication
tactics promoted in the S&M community, I realized that there were a lot of really
important lessons wrapped up in those tactics -- lessons that could be deconstructed and
applied to all kinds of sexuality. From the beginning, I planned to do a series of posts on

than indictment, including non-prosecution and deferred
prosecution agreements, may be appropriate in certain cir-
cumstances. Nine factors are considered in conducting an
investigation, determining whether to charge a corporation,
and negotiating plea or other agreements:

e the nature and seriousness of the offense, including
the risk of harm to the public;

e the pervasiveness of wrongdoing within the corpo-
ration, including the complicity in, or the condon-
ing of, the wrongdoing by corporate management;

e the corporation’s history of similar misconduct,
including prior criminal, civil, and regulatory
enforcement actions against it;

e the corporation’s timely and voluntary disclosure of
wrongdoing and its willingness to cooperate in the
investigation of its agents;

e the existence and effectiveness of the corporation’s
pre-existing compliance program;

e the corporation’s remedial actions, including any
efforts to implement an effective corporate compli-
ance program or improve an existing one, replace
responsible management, discipline or terminate
wrongdoers, pay restitution, and cooperate with the
relevant government agencies;

e collateral consequences, including whether there
is disproportionate harm to shareholders, pension
holders, employees, and others not proven person-
ally culpable, as well as impact on the public arising
from the prosecution;

e the adequacy of the prosecution of individuals
responsible for the corporation’s malfeasance; and

e the adequacy of remedies such as civil or regulatory
enforcement actions.

As these factors illustrate, in many investigations it
will be appropriate for a prosecutor to consider a corpora-
tion’s pre-indictment conduct, including voluntary disclo-
sure, cooperation, and remediation, in determining whether
to seek an indictment. In assessing a corporation's coopera-
tion, prosecutors are prohibited from requesting attorney-

client privileged materials with two exceptions—when a

corporation or its employee asserts an advice-of-counsel
defense and when the attorney-client communications were
in furtherance of a crime or fraud. Otherwise, an organi-
zation’s cooperation may only be assessed on the basis of
whether it disclosed the relevant facts underlying an inves-
tigation—and not on the basis of whether it has waived its

attorney-client privilege or work product protection.”!

What Does SEC Consider When
Deciding Whether to Open an
Investigation or Bring Charges?

SEC’s Enforcement Manual, published by SEC’s
Enforcement Division and available on SEC’s website,”
sets forth information about how SEC conducts inves-
tigations, as well as the guiding principles that SEC staff
considers when determining whether to open or close an
investigation and whether civil charges are merited. There
are various ways that potential FCPA violations come to
the attention of SEC staff, including: tips from informants
or whistleblowers; information developed in other inves-
tigations; self-reports or public disclosures by companies;
referrals from other offices or agencies; public sources, such
as media reports and trade publications; and proactive
investigative techniques, including risk-based initiatives.
Investigations can be formal, such as where SEC has issued
a formal order of investigation that authorizes its staff to
issue investigative subpoenas for testimony and documents,
or informal, such as where the staff proceeds with the inves-
tigation without the use of investigative subpoenas.

In determining whether to open an investigation and,
if so, whether an enforcement action is warranted, SEC
staff considers a number of factors, including: the statutes
or rules potentially violated; the egregiousness of the poten-
tial violation; the potential magnitude of the violation;
whether the potentially harmed group is particularly vul-
nerable or at risk; whether the conduct is ongoing; whether
the conduct can be investigated efficiently and within the
statute of limitations period; and whether other authorities,
including federal or state agencies or regulators, might be

better suited to investigate the conduct. SEC staff also may

sexual exploitation, national sovereignty, and support for Israel.” (Emphasis added)

Its leader, Penny Nance, has called for Acosta’s resignation. Noting that labor trafficking,
which the Labor Department combats, is often conjoined with sex trafficking, Nance says
that President Trump would not have nominated Acosta if reports fully describing Acosta’s
conduct in the Epstein case had emerged earlier.

Sen. Ben Sasse has also weighed in. He sent a letter to the Justice Department asking it to
investigate its treatment of Epstein, including the fact that the plea deal ensured that victims
of the pervert would be denied the ability to comment on or object to the leniency of his
sentence. Sasse is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Oversight,
Agency Action, Federal Rights and Federal Courts.

Sen. Marco Rubio, a longtime supporter of Acosta, says it would be “very troubling” if
political influence led to a light sentence for Epstein. In Rubio’s view, and that of every
rational person, Epstein “should have been in jail for a long time.” Rubio added, however,
that he will reserve judgment until he hears Acosta’s side.

That’s fair. But so far, Acosta has provided no real defense for letting Epstein off so lightly.
In public, at least, he is standing by his argument that the deal was a reasonable one and that
this is old news.

Previously, Acosta had a different defense. He cited “a year-long assault on the prosecution
and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars” who represented Epstein. This
allegedly included “defense counsel investigat[ing] individual prosecutors and their
families, looking for personal peccadilloes that may provide a basis for disqualification.” In
this account, the deal was made to relieve the pressure, while still getting a conviction.

Acosta could hardly assert this explanation — 1.e., that he wimped out — while seeking a
cabinet position with the expectation of being appointed to more exalted jobs in the future.
Nor is the explanation particularly plausible. Acosta isn’t the first prosecutor to face a
scorched earth defense. Ask Ken Starr about this.

I don’t doubt that Acosta regarded escaping the wrath of the defense team as a benefit of
reaching the plea deal. But I don’t believe this was incentive enough to cause him, in effect,
to throw the case.

What was the true incentive? As I wrote when this story broke, I think it was the same
incentive that explains much of his conduct in public life — Acosta’s desire to
accommodate people he thinks can help him down the road.

Which people? Probably the lawyers at Kirkland and Ellis, where Acosta had once worked.

Epstein enlisted Ken Starr* and Jay Lefkowitz, both of Kirkland, for his defense team.
Acosta reportedly worked out the terms of his surrender with Lefkowitz, a former
colleague, at a meeting in a location far away from the prosecutor’s office.

Sinai, said that the fliers had been distributed outside mosques after
Friday prayers by men who covered their faces with scarves.

Several days later, another purported al Qaeda flier appeared around
el-Arish -- this time announcing that the organization was planning to
attack police stations on Aug. 12. For the Egyptian security services,
that was one provocation too far. On that day, stunned residents of el-
Arish woke to find thousands of troops from the Egyptian 2nd Army,
accompanied by police officers and border guards, deployed in an
anti-terror crackdown in Sinai. The operation's first phase entailed
securing government buildings, police stations, and the el-Arish
prison. The offensive started on Aug. 15, as one Egyptian militant
was killed and 12 were arrested, according Hazem al-Maadawi, a
police officer involved in the operation. State news agency EgyNews
said authorities are targeting 15 more people who participated in
attacks at the el-Arish police station, including members of the al
Qaeda-affiliated Palestinian group Jaish al-Islam. These extremist
rumblings have frayed nerves in the Israeli government, which had
already been skeptical of the Egyptian revolution. Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a Knesset committee on May. 30,
Global terrorist organizations are meddling [in Sinai] and their
presence is increasing because of the connection between Sinai and
Gaza. If there is any hope of restoring order to Sinai, it lies in a
historic rapprochement between the Bedouins and the Egyptian
security forces to drive out these unwanted interlopers. Bedouins
have signaled their willingness to help restore security, but are also
calling on the Egyptian government to do its part by finally
integrating them into Egypt's social fabric. We will not let a single
Palestinian suspected of ill intentions into Sinai after the attacks,
said Muhammed al-Ahmar, a Bedouin and human rights activist.
But, we are fed up with empty promises, and if the police mentality
does not change, then nothing will work. It's time for Sinai to flourish

Couric: Can you think of any?

Palin: Well, I could think of .. . any again, that could be best
dealt with on a more local level. Maybe I would take issue
with. But, you know, as mayor, and then as governor
and even as a vice president, if I’m so privileged to serve,
wouldn't be in a position of changing those things but in
supporting the law of the land as it reads today.

So little of what Palin says makes sense that this interview was seen as a
national embarrassment, provoking multiple explanations for it from
the Palin camp, none of which said: She is just stupid and ignorant.

Obviously that is what her detractors were thinking. But is it true?
Is she stupid and ignorant? How can we find out? Look at this next
piece of the Couric interview:

Couric: .. . people have questioned your readiness since that
interview. And I’m curious to hear your reaction.

Palin: Well, not only am I ready but willing and able to serve as
vice president with Senator McCain if Americans so bless us
and privilege us with the opportunity of serving them, ready
with my executive experience as a city mayor and manager,
as a governor, as a commissioner, a regulator of oil and gas,
not only with my résumé proving that readiness, but I think
the important thing here is that John McCain and I, we share
a vision for America that includes energy independence.

What could be clearer than the idea that she is simply out of her
league and that it was a foolish idea to promote her as a possible vice
president? Why cynical politicians decide this is OK to do is not my
problem. The question I want to address is what makes one intelli-
gent, apart from genetics.

Looking at what we have seen here, we can think about our 12
cognitive processes one more time. Which of them are critical to the
everyday assessment of the intelligence of another person that most
people do on a daily basis?

Let’s start by eliminating some. Being able to evaluate something,
or having a set of values you believe in, has very little to do with basic
intelligence. The samples of stupidity that I cite above do not indicate
that any of this ability—determining what is important—is missing in
the people being interviewed.

dearth of women and minorities in science. “Science itself overcomes misogyny and prejudice and bias,” you
said. “It’s built in: Questioning yourself, always questioning results, questioning others, relying on empirical
evidence.”

° You have clashed with some skeptics over your defense of Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire financier who in
2008 was convicted for soliciting prostitution from underage girls, and spent 13 months in a Florida jail.

° Through his private foundation, Epstein has funded the work of several prominent scientists. He has
provided funding for your Origins Project, supporting lectureship and scholarship programs, most recently
pledging $100,000 in 2014.

° In April 2011, you told the Daily Beast: “As a scientist | always judge things on empirical evidence and
he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I’ve never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my
presumption is that whatever the problems were | would believe him over other people.”

° In a blog comment about the Epstein controversy, you wrote: “I remain skeptical, and | support a man
whose character | believe I know...If you want to condemn me for that, so be it.”

° You were made an honorary member of CFI’s board of directors in December 2011.

is always all around one like the air one

what works for the greater number of
people? What if the former imaginative
capacities are hard to cultivate, and

of concentration or inward focus that
many people lack? Might beliefs be
easier for most people to hold in mind

occasional perusal of a prayer book

The common name of an individual sometimes significantly differs from the complete, formal name
present in Encyclopedia Britannica and Wikipedia. This encyclopedia full name can contain details such
as titles, initials and military or nobility standings, which are not commonly used when referring to
individual in most publications. Even in simpler cases, when the full name contains only first, middle and
last names, there exists no systematic convention on which names to use when talking about an
individual. Henry David Thoreau is most commonly referred to by his full name, not “Henry Thoreau” nor
“David Thoreau”, whereas Oliver Joseph Lodge is mentioned by his first and last name “Oliver Lodge”,
not his full name “Oliver Joseph Lodge’.

Given a full name with complex structure potentially containing details such as titles, initials, nobility rights
and ranks, in addition to multiple first and last names, we must extract a list of simple names, using three
words at most, which can potentially be used to refer to this individual. This set of names is created by
generating combinations of names found in the raw name. Furthermore, whenever they appear we
systematically exclude common words such as titles or ranks from these names. The query name sets of
several individuals are displayed in Table $10.

5) For every record, using the set of raw names, create a set of query names. Query names
are (2,3) grams which will be used in order to measure the fame of the individual. The following
procedure is iterated on every raw name variant associated with the record. Steps for which the
record type is not specified are carried out for both.

a. For Encyclopedia Britannica records, truncate the raw name at the second comma,
reorder so that the part of name preceding the first comma follows that succeeding the
comma.

For Wikipedia records, replace the underscores with whitespaces.

Truncate the name string at the first (if any) parenthesis or comma.

d. Truncate the name string at the beginning of the words ‘in’, ’In’, the’, The’, ‘of and ‘Of, if
these are present.

e. Create the last name set. Iterating from last to first in the words of the name, add the first
name with the following properties:

i. Begin with a capitalized letter.

ii, Longer than 1 character.

iff. Not ending in a period.

iv. If the words preceding this last name are identified as a prefix (‘von', ‘de’, 'van',

‘der’, 'de' , ‘d”, ‘al-', ‘la’, ‘da’, 'the', ‘le’, ‘du’, 'bin', 'y’, ‘ion’ and their capitalized
versions ), the last name is a 2gram containing both the prefix.

f, If the last name contains a capitalized character besides the first one, add a variant of
this word where the only capital letter is the first to the set of last names.

g. Create the set of first names. Iterating on the raw name elements which are not part of
the last name set, candidate first names are words with the following properties :

i. Begin with a capital letter.

ii. Longer than 1 character.

iii. Not ending in a period.

iv. Not a title. Archduke’, ‘Saint’, 'Emperor', 'Empress', 'Mademoiselle’, 'Mother',

‘Brother’, 'Sister', ‘Father’, 'Mr', 'Mrs', 'Marshall', ‘Justice’, 'Cardinal', 'Archbishop',

was Sealed. Mussolini's fate was sealed. As for the Japanese, they would be ground

Ground to a powder. This was symmetry at its most pounding and decisive. Mass
against mass. This was a picture of power that seemed undeniable in its pure logic.
Until now.

ay

So how should we think about power in our own age? What picture best captures its
vibrant, unceasing demands?

It might be tempting now, as a first pass, to say we've left that world of purely
symmetric, mass-against-mass power behind. After all, a few figures, anywhere in
the system, can exert massive and even fatal, collapsing pressure. One clever hacker,
one terrorist, one hedge fund manager with a bad idea, even one purely accidental
mis-connection - never before has so much power accumulated in systems so
vulnerable to single slips. And our massive power - the US Army or our economy -
is hardly decisive despite its weight. It seems now that something can grow bigger
and weaker. A nation may have an ever-larger GDP, but if itis miswired somehow, if
its social or legal or youthful connections misfire a bit, then it may be still more
vulnerable. But this “power of a pinprick” asymmetry is not the whole story. Just
when the network looks like a way to tie together all sorts of small, even isolated
forces and bless them with decisive power, we notice something else. Tremendous,
even historic and undeniably massive concentrations of power. Platforms like
Facebook, software systems like Microsoft or search centers like Google are sort of
dense, impossible-to-replace gold mines. Google answers questions for more than
50% of the world every day. Is it the most powerful company in human history? Is
Facebook? And is their power widely distributed? Or is it concentrated in the
algorithms and cloud data of these firms? Anyhow, they are among the first of a
totally new species of firm.

The leap we have to make in understanding our networked age - and by this I don’t
just mean the Internet, but really any connected system you'd care to consider -
begins with this idea: On connected systems, power is defined by both profound
concentration and by massive distribution. It can’t be understood in simple either/or
terms. Power and influence may yet become even more concentrated than it was in

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016128.txt,"Spending path is unclear and is flattish (excluding NTP costs) in the best case
The spending path targeted or assumed by the NTP is unclear and does not appear to
match realized outturns. It may suggest that spending is likely to remain flattish,
excluding NTP costs. However, the indicative level spending would settle at is around
peak 2014 expenditures levels and well above the 2015 realized spending and 2016
budgeted levels. While 2015 spending could have been understated and may be revised
higher, at least SAR88bn from the 2015 spending is non-recurrent as it relates to the
one-off Saudi Royal edicts decreed upon King Salman’s accession.

Going by the indicated 2020 target for the share of the wage bill in total spending, this
would suggest that government spending is targeted at SAR1,140bn in 2020. This
represents a 2.7% increase over peak 2014 spending levels and 16.5% increase over
2015 actual spending levels. Excluding the NTP annual costs, this suggests that
government spending should still increase by 11% over 2015 levels and drop by 2% over
2014 spending in nominal terms.

In our view, given the lack of precise spending targets, one way of remaining consistent
is to use the two NTP figures for wages and infer the NTP fiscal spending from the
stated share of wages in total expenditures. This would suggest that fiscal expenditures
would reach SAR1,140bn in 2020, from SAR1,067bn in the base year (unstated in the
NTP). This is a 6.8% increase, but excluding the NTP costs, is just 1.8% higher. As such,
in the best case scenario, we think the NTP suggests flattish spending, excluding NTP
costs. If we instead take the NTP level of spending inferred to be the correct amount,
this would materially widen the fiscal deficit by SAR190bn (8.0% of GDP) and would be
deeply negative for the sustainability of the fiscal and Fx stance, in our view.

Fiscal adjustment burden shifts to raising revenue, oil prices and exports

The possible flattish spending implication of the NTP would tend to indicate that the
bulk of the spending cuts are now beyond us. Government projects are likely to continue
to be prioritized, likely according to their economic benefits and relevance to the NTP.
Flattish spending will thus shift the burden of forthcoming fiscal adjustment on raising
non-oil revenues, raising hydrocarbon exports and a sustained recovery in oil prices.

Judge: Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein
agreement to remain sealed

By MICHELE DARGAN

Palm Beach Daily News Staff Writer

Tuesday, February 17, 2009

A federal judge has ruled that a non-prosecution document under which the government agreed not to pursue

ederal charges against sex offender Jeffrey Epstein will remain under seal - at least for now.

The U.S. Attorney's Office and Epstein's lawyers reached the agreement before Epstein pleaded guilty to state
‘elony charges, and the document is under seal in Epstein's state criminal file.

Representing two of Epstein's victims, attorney Brad Edwards asked to have the document unsealed as part of his
ederal lawsuit against the Manhattan money manager. Although Edwards and his victims have seen the
agreement, Edwards says in his pleadings that the government has inaccurately described the agreement ...
creating a false impression that the agreement protects the victims.”

U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra ruled that the claims, even if true, haven't damaged Edwards’ case.

If and when such alleged mischaracterizations become relevant to an issue to be decided by the court, the parties
will be given the opportunity to advance their positions and the court will resolve the issue,” he wrote. If disclosure
of the agreement will be required for the court to resolve this issue, appropriate disclosure will be ordered.”

Seeking to keep the agreement sealed, Assistant U.S. Attorney Dexter Lee argued that the agreement is not part of
any case before Marra.

The non-prosecution agreement has never been filed under seal in federal court,” he wrote.

He also denied that the agreement has been inaccurately described.

Marra sided with Lee on the argument that the agreement was not filed in federal court under seal or otherwise.”

On Aug. 14, Marra ruled that the non-prosecution agreement would be unsealed for Edwards and any of the victims
who want to see it. But the ruling bars Edwards and anyone else who sees the document from disclosing the terms
to anyone else.

In his motion to unseal, Edwards said he wants to be able to discuss the terms of the agreement with other victims
and their attorneys as well as with other victims' rights groups such as the National Alliance of Victims’ Rights
Attorneys.

The desire to discuss the agreement with third parties is not justification for unsealing the document, Marra ruled.

If a specific tangible need arises in a civil case ... relief should be sought in that case,” he wrote.

Epstein, 56, is serving 18 months in jail for soliciting prostitution and procuring a minor for prostitution.

Under the agreement, federal prosecutors will defer their decision on whether to prosecute Epstein on federal
charges until 90 days after Epstein completes all requirements of his state sentence.

If he abides by all court conditions and restrictions, the federal case would be dropped.

In addition to the state criminal case, there are nine federal and seven state lawsuits pending against Epstein.

All contain similar allegations: The Manhattan money manager, through his employees and assistants, brought
minor girls to his Palm Beach home at 358 El Brillo Way for erotic massages and sometimes sex.

e The tax code includes a withholding tax provision that discriminates against foreign
investors (PRS Group 2002, PRS Group 2003, PRS Group, 2005, PRS Group, 2009;
USAID, 2006).

As a tule, investment in “sensitive” sectors, such as electricity, water and telecommunications
require special government concession. Investment in the public health sector requires
authorization from the Ministry of Public Health and Population. Investment in agriculture is
subject to the Ministry of Agriculture’s approval. Exploiting mineral and energy resources require
permits from the Office of Mining and Energy. Besides, natural resources are considered as the
property of the country (PRS Group, 2009; Schaaf, 2009).

Haiti after the Earthquake in 2010

The January 12, 2010 earthquake had inflicted massive human and financial damage to the country.
The natural disaster damaged homes, commercial & government buildings, cities infrastructure, and
took many people lives. The estimated monetary loss is $11.5 billion (U.S. Department of State,
2010).

According to the World Bank report (2010), 70% of the total damage and losses were done in the
private sector. Therefore, this has lead to the loss of production, reduction in revenues, loss of jobs
and wages, increase in production cost, etc. Additionally, the job market experienced 8.5 % of pre-
earthquake jobs decrease due to devastation.

Ninety percent of businesses are informal in Haiti; ninety-five percent of businesses are SME (Small
and Medium sized Enterprise). Business people indicated having various problems due to the
natural disaster. Some of them lost their houses and facilities; therefore, they do not have money
for rebuilding all the facilities. However, a vast majority of businesses do not pay taxes and do not
contribute to the countries’ official GDP (Investment Facilitation centre, 2010).

Government Role in Economy

Generally, government’s role in the economy is minimal. There are several government subsidies
and price controls; however, goods are mainly traded at market prices. Considering the fact that
there are over 70 % of imports in Haiti, the Haitian government has eliminated tariffs and non-
tariff barriers in order to liberalize trade (CIA, 2010; World Bank, 2010; PRS Group, 2009).

At the same time, there is a project for creating several trade free zones and exclusion from the
taxes of the foreign investors (PRS Group, 2009.

TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031725.txt,"﻿Gloria Allred Says More Women Are Contacting Her About Trump
Misconduct
Gloria Allred in New York City in June 2016 (Getty Images)
Donald Trump's disgusting behavior towards women has ranged from fat-shaming to allegations of sexual
harassment, and, as we heard in the infamous hot mic audio from a 2005 Access Hollywood segment,
even sexual assault: You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful—I just start kissing them. It’s like
a magnet... And when you're a star, they let you do it, you can do anything. Grab 'em by the pussy.
Unsurprisingly, allegations are flying about much more dirty laundry yet to be aired, with reporters
chasing down possibly damaging evidence and looking for other victims.
Gloria Allred, the civil rights lawyer who takes on high-profile targets, like Bill Cosby, Roman Polanski
and, yes, Trump, confirmed to us that since the Access Hollywood tape's release, she has been contacted
by women who allege inappropriate contact by Mr. Trump.
More to the point, Allred discussed how Trump's words suggest criminal behavior. If there is an
unwanted or unconsented to touching of a person’s intimate parts such as the genital areas or a woman’s
breasts, that could constitute a sexual assault or a sexual battery, she explained yesterday. She added that
when Rudy Giuliani was asked on Sunday's political programs if Donald Trump was describing a sexual
assault on the recently released 2005 video, he responded, 'That’s what he was talking about.' Allred said,
I am disgusted by what Donald Trump said and admitted that he had done on that video. An apology is
not enough.
The Access Hollywood tape was discovered after the AP's report featuring former crew members on
Trump's reality show, The Apprentice, describing his demeaning behavior towards women; in one
example, he allegedly judges female contestants' breast sizes and discusses which women he'd want to
have sex with. Allred released a statement last week, citing the numerous sexual harassment lawsuits and
his lecherous behavior: If Mr. Trump were to be elected president he would be the employer of the largest
workforce in the country, federal government employees. Mr. Trump in that role would be sending a
message through his past words and actions that sexual harassment of women in the workplace is
acceptable and this could lead to other employers believing that they can follow Mr. Trump’s lead and
openly sexually harass their female employees, thereby creating and condoning a hostile workplace for
working women.
We need a President who respects the rights of women in the workplace not someone who creates
a hostile and sexist environment for women who work and not someone like Mr. Trump who
believes pregnancy is an inconvenience for employers; and who enables sexism.
I call on Donald Trump to release all of his employees and former employees from their nondisclosure
clauses so that they can tell the public what they suffered when they had the
unfortunate experience of working for Donald Trump, and I urge him to promise not to retaliate
against them if they tell the truth.
Donald Trump once made a remark to TMZ about me. He said Gloria would be very very
impressed which TMZ suggested in the context of the interview with him meant that I would be
impressed with his penis.
No Donald, I wouldn’t. What would impress me would be having Hillary Rodham Clinton in the
White House, not a man who blatantly denigrates women in the workplace.
Allred, a Clinton supporter, was a delegate at the Democratic National Convention. She successfully fought
Trump and the Miss Universe pageant to allow transgender contestant Jenna Talackova to compete in the
Miss Universe Canada event. During the DNC, Allred told Variety, I know the only way to beat Trump is
to confront him, head on and to refuse to let him get away with his bullying behavior. I think people want
someone to stand up and confront him. I think a strong approach with Trump is warranted and that
Hillary is more than capable of fighting back and winning this battle.

outtakes.

On June 14, 2005, Detective Michelle Pagan contacted me and advised

Detective Pagan requested that I begin en pulls for the purpose of
gathering evidence and intelligence.

I made contact with Town of Palm Beach Sanitation Office Supervisor
Tony Higgins and requested trash pulls for 358 El Brillo Way to begin
on June 15, 2005.

On June 15, 2005, I met with a sanitation employee. I observed the
employee enter the driveway of 358 El Brillo Way and collect the trash

area at which time I collected the trash bags from the sanitation
truck. I transported the trash bags to the sanitation department,

where I sifted through its contents. The trash yielded negative
results and no evidence was collected.

No further trash was collected throughout the week due to the fact
that Epstein s security gates remained closed throughout the week;
therefore, the sanitation employees were unable to gain access onto
the property for collection of the trash.

car crashes and the weather. Though
retaining personal characteristics such as
love or anger, God operates less like an
individual human person with limited
reach and partial interests, and more like
light, air or gravity do—quite
pervasively and constantly.

Usually one side or the other
comes to the fore in the way Christians
feel connected to God: for some
Christians the personal side of God is
central; for others, the more impersonal.
Thus, some Christians expect God to be
very much like a human friend, offering
companionship and good advice.“ As
Tanya Luhrmann explores in her essay,
their religious lives often revolve around
the internal sensory or imaginative
experiences that make a God of that sort
seem real to them--the sense that God is
in the room with them, that God speaks
to them, and so on. They work to
cultivate a prayer life that heightens the
vividness of those experiences and
thereby allays doubts about the actual
existence of this invisible, otherwise
seemingly unreal, divine friend. In short,
good practitioners of prayer gain a
stronger and more reliable sense that
God is present as a friend directing the
course of their lives.

Other Christians have
expectations of a more overarching and
impersonal sort about the way God is a
force in their lives; these expectations, I
suggest below, are the consequence of
their holding certain beliefs about God
as the creator, sustainer, and savior of
the world. In this case a strong sense of
God’s presence in one’s life does not
depend on having experiences of a
literally personal sort or on developing
the spiritual practices that help cultivate
such experiences. The sense that God is
present as an influence on one’s life is

rather something one feels all the time
simply in virtue of the beliefs one holds
about God and the world. Given a
particular construal of those beliefs—a
relatively impersonal one, I argue—
simply having those beliefs in mind,
with some awareness of their quite
obvious presuppositions and
implications, makes clear one is never
alone, never a self-sufficient operator. In
contrast to the understanding of God as
friend, here God’s invisibility does not
threaten to interrupt a sense of God’s
presence and influence. God’s
invisibility to the contrary enables the
sense of God’s presence and influence to
be the routine backdrop of all one’s
experience, to constitute a general
outlook on the world, no matter what the
circumstances.

Belief in Creation as a Backdrop to
the Whole of Life

For example, a common
Christian construal of the belief that God
is the creator of the world makes it
possible for the sense that God is with
one—one’s supporter and sustainer—to
be a constant feature of one’s life as a
whole. Contrary to first impressions,
God’s creation of the world need not
refer to the origin of the universe, or to
the beginning of its more specific
features or components. Were either to
be its meaning, belief in God as the
creator of the world could not be a very
central component of a generally
applicable Christian outlook, of much
relevance, that is, for more than the
occasional speculation about origins:
e.g., why am I here at all? The belief
concerns instead a causal dependence
upon God of a more continuous sort,
spanning, in short, the whole time of the
universe’s existence and therefore the
whole time of one’s individual life. To
be created by God is to exist in a relation

Cadogan Tate Sponsors ‘New Sensations’ Art Exhibition
(PRWEB) October 17, 2010

Cadogan Tate, the world class art moving, storage and shipping specialist in contemporary art, has sponsored the
‘New Sensations 2010’ exhibition for UK art students. Organised by Channel 4 and The Saatchi Gallery, this
prestigious event aims to discover the most imaginative and talented artists graduating from BA and MA courses
in the UK and to support students leaving art college.

A total of 20 students were shortlisted to present their work in the exhibition. This is being held at Boswall House,
2 Cornwall Terrace - a magnificent 18th century building off Regent’s Park - from 14th to 20th October. The event
forms part of ‘The House of the Nobleman’, under the curatorship of Wolfe von Lenkiewicz and Victoria
Golembiovskaya.

Four of the finalists in New Sensations 2010 - Pablo Wendel, Katie Surridge, Nika Neelova and Ula Wiznerowicz -
have each been given a bursary to develop a new work for the exhibition. A short film about each of them was
aired on Channel 4 in early October.

Stephen Glynn, Cadogan Tate’s Fine Art Director, comments: “We are delighted to be the sponsors of this
important exhibition, which showcases the talent of some remarkable young artists. We have spent many years
transporting and storing the world's most precious contemporary art for leading museums, galleries and
collectors. It therefore seemed very appropriate that we should support and encourage the UK’s leading art
students through this exciting event.”

From the website of the OED we can read that the “number of word forms defined and/or illustrated” is
615,100; and that we find 169,000 “italicized-bold phrases and combinations”.

Therefore, we estimate an upper bound of the number of unique 1-grams defined by this dictionary as
615,100-169,000 which is approximately 446,000.

I1I.4B. Estimation of Lexicon Size

How frequent does a 1-gram have to be in order to be considered a word? We chose a minimum
frequency threshold for ‘common’ 1-grams by attempting to identify the largest frequency decile that
remains lower than the frequency of most dictionary words.

We plotted a histogram showing the frequency of the 1-grams defined in AHD4, as measured in our year
2000 lexicon. We found that 90% of 1-gram headwords had a frequency greater than 10°, but only 70%
were more frequent than 10°. Therefore, the frequency 10° is a reasonable threshold for inclusion in the
lexicon.

To estimate the number of words, we began by generating the list of common 1-grams with a higher
chronological resolution, namely 11 different time points from 1900 until 2000 (1900, 1910, 1920, ... 2000)
as described above. We next excluded all 1-grams with non-alphabetical characters in order to produce a
list of common alphabetical forms for each time point.

For three of the time points (1900, 1950, 2000), we took a random sample of 1000 alphabetical forms
from the resulting set of alphabetical forms. These were classified by a native English speaker with no
knowledge of the analyses being performed. The results of the classification are found in Appendix. We
asked the speaker to classify the candidate words were classified into 8 categories:

M if the word is a misspelling or a typo or seems like gibberish*

N if the word derives primarily from a personal or a company name

P for any other kind of proper nouns

H if the word has lost its original hyphen

F if the word is a foreign word not generally used in English sentences

B if it is a ‘borrowed’ foreign word that is often used in English sentences
R for anything that does not fall into the above categories

U unclassifiable for some reason

We computed the fraction of these 1000 words at each time point that were classified as P, N, B, or R,
which we call the ‘word fraction for year X’, or WFy. To compute the estimated lexicon size for 1900,
1950, and 2000, we multiplied the word fraction by the number of alphabetical forms in those years.

For the other 8 time points, we did not perform a separate sampling step. Instead, we estimated the word
fraction by linearly interpolating the word fraction of the nearest sampled time points; i.e., the word
fraction in 1920 satisfied WF 4929=. WF 1999+ .4* (WF 1950.- WF 1900). We then multiplied the word fraction by the
number of alphabetical forms in the corresponding year, as above.

For the year 2000 lexicon, we repeated the sampling and annotation process using a different native
speaker. The results were similar, which confirmed that our findings were independent of the person
doing the annotation.

We note that the trends shown in Fig 2A are similar when proper nouns (N) are excluded from the lexicon
(i.e., the only categories are P, B and R). Figure S7 shows the estimates of the lexicon excluding the
category ‘N’ (proper nouns).

* A typo is a one-time typing error by someone who presumably knows the correct spelling (as in
improtant); a misspelling, which generally has the same pronunciation as the correct spelling, arises when
a person is ignorant of the correct spelling (as in abberation).

highly-connected systems shared what Holland labeled an “evolving structure” -
they never stayed the same. They seemed to shift, with an easy plasticity, in
response to internal pressures or external changes. In the process, they took on new
forms. In many cases, they became better, stronger, more adaptively fit. It wasn’t
simply that the unexpected appeared, it was that the systems were evolving. We
talked earlier about how political and economic ideas like serfdom or divine right
fade into history as new forms - a congress, a stock market - are born to replace old
ones. Holland thought the world filled with such evolutions, no different than
species adjusting (or not) to a hotter climate or some fast new predator. He called
the networks that produce these sorts of innovations “Complex Adaptive Systems”.

When Holland chose the word “complex” he was making an important distinction.
Complicated mechanisms can be designed, predicted and controlled. Jet engines,
artificial hearts or your calculator are complicated in this sense. They may contain
billions of interacting parts, but they can be laid out and repeatedly, predictably
made and used. They don’t change. Complex systems, by contrast, can’t be so
precisely engineered or guessed at with much real certainty. They are hard to fully
control. Human immunology is complex, in this sense. The World Wide Web is
complex. A rainforest is complex: It is made up of uncountable buzzing, connecting
bugs and birds and trees.1!4 Order, to the extent it exists in the Amazon basin,
emerges moment-by-moment from countless, constant interactions. The uneven
symphonic sound of L’heure Blue, that romantic stopping point at dawn when the
night retreats bug by bug and you can hear the forest wakeing bird by bird is the
sound of complexity engaging in a never-the-same-twice phase transition.

The word “complex” comes to us from the Latin world plex, which nods at the
interwoven, layered nature of any object!!3. What looks simple - a flower, our skin,
the value of a dollar bill - is in fact plexus, loaded with twitches and influences. In
that stitching of new links, countless interactions sort of inevitably hiccup into
unexpected states and ideas and objects: financial panics or disease epidemics,
banks and revolutions. Traffic during rush hour is a complex system like this - the
atomic, moving bits of the system, of cars and pedestrians and bicycles together
determine the ultimate state of the system: jammed or no. Los Angles at 5 p.m. ona
Friday isn’t designed centrally; it’s honking and confused and aggravated rush hour
logic appears - slightly different every day - from interaction. . As any system fills
out with more actors and more types of connection, it becomes more complex and
harder to predict. Complicated systems don’t produce uncertainty in this same way;
appealingly, they just run. Strapping a complicated object to the wing of a passenger
plane makes sense, even if it takes decades of refinement to real reliability. A
complex object? Not so wise.

victims be treated with fairness. This is a broad provision intended to be broadly construed and to give victims a right to due
process. As Senator Kyl has stated,

The broad rights articulated in this section are meant to be rights themselves and are not intended to just be aspirational. One of
these rights is the right to be treated with fairness. Of course, fairness includes the notion of due process. Too often victims of
crime experience a secondary victimization at the hands of the criminal justice system. This provision is intended to direct
Government agencies and employees, whether they are in executive or judicial branches, to treat victims of crime with the
respect they deserve and to afford them due process. 7°?

[*883] Clearly, Congress intended to afford crime victims a broad right to due process in criminal proceedings. Due process,
of course, uncontroversially includes a right to be heard. 7!° Thus, victims should be heard before the court makes a transfer
decision.

Concluding that victims have a right to be heard on transfer decision does not mean, of course, that they will dictate the transfer
decision. In some cases, the defendant will be able to establish sufficiently pervasive prejudice in a particular community to
entitle him to a change of venue to protect his constitutional rights. *!! But the limited point here is that victims may provide
an important perspective that the judge ought to consider in reaching a decision. Moreover, even if the judge decides to transfer
a case, the victims may have valuable information for the judge on where to transfer the case to (e.g., to an adjacent state rather

the New Jersey Supreme Court. In Timmendequas, the trial judge imported a jury from a distant community rather than force
the family of a murdered young girl to travel to another district. Construing New Jersey state law provisions similar to the
CVRA's, the New Jersey Supreme Court explained that the trial judge properly considered the views of the victim's family:

An illustration of the general approach of the proposed rule comes from State v. Timmendequas,

Over the past decade, both nationwide and in New Jersey, a significant amount of legislation has been passed implementing
increased levels of protection for victims of crime. Specifically, in New Jersey, the Legislature enacted the Crime Victim's Bill
of Rights. That amendment marked the culmination of the Legislature's efforts to increase the participation of crime victims in
the criminal justice system.

[*884]

The purpose of the Victim's Rights Amendment was to enhance and protect the necessary role of crime victims and witnesses
in the criminal justice process. In furtherance of [that goal], the improved treatment of these persons should be assured through
the establishment of specific rights. One of the enumerated rights guaranteed for victims is to have inconveniences associated
with participation in the criminal justice process mimimized to the fullest extent possible.

... The [trial] court explicitly stated that it was not favoring the rights of the victims over those of defendant. Rather, it was
simply taking their concerns into consideration, as it had not done previously. Taking the concerns of the victim's family into

want to have sex with you? That's a respectable choice. If you're really turned on, but
your partner can't stand the idea of having sex right now? That's a respectable choice.
Those two are easy, I think, but how about these?

+ If your partner used to do something with you a lot, but doesn't want to do it anymore?
That's a respectable choice.

+ If you are married to your partner, but ze doesn't want to have sex? That's a respectable
choice.

+ If your partner performed a sexual act with another partner but would prefer not to do it
with you? That's a respectable choice.

+ If you know your partner likes a certain kind of sex, but they don't want to do it right
now? That's a respectable choice.

+ If you think a certain act is mild and taken for granted, like kissing or tickling, but
your partner doesn't want to do it? That's a respectable choice.

By the way, if you (like I once did) feel as though your partner is entitled to sex of any
kind, I encourage you to re-examine that feeling. Ditto if you've got a little voice in your
head telling you that you ought to be up for sex all the time just because you don't get it
very often... or that you ought to” be up for sex if you've done it with your partner
before... or whatever. The other best thing that ever happened to my sex life was when I
finally, finally, finally internalized the idea that my partners don't ever deserve sex for
any reason -- that there's no reason I ever should be having sex -- and that the only
reason I should ever, ever, ever do anything sexual is because I legitimately want to.

Of course, if you truly believe that you need a certain kind of sexuality in your life, then
you're absolutely entitled to ask your partner to consider it -- and you're entitled to leave
the relationship if ze isn't up for it. But this doesn't mean that you deserve to do that act
with that person, or that your partner owes you a certain act.

And hey, if your partner isn't down with one specific sexual act, then that means you've
got the chance to explore all kinds of other sexuality. Another other best thing that ever
happened to my sexuality? Quite possibly, it's my current boyfriend -- whose religious
adherence has drastically limited our physical sexual options.

Thomas MacAulay Millar:

We're each entitled to our own identity, but not to our own partner. Our partners are
people, with thoughts and desires and limits of their own, and they don't have to do what
we want them to do. This goes for tops, too! Tops have limits! Because of my blogging
covenant with my spouse (what I do as a bottom is personal to me and I decide how much
I reveal; what she does as a bottom is personal to her and she prefers that those stories not
be blogfodder) I don't have any really good stories to share about hitting my limits as a
top. But they exist. Tops are not required to be into everything a bottom is into, and they
damned sure are under no obligation to do things that make them uncomfortable just
because the bottom wants it -- whether the reason for the discomfort is risk tolerance,
ideology, squeamishness or anything else. Tops can say, no, I won't suspend you from

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022541.txt,"In the past, “corporate bribery has
been concealed by the falsification of
corporate books and records” and the

accounting provisions “removel] this
avenue of coverup.”

Senate Report No. 95-114, at 3 (1977)

What Is Covered by the Accounting
Provisions?

Books and Records Provision

Bribes, both foreign and domestic, are often mischarac-
terized in companies books and records. Section 13(b)(2)(A) of
the Exchange Act (15 US.C. § 78m(b)(2)(A)), commonly
called the “books and records” provision, requires issuers
to “make and keep books, records, and accounts, which, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transac-
tions and dispositions of the assets of the issuer.””!® The “in
reasonable detail” qualification was adopted by Congress
“in light of the concern that such a standard, if unqualified,
might connote a degree of exactitude and precision which
is unrealistic””!” The addition of this phrase was intended
to make clear “that the issuer’s records should reflect trans-
actions in conformity with accepted methods of recording
economic events and effectively prevent off-the-books slush
funds and payments of bribes.”*!8

The term “reasonable detail” is defined in the statute
as the level of detail that would “satisfy prudent officials in
the conduct of their own affairs.”””” Thus, as Congress noted
when it adopted this definition, “[t]he concept of reasonable-
ness of necessity contemplates the weighing of a number of
relevant factors, including the costs of compliance.”

Although the standard is one of reasonable detail,
it is never appropriate to mischaracterize transactions in a

company’s books and records.”! Bribes are often concealed

under the guise of legitimate payments, such as commis-
sions or consulting fees.

In instances where all the elements of a violation of
the anti-bribery provisions are not met—where, for exam-
ple, there was no use of interstate commerce—companies
nonetheless may be liable if the improper payments are inac-
curately recorded. Consistent with the FCPA’s approach
to prohibiting payments of any value that are made with a
corrupt purpose, there is no materiality threshold under the
books and records provision. In combination with the inter-
nal controls provision, the requirement that issuers main-
tain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the
corporation’s transactions “assure[s], among other things,
that the assets of the issuer are used for proper corporate
purpose[s].*? As with the anti-bribery provisions, DOJ’s
and SEC’s enforcement of the books and records provision
has typically involved misreporting of either large bribe pay-
ments or widespread inaccurate recording of smaller pay-

ments made as part of a systemic pattern of bribery.

Bribes Have Been Mischaracterized As:
* Commissions or Royalties
 Consulting Fees
# Sales and Marketing Expenses
 Scientific Incentives or Studies
 Travel and Entertainment Expenses
« Rebates or Discounts
» After Sales Service Fees
# Miscellaneous Expenses
= Petty Cash Withdrawals
« Free Goods
=  |ntercompany Accounts
* Supplier / Vendor Payments
« Write-offs

=» “Customs Intervention” Payments

Corruption in Russia is pervasive and is an obstacle to foreign
investment and ultimately to any political or economic progress in the
country. But with American blood and treasure safeguarding some of
the most corrupt governments in the world in Afghanistan and Iraq,
focusing on Russia’s real and serious corruption in a way that could
endanger America’s relationship with this important power is hard to
justify.

Notwithstanding predictions of America’s decline, the United States
is still the world’s greatest power and can remain so for quite some
time. However, as other powers rise, and as America becomes
increasingly preoccupied with its economic future, the margin for
error is shrinking. The United States faces critical choices—and it
needs leaders able to make them.

Dimitri K. Simes is the president of The Nixon Center.

had boundary issues she had to deal with. We have boundary
issues right now with Mexico now.

This Palin supporter is also incoherent but incoherent in a differ-
ent way. He doesn’t know much, and he knows he doesn’t know
much. But he has beliefs and he believes in his beliefs. He has beliefs
about socialism (that it is bad, and that President Obama thinks it
is good) that are based on no real knowledge. He has beliefs about
foreign policy and what it means to have foreign policy experience
that are based on nonsense. And he has made up some beliefs about
“boundaries.”

What does this tell us? It tells us that at some point, maybe not
now because he is too set in his own beliefs, someone could have
taught him about socialism or “boundaries” or what it means to have
foreign policy experience. But it should be clear that this is exactly
the kind of education that we have been trying to do in our schools
forever. You can talk about socialism in school, but that doesn’t mean
that your average person learns much from what is said there.

There is a wonderful movie called Ferris Bueller’s Day Off that
reveals a great deal about education. I often use a clip from that movie,
when I give speeches on education or training, wherein the teacher
drones on about the Smoot Hawley tariff and George Bush’s view of
Reagan’s voodoo economics (as stated in the 1980 primaries) while
the students doze off. At a different point in the same movie, the lead
character blows off a European history test, saying:

It’s on European socialism. I mean, really! What’s the point? I’m
not European ... I don’t plan on being European. So who gives a
crap if they’re socialists? They could be fascist anarchists. ... It
still wouldn’t change the fact that I don’t own a car!

They do teach about socialism in school, but no one is listening. If we
can’t produce reasonably intelligent voters in our schools, then we
aren’t doing much.

Another point that was raised in several different forms related to
how the current Arab revolt would affect relations with major
Western countries, especially since many Western powers actively
supported the Arab autocrats who are now being challenged and, in
some cases, removed from office. Would newly liberated Arab
citizenries seek revenge against Western powers?

My impression is that this will depend on the new policies that these
Western powers adopt, rather than on what they did in the past. Most
Arabs are critical of Western powers because they unquestioningly
back Israel or support Arab autocrats. Should those policies be
moderated and replaced by more even-handed postures toward the
Middle East, newly liberated Arab citizens would probably be too
busy building their new countries to allow themselves to be distracted
by lingering resentments from the past.

What is the single most important development that could trigger
regime change in some countries now facing domestic challenges and
unrest, one person asked? Three reasons come to mind: economic
collapse could do so; or key figures in the military and security
agencies could stop protecting the regime; or strategically placed
commercial, tribal, sectarian and business leaders in society could
decide that the current course was disastrous and, in consequence,
could bring about the fall of the regime.

fishing.” Moore had the certain confidence of a man who had spotted one of the
fundamental laws of our age, the compression of computing power and cost. He had
the “Let’s go fish” air of aman who had seen the inevitable. Grove, who as CEO had
to match the wild speed Moore’s Law suggested, had the total unease of a man
aware of just how fast a pace the inevitable was setting. Competition was
everywhere. One mistake sustained for six months could kill the entire, multi-billion
dollar business. It had happened to other firms. Often. Grove’s motto was best
captured in the title of one of his books. Only The Paranoid Survive. Each man was
right in his way. Moore’s law makes ever cheaper and more functional devices
spread. But Grove’s famous anxiety was honestly earned too: So much speed. So
much connection. Paranoia does seem the best reaction.

You have to wonder what that eye-rolling AT&T senior telecommunications
engineer who so mindlessly lectured Baran would have made of this new world. The
old New York City temple of phone switches where they met in 1961 has been
remade into a luxury condominium now. The company’s impregnable billions of
dollars of long distance revenue were eroded and then basically destroyed by free
packet-switched services running along the Internet. Son, let me tell you how a phone
works. What must Baran have really thought? Massive, widespread connection
changed everything. Including how a phone works. Baran eventually left RAND. He
founded several of the most important (and lucrative) companies of the early
Internet. Years later he understood with more precision what exactly had happened:
The real risk to those vulnerable AT&T systems wasn’t Russian missiles. It was an
information bomb of sorts, a concatenating desire for constant connection that
exploded many old tools of control. Yes, it took out the old structures. But, because
of the very way it was architected, for survivability, it had a remarkable feature that
even Baran had not quite expected: It enabled each of us to create too.

3.

We're surrounded by so many networks now where relations and ties of all sorts
produce a constant, hard-to-predict, “I never thought of that before,” dynamism. Of
course you have to pity those AT&T wizards a bit. Let me tell you how a stock market
works. Or let me tell you how a biologist works. None of these have quite the same
answer as they would have two unconnected decades ago. Economies, ecosystems
or our politics or immune systems are charged with this energy of expanding
complexity. Innocuous looking devices or people take on peculiar, sometimes
dangerous aspects when connectedLinked networks of money or people or bugs
tumble into wildness over and over, in ways we can’t quite anticipate or explain..
“There are systems of crucial interest that have so far defied accurate simulation,”

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017025.txt,"IlI.4C. Dictionary Coverage

To determine the coverage of the OED and Merriam-Webster’s Unabridge Dictionary (MW), we
performed the above analysis on randomly generated subsets of the lexicon in eight frequency deciles
(ranging from 10° — 10° to 10° — 10° ). The samples contained 500 candidate, words each lor all but the
top 3 deciles; the samples corresponding to the top 3 deciles (10° - 10%, 10*- 10°, 10°- 10° 2
contained 100 candidate words each.

A native speaker with no knowledge of the experiment being performed determined which words from our
random samples fell into the P, B, or R categories (to enable a fair comparison, we excluded the N
category from our analysis as both OED an MW exclude them). The annotator then attempted to find a
definition for the words in both the online edition of the Merriam-Webster Unabridged Dictionary or in the
online version of the Oxford English Dictionary’s 2™ edition. Notably, the performance of the latter was
boosted appreciably by its inclusion of Merriam-Webster’s Medical Dictionary. Results of this analysis are
shown in Appendix.

To estimate the fraction of dark matter in the English language, we applied the formula:
sum over all deciles of Pworg*Poepiw*Nigram, with:

- Nigram the number of 1grams in the decile

- Pworg the proportion of words (R,B or P) in this decile

- Poepw the proportion of words of that decile that are covered in OED or MW.

We obtain 52% of dark matter, words not listed in either MW or the OED. With the procedure above, we
estimate the number of words excluding proper nouns at 572,000; this results in 297,000 words unlisted
in even the most comprehensive commercial and historical dictionaries.

I1.4D. Analysis New and Obsolete words in the American Heritage
Dictionary

We obtained a list of the 4804 vocabulary items that were added to the AHD4 in 2000 from the
dictionary’s editorial staff. These 4804 words were not in AHD3 (1992) — although, on rare occasions a
word could have featured in earlier editions of the dictionary (this is the case for “gypseous”, which was
included in AHD1 and AHD2).

Similar to our study of the dictionary’s lexicon, we restrict ourselves to 1grams. We find 2077 1-grams
newly added to the AHD4. Median frequency (Fig 2D) is computed by obtaining all frequencies of this set
of words and computing its median.

Next, we ask which 1grams appear in AHD4 but are not part of the year 2000 lexicon any more
(frequency lower than one part per billion between 1990 and 2000). We compute the lexical frequency of
the 1-gram headwords in AHD, and find a small number (2,220) that are not part of the lexicon today. We
show the mean frequency of these 2,220 words (Fig 2F).

111.5. The Evolution of Grammar

III.5A. Ensemble of verbs studied

Our list of irregular verbs was derived from the supplemental materials of Ref 18 (main text). The full list
of 281 verbs is given in Appendix.

Our objective is to study the way word frequency affects the trajectories of the irregular compared with
regular past tense. To do so, we must be confident that

- the 1grams used refer to the verbs themselves: “to dive/dove” cannot be used, as “dove” is a
common noun for a bird. Or, in the verb “to bet/bet”, the irregular preterit cannot be distinguished from the

ARTINFO UK's Guide to Frieze Week 2010
Posted: October 12, 2010 03:11 PM

Frieze Week is upon us! Europe's largest contemporary art fair has staked its tent in Regent's Park, bringing with it
an estimated $375 million in work by brand-name artists and emerging talents alike, and London is seething with
exhibitions and events to welcome the collectors, tastemakers, and various art grandees descending on the city.
What to see? Where to go? ARTINFO UK has a few recommendations.

WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 14

You've done Tate Britain, do you really need to go to Tate Modern? Of course you do. First, the newly opened
Gauguin exhibition is stunning and simply impossible to miss (it has been described by the Times as the show of
the season -- in fact of the whole year). Second, the new commission by Ai Weiwei, was recently unveiled in
Turbine Hall. You can then head north to enjoy Fergus Henderson's English cuisine at St. John Bar & Restaurant in
Smithfield, before wandering to ROKEBY for their exhibition of German-born, London-based artist Bettina Buck.

Today is also a good day to see The House of the Noble Man, an exhibition curated by artist Wolfe von
Lenkiewicz and Russian curator Victoria Golembiovskayan. It includes a Cézanne, £6 million ($9.6 million) worth of
Picasso, as well as pieces by Damien Hirst, Christian Boltanski, Andy Warhol, Gerhard Richter, and many more --
all in the historical setting of Cornwall Terrace as it overlooks Regent's Park. (This event is by appointment only at
Boswell House, 2 Cornwall Terrace, Regents Park, London NW1. To arrange a visit, register at:

Chapter 13”

Theological Perspectives on God as an
Invisible Force

An individual’s beliefs about
God are one factor to be included in a
multi-dimensional investigation of the
social consequences and possible health
benefits of religion, an aid in particular

3 The lead author is Kathryn Tanner, Ph.D., the
Dorothy Grant Maclear Professor of Theology at
the University of Chicago Divinity School. Her
research relates the history of Christian thought
to areas of contemporary theological concern
using critical, social, and feminist theory, with a
special focus on the possible practical
implications of Christian beliefs and symbols.
She has lectured widely throughout the United
States and Europe, and is the author of six books:
God and Creation in Christian Theology:
Tyranny or Empowerment? (1988, Blackwell);
The Politics of God (1992, Fortress); Theories of
Culture: A New Agenda for Theology (1997,
Fortress); Jesus, Humanity and the Trinity (2001,
Continuum and Fortress Press); Economy of
Grace (2005, Fortress); and Christ the Key
(2010, Cambridge).

Christian beliefs are not just theoretical
matters, involving putative truth claims about the
nature of ultimate reality, but practical ones:
Christian beliefs are often promulgated with the
hope of impacting the way human beings live, by
establishing, for example, the meaningfulness of
and motivations for certain forms of social
behavior. Prior research has concerned the
possible economic, social and political
consequences of Christian beliefs about God's
relation to the world. This essay extends such
questioning to the topic of perceived social
isolation. How might belief in God as an
invisible force in everyday life affect an
individual's sense of social connection?

Page |120

to scientific hypothesis generation.”
Scientists can better test for the social
and health consequences of religious
commitment when they know more
about the character and range of beliefs
about God that such commitment brings.
This chapter hopes to show, in
particular, that exactly what Christians
believe about the nature of God’s
influence on their lives is likely to have
an important bearing on one of the
questions of this volume: How can
religion encourage a sense of connection
to others, especially in situations of
perceived social isolation, and thereby
assuage the adverse health consequences
of loneliness?

Depending on what they think
God is like, Christians vary in the way
they expect God to be a present
influence on their daily lives. God’s
nature is supernatural or transcendent,
which means God is not very much like
any of the ordinary persons or things
with which they come into regular
contact. Christians use the same terms
for God that they use for talking about
ordinary persons and things but they
therefore know that neither set of terms
is really adequate to capture who or what
God is. On the one hand, God is
something like a human being in that
God loves them and wants to do them
good, and in that God is unhappy with
their failings and trying, through the use
of carrots and sticks, to get them to
change. But, on the other hand, God is
really not very much like an ordinary
human being in that God is present at all
times and everywhere, working
inexorably to bring about what God
intends throughout the entirety of
peoples’ lives by way of influences of
both personal and impersonal sorts--for
example, through personal words of
advice and warning found in the Bible as

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019441.txt,"In other words, the budget takes note of recent issues that have reflected poorly on the IRS, including the
Service’s enhanced scrutiny of politically conservative groups that were seeking tax-exempt status as
501(c)(4) social welfare organizations, and the disclosure of certain training videos that spoofed several old
television shows and were deemed wasteful. John Koskinen, the new IRS Commissioner, has many
challenges ahead of him, including restoring public confidence in the agency and boosting employee morale.

National Taxpayer Advocate

Nina Olson has been the National Taxpayer Advocate since 2001. She heads up the Taxpayer Advocate
Service (TAS), which was created in 2000, and is an independent organization within the IRS. Ms. Olson
and the TAS are the taxpayer's “voice at the IRS.” The TAS is designed to help taxpayers navigate issues
with the IRS when the usual channels have failed; in addition, Ms. Olson regularly focuses on larger issues
within the IRS and the tax system itself, and recommends solutions. Her year-end Annual Reports to
Congress are thorough and thoughtful, and in part, detail wnat she views as the most serious issues facing
taxpayers.

Ms. Olson’s 2013 Annual Report was released on January 9, 2014, and, as always, is interesting reading.
One of the critical issues Ms. Olson focuses on in this report is that the IRS “desperately” needs more
funding to serve taxpayers and increase voluntary compliance. Ms. Olson presents some compelling
statistics to support this statement. In fiscal year 2013, for example:

e The IRS received about 109 million phone calls; only 61% of the callers seeking a customer service
representative got through, and those who did had to wait an average of 18 minutes before speaking
with someone.

e The IRS received about 8.4 million letters from taxpayers responding to proposed adjustments to their
tax accounts; it was unable to respond to 53% of this correspondence within its target timeframes.

e The IRS continues to reduce (and sometimes eliminate) services at its nearly 400 walk-in sites; the
Service will only answer “basic” tax law questions during this current filing season (January through
April), and will not answer any of those questions beyond April.

Ms. Olson also notes that since fiscal year 2010, the IRS workforce has declined about 8%, and that its
training budget has been “slashed” from about $172 million to about $22 million, a “staggering” 87%
reduction. “Thus,” she says, “the IRS not only has fewer employees than four years ago, but those who
remain are less equipped to perform their jobs.”

Ms. Olson calls the recent IRS budget cuts “shortsighted and counterproductive’” for several reasons: 1) our
system relies on voluntary compliance, and the harder it is for taxpayers to get answers, the less likely they
are to comply; 2) the IRS is a money-maker: in fiscal year 2013, it collected roughly 90% of federal revenue
— or about $2.86 trillion on an appropriated budget of about $11.2 billion (an average return on investment of
255:1); of those revenues collected, some 98% were paid timely and voluntarily, with only 2% coming from
enforcement actions. “In fiscal terms, to be blunt, the mission of the IRS trumps the missions of all other
federal agencies.”

At his confirmation hearing last December, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen voiced similar sentiments:
| don’t know any organization in my 20 years of experience in the private sector that has said “I think I'll
take my revenue operation and starve it for funds to see how it does.” The IRS will have 11,000 fewer
people working during this upcoming filing season while processing the largest number of returns in its

history. | don’t care how efficient you become, that is not a recipe for success or improved compliance
and taxpayer service.

« Given the announcement that SEC Chairwoman White will leave at the end of

the new Chair will likely be focused on less regulation and one panel member
thought Reg NMS could come under review.

Zuck sucks. According to his critics, Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, presides over a company which is undermining our basic freedoms. It was complicit in the spread of fake news and foreign interference in our elections, and is partly to blame for the rise of political polarisation through its echo chambers and filter bubbles. The company has been selling the private data of millions of users around the world to select companies – most notoriously Cambridge Analytica, who used the information to meddle in the US presidential elections and Britain’s EU referendum. And Facebook was accused of behaving like ‘digital gangsters’ by the House of Commons Digital Select Committee, led by Damian Collins MP, who claimed Zuckerberg has willfully misled lawmakers over fake news and data malpractice. Facebook is built on an essentially unethical business model, and the buck stops with Zuck.

That’s the case against Mark Zuckerberg. But let’s keep things in perspective, say his defenders. Facebook has done more than any other organisation in the world to connect people through technology, allowing more than 2.2 billion users so far – that’s 30 percent of the world’s population – to share their lives with friends and family around the world – all for free. And let’s not forget that Facebook has been a vital tool for social and political organisation, from the Arab Spring to Obama’s presidential campaign. The world is a complex and messy place and while it’s convenient to scapegoat a single CEO for our polarised politics, the fact is there were multiple causes for Brexit and Trump. Of course, there are problems at Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg is keenly aware of them. In January 2018, he made a promise to fix Facebook, admitting that the organisation makes too many errors and listing his priorities as ‘protecting our community from abuse and hate, defending against interference by nation states, or making sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent’. Much of what we are reading about Facebook is old news. Zuckerberg is essentially an idealist and we should at least give him the benefit of the doubt as he seeks to rebuild the world’s trust in Facebook.

That’s the argument of Zuckerberg’s defenders. But are they right? Join us on June 18 <https://intelligencesquared.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9b096c9e607fbd256b4fab080&id=11d2de0cad&e=796428630f> , hear the arguments and decide for yourself.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014405.txt,"Risks: Geopolitics, diplomacy and US economic cycle

The biggest risk to our scenario is the implications for Japan’s diplomatic and
geopolitical environment of the Donald Trump presidency in the US. The likelihood of
agreement on the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) has already declined and been priced
into the market, but any downward spiral in Japan-US relations would likely be further
negative for Japan equities near-term. A rise in protectionism would be negative for
stocks with high US export exposure. Meanwhile if the US economy slows or enters
recession and the protectionist response weakens USD, it would be negative for
Japanese cyclicals, particularly exporters, due to stronger JPY and potential trade
conflicts. Moreover, a potential improvement in US-Russia (US-China) relations under
the new US President most likely implies a relative worsening in Japan-Russia (Japan-
China) relations. On the other hand, we expect Japan to move closer to Europe under
such a scenario, raising the incentive to sign the Japan-EU EPA (Economic Partner
Agreement), positive for related stocks. If the Trump presidency tips the US towards
isolationism, we expect Japan’s spending on defense to increase. If this results in higher
spending on Japan’s Self Defense Forces (rather than compensating for US spending on
Japan-based US military), Japan’s defense-related stocks would be beneficiaries, and it
could reshape the arms industry in Japan.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019327.txt,"New Harvard Partner: Bok Center for Teaching and Learning

Meanwhile, Poetry in America has deepened its partnership and formulated a plan for growth going
forward at Harvard. This fall, Harvard's Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Mike Smith,
endorsed the integration and expansion of my public-facing humanities work within the Derek Bok
Center for Teaching and Learning. As a Bok Fellow this year, and alongside Bok director Rob Lue in
the years to come, | will be working to substantially expand Bok's capacity and resources to train
humanists in 21st-century methods of public engagement-- developing courses, digital fellowship
opportunities and also securing distribution outlets and partners for content produced in Bok by
Harvard humanists. By next year at this time, | will be turning some of my attention beyond poetry
(my favorite, but hardly the only humanistic mode of communication!) to create a wider base of
humanities materials for use in American schools and other institutions. We will begin integrating and
anchoring Poetry in America content (on art, sport and play; on the environment; and on health and
well being) with content created by others. As | continue to experiment with use of digital media
within my residential courses for undergraduates and graduates, | shall also be working with other
faculty and graduate students. My work at Bok will also facilitate collaborations between humanists
working across the whole university. Projects for 2017 include work with HarvardX on drama and
Shakespeare, with Harvard’s Center for the Environment, with the Arts and Humanities Initiative at
Harvard Medical School, and with several programs within Harvard’s Graduate School of Education.

Launching in 2017: Our First Course Designed Specifically for Teachers

Verse Video Education has allocated much of its staff time this year to bringing its first course
designed specifically to support the American secondary classroom to completion. Poetry in America
for Teachers: The City from Whitman to Hip Hop draws on assets created at HarvardX, along with
footage captured with our TV partners and independently by Verse Video Education. The resulting
course, designed for English, Social Studies, and Arts teachers, as well as for librarians,
administrators and others, provides deep content instruction as well as pedagogical training.
Common Core aligned, this course, the first of its kind, is now open for enrollment, and will launch
January 23rd. We are currently discussing group enrollments with major educational systems and
reformers across the nation, and we are also raising scholarship funds for strapped enrollees. Over
time, we hope to play a leading role in improving literacy and in strengthening the humanities across
the American educational landscape.

Airing Nationwide in 2018: Poetry in America, The Television Series
In May 2016, Verse Video Education was asked by WGBH and American Public Television to
expand its television series in development from 8 to 13 episodes, listed below.

The following episodes are entering post-production:

On Edward Hirsch’s “Fast Break”: Shaquille O'Neal, Pau Gasol, Shane Battier, Edward Hirsch,
and an on-court pick-up basketball chorus filmed at Success Academy Charter School; On W.H.
Auden’s “Musee Des Beaux Arts”: Ambassador Samantha Power, David Brooks, Peter Sacks; On
Robert Hayden’s “Those Winter Sundays”: Vice President Joe Biden, Elizabeth Alexander,
Angela Duckworth, Kevin Young, and a chorus of fathers and sons; On Carl Sandburg’s
“Skyscraper”: Frank Gehry, Robert Polito, and a chorus of Young Student Poets; On Nas’s “New

Why Israel is wrong about Iran

Meir Javedanfar

25 June 2011 -- Israel's former intelligence chief, Meir Dagan, has
been subjected to a firestorm of criticism — from the Israeli
government as well as sections of the media — since he stated that
attacking Iran's nuclear installations would be a stupid idea.

So strong has been the reaction that the prime minister's office even
asked him to return his diplomatic passport. What seems to be
bothering some Israelis, including Ari Shavit, the respected Haaretz
journalist, is that Dagan has now made the Iranians think they can
continue galloping to the bomb because they are not in any real
danger. This claim, though, is a clear example of where some in
Israel are getting it wrong with regard to Iran and what the Iranian
leadership perceives as serious threats. Israel has to realise that the
Tehran regime is more petrified by what is happening to its economy
and among its own population than by the possibility of a military
attack from Israel. When it comes to using violence, this regime has
had 32 years of experience. It can cope. However, the regime is so
frightened of its own population that it breaks up silent
demonstrations. It panicked when the shooting of Neda Agha Soltan
was filmed and broadcast to the world. It even went as far as to
temporarily ban books by Paulo Coelho — simply because his editor
in Iran, Arash Hejazi, was seen trying to save Neda's life.

Dagan could be wrong in his assessment but, even if he is right, it
does not mean that cessation of a military threat from Israel would
induce the Iranian government to gallop ahead towards the bomb
without any concern. The biggest reason why Iran's supreme leader,
Ali Khamenei, has agreed to talks during the last few years is not the

So we have a Palin supporter who has no idea why she supports Palin
and asks for help. The “helper” says fairness and realness, which apart
from being ungrammatical is also nonsense. Neither supporter seems
to know much about Palin, but they are eager to meet her and they be-
lieve in her. (This is not a comment about Sarah Palin, at least not by

why they like whomever they like. Or, alternatively, they can explain
it and those explanations leave you wondering.)

after initially downplaying democracy promotion, the administration
seems to have begun to pursue it with new energy, partly under the
influence of Chinese dissidents and partly, insiders say, because
officials are reluctant to be portrayed as China apologists. Whatever
the motivation, Beijing is likely to view this combination of external
and internal pressure as a serious threat.

Meanwhile, if the White House is seriously seeking to contain China
or, alternatively, to shape a global environment that would make
containment unnecessary, it is hard to imagine how this could be
done without precluding any rapprochement between Moscow and
Beijing. The administration claims the reset with Russia is one of its
most significant foreign-policy successes. But there is less here than
meets the eye—on both sides. Russian concessions so far have been
halfhearted and Russian policies, whether on Iran or Libya, do not
coincide with those of America. For its part, the United States
appears unprepared to address Moscow’s greatest concerns:
integration into Europe’s security architecture and reliable assurances
on missile defense.

More narrowly—but no less problematic for U.S. efforts to have
better relations with Russia than Russia has with China—Obama’s
team is risking alienating a large portion of the Russian elite in its
response to corruption and human-rights violations. While the State
Department has made clear its opposition to legislation punishing
Russian officials allegedly linked to the death of lawyer Sergei
Magnitsky while in police custody, the administration has decided
preemptively to deny visas to those it considers implicated in the
case. Moscow has stated clearly that this could derail cooperation
across the board, including on sanctions against Iran and transit to
Afghanistan (a deal that becomes even more important as U.S. ties to
Pakistan deteriorate).

Accounting Provisions

THE FCPA: ACCOUNTING

PROVISIONS

In addition to the anti-bribery provisions, the FCPA contains accounting provi-

sions applicable to public companies. The FCPA’s accounting provisions op-

erate in tandem with the anti-bribery provisions and prohibit off-the-books

accounting. Company management and investors rely on a company’s financial

statements and internal accounting controls to ensure transparency in the finan-

cial health of the business, the risks undertaken, and the transactions between

the company and its customers and business partners. The accounting provi-

sions are designed to “strengthen the accuracy of the corporate books and

records and the reliability of the audit process which constitute the foundations

of our system of corporate disclosure.””

The accounting provisions consist of two primary
components. First, under the “books and records” pro-
vision, issuers must make and keep books, records, and
accounts that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect an issuer’s transactions and dispositions of an issu-
er’s assets.” Second, under the “internal controls” provi-
sion, issuers must devise and maintain a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to assure management’s con-

trol, authority, and responsibility over the firm’s assets.”

These components, and other aspects of the accounting
provisions, are discussed in greater detail below.

Although the accounting provisions were originally
enacted as part of the FCPA, they do not apply only to brib-
ery-related violations. Rather, the accounting provisions
ensure that all public companies account for all of their
assets and liabilities accurately and in reasonable detail,
and they form the backbone for most accounting fraud and

issuer disclosure cases brought by DOJ and SEC”

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018470.txt,"clear from the context whether it's meant as an umbrella term like bottom or as a
specific term. The use of dominant and submissive as the default terms seems to me
to have started in the mid 90's, and I've never liked it because of its imprecision. Not all
bottoms are subs; some people like to bottom but don't have a submissive bone in them.
Some bottoms are wisecracking smartassed masochists only in it to play the pain game
and ride the endorphins; some bottoms don't see themselves as giving up power in any
way to the top. And I top my fair share, but I certainly don't think of myself as a
dominant. I think the change in terminology arose with a small but vocal minority of
kinksters who believe that everyone who does BDSM is really looking for a deep power
exchange, ultimately even a 24/7 relationship. I still see people make this argument.
They're still wrong, and they're still few in number. Using submissive and dominant
when one means to include folks who are just topping and bottoming may be
misunderstood; saying top and bottom is almost always correctly understood as the
inclusive term. (Sadist and masochist are specific terms that shouldn't be pressed into
general service either; there are submissives that really, really don't like pain at all and
dominants that would prefer never to inflict it.)

Clarisse Thorn:
What I love about safewords and check-ins:

1) Hypothetically, mainstream society acknowledges that anyone could say no at any
point during sex, but in practice, this is really hard. A variety of forces -- girls socially
pressured not to be so-called cock-teases, boys socially pressured to supposedly prove
their manliness, and everyone anxious to please their partners -- work against people's
capacity to say no; and while there is a vague understanding that no means no, that
vagueness is as far as it gets. There's no explicit framework in place for how to say no,
and no understanding of how to continue an encounter (or relationship) after one's partner
says no. Even worse, there's an assumed linear progression of sexual activity -- the best
example is the base system, which places sexual interaction on a metaphorical baseball
diamond where first base = groping and home base = penis-in-vagina sex. Have I
mentioned that I hate the base system?

So anyway, the biggest moral of the story with safewords and check-ins is that consent
does not only happen once. Consent is always happening, and can always be
renegotiated or withdrawn. Adapting my understanding of sexuality to reflect this --
even in my non-BDSM sex -- might have been the best thing that ever happened to my
sex life.

Thomas MacAulay Millar:

What can safewords do for non-kinky people? Permission communication. In a culture
that delegitimizes communication -- especially women's communication of limits or
needs -- this is huge. Safewords permission no. That which permissions the free
exercise of no also, necessarily, creates space for the free exercise of yes.

Clarisse Thorn:

2) On a related note: Good sex is not about entitlement. If we acknowledge that anyone
can safeword out of any sexual act at any time, then we acknowledge that no one is

account does not constitute error, provided that the constitutional rights of the defendant are not denied or infringed on by that

decision. 713

Just as the New Jersey courts have recognized that victims’ interests should be considered in transfer decisions, the federal
courts should do the same. Therefore, Rule 21 should be amended to allow victims to provide information to the judge on
transfer decisions.

Rule 23 - Victims’ Views Considered Regarding Non-Jury Trial

The Proposal:

The court should be required to consider the views of victims before allowing waiver of a jury trial as follows:
Rule 23. Jury or Nonjury Trial

(a) Jury Trial. If the defendant is entitled to a jury trial, the trial must be by jury unless:

(1) the defendant waives a jury trial in writing;

(2) the government consents; and

(3) the court approves after considering the views of any victims.
[*885]

The Rationale:

In the federal courts the preferred trial method is a jury trial. 7!4 As Justice Blackmun has explained, the public has interests,

independent of a criminal defendant, in monitoring judges, police, and prosecutors - and in being educated about the manner
in which criminal justice is administered. 7!> Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has concluded that defendants can waive their
right to a jury trial. 7!© To help protect the general public interest in trial by jury, Rule 23 requires not only prosecutor approval
217 but also judicial approval before proceeding by way of bench trial. This approval requires careful weighing of the
competing concerns. The Supreme Court has instructed that

213 Jd. at 76 (internal citations omitted). The hardship to the victim was established via affidavits from the victim's family provided to the
court by the prosecutor.

214 See Singer v. United States, 380 U.S. 24, 35 (1965) (Trial by jury has been established by the Constitution as the normal and preferable
mode of disposing of issues of fact in criminal cases. (citation omitted)). See generally Rachel E. Barkow, Recharging the Jury: The
Criminal Jury's Constitutional Role in an Era of Mandatory Sentencing, /52 U.Pa.L. Rev. 33, 68 (2003).

215 Gannett Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 428 (1979) (Blackmun, J., dissenting in part).

216 See Patton v. United States, 281 U.S. 276 (1930). But cf. Akhil Reed Amar, The Bill of Rights as a Constitution, /00 Yale LJ. 1131,
1196-98 (1991) (mounting a strong argument against Patton and noting that before 1930 court decisions had held jury trial could not be
waived).

217 Fed. R. Crim. P. 23(a)(2). But cf. Adam H. Kurland, Providing a Criminal Defendant with a Unilateral Right to a Bench Trial: A
Renewed Call To Amend Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 23(a), 26 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 309 (1993) (suggesting that prosecutorial
consent should be eliminated by the legislature). See generally ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 15-1.2, cmt. at 15.17 (2d ed. 1980)
(concluding that arguments in favor of requiring prosecutorial approval of jury trial waivers outweigh those against).

voluntary kind.

For many years | heard stories that comic actor Danny Thomas, the
star of Make Room for Daddy, was a coprophagiac. | assumed it was just
another urban legend until | bumped into an old friend who was now
working as a prostitute in Hollywood. Over lunch, she mentioned the
names of some of her celebrity clients, including Danny Thomas. She told
me how he had hired her to save her solid waste in her panties so that he
could rub those panties on his face and gobble up her shit as though it
were cotton candy.

When he finished, he would wash his hands and face thoroughly
then pay her and, as if coming out of a trance, he’ dsay, “Where was |?”
He was trying to distance himself from what he had just done. Instant
denial. Since then, | have believed that Danny Thomas’ s fundraising for
Saint Jude’ s Hospital was really for the purpose of having secret access to
their bedpans.

Anyway, |! googled “eating shit.” Topping the list was “Shit Eating
Grins: In Defense of Adam Sandler.” But sure enough, | was soon led to
hardcore shit-eating sites, which | found totally disgusting, yet absolutely

riveting. You may not want to read any further, but we both know you will.

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021414.txt,"° During a visit to Melbourne, Australia, in November 2016, you were accused of sexual misconduct once
again.

° The incident happened at a dinner held at the Melbourne Zoo as part of the Australian Skeptics
National Convention, where you were a featured speaker.

° With conference delegates chatting over drinks, a woman asked you for a celebrity selfie.

° As the woman held out her phone to take the picture, you reached over her shoulder and grabbed her
right breast.

° She immediately reacted, bodychecking you and spinning around. “Don’t do that,” she said.

° BuzzFeed News has seen the complaint made by another woman to ASU, ANU, and the New College

of the Humanities in London, including the selfie, her face obscured to conceal her identity. It shows your hand
in motion as a blur in front of her shoulder, apparently moving toward her chest. Two other eyewitnesses have
confirmed the complainant's account of what happened.

° In April 2017, the complainant described the incident on her blog. After hearing more about your
reputation for inappropriate behavior from blog readers, she decided to file a complaint about the Nov. 2016
incident.

° On July 16, she filed formal complaints with Arizona State University, and with the Australian National
University in Canberra and the New College of the Humanities in London, where you have visiting
appointments.

° Both Arizona State and the Australian National University told her they would look into the matter. But
neither university found against you.

° “Based on the material available to the University, we do not have sufficient evidence to substantiate
the allegations,” Kiaran Kirk, dean of the College of Science at the Australian National University, wrote to her.

° Erin Ellison, who heads Arizona State’s Office of Equity & Inclusion, wrote to her explaining that an
inquiry “did not find a violation of university policy.”

° In October, Arizona State denied a request from BuzzFeed News for documents relating to complaints
of sexual harassment against you. However, Cynthia Jewett, the university’s senior associate general counsel,
noted that two individuals, neither affiliated with the university, had complained about you. “The University did
not find either communication to state a credible allegation,” Jewett wrote.

Miscellaneous facts:

° In 2008, you founded the Origins Project at Arizona State University in Tempe, a multidisciplinary effort
to understand the origins of the universe, life, and social systems. You have led that effort ever since.

e Thanks to best-selling books like The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe From Nothing, frequent
essays in publications including the New Yorker and the New York Times, and the documentary you made with
biologist Richard Dawkins, called The Unbelievers, you are celebrated as one of America’s leading public
intellectuals.

° You served on the science policy committee for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign and are a
vocal critic of President Donald Trump.

° You also make regular public appearances across the world, often at gatherings of skeptics and
atheists.

° At CSICon in Las Vegas in October, a few dozen fans paid $500 per head to attend a VIP luncheon
with you and Dawkins.

° Many more lined up to get you to sign their copy of your latest book, The Greatest Story Ever Told —
So Far.

° Online, people can buy T-shirts emblazoned “Lawrence Krauss for President.”

° In talks and interviews, you have argued that our universe arose without divine intervention, that

religion drives xenophobia, and that our brains are hardwired to believe.

The schools make the same distinction. They do not seriously de-
bate foreign policy in high school, but they do teach how to do num-
ber sequences. There might be those who would say that Palin and
her supporters probably didn’t do well on the math SAT either. But
to me this is just a nonsensical way to look at intelligence. Plenty of
smart people don’t do well in, nor do they care about, math. But smart
people do well in reasoning logically from evidence and in presenting
a coherent argument for their beliefs. This is the essence of what it
means to be smart and to be educated. We expect leaders to be coher-
ent in what they say and to be able to justify their beliefs and actions.
One can assume that those who are bad at number sequences present
no problem for the country in any way, but being bad at detecting
faulty reasoning has its consequences in a democracy.

Here is a bit from the Katie Couric interview with Sarah Palin that
was shown on CBS during the 2008 campaign:

Couric: Why, in your view, is Roe v. Wade a bad decision?

Palin: I think it should be a states’ issue not a federal
government-mandated, mandating yes or no on such an
important issue. I’m, in that sense, a federalist, where I
believe that states should have more say in the laws of their
lands and individual areas. Now, foundationally, also, though
it’s no secret that I’m pro-life, that I believe in a culture of life
is very important for this country. Personally that’s what I
would like to see, um, further embraced by America.

Couric: Do you think there’s an inherent right to privacy in the
Constitution?

Palin: I do. Yeah, I do.

Couric: The cornerstone of Roe v. Wade.

Palin: I do. And I believe that individual states can best handle
what the people within the different constituencies in the 50
states would like to see their will ushered in an issue like that.

Couric: What other Supreme Court decisions do you disagree
with?

Palin: Well, let’s see. There’s, of course in the great history of
America there have been rulings, that’s never going to be
absolute consensus by every American. And there are those
issues, again, like Roe v. Wade, where I believe are best held on
a state level and addressed there. So, you know, going through
the history of America, there would be others but...

police officers and a 13-year-old boy caught in the crossfire,
according to Gen. Saleh el-Masry, head of North Sinai security.
Masry said that the attackers belonged to the radical Islamist group
Takfir wal-Hijra, as well as Palestinian factions that snuck through
the tunnels. The Takfiris -- extremist militants with a dogmatic,
exclusionary ideology -- have become more active during the
revolution, he said, claiming that Egyptian security forces had
arrested 12 of the assailants in the el-Arish attack, including three
Palestinians. The spike in violence has been fueled by outlaws who
escaped Egypt's prisons during the anarchy that accompanied
Mubarak's fall. Deputy Interior Minister Gen. Ahmed Gamal El Din
told me in an interview that 23,000 criminals escaped from Egypt's
prisons during the revolution and that only 7,300 had been rearrested
or turned themselves in as of May. The prison breaks also freed some
men allegedly linked to al Qaeda, who appear to be attempting to
establish a foothold in Sinai's ungoverned spaces. Maj. Yaser Atia of
Egypt's General Security confirmed that Ramzi Mahmoud al-Mowafi,
also known as the chemist for his expertise in preparing explosives,
escaped a Cairo prison on Jan. 30. The fugitive's prison files
presented to me indicate that the 59-year-old Egyptian had fled to
Afghanistan and joined al Qaeda. Upon his return to Egypt he was
given a life sentence by a military tribunal, though more details on
the charges against him remain unclear. Egyptian intelligence sources
told me that Mowafi is currently in Sinai, though they played down
the threat he posed. And then there is the matter of the fliers. On July

GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF

ENFORCEMENT

What Does DOJ Consider When
Deciding Whether to Open an
Investigation or Bring Charges?

Whether and how DOJ will commence, decline,
or otherwise resolve an FCPA matter is guided by the
Principles of Federal Prosecution in the case of individu-
als, and the Principles of Federal Prosecution of Business

Organizations in the case of companies.

DOJ Principles of Federal Prosecution

The Principles of Federal Prosecution, set forth in
Chapter 9-27.000 of the U.S. Attorney’s Manual,” pro-
vide guidance for DOJ prosecutors regarding initiating
or declining prosecution, selecting charges, and plea-bar-
gaining. The Principles of Federal Prosecution provide that
prosecutors should recommend or commence federal pros-
ecution if the putative defendant's conduct constitutes a
federal offense and the admissible evidence will probably be
sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction unless (1) no
substantial federal interest would be served by prosecution;
(2) the person is subject to effective prosecution in another
jurisdiction; or (3) an adequate non-criminal alternative to

prosecution exists. In assessing the existence of a substantial

federal interest, the prosecutor is advised to “weigh all rel-
evant considerations,’ including the nature and seriousness
of the offense; the deterrent effect of prosecution; the per-
son’s culpability in connection with the offense; the per-
son’s history with respect to criminal activity; the person’s
willingness to cooperate in the investigation or prosecu-
tion of others; and the probable sentence or other conse-
quences if the person is convicted. The Principles of Federal
Prosecution also set out the considerations to be weighed
when deciding whether to enter into a plea agreement with
an individual defendant, including the nature and serious-
ness of the offense and the person’s willingness to cooperate,
as well as the desirability of prompt and certain disposition

of the case and the expense of trial and appeal.”

As Steve Bannon continues his tour of Europe, energizing the anti-
establishment populist base, the mainstream media cannot help but
admit their admiration for his abilities, despite their dislike of his aims.

In this week’s issue, the left-wing German weekly Sern articulates the greatest fear of the European
establishment: that Bannon “could give the fragmented right in Europe a common ideology and rhetoric.”
Many thought that the reign of the “Dark Lord” had ended, writes Gernot Kramper, when Steve Bannon left
first the White House and then his role as executive chairman of Breitbart News. It turns out, however, that
Bannon’s adversaries had underestimated him, because he is “‘as dangerous as ever,” he confesses.

Kramper cannot conceal his respect for Bannon’s ability to move a crowd. He was greeted by “frenetic
applause” in his recent address before France’s National Front party, Kramper writes, demonstrating his
“impressive potential,” which the writer describes as “dangerous.”

In the mind of his audience, Bannon is something of a miracle-worker, Stamper notes, having “done the
impossible” by bringing Donald Trump into the White House.

The reason Bannon is dangerous, Kramper continues, is because he “lays out the political program of a
worldwide right: He has already conquered the USA; now Europe and then the whole world will follow.”

understand that there's a lot more to BDSM than light bondage, because I did not
understand that there are many separate BDSM acts that people can enjoy and
many ways to flavor them, I assumed from this experience that I didn't like BDSM.
I went through my old journal entries the other day and uncovered one in which I,
confused, am speculating about what's missing from my sex life: I write, I've tried S&M,
so it can't be that.”

What a learning curve I had ahead of me, eh?

I wish someone had tried to explain to me the vast cornucopia of human fetishes out
there. I wish someone had explained that erotica and pornography are both actually really
good ways to learn about your turn-ons, and -- more importantly -- had told me that not
all erotica and pornography are the same, so the fact that I wasn't into mainstream
stuff didn't mean I automatically wasn't interested in all erotica or porn. I've mentioned
that I had lots of conversations with friends about sex, but -- until recent years -- those
conversations were never framed as This is what I like, or I've found something new
that turns me on, and I wish I'd realized sooner what a great resource conversations like
that might be.

5. IL wish I'd gotten a list of ideas: Here are some ways you can try communicating
with your partner about sex.

Lastly, but certainly not least -- I was never taught how to communicate about sex. No
one ever gave me even the first idea. In all my sex-positive, liberal sexual upbringing, I
was told over and over that relationships require communication, but no one ever said:
And here's some ways in which you might communicate sexually with your partner.”

One big benefit of teaching sexual communication strategies is that it helps people learn
to say no when they don't want to do something. Teaching people how to set
boundaries is massively important, and I think a lot about ways to do it. I saw this
adorable video about cuddle parties recently that really struck me -- these people create
parties where everyone basically just cuddles, but everyone also specifically has the
power to say no to any given person or act. The reporter who made the video talks at
the end about how she found the whole experience to be empowering -- how she felt like
it gave her space to say no that she hadn't had before. Perhaps these could be used to
teach people to set boundaries?

But you can't really use cuddle parties in a school or workshop setting, more's the pity.
When I developed my first sex education workshop, it was all about describing good
communication strategies. I listed questions that all sex partners could benefit from
asking each other, including What do you like? and What do you fantasize about?”
and Is there anything you really don't want me to do?

And I talked about ways that you can make communication easier, if the two partners are
uncomfortable having this conversation. I took a page from the BDSM community by
creating checklists of all kinds of sexual acts and weird fetishes and gender-bending
craziness, and I put it all on a 1-5 scale (with | being not at all interested” and 5 being
I'd love to try this), and I told people that they could try filling out those checklists and

be closed under existing laws. This provision [of the CVRA] is not intended to alter those laws or their procedures in any way
n 292

Proposed Rule 43.1(b) turns to the potentially complex subject of whether the court may go forward with a proceeding when
the victim is not present. Of course, if the victim has been properly notified but has elected not to attend the proceeding, no
problem arises. The difficult issue 1s what to do when the victim is absent because of lack of notice of the proceeding. It could
be argued that the court has no choice but to reschedule such a proceeding, just as it would be required to reschedule a
proceeding when the defendant had not received notice. The CVRA mandates that courts shall ensure that crime victims are
accorded their rights, *? and one of the rights is notice for court proceedings. ?°* If the victim has not received notice of a
proceeding, then going forward with the proceeding arguably violates the victim's rights under the CVRA. As Senator Kyl
explained:

[*909]

It does not make sense to enact victims’ rights that are rendered useless because the victim never knew of the proceeding at
which the right had to be asserted. Simply put, a failure to provide notice of proceedings at which a right can be asserted is
equivalent to a violation of the right itself. 29°

Proposed Rule 43.1(b) stakes out a position more limited than an absolute requirement of proper victim notification. Except for
trials and sentencings (which are discussed below), proposed Rule 43.1(b) would allow the court to move forward with a
proceeding without notice to the victim provided that three conditions are met: (1) doing so is in the interests of justice, (2) the
court provides prompt notice to the victim of the court's action and of the victim's right to seek reconsideration of the action if a
victim's right is affected, and (3) the court ensures that notice will be properly provided to the victim for all subsequent public
proceedings.

Each of these three conditions serves an important purpose. To begin with, the court should not go forward unless the interests
of justice are served - the first requirement. The court should also notify the victim of the opportunity to seek reconsideration of
the court's action if a victim's right is affected - the second requirement. For example, if the court holds a bail hearing without
proper notice to the victim and decides to release a defendant, the victim should be advised of this fact and of the right to ask
the court to reconsider that bail decision. (The CVRA, as noted earlier, gives victims the right to provide information regarding
bail decisions. 7°) Finally, if the court is moving forward without proper notice to a victim at a particular proceeding, it seems
only fair that the problem be solved for future proceedings - the third requirement.

For two important proceedings - trial and sentencing - the proposed rule would bar a court from moving forward without proper
notice to the victim. This is consistent with the CVRA's directive that In any court proceeding involving an offense against a
crime victim, the court shall ensure that the crime victim is afforded the rights [in the CVRA]. 297 Tf the victim has not been
notified of a [*910] trial or sentencing, the only way the court can ensure that the victim's right is protected is to delay the
trial or sentencing until the victim receives notice. This is entirely appropriate; a victim of a crime deserves the opportunity to
see the trial of her victimizer and to speak at sentencing. A modest delay in these proceedings is a small price to pay for
respecting the victim's rights. Moreover, neither a trial nor a sentencing can be repeated. Double jeopardy principles may well

Hi 
Cathy and I have discussed your questions. At this stage we do not feel it is beneficial and may negatively impact our

Thank you for your response. My initial questions are fairly general I believe. 
Was Former Pres Clinton ever a guest on the island? 
Was George Mitchell a guest? 
Would any of the guests get massages from the girls brought by Mr. Epstein or Ms. Maxwell? 
Do you remember 
What was her interaction with Ms. Maxwell? 
How many massages would Mr. Epstein get per day? I understand that the massages happened in a location where, 
based on the article I read, Ghislaine instructed you to never go while in use. But I am curious knowing - were the 
massages done by the various young girls brought to the island? Did they appear to be massage therapists? I think I 
know that answer based again on the previous article I read. 
Were you aware of Ghislaine flying a helicopter? Flying girls to the island? Flying guests to the island? 
What did you understand Ghislaine's role to be? How did she describe herself or act while there? If she was the 
queen bee girlfriend, then what was her explanation of the presence of the other younger girls? And what 
interaction did Ghislaine have with those girls? It is our understanding that one of her primarily jobs was to find 
the girls to bring to Mr. Epstein but we do not yet have a firm understand where she found them or what interaction 
she personally had with each of them while on the island. I was hoping you could provide some clarity based on 
things you heard or observations you made. 
Again, thank you for any clarification you can provide. I am interested in the facts, including any inaccuracies that 
have been reported in the past which may have given us a misunderstanding of anything. 
Sincerely, 
Brad

Greetings 
Thank you for your letter and sentiments contained there in. 
Cathy and I have read a number of articles that have appeared in the press over the past few years. In the cases 
where statements are credited to I can honestly say that we cannot agree to the statements 
made and therefore do not see what further info you need. For example, the notion that we served or witnessed the 
stated alleged acts or parties are untrue. 
If you wish to take this further, please supply a list of questions you think are pertinent and we will then decide if any 
need answering .

Dear Miles and Kathy Alexander, 
I, along with several other attorneys, represent_____________________ She needs your help and we are hoping 
for your assistance. She doesn't need much. In fact, all she needs are some good, honest people who are 
willing to just tell the truth. That seems like a simple request that any compassionate person would 
accommodate; however, for some reason many people have instead decided to stay out of it and allow 
to continue to suffer. A small number of good people have stood up for what is right and told the 
truth. We do not currently know where you stand but we know that you have helpful information and 
are hopeful that you will cooperate in sharing that information with us. 
I have investigated various related aspects of this unfortunate story for 8 years now. is one of 
numerous clients I have represented in related matters. And only wants one thing - for the truth 
to be known and for her story to protect others. She was a teenager when she was recruited to travel 
with Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein. After 2 years she escaped that life and lived in 
hoping to forget what she had been through. After Mr. Epstein was arrested for doing similar things to 
other girls that he had done to her, lecided to speak out about what really had transpired while 
traveling with Maxwell and Epstein, including events that occurred on Little St. James. 
She remembers you and your wife fondly. We read the interview you gave a few years back. There can 
be no doubt that we absolutely appreciate the probably unwanted media attention that your previous 
interview drew. We are not at all looking for a second round of that. We are not the media. We do not 
need any public interview. We are not concerned with anything other than the facts, from your own 
observations or what you heard while working on the island. We just want to speak with you. 
came back to the United States to help others similarly victimized. Specifically, she started a non-
profit charity to help sex abuse victims. She very bravely told her story with the goal of starting a new life 
helping others. Unfortunately, Ms. Maxwell told the world that was lying, which has thus far had 
the impact of destroying 's charity. We are in litigation with Ms. Maxwell where we have to prove 
something that should be very simple - that is in fact telling the truth in her story of being 
recruited by Ms. Maxwell to travel and work for Mr. Epstein. We know she is being truthful. We also 
know that there are numerous witnesses who also know she is. But many of the witnesses still work for 
Mr. Epstein or cannot be located. 
- as well as any others similarly situated - deserves the truth. And that is all we are trying to 
capture for her. We promise not to let anyone in the media know we are talking to you. We are not 
looking to drag you into anything. We are not looking for anything at all more than the truth, and Virginia 
has told us that of all the people who worked for Mr. Epstein you were the most likely to help.

26. How does FinCEN interact with banking and securities regulators?

In 2004, FinCEN entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with federal banking regulators. The MOU
sets forth procedures for the administration of the BSA, Titles | and II of Pub. L. 91-508, as amended, codified at 12
U.S.C. § 1829b, 12 U.S.C. §§ 1951-1959, and 31 U.S.C. §§ 5311-5332; information relating to the primary federal
regulators’ policies and procedures for examination of BSA compliance; significant BSA compliance issues at banking
organizations supervised by the regulators; and analytical data based on or derived from information provided by the
regulators. The MOU also gives FinCEN authority to issue its own enforcement actions, even when regulators may
not think it is necessary. On April 26, 2005, FinCEN and the New York State Banking Department entered into a
similar MOU; shortly thereafter, a number of other states followed suit.

In late 2006, the SEC and FinCEN entered into an MOU under which the SEC provides FinCEN with detailed
information on a quarterly basis regarding the AML examination and enforcement activities of the SEC and the Self-
Regulatory Organizations (SROs). In return, FinCEN provides assistance and analytical reports to the SEC.

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015346.txt,"Betty Dodson, sex educator and producer of Viva La Vulva, says, “|
think we have changing ideas about what’ s public and what’ s private.
And now that nudity is more public--nude beaches, routine nudity in film,
and the enormous amount of exhibitionism and porn on the Web--I’ m
not surprised to see a trend toward pubic shaving. | think it’ s probably
here to stay.” She told me that, “Thanks to the lack of a comprehensive
sex education for kids, young girls now want their vulvas to look like porn
stars because that's what their boyfriends jerk off to and prefer. It's all they
know.” But a new study has concluded that pubic hair is returning: “The
men don’ tcare and the women don’ tcan’ t bother.”

Welcome back, good old bush. Hide and seek a friendly clit.

Ironically, although Arnold Schwarzenegger was only joking when he
announced that 4e was going to get a Bikini wax, actually Beverly Hills skin
care and waxing expert Nance Mitchell has about fifty regular male
customers that come for pubic waxing who “are not gay and they are not
porn stars. Some go totally bare, some just do the shaft and up around the
pelvic area.” She explains that “It depends on what their wives and
girlfriends want. Men go along because removing the hair makes the
whole package look bigger.”

Ah, yes, the //usion of size does matter.

I first met Erekat in the late 1980s, while
working on the Palestinian issue for then
Secretary of State George Shultz. Back
then, the U.S.-educated diplomat was
already showing the brashness and
outspokenness that would make him one
of the most memorable -- if exasperating
-- of the Palestinians with whom we
dealt.

He annoyed then Secretary of State
James Baker by wearing his kaffiyeh

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014411.txt,"Escape from zero

The Q3 CY16 GDP print confirms our view that Japan has at last emerged from the de
facto zero-growth trap of the past few years. Growth accelerated to an above-
consensus 2.2% q-o-q Saar, after a 0.7% rise in Q2 CY16 and 2.1% rise in Q1 CY16. We
expect a moderation in Q4 CY16, but underlying growth will remain firmly in the 1.0-
1.5% range. We are currently tracking CY2016 growth of 0.7%, a modest improvement
from 0.6% in CY2015, though the switch to a new GDP standard’ next month raises
uncertainty around our forecasts.

Upturn in exports to be sustained through Q3 CY17

The recent recovery has been driven by a fading consumption tax shock and stronger
exports. The downturn in the global industrial cycle in 2014-16 hurt Japan, but
manufacturing activity bottomed out early this year and is now modestly expanding
(Chart 2). The OECD leading indicator continues to signal a synchronized pick-up in
global growth (Chart 3). The domestic inventory cycle also points to production gains
ahead (Chart 4). For Japanese exporters, the improvement in demand has been most
visible for Europe (Chart 5). US and Chinese demand will likely follow, though the
mainland’s structural shift to services implies only a modest acceleration. We expect the
current up-cycle in global exports to be sustained through Q3 CY17 — possibly longer
depending on developments in the US (more on this later). The combination of stronger
external demand and a weaker currency should shore up business confidence, especially
among manufacturers, and lay the foundations of Japan’s recovery.

one form or another since antiquity. Moreover, the now-fallen
dictators promoted a venal system of corruption built on personal
access to their own ruling circles. And Mubarak, rather than move
society forward by dispensing with a pseudomonarchical state, sought
to move it backward by installing his son in power. Mubarak and Ben
Ali were dull men, enabled by goons in the security services. The real
story in the Middle East these past few months, beyond the toppling
of these decrepit regimes, is the possible emergence of authentic
constitutional monarchies in places like Morocco and Oman. Both of
these countries, which lie at the two geographical extremities of the
Arab world, have not been immune to demonstrations. But the
protesters in both cases have explicitly called for reform and
democracy within the royal system and have supported the leaders
themselves. King Mohammed and Sultan Qaboos have moved
vigorously to get out in front of popular demands by reforming their
systems instead of merely firing their cabinets. Indeed, over the years,
they have championed women’s rights, the environment, the large-
scale building of schools and other progressive causes. Qaboos, in
particular, is sort of a Renaissance man who plays the lute and loves
Western classical music, and who—at least until the celebrations in
2010 marking forty years of his rule—eschewed a personality cult.
The characteristics, then, of the benign dictator are evident, at times
hewing to propositions set forth by the likes of Berlin: freedom may
come as much from stability as from democracy; leaders must adhere
to the will of the people, they need not in all cases be chosen by
them. Yet in the Middle East these dictators remain the exception to
the rule, and this is why quasi monarchies of the iron-fisted Assad or
the crazed and tyrannical Qaddafi are now under assault. THE
PLACE where benevolent autocracy has struck deep and has
systematic roots is Asia. Any discussion of whether and how
democracy can be successfully implemented might, because of the

Centre De Formation Technique Pour
L’Avancement Des Jeunes Du Sud’Est Inc.

Project Overview

Description

Haitian manufacturing has been well known in the world. As recently as the mid 1980's, Haiti was
known as the staple for baseball production. After labor unrests occurred, corporations moved
their operations out of Haiti to China and other countries. Haiti went from employing 150,000
workers in the textile industry to a current level of 20,000. Haiti occupies the lowest ranks in the
world’s ranking among the countries. As a rule, the country is perceived as politically unstable, being
subject to various natural disasters, and having increasing security problems. For example, the
political difficulties related to the Presidential election had led to the suspension of funding for
major infrastructure rehabilitation by most international and bilateral donors.

The Centre de Formation Technique pour L’Avancement des Jeunes du Sud-est (CEFOTAJ) was
created by members who trace their roots to the beautiful city known as Haiti’s cultural center to
increase general awareness of the dangers facing idle young women and men. The city, a population
of 60,000, is considered a major production center of arts and creativity and is determined by
CEFOTAJ members as the ideal location to establish a trade school.

In support of the Government of Haiti’s National Action Plan to produce centers of economic
development outside the capital of Port-au-Prince, CEFOTAJ plans to ensure Haiti’s future
development by bringing much needed training skills for the textile industry to support the creation
of jobs to Haiti’s underserved regions.

Based on our target group of attracting over 100 youths with 75 enrolling and being trained for the
project, we have formulated a free association questionnaire that we would pose to individuals
within the community in order to assess whether the community believes this avenue of job skill
creation would be fruitful. The following questionnaire would be utilized to engage the community
in open ended discussions about their future and viability of a successful training center:

Black also denied there was any effort to pressure the U.S. attorney's office to back off Epstein.

It is absurd to say that the target of a federal criminal] investigation could put undo pressure on the United
States, the government, the Department of Justice, the U.S. attorney's office and the FBI,” Black said.

Weinberg, who challenged a Justice Department policy of seizing e-mail through secret subpoenas to Internet
service providers, also said to his knowledge no private investigator was hired. Lefkowitz, a partner at
Kirkland & Ellis in New York who drafted President George W. Bush's policy on stem cell research, did not
return a phone call for comment by deadline. Black and Weinberg said they still represent Epstein.

Fodder For Litigation
The motion to intervene does not claim the letters are attorney-client privilege and makes a point of saying
Epstein reserves his right to intervene individually.

Weinberg said turning the confidential correspondence over to the Jane Does would violate the federal rules of
evidence and cast a chill over the criminal defense bar, which would rightly be concerned that anything they
tell the government could boomerang into civil litigation against clients.

Neither party expected or believed these letters would later become a source of information that would be
used for any other purpose, Weinberg said. We believe the issue raised before Judge Marra has importance
beyond just the litigation between the government and the Jane Does.

Bradley J. Edwards, a partner with Farmer Jaffe Weissing Edwards Fistos & Lehrman in Fort Lauderdale,
represents the Jane Does. He didn't want to get into his planned response to the motion to intervene but said
Acosta's letter will not affect the case.

Edwards agreed with Acosta that the Palm Beach state attorney's office faltered on the Epstein case. A call to
the Palm Beach State Attorney's Office spokeswoman was not returned by deadline.

There has never been a stronger case for the state to prosecute, and the case should have been prosecuted by
the state, Edwards said. The state totally dropped the ball, but once the feds took the case over, they too
unfortunately dropped the ball.

Edwards refutes Acosta's position that the U.S. attorney's office was hampered by the lack of a clear interstate
nexus required for federal prosecution. Evidence indicates Epstein flew on his private plane out of state with
the intent to engage in sex with minors and used his telephone, a means of interstate commerce, to set up his
rendezvous with underage girls, Edwards said.

Edwards contends the U.S. attorney's office caved.

They identified a bunch of victims of sexual abuse and decided to align themselves with a bad guy and keep
the victims in the dark about the secretive nonprosecution agreement they were giving to Epstein, he said.

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016129.txt,"Focus on increasing non-hydrocarbon fiscal revenue could fall short of target

The breakdown of measures to raise non-oil revenues is not given. However, the tally is
close to the USS100bn targeted in the Vision 2030 and is thus likely to include
measures discussed then: hikes to administered energy prices, review of current levels
of fees and fines, introduction of new fees, land tax (we estimate annual revenues of
1.5-2% of GDP in its first phase when fully implemented). In this regard, the NTP
suggests forthcoming privatizations, imposition of taxes on harmful products (likely
tobacco and soft drinks), introduction of a Value-Added Tax (VAT) for which we estimate
annual revenues of up to 2% of GDP, implementation of a unified income tax and of an
income tax on residents (although official comments later clarified there were no plans
to tax nationals but stayed equivocal regarding expatriates).

Although there is no direct budgetary impact, water and electricity subsidies are
targeted to decrease by SAR200bn. Non-oil subsidies are targeted to decrease by 20%
by 2020. The latter, we believe, consists largely of subsidies for social and sports clubs,
private education, private hospitals, and other agricultural subsidies. They were
budgeted at SAR3.9bn (US$1.0bn; 0.2% of GDP) in 2016, down from SAR15.0bn
(USS$4.0bn; 0.6% of GDP) in 2015. A 20% cut to these on-budget non-oil subsidies would
thus generate minimal savings of US$O.2-US$0.8bn (0.1-0.5% of GDP) depending if the
reference base year was 2015 or 2016.

According to the Deputy Crown Prince pronouncements early in the year, medium-term
plans are also likely to target the introduction of US$400bn of unutilized state assets
(land, etc) to state-owned funds, with the latter in turn in charge of developing them
into projects and companies than can be IPOed to the public. In our view, this may be
linked to the Ministry of Finance assigned KPI of increasing total recorded non-oil
assets (real estate, etc) from SAR3trn to SARStrn.

The Deputy Crown Prince provided a breakdown of the government target of raising
US$100bn in additional non-oil revenue annually by 2020. The bulk of this increase in
non-oil revenue would come from the restructuring of subsidies which could generate
USS30bn per year (4.9% of GDP), according to the Deputy Crown Prince. VAT
implementation, a Green Card-like program and a plan to allow corporates to hire
foreign workers in excess of their official quotas could bring in US$10bn (1.6% of GDP)
a year by 2020, according to the Deputy Crown Prince.

culture that did manage to catch on, or at least may be on their way.

1. In 1958, pornography was gradually becoming legal, but at that
stage of the game, the Supreme Court was unwilling to allow 1st
Amendment protection of “hard-core” porn—as opposed, | assumed, to
the term | invented, “soft-core porn,” which was obviously more
respectable, though it seemed kind of sneaky, pretending to be squeaky
clean. So | decided to satirize the concept with a new feature in 7he Realist:

“Soft-Core Porn of the Month.”

For example, phallic symbolism in newspapers and magazines was a
key ingredient of soft-core porn. Sample: A close-up of a stickshift in a
1965 Volkswagen ad was accompanied by the question, “Does the
stickshift scare your wife?” Soft-core porn now refers to limited sexuality,
as seen in network TV dramas and hotel-room movies that feature jiggling
breasts and buttocks but no genitalia. The way to recognize soft-core porn
is that it gives men a soft-on.

2. On the afternoon of December 31, 1967, several activist friends
were gathered at Abbie and Anita Hoffman's Lower East Side apartment,
smoking Columbian marijuana and planning a counter-convention for the

Democratic Party’ s event the following summer in Chicago. Our fantasy

reflected a virtuous loop of theory and practice, between the lab and the market, the
scientist and the businessman.

This fusion of the instinct for competition, for constant new innovation, delivered
the modern world you and | live in today. “All fixed, fast-frozen relations,” Karl Marx
and Friedrich Engels wrote in 1849 about the speed of this change, “are swept away.
All new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid,
melts into air.”?” As more people “dared to know’, the big ideas and big thinkers
attracted an audience. Arguments started. New ways to record and share the
answers appeared too. Locke or Newton or Darwin were as notable for the crowd of
debating, curious citizens they attracted as for their ideas. Such contentious
discussions were designed to elicit truth, to give individuals that same shocking
sense Luther had felt on discovering a powerful idea by himself; but as important
was that these debates were recorded - written and then distributed in journals,
books and letters. For most of history, after all, knowledge suffered from its own
fragility and asymmetry: There was always a chance, maybe even a likelihood, that
some important insight would be lost in a plague, strangled as heretical, burnt up in
a library fire, or dissolved by some military misfortune. This is why, for instance, we
have almost all of Shakespeare and why we are missing so much of Sappho.
Widespread knowledge changed this. A solid, inarguable base endured. “If 1 have
seen further,” Newton famously wrote, “it is because I have stood on the shoulders
of giants.” Those shoulders for Netwon were enshrined in libraries, scientific
journals and the massive sense of what had come before swaddled in the Cambridge
walls that surrounded him. In this sense, the preservation and advance of
knowledge, the new symmetry, was not only the largest shift of power in history. It
was also the best thing that ever happened to the human race.

In other ways, of course, it was very nearly the worst. Symmetry had a darker edge.
It meant that nations decided the strategic questions of the day by throwing
massive, deadly power at one another in unprecedented volume. With each passing
year, Europe's engines of science and industry were grinding out tools of
unprecedented destruction. Napoleon’s greatest victories were enabled as much by
the industrial strength of French artillery factories as by the liberated masses of the
French revolution. When France was unseated by the British Empire, it was
manufacturing scale and naval depth that tipped the balance. London’s clubby
mastery was, in turn, challenged by Germany’s efficient, iron-and-blood commercial
engines. Size and scale and safety became linked. This sense of the undeniable
power of industrial mass was Winston Churchill's only comfort for two nervous,
lonely years after 1939 as he paced the hours until what he hoped was America’s
entry into The Second World War. “] knew that the United States was in the war, up

combining the sets of first and last names.
i. This procedure is carried for every raw name variant.

l11.7.A.6 — Find the word match frequencies of all names.

Given the set of names which may refer to an individual, we wish to find the time resolved words
frequencies of these names. The frequency of the name, which corresponds to a measure of how often
an individual is mentioned, provides a metric for the fame of that person. We append the word
frequencies of all the names which can potentially refer to an individual. This enables us, in a later step,
to identify which name is the relevant.

6) Append the fame signal for each query name of each record. The fame signal is the
timeseries of normalized word matches in the complete English database.

l1.7.A.7 — Find ambiguous names which can refer to multiple individuals.

Certain names are particularly popular and are shared by multiple people. This results in ambiguity, as
the same query name may refer to a plurality of individuals. Homonimity conflicts occur between a group
of individuals when they share some part of, or all, their name. When these homonimity conflicts arise,
the word frequency of a specific name may not reflect the number of references to a unique person, but to
that of an entire group. As such, the word frequency does not constitute a clear means of tracking the
fame of the concerned individuals. We identify homonimity conflicts by finding instances of individuals
whose names contain complete or partial matches. These conflicts are, when possible, resolved on the
basis of the importance of the conflicted individuals in the following step. Typical homonimity conflicts are
shown in Table $11.

7) Identify homonimity conflicts. Homonimity conflicts arise when the query names of two or more
individuals contain a substring match. These conflicts are distinguished as such :

a. For every query name of every record, find the set of substrings of query names.

b. For every query name of every record, search for matches in the set of query name
substrings of all other records.

c. Bidirectional homonimity conflicts occur when a query name fully matches another query
name. The name conflicted name could be used to refer to both individuals.
Unidirectional conflicts occur when a query name has a substring match within another
query name. Thus, the conflicted name can refer to one of the individuals, but also be
part of a name referring to another.

l11.7.A.8 — Resolve, when possible, the most likely origin of ambiguous names.

The problem of homonymous individuals is limiting because the word frequencies data do not allow us to
resolve the true identity behind a homonymous name. Nonetheless, in some cases, it is possible to
distinguish conflicted individuals on the basis of their importance. For the database of people extracted
from Encyclopedia Britannica, we argue that the quantity of information available about an individual
provides a proxy for their relevance. Likewise, for people obtained from Wikipedia, we can judge their
importance by the size of the article written about the person and the quantity of traffic the article
generates. As such, we approach the problem of ambiguous names by comparing the notability of
individuals, as evaluated by the amount of information available about them in the respective
encyclopedic source. Examples of conflict resolution are shown in Table $12 and $13.

8) Resolve homonimity conflicts.

God intends in creating the world.“ But
more often than not the gift of God’s
presence as an effective influence on
human life is specifically associated by
Christians with salvation. Human beings,
Christians typically believe, have either
lost altogether, or at a minimum,
habitually fail to attend properly to a
presence of God always theirs, in ways
that corrupt human well-being. The
Christian claim is that God saves human
beings by giving them the presence of
God as an effective force for human
transformation in virtue of something
that Jesus suffers or accomplishes.

God acts as an invisible force in
human lives here because God
influences humans through God’s very
presence. Christians, if they follow the
common teaching of theologians in this
regard, believe God is invisible or
unapparent because God is not capable
of being delimited or circumscribed by
the usual boundary drawing and sorting
mechanisms used to cordon off and pin
down other things.“ God is not, in
short, a kind of thing, set off by clear
boundaries that distinguish God from
what God is not. But there is also here
the kind of invisibility discussed earlier:
the invisibility of apparent absence in
human terms.

Christian claims about salvation
often have an eschatological edge. They
frequently point, that is, to an end time,
indefinitely deferred from the
perspective of anything achievable in
this life. What God gives to remedy the
sin of human life through Christ is,
accordingly, not commonly thought to
be fully effective in any visible way in
this life. Christians typically think that
their connection to Jesus brings with it a
new availability of the presence of God
as a force for change in their lives, but
what they expect to achieve by way of
that constantly available relationship
remains invisible in the form of an
always deferred hope. Once again it is
invisibility—here the invisibility of the
revolutionary changes in one’s life for
which one continues to hope--that
permits Christians to believe the
presence of God, made available to them
in a new way in Christ for the very
purpose of bringing about those changes,
is nevertheless always with them.

Conclusion

The main intention of this
chapter was to make the case that basic
Christian beliefs are likely to have a
bearing on perceived social isolation.
After suggesting that Christianity is not
all of a piece on that score, I developed a
particular construal of basic Christian
beliefs that would seem to have great
potential to alleviate perceived social
isolation through attention to connection
with God. While that argument was
merely a logical or prima facie one, it
forms a testable—though as yet
untested—hypothesis: Does the
particular construal of the beliefs
commended here for their
encouragement of a focal sense of
constant connection with God really
have those consequences? Do people
actually feel less lonely, in other words,

£6m worth of Picassos to go on show during Frieze

Gareth Harris, October 15, 2010

Four rare works by Picasso thought to be worth over £6m and an 1875 Cézanne oil on canvas will go on sale
during Frieze week next month in an ambitious exhibition to be held at a London property part owned by a
Russian billionaire. The show, entitled The House of the Noble Man (12-20 October), will open at 2 Cornwall
Terrace, an 18th-century building off Regent's Park in London near to the Frieze Art Fair site. The exhibition is
curated by artist Wolfe von Lenkiewicz, whose works will feature in the display, and Russian curator Victoria
Golembiovskaya. Around £20m worth of art will be for sale, approximately a third of the show, confirms Von
Lenkiewicz.

According to the co-curator, the Picasso pieces on offer will include Buste d'Homme 4 Ia Pipe (1969, priced at
£3m); the 1905 drawing The Family of Saltimbanques and a cubist painting, Nature Morte au Gobelet (around
1914). An 1875 oil on canvas by Cézanne, Don Quixote, is priced at £1.25m. Works by Yves Klein, Egon Schiele,
Gerhard Richter, Damien Hirst and Andy Warhol will also be for sale. Von Lenkiewicz's own works will be in the
£30,000-£60,000 price range. The Picassos etc. are from anonymous dealers who will take their portion of the
percentages. Any other proceeds made during the show will go back into the funding of the exhibition which is
hugely expensive despite its sponsorship [by the Russian real estate company Mirax], adds Von Lenkiewicz. A
selection of works from Charles Saatchi's New Sensations 2010 roster of emerging artists will also be for sale.
Twenty students shortlisted for the prize, which is sponsored by Cadogan Tate, have been chosen to present their
work; these artists include Matthew Welch, Katie Sims and Pablo Wendel. A non-selling section will include works
from the London-based Zabludowicz Collection and the holdings of the Iraqi-born industrialist Ragdan El-akabi.

The show came about when | was in Moscow exhibiting my work at Triumph Gallery. Victoria took me to the
Mirax city project, a huge development in central Moscow. She talked to Sergei Polonsky [head of Mirax] about
the Cornwall Terrace buildings which he has shares in. He was willing to sponsor the show, says Von Lenkiewicz.
The Mirax group are co-developers of the Cornwall Terrace historical complex, parts of which are up for sale.
Ironically the exhibition, awash with blue-chip items, is meant to reflect the typical tastes of a 21st-century
collector who may well treat art as a commodity. The notion of the noble man with sangre azul, [with] blue
blood developing a blue-grey skin tone from eating off the family silver, has prevailed for centuries. But this idea
is bankrupt, outmoded. Our collector spends his days and nights bathed in the blue light of a computer screen, as
he trades in dematerialised securities, or price options based on weather conditions on the other side of the
globe, according to a press statement. It is important that the show comes across strongly as a curatorial
concept playing with the idea of commerce, mirroring the [art] market with irony. We based the idea around
nobility and bankrupt values in a post humanist age, says Von Lenkiewicz.

HEADLINE: CITY SPY

BODY:

EXPECT more media firms to announce plans to charge for content online in early 2010. City Spy hears that busi-
ness-to-business publisher United Business Media is the latest outfit which is thinking of ramping up its subscription
model. Property Week and Building are among the titles which recently started asking users to register their details to
keep reading stories, which is seen as a possible precursor to charging.

BUSINESSES TIPPED TO COME A CROPPER

AMID all the contradictory forecasts for recovery or double-dip recession in 2010, what do the insolvency practi-
tioners say? City Spy's mole in the bean-counting world says the last quarter of 2009 was surprisingly quiet as the
economy stabilised but they are not optimistic about the new year: We reckon there's going to be a rush of insolvencies
in the second quarter, after the end of the financial year. The next quarterly rent review is due tomorrow, Christmas
Day, then again at the end of March. But given the number of seasonal sales that started on the High Street at least a
week before Christmas, it would be no surprise to see some retailers come a cropper sooner...

EPSTEIN PILOT TAKES TO THE ROAD

FURTHER news reaches City Spy of former Bear Stearns trader, Prince Andrew's shooting companion and con-
victed sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein.

The ex-Wall Street star served 13 months in jail on criminal charges of soliciting prostitution and procuring a minor
for prostitution and he now faces civil claims from young women accusing him of having unlawful sex with them. This
week, City Spy recounted how Epstein had transferred the title deeds of his prized 2003 Ferrari 575M Maranello to his
private pilot Larry Visoki, prior to the car going on sale for $159,000 (£99,000) (possibly to help Epstein pay his legal
bills). It turns out, the same Visoki was deposed last week by Bradley Edwards, an attorney for three of the women su-
ing Epstein. Questioned by Edwards about plane passengers who might have witnessed Epstein in the company of
young girls, Visoki admitted Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, former Colombian
president Andrés Pastrana Arango, Obama economic adviser Lawrence Summers, billionaire Ron Burkle, and actors
Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker had been on board the plane while young girls were present. Fortuitously for Epstein,
however, Ferrari-selling Visoki swore on oath that he never suspected his boss of having sex with them.

Of course not, Larry. Now drive off into the sunset.

More on Prince Andrew, our special representative for international trade and investment. The European Parliament
and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe have strongly condemned Azerbaijan for tightening re-
strictions on the media and jailing two bloggers who were critical of the government. It transpires the oil-rich country
has long blocked BBC broadcasts there, which might explain why oft-criticised Andrew and former Prime Minister
Tony Blair spend so much time visiting the sometime Soviet State.

What does the snow have in common with the recession? Every other country can get out of both but Britain can't
get out of either. HAPPY news: private jet travel is back, reports the Wall Street Journal. Alas, there is a but [#x2039]

article titled “Laughing It Off: What Happens When Women Tell Rape
Jokes?” by Katherine Leyton stated: “Some female comics tell jokes that
clearly target rape culture, such as one classic skit by veteran comedian
Wanda Sykes, ‘Even as little girls we’ re taught we have something
everybody wants—you gotta protect it, you gotta be careful, you gotta
cherish it. That’ s alot of fucking pressure! | would like a break! You know
what would make my life so much easier? Wouldn’ t it be wonderful if our

New York to Chicago, Minneapolis, San Francisco and Los Angeles.

While | was in New York, a nun was raped. When | got to Chicago,
the rapist was also there. He had given himself up to the police. On stage |

| was told by everybody that BP was loathed in New Orleans. So now | have to pick a jury in
New Orleans for the very same conduct the company pleaded guilty to. And BP had paid a
zillion dollars to every fisherman and stripper in New Orleans who claimed the spill

educated people, and—in New York City this happens—they want doormen and bus drivers,
what they want is to rely on visceral hatred for the target and also a visceral reliance on
Uncle Sam, as opposed to the facts.

When that happens, | want to blow my brains out, because that’s not how prosecutors
should behave. Prosecutors always should have the righteous case, and it should only be
crafty defense attorneys who want to obscure the facts. When | want the smart jurors

Key questions

e Is the nascent growth recovery sustainable? Will the Fed stimulus boost growth?

e How will the election result change fiscal policy deliberations?

® Can politicians find an agreement to avoid a sharp fiscal contraction in early 2013 (i.e. the fiscal cliff)?

CIO View (Probability: 70%*) Moderate expansion
¢ The economy stays on a moderate growth path but the unemployment rate comes down only very gradually - the
September report exaggerated the pace of improvement. Core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation stays
slightly below or close to the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. UBS forecasts real GDP growth of 2.0% in 3Q 2012
(consensus: 1.8%) and 1.6% in 4Q 2012 (consensus: 1.9%). The Fed has added considerable stimulus: it extended
Operation Twist and its interest rate forward guidance, indicated that it will stay highly accommodative even after the
recovery strengthens, launched an open-ended agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) purchase program of USD
40bn per month, and shows a strong easing bias tied to the state of the labor market. The Fed actions effectively
mitigate downside growth risks, but they are unlikely to dramatically boost growth.

¢ In the elections, Republicans will likely lose seats in the House on a net basis but retain a majority; we expect them
to be even with Democrats in the Senate. Obama will likely retain the White House. Such an electoral outcome would
prolong the existing gridlock between Republicans and Democrats.

¢ Due to the ongoing political gridlock, we expect modest fiscal tightening. The government will likely let
unemployment benefits phase out and payroll tax cuts expire, but postpone income tax hikes and sequester spending
cuts. Such a decision would lower the federal deficit by 0.7% of GDP, with a likely lower real GDP growth impact as
households could buffer the income loss with lower savings.

A Positive scenario (Probability: 10%*) Strong expansion
¢ Propelled by expansive monetary policy and a fading Eurozone crisis, growth accelerates persistently above 3.0%.
This leads to higher inflation and the Fed responds by halting QE3 and raising rates sooner.

¢ The better economic outlook raises the odds of an Obama reelection and makes it harder for Republicans to gain
seats in Congress. Faster-rising tax collection and a Democratic stronghold leads to some tax hikes and limited
spending cuts. Fiscal policy tightens by about 1.2% of GDP in 2013.

& Negative scenario (Probability: 20%*) Growth recession
¢ US fiscal deleveraging and an escalating Eurozone crisis weigh on the cyclical recovery. Falling profit margins weigh
on business capital expenditures. Real GDP growth deteriorates much further. The Fed massively purchases agency
MBS and Treasuries under its QE3 program.

¢ The debt limit is reached earlier and the Treasury runs out of money before year-end. Political gridlock becomes
dysfunctional, thus sending the country over the fiscal cliff, with fiscal policy tightening by

USD 607 billion (3.7% of UBS estimate of 2013 GDP) in 2013. The US credit rating is downgraded.

PROJECT An Origins Project Scientific Workshop

ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY Challenges of Artificial Intelligence:
Envisioning and Addressing Adverse Outcomes

obesity, non-communicable disease; greater longevity; and lower rates of infant mortality — effectively
stop any serious challenges to the systems being used and further developed.

By 2050, life styles and healthcare across the US and many other parts of the world are governed by Al
systems that have their roots in the early Al-consult technologies. The advice given to people, the
actions that are imposed on them, the way people are persuaded and encouraged to live their lives in
certain ways, are opaque, and are no longer under transparent direct human control. However, most
people live longer, healthier and happier lives as a result.

There remain several concerns:

e There remains some differentiation in health and well-being related quality of life within society. Some
communities and individuals opt out of Al-consult control, although their health-metrics are typically
very poor in comparison with the rest of society.

e Perhaps troublingly, there are some trends that are hard to make sense of. For instance, there seem to
be fewer cases of mental and physical disability than might be expected. However, with Al-consult
controlling healthcare (and health data) across the board, there are few ways for people to analyze and
study these possible trends.

e Lack of transparency can be a starting point for many adverse outcomes.

e Autonomous devices rely on collecting personal data for performing their tasks. But what happens
when a device starts to know more about its owner than the human itself? How do we ensure the
device does not act in ways that would not act in ways that the owner would not want it to? (Of course
the important question of making sure the data under consideration is protected and does not fall into
malicious hands is a whole other discussion, but let us table that for now.) The classic story of the
Target ads comes to mind, where a teenager was sent ads for pregnancy related products, however,
she had not told her family about the pregnancy.

e Systems might as above might move beyond such areas of health, and provide advice to people on both
their daily decisions and longer-term planning. Such systems might evolve to become personal
advocates who represent people to third parties. This would include both giving advice, and formulating
arguments to make to others, or in making those arguments directly as your representative. These
advocate bots will gradually be useful to a larger and larger fraction of the population, eventually being
useful even as corporate legal counsel and as advisers to CEOs. Strong systems and reliance will raise
reasonable alarms about Al control of people and society. How can we be sure that our these highly
relied upon systems are genuinely advocating for us rather than the interests of others?

DISCUSSION

How can we characterize potential high-threat areas and stay aware of these possibilities even if
these effects are insidious, and occur over long periods of time. What might be done to address
potential poor outcomes? How can people maintain skills, agency, and be empowered, and aware
over time with the expected growth and eventual ubiquity of Al systems that advise and guide?

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027008.txt,"Composition of a pilot
team

- Build an initial software infrastructure for testing
benchmark problems, and to create a common
methodological ground

The pilot team should consist of a scientific board, including a
mutually compatible sub-set of contemporary thinkers in the
field. Its core should consist of a new generation of researchers
that have the resources and impetus to work full-time on the
design, implementation and publication of the project’s
infrastructure. The initial team size should not be large, but
agile and effective (I would suggest about five permanent
researchers, about the same number of dedicated software
developers, and 2-3 slots for visiting scientists at a time).

The initial duration should be about 2.5 years, followed be an
evaluation, and a possible continuation of similar length.

Possible candidates for the scientific board include (in no
particular order) Paul Rosenbloom (who worked with Alan
Newell on the cognitive architecture Soar, and now started a
new architecture), John Sowa (well-known for his
groundbreaking work in semantic networks), Ben Goertzel
(designer of the cognitive architecture OpenCog), Luc Steels (an
Al researcher studying the emergence of natural language in
communities of software agents), Jerome Feldman (who
devised building blocks for a Neural Theory of Language),
Stephen Pinker (who thought much about the relationship
between language and mental representation), Stephen
Kosslyn (an expert on the psychology of mental
representation), Daniel Dennet, Cristiano Castelfranchi (an Al
researcher specializing on mental representations of intentions
and social context), and many others.

The project should start out with a number of kickoff
meetings to invite the interaction between suitable candidates,
and the formation of a core group. The eventual pilot team
could be located in many possible places, however, the project
should be able to draw on the vicinity of academic and other
infrastructure, and the influence of a creative environment.

About me VJoscha Bach):

Driven by an interest to learn hot the mind works, I studied philosophy
and psychology, graduated in computer science/artificial intelligence, lead
several small academic research groups, built the cognitive architecture
MicroPsi and obtained a PhD in cognitive science. I co-founded a couple of
startup companies in Berlin, but turned back towards academia to
contribute to the question of how to build a mind.

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025530.txt,"Kramper cannot conceal his respect for Bannon’s ability to move a crowd. He was greeted by “frenetic
applause” in his recent address before France’s National Front party, Kramper writes, demonstrating his
“impressive potential,” which the writer describes as “dangerous.”

In the mind of his audience, Bannon is something of a miracle-worker, Stamper notes, having “done the
impossible” by bringing Donald Trump into the White House.

The reason Bannon is dangerous, Kramper continues, is because he “lays out the political program of a
worldwide right: He has already conquered the USA; now Europe and then the whole world will follow.”

“You are part of a worldwide movement that is bigger than France, bigger than Italy, bigger than Hungary,
bigger than all that,” Bannon told French populists.

Bannon showed that he “dominates the mood against the ‘elites,’ the ‘establishment’ and the ‘perverse
system’ of greedy corporations and banks, and of course also against the press, which is led around ‘like a
dog on the Leash,’” Stamper writes.

And now he Mr. Bannon setting himself up as an instigator, if not an outright shepherd, of a movement that
crosses borders, languages and parties.

“Bannon is a master of apocalyptic rhetoric,” Stamper continues, effortlessly weaving together nationalist
interests with an international populist movement.

The American strategist showed his “true caliber” by expounding modern methods of political freedom
through blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies, Stamper said, leaving many of his hearers behind.
Bannon has demonstrated that if the right wants to rule the future, “it must dominate modern themes and
rhetorically position them,” he added.

Aspiring to be far more than an uncle who tells stories to his nephews of how he won the fight for the White
House, Stamper writes, “Bannon wants to become the super godfather of the international right.”

Although Bannon often looks a bit disheveled, “he should not be underestimated,” the writer warns. Past
business partners attribute impressive “strategic foresight” to the eccentric tactician, saying he was often
“three or four steps ahead” of his opponents in business. Because of his phenomenal memory, his nickname
is “the encyclopedia,” Stamper notes with a certain reverence, and in his speeches he will spontaneously cite
“forgotten thinkers, known only to a handful of specialists.”

“Bannon brings with him exclusive knowledge of power from the very heart of power,” Stamper writes,
which he will bring to bear on Europe’s fragmented populist populism.

According to Stamper, Bannon has established his “European headquarters” in Italy, from where he intends
to galvanize European populists.

The Italian political situation is completely to his liking, Stamper declares, with a political landscape
“dominated by populists, right-wing ideologues and the political puppeteer Berlusconi.”

3. BUY the hell out of Russia -- Exxon Rex is a cabinet trifecta for Koch Brothers.

A. And there's Exxon Rex. Any contribution from Exxon received money from Koch -- and vice versa.
Rex Tillerson is worth $151 million and is leaving Exxon next year. He seems to have accepted
secretary of state position. He inked a deal worth $300 billion in oil and gas exploration in 2012. (For
that, he received the highest civilian honour bestowed by Russia). This will be a boom for Koch
Industries as the sanctions against Russia are lifted. (Thank you Uncle Vlad for interfering in the
elections). This will be a boom for Russia -- for equities, FX and bonds. It is clear that sanctions
against Russia will be lifted regardless of whether Russia interfered in the elections. (Clinton made
this a campaign issue and still lost!).

B. Anyone who thinks this will be reversed by Greenpeace or other green organization is kidding
themselves. The Senate and House is Republican. Majority parties control all committees so they
control the agenda. The agenda is set. These guys are geniuses with the news cycle. And the vast
array of think tanks controlled by the Koch Brothers (most of them) allows them to control the news
cycle as well as the opinion pages of newspapers. The web on control on public opinion from the
Koch Brothers reaches every newspaper through a large array of think tanks like the AEI and Cato
Institute, not to mention the vast array of Koch think tanks.

C. If you don't like this, tough luck. Life is not fair. This is not going to be reversed. Think of it as
watching a science experiment. Bush lost the popular vote to Gore in 2001 and completely reversed
policies on tax, environment, Middle East, energy, fracking, birth control, and LGBT issues. Trump,
Pence, Bannon and Koch will make a deal which will be a hybrid of religious right on moral issues and
zero intrusion from government” in commerce. Republicans already control the Senate, the House, a
majority of governorships as well as a majority of attorneys general. It will be very hard to reverse
this. And if Trump can deliver jobs to the midwest red states, more senate seats will turn red. Tom
Pyle's list of things to for the Department of Energy's transition team is expressly designed to do this.
This includes new oil and gas leasing projects, more fracking, more coal, more LNG projects -- and a
green light for both the Keystone and Dakota pipelines. The working paper reneges on the Paris pact,
the Clean Power Plan and the carbon tax. And it is expressly a climate change denial policy. States
like North Dakota, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Iowa, Texas, Louisiana, West Virginia, Kansas and
others will come to life again.. Most of these states have small populations but each gets a governor
and two senators.

The USD is a case in point, with the higher US rates creating a significant gap to
equivalent Euro and JPY rates. With the ECB likely to extend QE by the full current
amount (despite the debate over timing) and the BO) committed to capping JGB yields
at zero, a surge higher in the USD was the logical outcome. Given that the biggest gap
in intentions was relative to Japan it is perhaps not surprising that the JPY has been the
biggest victim, with the JPY falling some 10% against the USD since the election. The
DXY has broken out of the top end of the trading range it has been in since early 2014.

The stronger USD is not just reliant on higher yields, but also other factors such as the
likely repatriation of money into the US under a new proposal for US corporates to
return funds at a concessionary tax rate, generally referred to as HIA2.

We had positioned long USD as well as short rates, not so much as an explicit play on a
Trump victory but more against a more hawkish Fed in 2017. We were also of the view
though that a Trump win would likely be positive for the USD and higher yields. Going
back to our fixed income strategists’ point that the dot plot should now perhaps be the
base case for the markets that does imply higher yields which should continue to be
dollar supportive. Like their bond yield forecasts though our strategists call for a
modest further appreciation of the USD rather than a huge surge. They have the USD
peaking at 1.02 vs the EUR, 120 against the JPY and 1.43 vs the CAD.

So the big violent move has likely happened even if we still see the USD strengthening
further next year. Certainly our FX strategists are not calling for a surge in the USD
similar to the one that happened in 2014/15.

The reaction of the US economy to “Trumponomics” is key

These two things are important for other asset classes. If we really thought 10Y
Treasuries were heading to 3%, the Fed likely to tighten above the dot plot and the USD
to surge another 10% in quick order, the impact on other asset classes would likely be
more severe. That would undoubtedly exacerbate the trends we have seen out of EM
and long duration equities. We also suspect it would make it much harder for
commodities to perform. We see holding USD and short rates positions as necessary to
hedge against such an outcome with limited downside risk if it does not happen.

Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire Bill Clinton pal who just left jail after completing a sentence for
soliciting sex with a minor, may be headed back soon: The Daily Beast reports that the Justice
Department is investigating him for child trafficking.

Epstein, famous for being rich, being friends with Bill Clinton, having an egg-shaped penis, and
being a vindictive pervert, can't be prosecuted again for the charges he copped to in his plea deal.

But according to The Daily Beast's Conchita Sarnotf, new charges might be coming:

As we learned in Vanity Fair yesterday, Bill Clinton has spent his post-presidential life...Read
more

Federal investigators continue to investigate Epstein's activities, to see whether there is evidence
of child trafficking-a far more serious charge than the two in his non-prosecution agreement, the
arrangement between Epstein and the Department of Justice allowing him to plead guilty to
lower-level state crimes, Trafficking can carry a 20-year sentence.

Since there's no statute of limitations for sex-trafficking, and Epstein's predatory adventures
apparently date back more than a few years, it's likely there's more women who could come
forward. (Apparently some have contacted a lawyer, but nothing's been filed yet.)

It's not just Epstein, either—his buddy Jean Luc Brunel, head of the MC2 modeling agency, is

also being investigated, and some of the models he represented (many from overseas) may have
been enlisted as companions on Epstein's private jet.

Conchita Sarnoff has developed multimedia communication programs for Fortune 500 companies and has produced three current events 
debate television programs, The Americas Forum, From Beirut to Kabul, and a segment for The Oppenheimer Report. She is writing a 
book about child trafficking in America. 
Hedge fund mogul and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who went free this week, lived in a depraved world of thrice-daily massages, 
pornographic artwork, and hush money—that's only now being revealed. Conchita Sarnoff follows up on her investigation of the legal 
wrangling that saved him from a long prison term and reports on the sordid details in part two of her exclusive exposé. Also: 
• Palm Beach's police chief objected to Epstein's special treatment and gave The Daily Beast an exclusive look at his nine-hour 
deposition about the investigation. 
• Earlier versions of the U.S attorney's charaes. includina a sealed 53-naae indictment, could have landed Epstein in nrison for 20 years. 
• Victims  a lle creel that Epstein mn1PctPd iindPra tTP trirls from South America. FurnnP and the former Soviet rPnriblicc includinu three 19- 
year-old girls brought over from France as a birthday gift. 
• The victims also alleged trips out of state and abroad on Epstein's private jets, which would be evidence of sex trafficking—a much 
more serious federal crime than the state charges Epstein was convicted of. 
• Epstein's attorneys investigated members of the Palm Beach Police Department, while others ordered private investigators to follow and 
intimidate the victims' families; one even posed as a police officer. 
• Then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales told The Daily Beast that he would have instructed the Justice Department to pursue justice 
without making a political mess. 
Film director Roman Polanski is not the only convicted pedophile to walk free this month and return to a life of privilege. On Wednesday, 
hedge fund manager Jeffrey Epstein completes his one-year house arrest in Palm Beach, which has been even less arduous than Polanski's 
time at a Swiss ski chalet. 
Watch Jeffrey Epstein Storm Out of a Deposition When Asked About His Penis 
During Epstein's term of house arrest, he made several trips each month to his New York home and his private Caribbean island. In the 
earlier stage of his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor-13 months in the Palm Beach Stockade—he was allowed out to his 
office each day. Meanwhile, Epstein has settled more than a dozen lawsuits brought by the underage girls who were recruited to perform 
massages at his Palm Beach mansion. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a scheduled trial; each received 
well over $1 million—an amount that will hardly dent Epstein's $2 billion net worth.

But the question remains: Did Epstein's wealth and social connections—former President Bill Clinton; Prince Andrew; former Israeli 
Prime Minister Ehud Barak; New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson; and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers were just a few of the 
prominent passengers on his private jets—allow him to receive only a slap on the wrist for crimes that carry a mandatory 20-year 
sentence? Was he able, with his limitless assets and heavy-hitting lawyers—Alan Dershowitz, Gerald Lefcourt, Roy Black, Kenneth Starr, 
Guy Lewis, and Martin Weinberger among them—to escape equal justice? 
Epstein Faces Sex-Traffic Probe 
http://www.thedailyb...obref=obnetwork 
The Justice Denartment is investigating Jeffrey Enstein for child trafficking The Daily Beast has learned—and has widened the scone n 
its probe to include a famous modeling agency. 
Hedge-fund manager Jeffrey Epstein completed his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor last week. But it appears his problems 
may not be over. Now The Daily Beast has learned that: 
• Federal investigators continue to investigate Epstein's activities, to see whether there is evidence of child trafficking—a far more serious 
charge than the two in his non-prosecution agreement, the arrangement between Epstein and the Depat___Intent of Justice allowing him to 
nlearl cmiltv to lnwer-level ctate rrimec Trafficking can ran-v a 911-vear centenre 
• The FF1T is also investigating Enstein's friend Jean T tic flninel whose MC2 modeling agency annears to have been a source of girls from 
'-
overseas who ended up on Epstein's private jets. 
D 
Because Epstein's predatory habits stretch back many years and involved dozens of young-looking girls, there may well be more evidence 
to uncover. 
Under the concept of double ieopardy, Epstein can no longer be prosecuted for any of the charges covered by his non-prosecution 
agreement, in which he agreed to serve a short term of incarceration, fund the civil suits of named victims, and register as a sex offender. 
The victims who accepted cash settlements in these civil suits agreed not to 
testifyagainst him or speak publicly about the case. However, 
- 
new evidence developed by the Depal___Intent of Justice on other offenses not covered by the agreement, 
victims who come forward, could lead to new charges. There is no statute of limitations in the federal sex-trafficking law, which was also 
enacted by the state of Florida in 2002. Because his predatory habits stretch back many years and involved dozens of young-looking girls, 
there may well be more evidence to uncover. (Several young women who claim to be Epstein victims have recently contacted a Ft. 
Lauderdale lawyer, but to date no new civil complaints have been filed.) 
including allegations by additional

• Billionaire Pedophile Goes Free 
These new developments come one week after the publication of two articles in The Daily Beast about Epstein's pattern of sexual contact 
with underage girls, which Palm Beach police began investigating in 2005 and the U.S. Attorney's office then settled in a 2007 plea deal. 
The first article quoted a deposition by then-Palm Beach Chief of Police Michael Reiter, in which he stated that Epstein, a billionaire with 
many powerful friends, had received special treatment in both his plea deal and the terms of his incarceration. Although federal 
investigators at one point produced a draft 53-page indictment against Epstein, he was eventually allowed to plead guilty to only two 
relatively minor state charges and receive a short term of incarceration: 13 months in the county jail, during which he went to the office 
every day, and one year of community control, during which he traveled frequently to New York and his private island in the Virgin 
Islands. 
The Daily Beast has now discovered another instance in which Epstein apparently received special consideration: As a convicted sex 
offender, he is required by law to undergo an impartial psychological evaluation prior to sentencing and to receive psychiatric treatment 
during and after incarceration. This is because child molesters tend to be repeat offenders with high rates of recidivism. According to a 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029626 
source in law enforcement, however, Epstein was allowed to submit a report by his private psychologist, Dr. Stephen Alexander of Palm 
Beach, Florida, whose phone has since been disconnected with no forwarding information. 
The Daily Beast's second article provided details about Epstein's systematic abuse of underage girls at his Palm Beach mansion, where 
members of his staff allegedly recruited and paid a parade of teenagers, most of them 16 or younger, to perform daily massages that 
devolved into masturbation, groping, and sometimes full-blown sexual contact. It also revealed a monetary relationship between Epstein 
and Jean Luc Brunel, a frequent visitor to whom he gave $1 million around the same time that Brunel was starting his MC2 modeling 
agency. Some of the young girls MC2 recruited from overseas—often from Eastern Europe and South America—are known to have been 
passengers on Epstein's private jets. 
The U.S. Attorney General's Office in Florida says that it is against policy to confirm or deny the existence of an investigation. Jeffrey 
Epstein's lawyer, Jack Goldberger, says he has no knowledge of an ongoing probe, and he told The Daily Beast, Jeffrey Epstein has fully 
complied with all state and federal requirements that arise from the prior proceedings in Palm Beach. There are no pending civil lawsuits. 
There are not and should not be any pending criminal investigations, given Mr. Epstein's complete fulfillment of all the terms of his non-
prosecution agreement with the federal government. 
Conchita Sarnoff has developed multimedia communication programs for Fortune 500 companies and has produced three current-events 
debate TV programs, The Americas Forum, From Beirut to Kabul, and a segment for The Oppenheimer Report. She is writing a book 
about child trafficking in America.

questionable ties to Tunisian oligarchs, corrupt presidents of
former Soviet republics, and Mu’ammar Gadhafi, among other
entanglements, many of which were explored in a Vanity Fair
article headlined THE TROUBLE WITH ANDREW.

“The duke has a record of being loyal to his friends,” a “royal
source” told Vanity Fair's Edward Klein. “Take his feelings for
Sarah Ferguson. If you are a prince and you bring a woman into
the royal life and, for whatever reasons, she’s spit out, you might
have feelings of debt toward her. The duke feels that she’s been
spattered and rejected. His close relationship with the Duchess
of York is problematic, and there have been many problems over
the last 5 to 10 years, all of which stem from the duchess. Some
of the behavior of the duchess is inconsistent with being mar-
ried to, or an ex-wife of, the duke, There’s no question but that
Sarah’s been a financially self-destructive element in the -duke’s
life.”

“The same kind of loyalty manifested itself last December,
when the duke visited Epstein at his home in New York,” said a

spokesperson for Buckingham Palace. “Epstein was a friend of ~
the duke’s for the best part of 20 years. It was the first time in 7
four years that he'd seen Epstein. He now recognizes that the —

meeting in December was unwise.”

“Don’t expect to see a photo of the two of them together,” =

another “royal source” would say.

deposition in 2009. See Deposition Notice attached as Exhibit “BB.” Maxwell was represented
by Brett Jaffe of the New York firm of Cohen and Gresser, and Edwards understood that her
attorney was paid for (directly or indirectly) by Epstein. She was reluctant to give her
deposition, and Edwards tried to work with her attorney to take her deposition on terms that
would be acceptable to both sides. The result was the attached confidentiality agreement, under
which Maxwell agreed to drop any objections to the deposition, attached hereto as Exhibit “CC.”
Maxwell, however, contrived to avoid the deposition. On June 29, 2010, one day before
Edwards was to fly to NY to take Maxwell’s deposition, her attorney informed Edwards that
Maxwell's mother was deathly ill and Maxwell was consequently flying to England with no
intention of returning to the United States. Despite that assertion, Ghislaine Maxwell was in fact
in the country on July 31, 2010, as she attended the wedding of Chelsea Clinton (former
President Clinton’s daughter) and was captured in a photograph taken for OK magazine. Photos
from Issue 809 of the publication See US Weekly dated August 16, 2010 are attached hereto as
Exhibit “DD” and Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit “N” at 412.

- 62, Maxwell is not the only important witness to lie to avoid deposition by Edwards.
Upon teview of the message pads that were taken from Epstein’s home in the police trash pulls,
see Exhibit “J” supra, many were from Jean Luc Brunel, a French citizen and one of Epstein’s
closest pals. He left messages for Epstein. One dated 4/1/05 said, “He has a teacher for you to
teach you how to speak Russian. She is 2x8 years old, not blonde. Lessons are free and you can
have your 1 today if you call.” See Messages taken from Jean Luc Brunel are attached hereto as

concerned. When | spoke to the human resources person, including relating my concerns and providing the emails in question, | was
told that no formal complaint of sexual harassment was deemed to be warranted in this case, and that the young woman in question
had agreed to that. By that time | learned of the complaint | had already announced my intentions to leave Case to accept an offer at
ASU—a very difficult decision for me because of my long-standing attachment to the University, and the excellent relations | had with
my colleagues there, both among the faculty and among the administration. Because | was already in Arizona at the time | was asked
not to have any further interaction with the student | agreed to that request because it was basically moot. | was also told that
because it was being handled informally, that (a) it should remain confidential, which |, at least abided by, and (b) if no further
complaints were lodged in that case, that the University would remove the allegation from my record after 5 years, which makes me
surprised that someone violated that written agreement with you.

Re item 6: You report on ASU’s response to item #6 , without including the fact that the University specifically stated there were never
any allegations of sexual misconduct or harassment by me at the University, and the outside complaints were in fact related
specifically to your item #6. Further you neglect to mention that this complaint was by an anonymous third party, not the individual
who was allegedly harassed, who never lodged a complain, and that no specific evidence was provided of the alleged transgression. |
was surprised and dismayed that both ASU and ANU launched investigations on the basis of this but was told by both Universities that
because of my high profile even such unsubstantiated third party complaints at private events unrelated to the University would be
investigated. The complaint was investigated throughly by both ASU and ANU and both came to the conclusion that it was not
credible and no university policies had been violated. . In addition ANU’s investigation, which took a full month found significant
inconsistencies in the allegation, suggesting distortion and fabrication, | will quote from the ANU report. The initial complaint, which in
fact resulted in a temporary suspension by ANU outlined the claim you made in the words you quoted in your note to me, along with
the statement made in the complaint that

It is the University’s understanding that a complaint was lodged directly to the conference organisers at the time of the incident.”

After the investigation, the final report absolved me of any wrongdoing, and indicated information inconsistent with the original claim
and apparent later claims as follows:

“The allegations were made by an observer to the incident.

- The complaint did not identify, nor disclose the identity of the conference attendee who was allegedly touched in

an unwelcome manner.

- The conference attendee who took the ‘selfie’ photo did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference organisers
at the time of the incident (November 2016).

- The conference attendee who witnessed the incident, did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference organisers
at the time of the incident (November 2016).

The photo submitted as part of the complaint does not provide evidence of any physical contact.

- The complainant alleged that a photo exists, showing your hand on the breast of the conference attendee who took
the ‘selfie’ photo. This photo was not made available to the Australian National University, although it was requested
in the course of the investigation.”

(And for the record | often put my hand up in front of a camera if there is a flash, as | specifically request selfies not to include flashes,
so that | don’t end up with a series bright spots in front of my eyes for the next half hour)

What makes this particular type of allegation so repugnant is that | get asked for literally thousands of selfies, and when people come
up to me they are vulnerable, often shaking, and sometimes overly aggressive. | am particularly proud of the way | attempt to make all
people feel at ease, and respected, rather than humiliated. Thus, this false claim strikes at the heart of what | am about, which is to
acknowledge fans in a way that makes them feel appreciated. As | understand you had a reporter watching me sign books and take
selfies at the CFl conference in Las Vegas this year, that behavior is what they will have witnessed. Moreover, | am proud of the
interactions | have had at both Case and ASU, with students, colleagues and staff. | have had numerous female graduate students,
postdocs, employees, and colleagues, and as ASU attested to you, none of these have ever complained of harassment. Quite the
contrary in fact, as | have worked hard to support them, mentor them, and treat them with respect. | treat others as responsible adults,
and | expect to be treated equally.

"
IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030964.txt,"The location of the meeting is itself suspicious. Prosecutors and other law enforcement
officials normally demand that those seeking a deal come to them.

The fact that Acosta didn’t is another sign — if one were needed — that this was a
capitulation. It also casts further doubt on the claim that Acosta was capitulating for the
purpose of sparing the folks who worked with him in the prosecutor’s office.

The key point, though, is that Ken Starr and Jay Lefkowitz were power players in
Washington — men who might help Acosta down the road.

Readers will be quite familiar with Starr’s background. Lefkowitz was director of cabinet
affairs and deputy executive secretary to the domestic policy council under President
George H.W. Bush. Under President George W. Bush, Lefkowitz served as general counsel
in the Office of Management and Budget and later as deputy director of domestic policy at
the White House.

Accommodating such influential figures must have seemed like a good career move.
Having Starr and Lefkowitz on his side might help Acosta get a judgeship, a cabinet
appointment, or a high-paying job back at Kirkland and Ellis.

I’m speculating, of course. But my speculation finds support in Acosta’s practice of
accommodating the powerful.

Much of that accommodation is of Democrats. Indeed, at the time Acosta was working in
Miami as a U.S. Attorney, he had alienated some Republicans by such accommodation
while at the Department of Justice. Some say he was on the verge of being fired when
Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez parachuted him to Miami. The Epstein settlement was a
way for Acosta to shore up his standing with some influential Republicans.

Will Acosta be able to survive the current scandal? I don’t have a clear sense about this yet.
But President Trump, who isn’t bashful about sacking cabinet members, may come to
believe (if he doesn’t now) that it’s disadvantageous to have a cabinet member who sold out
teenage victims of sexual abuse, especially when the sell-out benefited an ultra-wealthy
serial offender.

* Some on the left are trying to make something or the fact that Starr, who had investigated
Bill Clinton in connection with sexual misconduct, later defended Epstein, a pervert. This is
silly.

In both instances, Starr was doing his job as a lawyer. Perverts are entitled to a defense and
there is nothing hypocritical about investigating Bill Clinton’s misconduct when that was
Starr’s job and later joining the team that was defending Jeffrey Epstein.

Acosta, by contrast, was on the team seeking justice for Epstein and for his victims. He
gave up this quest for reasons that can’t be defended.

This is what I want, | reminded myself as Richard wound his hand in my hair and pulled
my head back. His teeth bruising my shoulder felt familiar and wrong. A kiss on my neck
sent me rigid. Sobs nearly choked me. Why now, my heart cried, why not when you were
who I dreamed of, Richard?

I couldn't fault his empathy -- he pulled away. No, I said unwillingly, I'm fine,” but he
wouldn't continue. Uneasily, he pointed out that I'd never reacted like that. I said he'd
never kissed me like that, and he asked, Really? as if it were a surprise.

Yes, I thought, forcing my tears away. / was desperate for it. I know.

To get him to keep hurting me, I had to convince him that I was fine. This is what I want,
I coached myself. I was nearly composed when Richard mentioned Andrew, and I felt
grief rip me open.

He watched me cry, got me a glass of water. Shades of two years ago, I might have
thought, but I never did. I apologized; he said only, I thought this might happen. On
some level, I knew that I had, too -- for all my self-reassurances that I would be fine.
What was I thinking? | asked myself, and the answer came instantly. / had to know.

When Richard asked if I wanted to sleep over, I said I didn't. Then don't go yet, he said
softly, putting his arms around me where I lay. I rested my head on his chest. / won't tell
Andrew about this, | decided, wondering if he and I would be together again. Even if I've
learned that I don't want Richard anymore.

te OK ok

In retrospect, it seems surreal that I reacted so badly to my BDSM orientation. The
agonizing memories of my adjustment have lost their emotional flavor. I've learned a lot
about how to practice BDSM safely -- physically and emotionally. I've had multiple
BDSM partners, and I've had positive experiences in the welcoming BDSM subculture.
In recent times, I've even begun to switch: occasionally I'll be the dominant partner,
though I feel submissive masochism far closer to my core.

Still, I remember the unease I felt at first -- and I recognize stronger unease in others. I
certainly wouldn't describe this orientation to, say, an employer. I believe BDSM needs a
liberation movement, just like homosexuality, but I'm not (yet?) ready to be a public
spokeswoman. And I definitely wouldn't consider dragging others out of the closet. I
write about BDSM under a pseudonym, and I have changed the names of Richard and
Andrew.

I fear that others will read this narrative as describing an assault, a near-rape -- and a
woman who tried to rationalize her experience by embracing it. That's not what
happened. When Richard first pulled my head back and hurt me at that drunken outdoor
party, I could have said no. The word was echoing in my mind, waiting on my lips, and I
didn't say it because I didn't want him to stop. I was certainly intoxicated, but I wasn't
helpless. I was threatened, but I was not afraid. I may have fought self-actualization like a
caged animal, but I could not deny it. I have always been this way.

businesses and professions (DNFBPs) (e.g., casinos, accountants, attorneys, dealers in precious metals and stones,
real estate agents).

For additional guidance, please refer to the Financial Action Task Force and Mutual Evaluations sections.

For additional guidance on international perspectives, please refer to the International Perspectives and Initiatives

14. What are the consequences of not complying with AML laws and regulations?

The consequences of noncompliance with AML laws and regulations may include regulatory enforcement actions,
civil and criminal penalties, seizure and forfeiture of funds, and incarceration for the individuals involved. Depository
institutions also may be subject to restrictions on growth and expansion and, in the extreme, may have their
charters/licenses revoked, a consequence known as the “death penalty.” For additional guidance, please refer to the
Enforcement Actions section.

15. What factors are considered by law enforcement when it assesses whether an institution
or its personnel are guilty of aiding and abetting money laundering or terrorist financing?

When assessing whether an institution or its personnel are guilty of aiding and abetting money laundering or terrorist
financing, the authorities consider, among other factors, the following “standards of knowledge”:

e Reckless Disregard — Careless disregard for legal or regulatory requirements and sound business practice

® Willful Blindness — Deliberate ignorance and failure to follow up in the face of information that suggests
probable money laundering or illicit activity

e Collective Knowledge - Aggregates/attributes the knowledge of employees to the employing company

It is important to remember that under U.S. law, a company may, in general, be held liable for the actions of its
employees, regardless of the number or level of employees involved in the wrongdoing.

Overview of the U.S. Regulatory Framework

Key U.S. Regulatory Authorities and Law Enforcement
Agencies

16. Who has the authority to assess penalties for violations of AML laws and regulations?

Authority to assess civil penalties rests with the Secretary of the Treasury and is delegated to the Financial Crimes
Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the primary federal regulators or Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs) (e.g.,
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority [FINRA]). Some state regulatory agencies have their own authority to assess
civil penalties, as well. Criminal penalties are determined through legal proceedings at state or federal levels. The
Department of Justice (DOJ) can bring criminal and civil actions, as well as forfeiture actions.

17. Who are the primary federal banking regulators and what are their responsibilities?
The five federal banking regulators include:

e The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) oversees state-chartered banks and trust
companies that belong to the Federal Reserve System, financial holding companies, bank holding companies
(BHC) and thrift holding companies.

e The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) regulates federally charted banks (e.g., state-chartered
banks that do not belong to the Federal Reserve System) as well as state-chartered thrifts.

e The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) regulates federally chartered banks (e.g., banks that
have the word “National” in or the letters “N.A.” after their names as well as federal thrifts).

¢ The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) regulates federally chartered credit unions.

ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY

e Noconsensus reality, inability to coordinate large-scale positive action
e Concrete version of emergent social failure from Al technology

DISCUSSION

Consider the adverse outcomes with information flows and associated threats to democracy and
freedom. What surprises might lurk in our future around costly outcomes in this realm? How
might we thwart attacks on manipulating content from people, and on harnessing or hacking
someone’s identity? What might be done to thwart a march to adverse outcomes for information,
freedom of thought, democracy? What recommendations might be made about steps for moving
forward?

POTENTIAL GOALS

e Seek a better understanding of the technological, social, political and economic aspects around
uses of Al for generating, optimizing information and propaganda.

e Identify potential blueprints for institutional interventions that may prevent/slow/detect the
scenario unfolding

e Develop ideas for coordinating relevant actors (advertising agencies, political parties) and/or
carriers (media outlets, digital platforms) to prevent the worst versions of the scenario.

e Identify potential approaches to thwarting attacks harnessing identify, including certification of
identity by owners, identifying mechanisms for thwarting generation and distribution of false
content. Possibilities of new approaches to minimizing threat with fines, other regulatory activity.

Described as feeling like a ‘family wedding’, guests included former Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, Terry McAuliffe, Governor of Virginia, and leading figure in the civil rights movement Vernon

Jordan.
For Maxwell to remain a Clinton chum is an interesting turn of events.

Just two years earlier, her former lover and friend Jeffrey Epstein was sentenced to 18 months behind bars

after pleading to a single state charge of soliciting prostitution. He served 13 months in prison.

President Clinton had been so close to both to Epstein he had joined him on his private jet and stayed on

his private Caribbean island.

Speaking to the Mail On Sunday in 2011, Virginia Roberts - who claims in court papers she was kept as
Epstein's 'sex slave' and forced to sleep with Prince Andrew three times - said she met President Clinton

twice, but was never ‘lent out’.

Buckingham Palace vehemently denies the claims, as does Maxwell. Her legal team stresses she was not
involved in, or connected to the criminal proceedings against Epstein and with regards to Virginia

Roberts' claims, they stressed she denies each and every allegation.

Virginia, now a married mother of three, claimed that President Clinton traveled with Epstein to a number
of destinations, including three times on the billionaire’s private jet, and enjoyed intimate dinners with
both him and Maxwell.

On one occasion, she said that Epstein flew the former President, Hollywood actor and staunch Democrat

Kevin Spacey and another actor friend of Mr Clinton’s, Chris Tucker, to Africa, to ‘discuss AIDS policy’.

Epstein, who has donated more than £75,000 over the years to candidates from the Democratic Party,
also flew with President Clinton in November 2003 to destinations including Russia, Oslo, Hong Kong,

Shanghai and Beijing.

On one occasion, she alleged, Epstein did invite two young brunettes to a dinner which he gave on his
island for President Clinton shortly after he left office. But, as far as she knows, the ex-President did not
take the bait.

Maxwell declines to comment on Prince Andrew allegations

`Blahblahs' forbidden in 'Radical Breakthroughs'. So we need two replacements (for Multiverse as Science 
and Rare Sentience). 
Initial ideas: 
* Expand the first episode Mathematics and Truth into two or likely three episodes. I'm intrigued by this 
because there is so much rich material - pure math, philosophy (discovered or invented), physics (Wigner's 
'unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences)', astrophysics, cosmology, biology, 
general systems theory. I've felt frustrated in this first episode because there is so much material. I think 
three episodes could work - if you agree, I'll get back to you with a suggested structure of the 2 or likely 3 
parts. Also, Closer To Truth has had only a few videos and one episode on mathematics per se (out of 277 
episodes!), so this would be original and complementary. In this may, math would become about half the 
series. 
* Integrated Information Theory - quantifying and explaining consciousness (Giulio Tononi, Un 
of Wisconsin-Madison), plus supporters and critics. New controversial, science-based radical theory. 
* Evolutionary Dynamics - your program at Harvard - mathematical models. This is not an area of my 
expertise, but it could well fit Closer To Truth in general and Radical Breakthroughs in particular. But you 
need to tell me if you would like to include this. 
* Replicability Crisis - Problems in Statistics in Search for Truth. Deep problems of replicability 
in biomedical and especially psychological research - the scandal in recent years. See links 
and attachments.

centralize decision-making into CEDA, chaired by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin
Salman, and reporting to the Council of Ministers. The Ministry of Economy and
Planning also retains an important role, with lower emphasis being put on the Ministry
of Finance. The Project Management Program also suggests emphasis on ongoing
review of capital expenditures, whereby existing review served to examine their approval
process, and control their level. From a macro perspective, the three most important
programs for now are: a) the re-shaping of the Public Investment Fund (PIF) into a
USS2trn Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF); b) the new corporate strategy for Saudi Aramco
to transform it into an energy and industrial conglomerate; and, c) the National
Transformation Plan (NTP) which encompasses medium-term growth boosting
initiatives and fiscal consolidation measures (alongside the Fiscal Balance and

Privatization Programs). We discuss these three elements in turn below.

How We Got to this Point

I said that if] had any sense, I would have left the worms in the can by pretending to
believe (4.1) as Mill did and as the rest of the world seems to do. Charts and tables
confirm his prediction in his and their terms as well as mine. But Piketty’s argument
was rightly criticized for leaving human capital out. Someone might or might not
have faulted mine on the same ground if I had stopped at the end of Chapter 4.
Whether they would have or not, every composer knows that the critic to hear is the
one inside. What that critic told me was to gamble a case already won, open the can,
and follow the argument and worms wherever they lead. That’s why my title

promised other surprises.

I risked following it past clarification into digression when I argued the pay rule. I
since tried to justify the digression, if there was some, by showing how that rule
could explain Piketty’s data for pay/net profit ratios in the twentieth century. And I
tried to show how the pay rule and depreciation theory combined, making pay all
human depreciation and no realized work at the end, gives the only convincing
explanation of age-wage profiles showing rising or steady pay as human capital
grades smoothly to zero. Risk theory reinforced this argument by revealing time
discount rates for human capital as those made plain for physical capital owned by
the same ageing cohorts. Every step was an adventure, and every step led to the
next one. But I opened other questions and cans along the way, and the same critic

tells me to follow the worms a little farther.

I said that the cost of survival is adult consumption for the sake of investment in the
next generation, that pure consumption is more or less the same, and that we will
understand the maximand when we understand pure consumption. These threads
lead into evolutionary biology, which reasons how traits are selected for lineage

survival. The faithful need not take alarm. Although I mean natural selection, divine

CHAPTER FOUR

Secret Agent
“Sure, a whistleblower could use these [computer vulnerabilities], but so could a spy.”

--Edward Snowden in Moscow

The sudden transformation of Snowden in 2006 from a night watchman on a university
campus to secret agent for the CIA provided him with a powerful new identity and one much
closer to the avatars he adopted for his fantasy games. It was burnished so deeply in his self-
image that he cited it eight years in Moscow. When Brian Williams, then a NBC anchorman,
began an hour-long NBC television interview with Snowden in 2014 by saying, “It seems to me
spies probably look a lot more like Ed Snowden and a lot less like James Bond these days,
Snowden approvingly smiled and told him, “I was trained as a spy in sort of the traditional sense
of the word.” Snowden further confirmed his interviewer’s point, sating “I lived and worked
undercover overseas, pretending to work in a job that I'm not, and even being assigned a name
that was not mine.

In reality, Snowden’s employment at the CIA was more prosaic. When he joined the CIA in
2006, he did not have the required experience in maintaining secret communication systems. So
the CIA sent him to its information technology school for six months to train as a communications
officer, not aspy. After completing his training, he was dispatched to the CIA station in Geneva,
Switzerland. He worked there for the next two years as one of dozens of Information
Technologists servicing the CIA’s communication channels in Switzerland. He was stationed
there, according to Swiss registry records, under his own name from March 2007 to February
2009. He was identified as a US State Department employee in Geneva because Switzerland
does not allow any intelligence officers to operate in that country. So officially he was attached
to the permanent U.S. mission to the United Nations which employed hundreds of US
government functionaries in Switzerland. It was a thin cover, since the Swiss government was
aware that the CIA maintained its base in Geneva and posted it employees at the US mission,

Although he would later claim in the video he made in Hong Kong that he had served as a
“senior adviser for the Central Intelligence Agency,” he was merely a telecommunications support
officer, or TSO in CIA parlance, which was a junior level job at the CIA. He worked as part of a
12 man team of information technologists under the supervision of senior CIA officers, according
to a former CIA officer in Geneva. The job of these TSOs was to protect the security of the
CIA’s computer systems through which the CIA station in Geneva sent and received its secret
communications. As far as is known, Snowden made very few friends at the 800-person
mission. The only person there to have publicly reported knowing him in Geneva during this

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014931.txt,"Yelp (Neutral, $43 PO)

Stock view: Likely to be some improvement vs last quarter

Yelp is coming off of a quarter with decelerating app unique devices, weak new
customer adds, and decelerating sales force growth, and it seems likely that one or two
of these metrics will improve. The tone at our recent investor meetings with the CFO
seem to suggest that 4Q issues did not signal a break in the model (see On the road
with Yelp), and we expect an improvement q/q customer adds. We think the company
should be able achieve Street 1Q revenue and EBITDA estimates, though we won’t be
surprised to see the 2Q17 outlook come in slightly below current Street estimates.

For the full year outlook, while we believe the implied expense growth in the 2017
outlook is somewhat conservative, management appears focused on investing in the
business for now and we think upside is more likely to come in 2Q or 3Q. Overall, we
remain somewhat cautious on the stock given potential revenue deceleration due to
tough comps and a deceleration in sales force growth.

On the cost front, management has been clear in its intention to invest in performance
marketing, which could take time to bear fruit. In addition, we believe sales force growth
to stabilize/increase going forward, which would seem to suggest potential cost
headwinds relative to recent quarters. Finally, while we don’t have the specific
financials, the addition of Nowait ($40mn acquisition closed 2/28) likely encompasses a
moderate bump up in opex with limited revenue to offset.

As we look ahead, we are encouraged with the three transitions within company and we
will be looking for progress on the following on the call. The first is connections
between consumers and businesses on Yelp through clicks, reservation services,
ordering, and Request a Quote. The second is a ramp up in performance marketing as
users engage in more measurable events. The third is new customer acquisition via
alternative channels, including national customers from outside sales alongside self-
serve customers via online channels.

Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q: new account adds, app unique devices growth

Given the miss last quarter and pressure on sales force headcount, local advertising
accounts will be important gauge of overall execution. Other key metrics include app
unique devices growth, which has been decelerating since mid-2015 from 51% y/y to
20% in 4Q16. Performance marketing could reverse the trend, but it could take some
time. Finally, while management continues to highlight a decoupling of sales force
growth and topline trends, investors still pay attention to overall sales force growth,
particularly given the three consecutive quarters of deceleration from 44% y/y (1Q16) to
11% y/y (4Q17). Management has indicated that sales force growth in 2017 should be
in the double digits.

Table 30: Key 1Q metrics

Metrics 4Q16A 1Q17E 2Q17E
Claimed Local Business 3,363 3,552 3,/27

http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey-epstein-200303

Q: Did you ever hear while you were at Bear Stearns that Mr. Cayne may have trader or insider
information in connection with St. Joe Minerals Corporation?

Q: Did Mr. Cayne ever have any conversation with you about St. Joe Minerals?

Q: Did you happen to overhear any conversations between Mr. Cayne and anyone else regarding
St. Joe Minerals?

And still later in the questioning comes this exchange:

Q: Have you had any type of business dealings with Mr. Cayne?

A: There’s no relationship with Bear Stearns.

Q: Pardon?

A: Other than Bear Stearns, no.

Q: Have you been a participant in any type of business venture with Mr. Cayne?

Q: Do you have any expectation of participating in any business venture with Mr. Cayne?
Q: Have you had any business participations with Mr. Theram?

A: No; nor do I anticipate any.

Q: Mr. Epstein, did anyone at Bear Stearns tell you in words or substance that you should not
divulge anything about St. Joe Minerals to the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission?

Q: Has anyone indicated to you in any way, either directly or indirectly, in words or substance,
that your compensation for this past year or any future monies coming to you from Bear Stearns
will be contingent upon your not divulging information to the Securities and Exchange
Commission?

A: No.

Despite the circumstances of Epstein’s leaving, Bear Stearns agreed to pay him his annual
bonus—which he anticipated as being approximately $100,000.

The S.E.C. never brought any charges against anyone at Bear Stearns for insider trading in St.
Joe, but its questioning seems to indicate that it was skeptical of Epstein’s answers. Some
sources have wondered why, if he was such a big producer at Bear Stearns, he would have given
it up over a mere $2,500 fine.

Certainly the years after Epstein left the firm were not obviously prosperous ones. His luck
didn’t seem to change until he met Hoffenberg.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027949.txt,"1967 war had turned out to be hollow words. It was time for a new generation,
and a new, more direct, form of confrontation with the “Zionist enemy.”

Arafat had set up camp with nearly a thousand men just across the Jordan
River, in a town called Karameh. From early 1968, they had been launching hit-
and-run raids, not just on the West Bank but into the Negev. Eshkol’s cabinet
was initially divided on whether to attack his base in Jordan, in both an act of
retaliation and a signal to King Hussein that if his army didn’t rein in Arafat’s
men, Israel would take whatever action necessary. But the decisive moment
came on the eighteenth of March. A school bus near Eilat, in the far south of
Israel, hit a Fatah landmine, killing the driver and a teacher, and injuring 10 of
the children.

I was called up the night before the Israeli attack, as part of a small Sayeret
Matkal contingent which was supposed to play a support role. An enormous
pincer operation was mounted around the Fatah camp and Karameh itself:
including a full infantry brigade, the Seventh Armored Brigade and the
paratroopers’ sayeret. But the resistance they met, both from Fatah and
Jordanian troops, was much fiercer than expected. One of the paratroop
commandos, Mookie Betzer, who would go on to join Sayeret Matkal, told me
how they landed by helicopter and immediately came under a hail of AK-47
fire. Within minutes, several of his men had been killed. Mookie was wounded.
The tanks of the Seventh Brigade advanced from the south. Battling the
Jordanian army, they took losses as well. Amnon Lipkin, who would also later
become a friend and colleague, in both the army and Israeli politics, was in
command of a unit of lightly armored French tanks called AMLs. They, too,
were hopelessly outgunned.

Our sayeret assignment was to block the southern entrance to Karameh as
the Israeli armored force advanced. But we got bogged down in mud as we
made our way from the Jordan River. By the time we arrived, hundreds of
Arafat’s men had already fled the area. Arafat, too, had escaped, on the back of a
motorcycle.

By the time the fighting was over, some two hundred Fatah fighters had been
killed. But nearly 30 Israeli soldiers lost their lives as well, and more than twice
that number were wounded. Politically, the outcome was even murkier. Most of
Israel was still basking in our victory in the Six-Day War. Now, we had
deployed many of the same units, only to fight to what looked like a costly
draw. Arafat and Fatah could claim — and soon did — that they had stood and
fought, and inflicted losses on the victors of 1967.

against him would reveal his guilt.

have a trial to establish his innocence. By contrast, he paid to settle the case that would have

the intent to intimidate, discredit and defame Roberts.

prevent Roberts from effectively providing assistance and advocacy on behalf of other victims of

No. Of course not. If your child gets into Yale, send her there. It is
a great place. But you should know what Yale actually has to offer and
what it doesn’t.

If your child wants to be a professor, Yale is the place.

If your child wants to be an intellectual, Yale is the place.

If your child wants to go to law school, Yale is the place.

If your child wants to hobnob with the best and brightest, Yale is

Then what is wrong?

There is a problem only if you think that there is a different reason
to go to college than the reasons I have listed above.

Oh. There is this other problem. Many of the other 3,000 colleges
are trying very hard to imitate Yale. They attempt to provide similar
experiences and they can’t pull it off. Yale is a unique place. The na-
tion can afford only so many unique places, however. We cannot af-
ford having the main university of a state thinking it is Yale, as my
state university friend suggests. If every university has as its main fo-
cus research and not education, then the best and brightest of each
state will be trained, not necessarily willingly, to be academics rather
than practitioners. There will be a great many students who came to
school for an education that will help them in their future lives who
will be disappointed to find out that that is not the type of education
being offered.

Professors at Yale are playing the prestige game. Unfortunately,
they are hardly alone in this.

My state university professor again:

We definitely want to be part of the superstar system but we have
no superstars. If we had them, we would probably lose them to
Harvard and Yale anyway. Nevertheless, we are obsessed with

the National Rankings put out by places like U.S. News and World
Report. Faculty and deans say they are not obsessed with them,
but rankings are an important part of the evaluation process and
shape a department’s growth. We want to be in the top 4 or 5
universities. We are not but that’s what we want to be.

Unemployment Benefits: Bad News

Although economists have shown that extended availability of UI
[unemployment insurance] benefits will increase unemployment duration, the
effect in the latest downturn appears quite small compared with other
determinants of the unemployment rate. Our analyses suggest that extended
UI benefits account for about 0.4 percentage point of the nearly 6 percentage
point increase in the national unemployment rate over the past few years. It is
not surprising that the disincentive effects of UI would loom small in the midst
of the most severe labor market downturn since the Great Depression.

Despite the relatively minor influence of extended UI, it is important to note that
the 0.4 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate represents about
600,000 potential workers who could become virtually unemployable if their
reliance on UI benefits were to continue indefinitely.

myself stuck in the middle of a West Bank town. To the obvious shock of the
Palestinians, I floored the accelerator and raced toward Tel Aviv. It still took
half-an-hour. Misha and Dan, who lived closer to the kirva, were already in the
bunker.

Ten Scuds hit near Tel Aviv and Haifa that night. It was not until shortly
before dawn that our tracker units got back to us with formal confirmation that
there had been no chemical warheads. The rockets caused a half-dozen injuries,
though thankfully none was serious. Still, the very fact Saddam had proven he
could hit Israel with ballistic missiles provoked widespread alarm. Well into the
next morning, the streets were almost empty. Misha phoned Cheney and
strongly implied we were going to have to attack the Scud sites. I know that was
Misha’s own view, and it only hardened after another four missiles hit the Tel
Aviv area the next morning. Again, no one was killed, but several dozen people
were injured from debris, shards of glass and blast concussion. I visited several
of the areas that had been hit and was shocked by the scale of the damage. One
four-story apartment building had been virtually destroyed, and there was blast
damage to other buildings hundreds of yards away.

The Americans were clearly determined, in both word and deed, to persuade
us not to take military action. They rushed an anti-missile system called Patriot
to Israel. Cheney was also giving us frequent updates on American air strikes
against suspected Scud launch sites. And the Israeli public did seem to grasp the
serious implications for the US-led coalition of our taking unilateral military
action. Opinion polls suggested most Israelis were giving Shamir credit for the
way he was handling the crisis.

Still, it wasn’t easy for Shamir to hold the line. This was the first time since
1948 that enemy munitions had landed on Israeli homes, provoking not just
fear, but a feeling of helplessness. That inevitably led to calls for the army and
the government to do something. | saw his dilemma first-hand at an emergency
cabinet meeting after the first two Scud attacks. For Arik and Raful, the political
effects on the US coalition were irrelevant. The issue, for them, was simple:
Israeli cities had been attacked, and we should respond with any and all force
necessary. Our air force commander, Avihu Ben-Nun, favored going ahead with
the joint and-and-ground attack we’d prepared, and Misha agreed with him. So
did Dan Shomron. The key voices of caution were Foreign Minister David
Levy; Ariye Deri, the leader of the Sephardi Orthodox party Shas; and two

to the contrary,” that “the legislative purpose is expressed
by the ordinary meaning of the words used.” American
Tobacco Co. v. Patterson, 456 U.S. 68, 68 (1982) (altera-
tions omitted). Whatever the ultimate purpose of interna-

address that question—the immediate purpose of the
immunity provision is expressed in language that Con-
gress typically uses to make one thing continuously equiv-
alent to another.

B

The more natural reading of the IOJA is confirmed by a
canon of statutory interpretation that was well established
when the IOIA was drafted. According to the “reference”
canon, when a statute refers to a general subject, the
statute adopts the law on that. subject as it exists whenever
a question under the statute arises. 2 J. Sutherland,
Statutory Construction §§5207-5208 (3d ed. 1948). For
example, a statute allowing a company to “collect the same
tolls and enjoy the same privileges” as other companies
incorporates the law governing tolls and privileges as it
exists at any given moment. Snell v. Chicago, 1388 II]. 418,
437-489, 24 N. E. 582, 5387 (1890). In contrast, a statute
that refers to another statute by specific title or section
number in effect cuts and pastes the referenced statute as
it existed when the referring statute was enacted, without
any subsequent amendments. See, e.g., Culver v. People
ex rel. Kochersperger, 161 Ill. 89, 95-99, 43 N. E. 812, 814—
815 (1896) (tax-assessment statute referring to specific
article of another statute does not adopt subsequent
amendments to that article).

Federal courts have often relied on the reference canon,
explicitly or implicitly, to harmonize a statute with an
external body of law that the statute refers to generally.

On the morning of April 1, 1991. I got up even earlier than usual, to visit the
graves of the men who had lost their lives in my battalion in the Yom Kippur
War. I also went to pay my respects to Uzi Yairi, killed when he’d rushed from
his desk in the kiryva to join the Sayeret Matkal attack at the Savoy Hotel. Then
Nava and I drove to Jerusalem. At Israel’s national military cemetery on Mount
Herzl, we stood before the resting place of Nechemia Cohen, Yoni Netanyahu,
Dado, and Avraham Arnan. From there, we went to the Prime Minister’s office.
With Dan Shomron and his wife looking on, Shamir presented me with my third
star and formally made me chief of staff.

For years, I'd developed the habit of carrying around a notebook in which
I’d jot down thoughts on things I thought that the Israeli military, and I as an
officer, could have done better: errors, oversights, and how we might fix them.
In the weeks before becoming ramatkal, I'd filled dozens of pages on issues
large and small I hoped to address as the commander of the armed forces. A lot
of them dealt with what I sensed was an erosion of cohesiveness in the army,
and, since ours was a citizen military, a fraying of the relationship between the
army and Israeli society. To some degree, this was inevitable in a country now
nearly 45 years old: developed economically and free of the kind of existential
threat we’d faced in the early years of the state. But the political divisions over
the war in Lebanon, and morale-sapping need to quell the violence on the West
Bank and in Gaza had further strained our unity of purpose.

Militarily, we were now indisputably strong enough to defeat any of the
Arab armies, even if they launched a joint attack as in 1973. Our most important
overseas ally, the United States, was committed to helping us retain that
position — what both we and they called Israel’s “qualitative edge” — in the
interest of our security and their own. But we were facing a series of new,
unconventional challenges. One of them, which had come on to Dan Shomron’s
and my radar over the past year, was Iran. Though geographically distant, it was
potentially the most serious in the longer run, as Dan himself warned Israelis in
his final interview as chief of staff. Iran was likely to become even more
assertive regionally now that the Gulf War had weakened its neighbor and rival,
Iraq. We also knew, from our intelligence sources, that the Iranians were
making preliminary efforts to develop a nuclear weapon.

and every form of judicial process as is enjoyed by foreign
governments.” §288a(b).

The IOIA authorizes the President to withhold, with-
draw, condition, or limit the privileges and immunities it
grants in light of the functions performed by any given
international organization. §288. Those privileges and
immunities can also be expanded or restricted by a partic-
ular organization’s founding charter.

B

When the IOIA was enacted in 1945, courts looked to
the views of the Department of State in deciding whether
a given foreign government should be granted immunity
from a particular suit. If the Department submitted a
recommendation on immunity, courts deferred to the
recommendation. If the Department did not make a rec-
ommendation, courts decided for themselves whether to
grant immunity, although they did so by reference to State
Department policy. Samantar v. Yousuf, 560 U.S. 305,
311-812 (2010).

Until 1952, the State Department adhered to the classi-
cal theory of foreign sovereign immunity. According to
that theory, foreign governments are entitled to “virtually
absolute” immunity as a matter of international grace and
comity. At the time the IOIA was enacted, therefore, the
Department ordinarily requested, and courts ordinarily
granted, immunity in suits against foreign governments.
Ibid.; Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U.S.
480, 486 (1988).1

In 1952, however, the State Department announced that
it would adopt the newer “restrictive” theory of foreign

1The immunity was “virtually” absolute because it was subject to
occasional exceptions for specific situations. In Republic of Mexico v.
Hoffman, 324 U.S. 30 (1945), for example, the State Department
declined to recommend, and the Court did not grant, immunity from
suit with respect to a ship that Mexico owned but did not possess.

Looming tech war

Robert Lawrence Kuhn says the ZTE showdown points to a misunderstanding over motives

s someone who works for US-

China understanding and

roots for US-China partner-

ships, I've been concerned, but

not worried, over what others
have called “a looming trade war”. I've not
worried because tariffs don’t work; they are
bluntinstruments ina globalised economy,
penalising American companies and
consumers as much as Chinese. Most
American experts oppose tariffs, and Presi-
dent Donald Trump likes to make bigdeals
after making big threats.

But I am now worried over what I will
call “a looming tech war”, because the
structural imperatives fo deeper.

‘As everyone who follows China knows,
the US Department of Commerce has im-
posed a denial of export privileges
against ZTE, China's second-largest tele-
communications equipment manufactur-
er, thus prohibiting US companies from
selling essential electronic components
and software to ZTE, a crippling sanction.

China has responded resolutely, with
actions that seem selected from expert sce-
nario planning, and with rhetoric, both in-
dignation and nationalistic bravado.

From China's perspective, according to
its Ministry of Commerce, “If the United
States attempts to curb China's develop-
ment... it miscalculates. The action targets
China; however, it will ultimately under-
mine the US itself,” affecting tens of thou-
sands of jobs and hundreds of related US
enterprises.

“Targeting technology is like throttling
the neck of the Chinese enterprises,”
wrote China Daily. “The ZTE case should
remind China's decision-makers of the
urgency to become self-sufficient in core
technologies.

President Xi Jinping has been prescient
about domestic control of core technol-
ogies, especially related to the internet and
more recently to artificial intelligence.
Since taking office in 2012, he has stressed
the “hidden risks” that come with core
technologies not being mastered domesti-
cally. He said, “Heavy dependence on im-
ported core technology is like building our
house on top of someone else's walls: no
matter how big and how beautiful it is, it
won't remain standing during a storm.”
Innovation is the first of Xi’s “five major
concepts of development”.

Beijing also claims
that the country itself
is a victim of
discriminatory
policies

From the US perspective, according to
its Department of Commerce, the prone
tion against ZTE is punishment for ZTE vio-
lating US sanctions against Iran and North
Korea, making false statements and ob-
structing justice, and then after reaching a
settlement agreement, violating it.

The United States claims it is not resist-
ing China's rise, but rather the country’s
unfair or illegal means to achieve it. The US
action enumerated four such practices as
rationale for imposing punitive tariffs, all
relating to technology or intellectual prop-
erty: foreign firms in China are required to

form joint ventures and transfer knowl-
onke. as well as license technology with
below-market terms and conditions, while
the state supports Chinese enterprises in
acquiring foreign hi-tech assets, and sanc-
tions commercial cyber theft.

President Trump is wildly unpopular
among American elites, especially among
policy experts, who do notneed much ofan
iticise him—note the fusillade of
attacks on Trump’s tariffs. But these elites
are not criticising Trump on US moves to
counter what they, with unusual consen-
sus, perceive to be China's unfair policies,
and in some cases unlawful programmes,
to becomeaworldleaderin state-of-the-art
technologies, especially AI, information
technology, robotics, advanced manufact-
uring, new energy vehicles, aviation and
biotechnology.

China claims that itis still a developing
country, so different rules apply, a founda-
tional principle of the World Trade Organ-
isation. Beijing also claims that the country
itself is a victim of discriminatory policies
restricting its imports of hi-tech products.

Of course, China had to respond with
appropriate actions as well as confident
words, imposing heavy tariffs on US
sorghum and signalling that additional
agricultural tariffs were at the ready, along
with barely veiled threats against US com-
panies operating in China.

Here's my fear. While I have argued that
most mainstream American experts are not
motivated to impede China's rise, as many
in China believe, I can no longer make that
argument persuasive.

In the US, there has been a dark turn
among experts that US policy towards
China, calibrated over four decades to
shepherd China's rise, has failed: China,

they have come to believe, has become a
competitor and may become an adversary,
and that US relations with China must now
be managed as with an emergent adver-
sary, not as with a developing partner.

In China, nationalistic voices are on the
rise, castigating the US for its self-serving
motivation to impede China's rise, and call-
ing for China to Become more self-reliant,
more rapidly, especially in world-class
semiconductors, so that the country would
not be vulnerable to US “blackmail”.

Welcome to the unhappy world of self-
fulfilling prophecy, where the actions of
each side in response to a perceived threat
from the other side increases the likelihood
of that threat morphing from theoretical to
actual.

To both sides, I offer two pieces of
advice. First, take a breath and a fresh look,
because the road on which you are travel-
ling will not lead toa happy place.

Second, contemplate why the otherside
is misinterpreting your actions. To my
American friends, what makes China think
the US is resisting its rise? To my Chinese
friends, what makes the US think that
China is a competitor and may become an
adversary?

Projecting malevolent motives and see-
ing sinister conspiracies is the easy way out.
It can solicit cheers and plaudits in one’s
domesticmedia, butitwill impede progress
andis likely to be self-defeating.

The US and China must each figure out
hownotto confirm the other's self-fulfilling
prophecy.

Greater effort is required to foster gender diversity

Kevin Sneader and Anu Madgavkar say the Asia-Pacific region needs more women leaders

omen’s representation in high-
ranking positions in business
and politics isa global issue, but
an even more pressing one in Asia-Pacific.
Across the region, only one in five people in
leading roles isa woman.

This waste of women’s talentcomes at
an economic cost. Many economies in the
region are ageing and skills shortages are
onthe rise: making more of women’s
potential can help meet such challenges.
Businesses gain a great deal from
supporting women. McKinsey’s 2018
report “The Power of Parity” found that
companies in the top quarter for gender
diversity on their executive teams are 21
percent more likely to experience above-
average profitability.

Even in developed economies in the
Asia-Pacific, few women are getting to
the top in business—in Japan, there are no
female CEOsin the top 100 public
companies. In Australia and Singapore, the
share of women CEOs in 2016 was only 6
percent and 5 percent respectively. The
Philippines, a traditionally matriarchal
society whose government has been,
proactive in tackling gender inequality,
does better in senior positions overall, but
only3 per cent of CEOs and 15 percent of
board members are women.

The lower share of women in leading
positions within companies isn'tall about
the glass ceiling—the point at which
women’s careers appear to halt. Rather,
women’s under-representation has its
rootsas far backas the education system.

In India, only 44 per cent of students in
tertiary education are female and many
graduates don’t take up employment: only
25 per cent of entry-level positions in
Indian companies are taken by women. In
Japan, the share of women enrolled in
college is higher, at 47 per cent, but women
were only 28 per cent of students attending
the top 10 universities.

The share of women erodes sharply
from entry-level to the boardroom, and the
biggest “breakpoint” is motherhood. Ina
2015 McKinsey survey, 45 per cent of Asian
executives cited the “anywhere, anytime”
performance model as the largest barrier
towomen moving into senior roles. In
Japan, a survey found that three-quarters
of women respondents said they were not
interested in managerial positions, partly
because promotion would mean working
even longer hours.

The second most cited factor behind
women. dropping out of workis the
“double burden” of holding downa job
while looking after the family. In China, 33
percent of female respondents to a 2017
survey said that they hada lower salary
when they returned to work after having a
baby, and 36 percent said they had to
accepta demotion. Sixty-three per cent
said they did notwanta second child
because this would hurt their career.

Many women struggle to return to work
because childcare options are limited or
too expensive. In Australia, net childcare
costs (paid by two-earner families) were 20
percent ofan average family’s income in

2015, compared with the 13 per cent
average in OECD economies.

The attrition of women from the talent
pipeline starts even earlier
motherhood, as societal attitudes militate
against women pursuing a career and
prioritise looking after families. In India, 70
percent of respondents to the 2010-2014
World Values Survey agreed with the
statement, “When a mother works for pay,
the children suffer.”

More can be done to
give women the
freedom to choose a
career as well as
motherhood

There has been some progress. The
share of women on company boards has
been rising reflecting efforts by both
governments and private-sector
organisations. India has made it
mandatory for companies to have at least
one female director, and the Australian
Securities Exchange Corporate
Governance Council tracks gender
diversity in its constituent companies.
Japanese pharmaceutical company
Takeda hit its target of 30 per cent ofnew

managers being women (from only 6.2 per
centin 2015) through a range of initiatives
including flexible working hours.

However, there is much more that can.
be doneto give women the freedom to
choose a career as well as motherhood.
Narrowing the leadership gender gap will
require concerted action by governments
and companies from encouraging and
helping girls to learn the right skills fora
changing labour market and mentoring
women in their careers, to shiftin;
attitudes towards women's roles through
public-awareness campaigns to — perhaps
most importantly making work flexible.

More help with childcare is urgently
needed. Governments can use public
spending to expand childcare provision
and companies can set up nurseries.
Flexible working practices in companies
are vital. In Australia, financial services
company Suncorp enables flexible
working through “workat home hubs” that
combine home work stations and working
spaces in regional shopping centres.

Such efforts are only likely to be
effective with a root-and-branch shift in
attitudes towards women’s roles in society.
Governments can lead from the front,
setting targets for women’s representation,
in business as Japan and Singapore have
done, and more companies can push for
true diversity within their ranks. Doing so is
notonlyin the interests of their bottom line
but the health ofthe economies in which
they work.

Older people still
have lot to offer
in the workplace

Paul Yip says measures to ensure
Hong Kong retirees remain active
through employment may help
prevent poverty and partially offset
the impact of a declining birth rate

keeping people out of poverty. In Hong Kong's

latest poverty situation report, for those with a
job, the poverty rate is only 12.3 per cent, compared to
77.4 per cent among those not working. Among older
adults with a job, itis 12.9 per cent, compared with 48.2
percent among those without employment.

Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung has
recently raised the possibility of promoting workforce
participation for those aged 50-64 and helping those
aged 65-74 re-enter the job market. Hong Kong's
workforce participation rate among older adults is 17.7
percent, lower than in Japan (22.7 per
cent), Singapore (26.8 per cent) and Seoul (31.5 per
cent).

‘The Japanese government has been very active in
promoting workforce participation among its older
citizens, especially since 27 per cent of its
population was aged 65 or over as of 2017. The
population size has decreased, from 128 million in
2010 to 127 million in 2015, and the United
Nations estimates that the number will continue to fall
until 2061. The number of migrants moving to the
country has not offset the population decrease, leaving
no choice but to improve the labour participation and
productivity rate, especially among older adults and
married women with children.

Though Hong Kong's total fertility rate is only 1.2
per woman —less than the 1.4 in Japan—we have
benefited from migration from the mainland to keep
our population young. Our life expectancy is also very
similar to Japan’s, at 81 for men and 87 for women. It is
time to explore how to make better use of our older

The most important thing is
to provide an option for
older adults to be active in
the job market

| ; mploymentis the most robust method for

adults. We should create the right environment

for raising the retirement age and extending
employment beyond that age. Some issues, like
excessive health and medical insurance costs for the
older workforce, and long working hours, should be
re-examined.

The governmentcan create a fund to protect
against excessive increases in insurance costs, while
introducing a more flexible working arrangement for
the older workforce.

The most important thing is to provide an option
for older adults to be active in the job market, and give
them the choice of whether to continue in ajob. Those
who have had enough could perhaps take on volunteer
work in the community. For those who stay on with
paid employment, more flexible time arrangements
would better suit their needs, while their roles could be
redefined so as not to stand in the way of the career
advancement of younger workers. Some tangible
support might be needed for the business sector,
ideally through a tax-deductible arrangement rather
than the proposed cash support.

Forsome work, such asin teaching and research,
the situation depends on individual ability. As in
overseas countries, participants should be allowed to
work as long as they meet expectations. At present, a
vigorous review process takes place to determine
whether to extend beyond retirement age.

The education levels of Hong Kong's older adults is
not high and, among those with very lowlevels, most
can only find workin low-skilled jobs such as cleaning
and, security duties Nevertheless, these areas face a
shortage oflabour and can be a good fit. In such cases,
people's rights and pay should be better protected, to
avoid companies exploiting this group of workers.

Also, sometimes, older adults are not driven by
money when seeking work. For some, finding meaning
in their work can be sufficient. The Japanese
experience shows that some older adults continue to
work to maintain their independence and fitness. Such
workers, whatever they do, display high levels of
professionalism.

Respecting the wishes of older adults and providing
a quality choice in terms of working would be awin-
win situation for the whole community.

Paul Yip is chair professor (Population Health) in the
Department of Social Work and Social Administration at the
University of Hong Kong

For some, finding meaning in work is important, as with
these women who recycle used clothes to make bags.

Dershowitz said Roberts’ allegations were part of an extortion plot,
and that she “should be seriously punished for submitting false
information and a false affidavit.”

The attorney emphasized that Roberts has not been willing to repeat
her allegations against him in public, and that she has only accused
him in the context of litigation, which affords certain protections.

“She simply hides behind litigation privileges,” Dershowitz said,
encouraging Ross to call Roberts and see if she would repeat her
claims. “And if she does, | will be in court the next day suing her for
defamation and | will win the case ‘cause | can prove conclusively
that she made up the whole story from top to bottom.”

Ross then turned to the controversial deal that Epstein received from
federal prosecutors who were investigating the trafficking case
against him. Federal prosecutors agreed not to prosecute him, and let
him plead guilty to state charges that resulted in a 13-month prison
sentence that allowed Epstein to leave prison during the day for
work. Federal prosecutors allegedly did not even inform victims
before making the deal, which is now the subject of a request for an
Inspector General investigation. Congressional Democrats said ina
letter that they want to know more about the circumstances
surrounding the deal, which was made by then-U.S. Attorney and
current Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta.

As Epstein’s defense attorney in that case, Dershowitz is not upset
about it the deal at all.

“I’m very proud of that deal, that’s what lawyers are supposed to do,”
he said. “Lawyers are supposed to get the best deals they can.” If he
could have gotten 10 months or no time at all, that would have been
even better, he said.

Acosta said in the past that Epstein’s lawyers, including Dershowitz,
put pressure on his office by investigating his staff. Dershowitz has
denied this.

“Acosta was very tough,” Dershowitz said, contrary to concerns that
he did anything improper. Dershowitz pointed out that the problem
feds had was proving that girls were transported in interstate

got a week to talk about what his work was about. The goal was to try
to convince students to sign up for a special research seminar with
that faculty member the following quarter.

My champion at Stanford was a psychiatrist named Kenneth Col-
by. He invited me to share his week and thus we would be a team for
which students could sign up the following quarter. I listened to his
talks to the students. He was very funny but rather light on content, in
my opinion. I wasn’t impressed. But, after I spoke, he said something
to me I never forgot. He said: If you try to say everything that you
know in an hour, either of two things is true. Either you can do it and
therefore you must not know very much, or else you can’t do it and
you will talk way too fast trying to fit it allin and you will be generally
incomprehensible.

I listened to what he had to say, but I wasn’t sure he was right. At
the first meeting of our jointly run seminar, we discovered that we
had won the student jackpot. While other faculty had gotten four or
five sign-ups, we had gotten 25. I was very proud of myself until the
students went around the table to say who they were and why they
had signed up. Not a single one of them had signed up because of any-
thing I had said. They had been mesmerized by Colby.

Then I reheard in my head what Colby had told me the previ-
ous quarter. He had entertained them—not overwhelmed them. They
thought he would be interesting and fun and they wanted to work
with him. While I had looked down on his lighthearted presentation
style, it turned out he knew what he was doing.

So, what did I learn and how did my thinking change? Thinking,
as I said earlier, looks like this:

Make a prediction
Prediction fails

Make a generalization
Explain your generalization
Make a new prediction

What was my prediction? I had predicted that speaking quickly with
a great deal of brilliant content would woo the incoming students.
This was simply wrong. I needed to make a new generalization. Fortu-
nately, I did not have to do the work myself. Colby had helped me by
supplying a generalization that he believed to be true. (Good teachers

Stock view: Advertising continues to drive growth engine

Trivago’s 4Q revenue and EBITDA results highlight the company’s rapid revenue growth
and potential for solid profitability. Though there are concerns over the company’s large
marketing spend (80-85% of revenue}, we think the Street will view Trivago’s results
positively given continued revenue ramp while also achieving profitability. The stock
remains highly volatile given the limited float. Commentary during 4Q’16 earnings from
Trivago’s key customers Expedia and Priceline (as well as from TripAdvisor) indicated
that paid traffic has been growing faster than free traffic, and that companies in the
sector planned to ramp ad spend to drive continued traffic growth, which is a positive
for Trivago.

Trivago has best-in-class revenue growth, with 2017 revenue growth expected at 47%
(vs. guidance of 45%+), led by 50% qualified referral growth. We also expect Trivago will
become more efficient with advertising and start to reap the benefits of past brand
advertising, with return on advertising spend (ROAS) improving across regions in 2017,
a key driver of modestly improving EBITDA margin from 3.7% in 2016 to 3.9% in 2017.

The company remains in growth mode, led by click revenue growth in ROW and
Americas regions, as Trivago is driving brand awareness outside its key European
foothold through aggressive brand marketing. The company is adding qualified referrals
at an accelerating rate as it expands beyond its core Developed Europe markets and
penetrates new markets. We think the company has significant runway for growth and
can sustain 30%+ revenue growth through the end of the decade. As the business
matures in its new Americas and ROW markets, we expect a better balance between
profit and growth. We think EBITDA margins should accelerate as the company
leverages ‘16 and ‘17 marketing spend, with greater uplift in ‘18.

Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q: Qualified referral growth

We forecast 56% qualified referral growth in 1Q (920bps deceleration on 730bps
tougher y/y comp), led by 38% y/y growth in Developed Europe, 48% in Americas, and
110% in ROW. We expect continued robust marketing spend will drive user growth.

Biggest 1Q issues/risks:

e Weak return on advertising spend (ROAS} may be an earnings headwind.
Competition in the company’s advertising channels may result in lower ROI trends.
The company may also see less efficient advertising in newer, less mature markets.

« A positive update to 2017 guidance may be expected. Trivago currently expects
total revenue growth of 45%+ and adjusted EBITDA margin is guided to flat to
slightly up vs. 2016’s 3.7%.

Estimates vs. Consensus: Expect revenue in-line vs. the Street, EBITDA ahead

For 1Q, we expect revenue/EBITDA of €241mn/(€12mn) vs. the Street at
€241mn/(€10mn). We expect 2017 and 2018 revenue and EBITDA to come above the
Street and expect there is room for upside to management’s 2017 revenue growth and
EBITDA margin guidance.

Demand for gaming can be classified into four primary sources: the leisure segment, local residents, tour and travel groups and convention
demand.

LEISURE DEMAND

Leisure visitation to Las Vegas is enormous with visitors taking advantage of the year-round favorable climate and multitude of attractions.
The leisure segment utilizes both table games and gaming devices and has a higher propensity to play table games than other segments.
According to the Las Vegas Convention Authority Visitors Profile Study, in 2014 approximately 47% of all visitors mentioned vacation or
pleasure, up significantly from 41% in 2013. Of those polled, 71% of all visitors said they gambled while in Las Vegas with an average
gambling budget of $530.

LOCAL DEMAND

Local demand plays a part in gaming revenue contribution to the Las Vegas market. However, the local segment’s impact on the Las Vegas
Strip is moderate. According to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, 13% of locals gamble on the Strip with 45% gambling at
least once per week and 75% gambling at least once per month.

TOUR AND TRAVEL DEMAND

Las Vegas welcomed a record 41.1 million visitors in 2014, an all time record. Las Vegas tourism generates more than $45 billion in economic
impact for the local economy and supports 376,000 local jobs. Las Vegas is recognized worldwide as a premier gaming destination. From
traditional card and dice games, to slot machines and race and sports book betting, the casino industry has flourished and evolved into
an international phenomenon. A significant portion of the visitor revenue generated in the city is attributed to the gaming industry, which
posted $9.6 billion in revenue in 2014.

CONVENTION DEMAND

Convention demand within the Las Vegas market is significant. Las Vegas was the most popular trade destination (with a 25% market
share of the Trade Show Week 200 Shows in terms of net square footage) and third most popular convention destination in the nation. In
1990, approximately 1.7 million persons attended trade shows and conventions in Las Vegas; In 2014, convention attendance was up to 5.2
million, an increase of 8% annually over the last 25 years. Future convention expansion in demand is anticipated to see these rates of growth
continue for the foreseeable future.

available to him in his job at Dell, he may have been seeking wider access in 2012 for a more
nefarious purpose than a NSA job.

In any case, despite the near-perfect high grades he scored, the NSA did not offer him a
position in the senior executive service job. While Snowden may have believed such results
would elevate him, the NSA’s offer did not meet his expectations. “It was totally unrealistic for
Snowden to expect to get a SES position,” a former senior NSA officer told me. Snowden
ambitions may have been disappointed in this instance, but it did not prevent him from later
claiming that he had been a senior adviser to the CIA and also a senior adviser to the Defense
Intelligence Agency.

Instead of an SES position, the NSA offered a lowly G-13 job as an information technology
worker, which was not an improvement on his job at Dell. He took this slight as evidence of the
NSA’s incompetence, subsequently joking to a reporter in Moscow that his ability to steal the test
answers should have been seen as a qualification for the NSA job. In September 2012, he turned
down the NSA offer. If he was to advance himself now, he had to find a new way.

ings but Ho would not identify him beyond saying that he was a
“well-connected resident” of Hong Kong.

I called Ho’s law office in Hong Kong. He politely declined to be
interviewed by me, saying he had said all he was going to say about
the Snowden case. I was able, though, to make an appointment with
Robert Tibbo, a Canadian-born barrister specializing in civil liberties
cases. Tibbo had worked closely with Ho on the Snowden case.

I met Tibbo in the tearoom at the Mandarin Oriental hotel on
Hong Kong Island. Tibbo, in his early fifties, was tall, with a round
face and thinning hair. He talked freely about his remarkable career,
After earning a degree in chemical engineering from McGill Univer-
sity and working in Asia as an engineer for a decade, he went to law
school in New Zealand and became a barrister in Hong Kong special-
izing in cases involving the legal status of refugees.

Over a leisurely tea, Tibbo made it clear that he had played a far
more active role than Ho in the Snowden case. He had even per-
sonally escorted Snowden from the Mira hotel to a safe house on
June to. He did not dispute what Ho had told Bradsher. When I asked

© him if he could give me the name of the “carer,” he said that he was ®
bound by a lawyer-client privilege that prevented him from provid-
ing me with any details that might reveal the identity of the person
who had made arrangements for Snowden. When I asked the date
that he was officially retained by Snowden, he said that Snowden
had signed an agreement hiring him and Ho’s law firm as his legal
adviser on June 10, 2013 (which was a matter of public record).

“T understand that,” I said, “but I am inquiring about something
that had happened before you became his legal adviser.” He shook
his head, as if getting rid of a pesky fly, and said that his oath pre-
cluded him from saying anything at all that might do damage to
the credibility of his client. “Not even where he was staying in May
in Hong Kong?” I persisted. He leaned forward and, after a brief
hesitation, said, jokingly I assumed, that he would not divulge that
information, “even if you held a gun to my head.” We met two more
times, but true to his word Tibbo would not say if he even knew the
identity of the “carer.”

Meanwhile, Joyce Xu, a very resourceful Chinese journalist who
was assisting me in Hong Kong, had filed the equivalent of a Freedom

Peggy Siegal’s Oscar Diary
APRIL 2012 • AVENUE MAGAZINE | 53
David O. Russell
and Spike Jones
Peggy Siegal and
Catherine Martin
Suki Waterhouse
and Bradley
Cooper
This was the year absolutely no one could predict Best
Picture for the 86th Academy Awards: not even me, the
Oscar witch. This made directors Steve McQueen,
Alfonso Cuaron and David O. Russell very crazy. After
months of screenings, press conferences, lunches, and
parties, publicists and bloggers had to look these three wise
men in the eye and say, “We don’t have a clue.”
Then came the slogan, “It’s time.” That was
Fox Searchlight’s last suggestion on 12 Years
a Slave advertisements that subliminally
registered in the hearts and minds of voters
in the closing days of the studio’s low-key
campaign.
“It’s time.” So simple. Says it all. Just like
the mantra “Find your voice” that marketing
honcho Harvey Weinstein came up with
three years ago, which drove The King’s Speech
to a win.
This is how you win an Oscar. You pinpoint
and connect an exact emotion on the screen to
an exact emotion that moves 6,000 voters who
are mostly very smart white middle-aged guys.
On Oscar night, host Ellen DeGeneres joked
to 43 million viewers, “Possibility number one:
12 Years a Slave wins Best Picture. Possibility
number two: You’re all racists,” answering
the question three hours before the win was
announced. DeGeneres then gifted sponsor
Samsung with the world’s most famous selfie
and tipped a pizza delivery guy $1,000.
The gripping 12 Years a Slave won Best
Picture, putting Steve McQueen in the history
books as the first black director, who is also
British, to win an Oscar.
It took the star power of white heartthrob
Brad Pitt to get the film financed. Taking
the small but heroic role as the slave’s savior,
Brad then took a backseat by shooting WWII
film, Fury in England, leaving the promotion
to others.
Steve McQueen’s muse Michael Fassbender,
who portrayed a sadistic plantation owner,
announced he would not campaign. McQueen,
Chiwetel Ejiofor and an unknown supporting
actress, Lupita Nyong’o, were left with the
herculean task of selling a film about slavery that
was guaranteed to embarrass every American.
This is why their win was so poignant.
Warner Bros.’ wildly popular Gravity had
skyrocketed to $1 billion globally at the box
office. This technical game changer propelled
Sandra Bullock into outer space with $70
million of backend profits tucked into her
space panties. The beloved thriller landed
triumphantly with seven Oscars. Alfonso
Cuarón, who slaved for four years to create
his masterpiece, won two statues for directing
and editing and became the first Latino
director to win. Although Gravity’s producer
David Heyman did not strike gold, this film
was one hell of a second act after producing
all those Harry Potter films.
In the past four years, David O. Russell
has been a serious contender with 25 total
nominations for his last three films. Hilarious
and astute American Hustle garnered 10
nominations, but no wins this year.
The four acting categories were easy to
predict. Cate Blanchett wowed the minute
Blue Jasmine was released in July. This
instantaneous phenomenon is known as the
“Colin-Firth-Daniel-Day-Lewis slam dunk.”
In November, beautiful darling Jared Leto
stole everybody’s hearts dressed as a woman
in Dallas Buyers Club. His long hair, penchant
for ’90s grunge, and rock band 30 Seconds to
Mars, made him another instant winner.
Matthew McConaughey’s career renaissance
became “McConaissance.” Mud, Dallas Buyer’s
Club, Wolf of Wall Street, and finally HBO’s

True Detective collectively earned him Best
Actor by December.
The actress who really stole the show
on the campaign circuit was eloquent
ingénue Lupita Nyong’o, who morphed into
a fashion goddess. No one will forget her
Best Supporting Actress acceptance speech
when she said, “It doesn’t escape me for one
moment that so much joy in my life is thanks
to so much pain in someone else’s.”
Tuesday, February 25
I flew to L.A. with some indefinable eye
infection that made Olympics reporter Bob
Costas’ reaction to Botox look attractive. My
medical calamity possibly caused by Latisse,
which promotes eyelash growth, caused
my eyelids to resemble red golf balls and
necessitated the wearing of dark glasses.
No, I did not look as cool as Anna Wintour.
I managed to grope my way through Oscar
week in couture Ralph Rucci gowns and furs
and pretend temporary blindness was “just a
new look.”
On this, my 30th trip to The Beverly Hills
Hotel, the famous Polo Lounge had finally
been renovated to look exactly like it did
30 years ago so as not to upset the regulars.
Each pool cabana now had giant flat screens
installed for watching CNN in the sun. Cate
Blanchett and Oprah Winfrey were the hot
Oscar week guests.
I headed over to the Vanity Fair Social Club,
with its media-friendly “WeWork Hollywood”
pop-up lounge. Vanity Fair publisher Ed
Menicheschi, who perfected the Midas touch
for masterminding Oscar week sponsorship,
greeted me. I participated in a panel discussion
of Oscar prognosticators about who would
win, hosted by Michael Hogan of VF.com with
Anne Thompson of IndieWire, Sasha Stone
of Awards Daily, Pete Hammond of Deadline,
Dave Karger of Fandango, Krista Smith of
Vanity Fair, and Kyle Buchanan of Vulture.
If you had put fire to our feet we could not
tell you who was winning Best Picture. Like a
bunch of nerds all trying to impress each other,
we did predict every other category correctly.
The town was crawling with stars. So it
wasn’t shocking to find the most famous
sitting in the middle of a public restaurant
drinking and singing oldies by the Eagles
and Neil Diamond. That was the scene at
Nobu in L.A. where Bono and U2, here to
perform Mandela’s theme “Ordinary Love”
at the Oscars, sat drinking sake and George
Clooney’s Casamigos Tequila with Clooney
himself, and Cindy Crawford and Rande
Gerber as they all belted out songs.
Steve McQueen
with Bianca
Stigter
Jennifer
Lawrence
Brad Pitt and
Angelina Jolie
George left town soon after, was rumored
to stop in London to see his new girlfriend,
Oxford-educated British barrister Amal
Alamuddin, and they headed to an exotic,
secluded island for a much-deserved vacation.
After winning the Oscar last year for producing
Argo, George had a supporting role in Gravity;
co-produced August: Osage County; and
starred in Tomorrowland, which Disney will
release in 2015. He also produced, wrote,
directed, and acted in The Monuments Men.
Clooney marched to Berlin, Milan, London,
and Paris, successfully opening that film.
With his Oscar night absence, not only did
he make sure Sandra Bullock got all the credit
she deserved, but my hunch is that he was
also quietly proud of his good friend Brad
Pitt, who produced 12 Years a Slave, Gravity’s
biggest competition.
Wednesday, February 26
Action central was now in the lobby
of Chateau Marmont where Vanity Fair,
Graydon Carter, and Benedikt Taschen
Alfonso Cuaron
Lupita Nyong’o
honored world-class photographer Annie
Leibovitz for the launch of her new sumosized
book, Annie Leibovitz.
André Balazs confided that Annie pulled
an all-nighter in her pajamas hanging her
work. Balazs gave her free reign to install
her huge iconic portraits throughout the
hallways and first floor suites that were open
during the party.
Photographers Mario Testino and Terry
Richardson browsed as Annie walked
Quincy Jones on a tour of her larger-thanlife
exhibition. Sylvester Stallone gazed at his
own portrait taken 20 years ago, his Dorian
Gray Rocky face now frozen—as in Botox—
not the blockbuster animated Disney winner.
Paramount CEO Brad Grey’s wife
Cassandra, Carole Bayer Sager and Lorraine
Schwartz gave a private dinner at Cassandra’s
Violet Grey store on Melrose. Jack Nicholson,
seated with model Erin Wasson and Eva
Mendes, held court as superstar Pharrell
Williams (in his Vivienne Westwood
“Mountain” hat) and Anjelica Huston chatted

up Chinatown producer Robert Evans. Dom
Perignon sent the champagne, proving that even
behind private dinners, one can now spot a sponsor.
Thursday, February 27
Oprah Winfrey slipped into Essence’s “Black
Women in Hollywood” lunch at the Beverly Hills
Hotel where Cheryl Boone Isaacs, the first black
female president of the Academy, was honored
with a Trailblazer Award.
President Bill Clinton, in town for the
first United4Humanity gala at Sony Studios
that night, had lunch at Larry Gagosian’s
magnificent modern home in Holmby Hills.It
was designed by architect A. Quincy Jones, the
mentor of Frank Gehry—not to be confused
with music legend Quincy Jones, the mentor
of Michael Jackson. On this night, there were

and Diane von

10 parties. English society decorator and Olympic
party animal Nicky Haslam flew in from England
for the Vanity Fair dinner Sunday night and was my
escort for this evening. We made it to five parties.
Vanity Fair and Sony’s “Toast to American
Hustle” at Ago on Melrose was our first stop, to
pay homage to David O. Russell. Inquiring minds,
including hotshot producer Megan Ellison,
Amy Adams, Sony CEO Michael Lynton and
co-chairman Amy Pascal, debated who was
winning Best Picture. We still didn’t know.
CAA’s Josh Lieberman was on his way to
ICM’s John Burnham’s Santa Monica home.

Al Pacino and David Mamet were huddled on
a couch as Spike Lee and Meredith Vieira sat
nearby listening.
At Warner Bros.’ fancy private dinner for its
nominees at the Bel Air Hotel, Nicky and I were
greeted by David Heyman. Executives Sue Kroll
and Juli Goodwin brought us over to Sandra
Bullock and CEO Kevin Tsujihara. Again,
everyone whispered, “Who is winning Best
Picture?” Gravity’s technical wizardry, revered in
L.A., was now thought to have the edge.
Spike Jones arrived and was too superstitious
to discuss his chances for Best Original Screenplay
for Her. He won. Don’t worry about Blue Jasmine
fellow nominee Woody Allen; he was tap dancing
with Susan Stroman on Broadway, rehearsing
Bullets Over Broadway. As a man who doesn’t
believe in campaigning for awards, he just might
show up to collect a few Tonys.
An exhausted Alfonso Cuarón was the last to
appear, with girlfriend Sheherazade Goldsmith.
He was fighting a cold and couldn’t wait to get
back to real, not reel, life.
Brad Grey’s party for Paramount’s nominees
was in full swing at Spago Beverly Hills. The Wolf
of Wall Street’s Marty Scorsese was huddled in
a booth with Brad, marketing maven Megan
Colligan, producer Irwin Winkler, and the
ageless Don Rickles. Jonah Hill’s buddy
Leonardo DiCaprio had just left, as he was
getting a cold too, but he later showed up at the
Bel Air, where Marty was staying, to have drinks
with Scorsese and Cuarón in the bar.
Nebraska talent Bruce Dern, Will
Forte, June Squibb, cinematographer
Phedon Papamichael and
screenwriter Bob Nelson relaxed
since their grueling nine-month
campaign, which had begun at
Cannes, was finally over.
Ron Meyer, vice
chairman of Universal,
had his annual private
party at his Malibu home
in honor of Graydon Carter.
Barbra Streisand, Jim Brolin,
John Travolta, Kelly Preston,
Diane Lane, Robert Downey Jr.,
and Paul Rudd mingled under a
tent with interior designer Sandy
Gallin and his new husband
Bryan Fox. Ron’s daughter,
jewelry designer Jennifer Meyer,
came alone. It was nanny’s
night off, so her husband Tobey
Maguire stayed home with the
kids.
Lara
Spencer
Larry Gagosian gave his 17th
annual art opening and dinner,
which is always a hot ticket for the rich and
hip. This year, art photographer Taryn Simon
mounted a show titled “Birds of the West Indies”
after the seminal taxonomy by ornithologist
James Bond. The exhibition also chronicled the
women, weapons, and cars depicted in the Bond
films, in addition to the birds that appear in all 24
movies. Even MGM couldn’t dream this up.
Dinner followed next door at Mr. Chow’s,
complete with Eva and Michael Chow. Simon’s
filmmaker husband Jake Paltrow brought his
mother Blythe Danner and his sister Gwyneth.
Since the Spielbergs and the Paltrows are
close family friends , Kate Capshaw arrived with
Theo and Sasha Spielberg. Jared Leto came
with Terry Richardson. Adrien Brody, Elle
Fanning, Cameron Diaz, John Waters, and
Robbie Robertson chowed down. Power
collectors Eli and Edythe Broad and Bill
and Maria Bell split chopsticks.
After dinner, we migrated to Gagosian’s
home. It was raining, it was windy, and
it was cold. Teetotaler Robbie Robertson
slipped on wet stone outside the house. He
was taken to the hospital that night and
endured a two-hour operation on three
broken ankle bones. Simultaneously,
Nicky Haslam slipped onto a glass table
and crashed to the floor. Nicky was fine;
the table was a goner—so much excitement
for one night.
Friday, February 28
Woke up this morning and the eye problem
had reached epic proportions as my left eye
was now shut. Found an eye doctor to lance the
infected eyelid. He gave me enough drugs to get
me to the Publicist Guild lunch at the Beverly
Wilshire Hotel. Jerry Lewis was receiving
a Lifetime Achievement Award from Carol
Burnett. Thankfully, I only needed one eye to
take all that in.
At her uncle’s Rodeo Drive store, Roberta
Armani toasted fellow Italians Marty Scorsese
and Paolo Sorrentino. The suits Leo wore in
The Wolf of Wall Street were designed for him by
Armani himself.
Paolo Sorrentino was the overwhelming
favorite to win Best Foreign Film for his Felliniinspired
The Great Beauty, and indeed he won.
Armani’s talent turnout was very impressive.
Cate Blanchett, who has signed with the designer
as the face of his perfume, was there with Glenn
Close, Robert DeNiro, and Samuel L. Jackson.
All were bedecked in Armani.
Wanda McDaniel, the marketing guru for
Armani, was the very first to dress actresses on
the red carpet. Jodie Foster was her muse and
that was 25 years ago.

Watts
Graydon Carter and

Andre Balazs
Sandra Bullock
Terry Richardson
I never tire of the overwhelming
excitement, throngs of eager press,
and screaming fans. Everything boils
down to this moment of mass hysteria.
Philomena producers Gaby Tana and
Tracey Seaward invited me to Steve Coogan’s
home where music man Alexandre Desplat
and Jon Hamm were having beers. Coogan
captivated me with conversation of how he
and the real Philomena Lee, who was a red
carpet regular, took their “full disclosure”
adoption campaign to the Vatican, meeting
The Pope. Only Harvey Weinstein could
have pulled off that jaw-dropping marketing
miracle.
Traditionally, there are three private agency
parties on Friday night—WME, CAA, and
UTA. They were hosted by Ari Emanuel,
Kevin Huvane, and Jim Berkus and were
press free, leaving the stars uninhibited and
happy. Justin Theroux, about to explode in
HBO’s miniseries The Leftovers, canoodled
with Jennifer Aniston. Past and present
Oscar nominees and winners including
Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Oprah Winfrey,
Charlize Theron, Sean Penn, Bradley
Cooper, Jonah Hill, Alexander Payne, Steve
McQueen, and Alfonso Cuarón were among
the evening’s migrating tribe.
Saturday, March 1
Barry Diller and Diane von Furstenberg
canceled their annual, highly anticipated
outdoor lunch for Graydon Carter at their
Coldwater Canyon home atop a steep hill
because of impending torrential rain that
never came. Three hundred power hungry
showbiz executives were sent into a tailspin
for an alternative activity.
Luckily, Sony Pictures Classics’ and
industry icons Tom Bernard, and Michael
Barker took pity on me and invited me to
their table at the Independent Spirit Awards
under a wobbly tent that billowed with the
wind in Santa Monica.
Bob Balaban and I headed to the 6th
annual Chanel-sponsored dinner hosted
by the debonair Charles Finch at Madeo.
Girls donning $20k Chanel dresses included
Anne Hathaway, Sienna Miller (with baby
daddy Tom Sturridge), Lily Collins, Greta
Gerwig and Poppy Delevingne. Jessica de
Rothschild and her director husband Sacha
Gervasi were in attendance as well as Adrien
Brody, David O. Russell, Oliver Stone, Danny
Huston, Jean Pigozzi, Ben Silverman, Peter
Morton, and Elon Musk.
Harvey and Bob Weinstein along with
Chopard honored their nominees, including
the singers in RADiUS-TWC’s Best
Documentary winner 20 Feet from Stardom,
with a seated dinner at the Montage Hotel in
the “Marchesa Ballroom.” (The dining room
was rechristened for the evening in honor
of Harvey’s wife Georgina Chapman’s dress
label.) After dinner, guests were wowed by
a performance from Weinstein’s upcoming
Broadway musical, Finding Neverland, based
on their Oscar-nominated film about Peter
Pan creator J. M. Barrie. Celebrities Bono, U2,
Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts, Oprah Winfrey,
Olivia Wilde and Jason Sudeikis, Christoph
Waltz, and Taylor Swift gave Neverland’s
stars, Jason Alexander and Gary Barlow, a
standing ovation.
Sunday, March 2
My Oscar date this year was GMA’s
glamorous Lara Spencer. I arrived, as usual,
two hours early at the Dolby Theater in order
to plant myself on the mother of all red carpets.
Only this year, I was incognito with the dark

glasses. I greeted each of Lara’s interviewees
as if they were coming to my house for dinner.
I never tire of the overwhelming excitement,
throngs of eager press, and screaming fans.
Everything boils down to this moment of
mass hysteria. It’s always humbling to stand
among the entertainment giants, wish them
luck and have them nervously smile back.
It’s the bittersweet finale when all of the
campaigning is over and you think you won’t
see them until their next movie. It’s like the
last day of camp.
I was now dateless and alone as Lara Spencer
went home suffering from a sore throat.
Those in the know always hang out at the
downstairs bar during the broadcast where
the sound is turned up on the flat screens.
This year, Cate Blanchett’s husband theater
impresario Andrew Upton bought me free
drinks. I hung out with Cate, her CAA agent
Hylda Queally, the adorable skinny Sally
Hawkins in a heavily beaded Valentino gown,
Julia Roberts, and Tom Bernard and Michael
Barker who have 140 career nominations and
32 wins.
After reassuring Blanchett that her
stupendous pale beaded Armani Privé gown
was the best of the other girls’ pale dresses and
that her Oscar would pop against it, she went
on stage to win.
While I was at the Oscar broadcast, 160
VIPs at Graydon Carter’s annual Oscar
viewing dinner were getting ready for the
rush of a thousand more party guests. Five
hundred limos were on the way. Those
who watched the awards from the beige,
circular dining room were Graydon’s
friends including: Sofia Vergara, Tom Ford,
Carolina Herrera, Bruce Weber, Allen
Grubman, Bob Colacello, Judd Apatow, Jeff
Klein and John Goldwyn, Rupert Murdoch,
Steve Newhouse, Les Moonves, and Jimmy
Buffet.
I ran through the Governor’s Ball and
found Bryan Lourd and Fox’s beloved leader
Jim Gianopulos, ushered by Fox Searchlight’s
Michelle Hooper, sitting at Brad Pitt’s empty
table because everyone else was still in the
press room doing interviews.
I arrived at the Vanity Fair party at its new
location, 8680 Sunset Boulevard, a parking lot
that was transformed into an airy glass dome.
I stood in a corner, ravenously inhaling my
In-n-Out burger with ketchup dripping down
my chin and of course, Graydon—the adored
maestro of the week—came up and so sweetly
wanted to know how I was doing. It’s a little
difficult to respond with a mouthful of food
behind dark glasses.
The stars were huddled together in groups,
air kissing and congratulating each other. Bill
Murray, Lupita Nyong’o, Jennifer Lawrence,
Naomi Watts, Idina Menzel, Sarah Paulson,
Bette Midler and Lady Gaga owned the
dance floor; Jared Leto passed his Oscar
around so much he dropped it and it now
sports a little dent in the head; pregnant Kerry
Washington ate for two; and the Janes —
Fonda and Buffet—huddled on a couch,
while The Great Gatsby’s production and
costume designer, and wife of director Baz
Luhrmann, Catherine Martin and I posed
with her two Oscars. (Including the two she
won for Moulin Rouge, she now has four).
Even Madonna has sponsors now. The
material girl—blinding in 1,000 carats of Neil
Lane’s diamonds—hosted her seventh annual
awards bash at her manager Guy Oseary’s
home with Gucci. Originally super secret, the
party is now a headline on Page Six. Madonna
made her best effort to cream off the stars
from Graydon’s party.
In attendance were Paul McCartney, Tom
Brady and Gisele Bündchen, newly engaged
Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis, Serena
Williams, Prince, and Pink. Madonna closed
out her own party by breakdancing with her
kids and Miley Cyrus, and spinning records
until 7 a.m. for Matthew McConaughey.
Madge, short for majesty, would rather die
than entertain press, let alone an adorable
publicist like moi. Last year, ever so curious,
Anne Hathaway and Jared Leto
Charlize Theron
I was brought as
a guest of a guest
only to be frogmarched
to the door by Oseary, the
furious host himself. Dear
readers, I did this for you. It has
taken me a year to admit—I was
too socially traumatized to report
my investigative failure. I now realize that
I was just a pawn for Oseary’s A-list purity
for the night. His own rock status had been
boosted by signing Bono and U2. Thank God
my social stock is still otherwise intact. The
week before the Oscars, the real Oscar—de
la Renta—had invited me to his beachfront
paradise in the Dominican Republic with
Lord and Lady Astor. In June, the Duke and
Duchess of Marlborough are expecting me at
Blenheim Palace. So much for not making the
cut at Madonna’s.
Once again, I scored a ride home on a
friend’s plane where my dark glasses fit right
in. Passengers received an email that morning
requesting “no jeans.” I thought this was a
bizarre fashion edict, only to find out the
indigo dye in denim bleeds onto the jet’s white
leather chairs.
As a closing to my 10th annual Oscar diary,
I can sum up this year’s race as one of intense
emotions and euphoric pride for our love of
what Americans do best: making the most
wonderful and culturally enlightening movies
that entertain the world. On to Cannes!✦

What Is Human-Like General Intelligence?

2.1 Introduction

CogPrime, the AGI architecture on which the bulk of this book focuses, is aimed at the creation
of artificial general intelligence that is vaguely human-like in nature, and possesses capabilities
at the human level and ultimately beyond.

Obviously this description begs some foundational questions, such as, for starters: What is
general intelligence? What is human-like general intelligence? What is intelligence at all?

Perhaps in the future there will exist a rigorous theory of general intelligence which applies
usefully to real-world biological and digital intelligences. In later chapters we will give some
ideas in this direction. But such a theory is currently nascent at best. So, given the present
state of science, these two questions about intelligence must be handled via a combination of
formal and informal methods. This brief, informal chapter attempts to explain our view on the
nature of intelligence in sufficient detail to place the discussion of CogPrime in appropriate
context, without trying to resolve all the subtleties.

Psychologists sometimes define human general intelligence using IQ tests and related instru-
ments — so one might wonder: why not just go with that? But these sorts of intelligence testing
approaches have difficulty even extending to humans from diverse cultures [HHPO12] [Fis01].
So it’s clear that to ground AGI approaches that are not based on precise modeling of human
cognition, one requires a more fundamental understanding of the nature of general intelligence.
On the other hand, if one conceives intelligence too broadly and mathematically, there’s a risk
of leaving the real human world too far behind. In this chapter (followed up in Chapters 9 and
7 with more rigor), we present a highly abstract understanding of intelligence-in-general, and
then portray human-like general intelligence as a (particularly relevant) special case.

2.1.1 What Is General Intelligence?

Many attempts to characterize general intelligence have been made; Legg and Hutter [LI107a]
review over 70! Our preferred abstract characterization of intelligence is: the capability of a
system to choose actions maximizing its goal-achievement, based on its perceptions
and memories, and making reasonably efficient use of its computational resources

Paul Keating explains as never before

e BY:PAUL KELLY, EDITOR-AT-LARGE
° From:The Australian
e October 22, 2011 12:00AM

WITH his panoramic view of world affairs sharper than ever, Paul Keating blames the current global crisis
on blunders by European and US leaders and warns that Australia must rediscover the keys to national
success.

Interviewed in his Sydney office, furnished in a style he calls “the last gasp of revolutionary classicism, Keating's
new 600-plus page book sits atop his desk, an insight into his intellectual, aesthetic and political obsessions.

What has Keating been doing since he left office in 1996? He has been travelling, speaking and analysing the
world and Australia with undiminished intensity suggesting a man operating as prime minister-in-exile.

His idea of leadership is more philosophical than ever, more distant from Bob Hawke or John Howard. His focus is
the synthesis between beauty and reason and his book encompasses China's currency, the world malaise,
Mahler's Symphony No2 and broaching the republic with the Queen.

During the interview Keating talks, as never before, about his leadership concept. But he
is doing something else: explaining himself to a still puzzled nation.

“The great changes in civilisation and society have been wrought by deeply held beliefs
and passion rather than by a process of rational deduction, Keating tells me. In
retirement, his political inspiration comes from music and beauty, not opinion polls.

There are signs he has mellowed. While ruthless with his judgments Keating is keen to
support a struggling Labor Party while addressing the source of its strategic demise.

The failure of the Rudd and Gillard administrations is the lack of an over-arching story,
the lack of a compelling story, he says when interviewed last week.

Second Renewed Motion for Leave to Assert Claim for Punitive Damages

4, was filed for the sole purpose of attempting to intimidate both EDWARDS and
EDWARDS’ clients and others into abandoning their legitimate claims against
EPSTEIN.
APPLICABLE LAW
To plead a claim for punitive damages, the claimant must show a “reasonable basis” for
the recovery of such damages. See Fla.R.Civ-P. 1.190(f); see also Globe Newspaper Co. v. King,
658 So.2d 518, 520 (Fla. 1995). The showing required to amend is minimal. As stated in State
of Wis. Inv. v. Plantation Square Assoc., 761 FB Supp. 1569, 1580 (S.D. Fla.1991): oe

[T] he court-beliéves it must ultimately be a lesser standard than that required for. e028...
summary judgment. Though the burden is on [the plaintiff] to survive a §768.72
challenge of insufficiency, see Will v. Systems Engineering Consultants, 554
So.2d 591, 592 (Fla. 3 DCA’ 1989), the standard of proof required to assert’
Plaintiff's punitive claim must be lower than that needed to survive a summary
adjudication on its merits. As the Florida courts have noted, a §768.72 challenge

“more closely resembles a motion to dismiss that additionally ~requires’ an
evidentiary proffer and places the burden of persuasion on the plaintiff. Jd In
considering a motion to dismiss, factual adjudication is inappropriate as all facts
asserted—or here, reasonably established—by the plaintiff are to be taken as true.
Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, at 45-46, 78 S. Ct. 99, at 101-102, 2 L.Ed. 2d 80,
-1581 at 84.-As such, the court-has given recognition only to those assertions of
the defendants which would show Plaintiffs factual bases to be patently false or
irrelevant, and has paid no heed whatsoever to the defendants’ alternative
evidentiary proffers.

State of Wis. Inv., 761 F. Supp. At 1580; see also Dolphin Cove Assn. v. Square D. Co., 616 So.
2d 553 (Fla. 2d DCA 1993) (“Prejudging the evidence is not a proper vehicle for the court’s

denial of the motion to amend” to assert punitive damages claim).

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027975.txt,"They were not just academic issues. Even if we were never again called upon
to free a hijacked airplane, I assumed we would face other operations which
were equally urgent, without the weeks or even months of preparation we’d
always insisted on in the past.

After the Sabena operation, I emphasized the need for us to be proactive. It
wouldn’t be up to us to decide which operations to do. But it was up to us to
take the initiative in identifying and understanding specific threats and framing
ways in which we could provide a response. Even before Sabena, barely two
weeks had gone by when I didn’t go to Eli Zeira, who was in charge of the
operations department of military intelligence, with a mission which I felt
confident we were ready to carry out. Several of the most complex centered on
the new threat posed by Palestinian groups in Lebanon. Before the civil war in
Jordan, King Hussein had accused Fatah, the PFLP and the equally militant
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine of trying to create “a state
within a state” and deliberately weakening his government. Now, they were
doing much the same in Lebanon. Their headquarters buildings in southern
Beirut were spawning hiyackings or terror attacks. From bases in southern
Lebanon, the Palestinians were also firing Katyusha rockets into Israel.

One of the operations I planned targeted Arafat. From our intelligence
intercepts, we knew that a day or two after a particularly intense clash with
Israeli artillery units on the Lebanese border, he would tour the area and meet
with his commanders. If we were going to go after him, however, we needed to
know exactly when he was coming. Fortunately, the Lebanese authorities
tracked Arafat’s motorcade on these “review the troops” excursions, reporting
how many cars were involved, which one he was in, and their progress. Thanks
to previous sayeret missions, we could listen in. In order to ensure the operation
would be on our terms, I proposed that a couple of days before we planned to
move, Israeli artillery target a Fatah rocket site in an isolated area about ten
miles from the border, where there was just a single road in from Beirut. I
proposed landing several teams by helicopter the night before. We would lie in
wait until the Lebanese army checkpoints reported that the Fatah convoy was on
its way. Israeli helicopters and F-4 jets would then cut off the road on both
sides, and we would ambush Arafat’s vehicle.

Producing Cannabinoids Using Synthetic Biology

Synthetic biology methods use fermentation to produce cannabinoids with identical
chemical structures to those found in plants.

Biocatalytic Cannabinoid Pathways

The first step of the synthetic cannabinoid production requires identification and
extraction of the desired cannabinoid biosynthetic pathways from a cannabis varietal.
The biosynthesis of cannabinoid molecules in a microbe could require four or more
cannabinoid metabolic pathways. When the pathways are selected, their corresponding
DNA sequences need to be cloned from the cannabis varietal and spliced into the
microbial DNA.

Cannabinoids could be produced biocatalytically using the following mechanism:
i. Inthe first pathway, glucose is converted into G3P and pyruvate via glycolysis.
These two compounds are then utilized to produce the precursors geranyl

pyrophosphate (GPP), and/or neryl pyrophosphate (NPP).

ii. Glycolysis of glucose also produces Acetyl CoA, which can catalyze biosynthesis
of the second group of precursors: olivetolic acid (OA) and divarinic acid (DVA).

Mr Gulen is a reclusive figure who rarely makes contact with the media.
Although Turkey has demanded his extradition, it has yet to make a formal request.

The US has said its judiciary will consider a request 1f and when it is filed. It also asked for evidence of the cleric's involvement
in the coup attempt, which Turkey says it has supplied.

Mr Gulen's lawyers said it was most unlikely any extradition request would stand up in a US court and almost no chance that
their client would get a fair trial in Turkey, given what had been said against him there since the coup attempt.

One of the lawyers, Reid Weingarten, said: It would be unprecedented and appalling if the United States took a frail almost-
octogenarian, plopped him on a plane to go back into that kind of setting with the hideous things that are being said about him
by the entire Turkish government.

Much of Turkey's crackdown has targeted perceived supporters of the cleric.

There has also been a massive reshuffle of the military.

Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 2 of 18

Even from jail, sex abuser manipulated the system. His victims were kept in the dark

BY Julie K. Brown

A decade before #MeToo, a multimillionaire sex offender from Florida got the ultimate break.

fy
Palm Beach County Courthouse
June 30, 2008

Jeffrey Edward Epstein appeared at his sentencing dressed comfortably in a blue blazer, blue shirt, jeans and gray sneakers. His attorney, Jack

Goldberger, was at his side.

At the end of the 68-minute hearing, the 55-year-old silver-haired financier — accused of sexually abusing dozens of underage girls — was fingerprinted

and handcuffed, just like any other criminal sentenced in Florida.

But inmate No. W35755 would not be treated like other convicted sex offenders in the state of Florida, which has some of the strictest sex offender laws in

the nation.

Ten years before the #MeToo movement raised awareness about the kid-glove handling of powerful men accused of sexual abuse, Epstein’s lenient
sentence and his extraordinary treatment while in custody are still the source of consternation for the victims he was accused of molesting when they

were minors.

Beginning as far back as 2001, Epstein lured a steady stream of underage girls to his Palm Beach mansion to engage in nude massages, masturbation, oral
sex and intercourse, court and police records show. The girls — mostly from disadvantaged, troubled families — were recruited from middle and high
schools around Palm Beach County. Epstein would pay the girls for massages and offer them further money to bring him new girls every time he was at

his home in Palm Beach, according to police reports.

The girls, now in their late 20s and early 30s, allege in a series of federal civil lawsuits filed over the past decade that Epstein sexually abused hundreds of
girls, not only in Palm Beach, but at his homes in Manhattan, New Mexico and in the Caribbean.

In 2007, the FBI had prepared a 53-page federal indictment charging Epstein with sex crimes that could have put him in federal prison for life. But then-
Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta signed off on a non-prosecution agreement, which was negotiated, signed and sealed so that no one would know

the full scope of Epstein’s crimes. The indictment was shelved, never to be seen again.

Epstein instead pleaded guilty to lesser charges in state court, and was required to register as a sex offender. He was sentenced to 18 months

incarceration.

But Epstein — who had a long list of powerful, politically connected friends — didn’t go to state prison like most sex offenders in Florida. Instead, the
multimillionaire was assigned to a private wing of the Palm Beach County stockade, where he was able to hire his own security detail. Even then, he didn’t
spend much time in a cell. He was allowed to go to his downtown West Palm Beach office for work release, up to 12 hours a day, six days a week, records

may not work for another. A leader learns to figure out who is who
and what works for each member of the team. The conscious part of
this is about learning who needs what from the leader in order for
the leader to get the most out of each individual so that the team’s
goals are achieved. The subconscious part is about interacting with
others, which is rarely conscious behavior. We get smarter through
experience. If our team wins because we functioned well as a team,
we learn to repeat the behaviors that worked. If we win because our
team was simply much bigger than the other team, then we probably
won't learn much about teamwork.

Teamwork can be taught only by examining how a team functions
and attempting to make conscious the subconscious behavior that is
not working. Thinking about what we have done that may not have
been helpful to the team, and making sure that team members’ goals
are aligned, is pretty much the only way we can learn to improve our
behavior.

HOW TO TEACH NEGOTIATION

My daughter was a little over 2 when we moved back to the United
States from Switzerland. The enormity of U.S. toy stores overwhelmed
her and it seemed that she wound up crying every time we entered
one. She wanted everything. So I had what I thought was a clever idea.
I told her that she could have two toys of her choice but that if she
cried she couldn't get any at all. We talked about it and it was clear that
she had understood what I said. She ran around the toy store and end-
ed up selecting three toys. I told her one would have to go back—that
our agreement was two. She started crying hysterically. I then said she
had to put them all back as she had violated our no crying agreement.
All of sudden, she sucked up all her tears and said in a breathless voice:
I’m not crying now. I said that we would compromise on one toy.
That was possibly her first lesson in negotiating. I say possibly
because kids and parents negotiate all the time. She and J are still ne-
gotiating. Now it is about when she will come to visit or when she will
send her son down to visit or a range of other family issues.
Negotiation is so important that it is nearly absurd to ask how we
teach negotiation. We can learn it by copying, of course, which I did
when I watched my father get a good price on a used car I was buying
that I was ready to pay much more for. But really we negotiate with

he found himself in the canal, being tugged down by the current. Only the
SEALs, and Bibi’s mix of calm and endurance, averted disaster.

When I returned as commander, Bibi had gone through officers’ school and
was given a team of his own, making him one of half-a-dozen core, operational
officers with whom I worked from the planning stages of every mission,
through the training and the operation itself. Especially with Bibi, since he was
newest to the role. He was smart, tough and, even by sayeret standards,
supremely self-confident. It also was clear that he understood my determination
to build the unit into a military strike force — which was one reason why he
urged me to bring in his older brother. Bibi was 22 at the time. His brother —
Yonatan, or Yoni — was 25. He had led a company of paratroopers in the 1967
war, before going off to university. He’d taken a bullet in the elbow while
helping to rescue one of his soldiers behind Syrian lines on the Golan. “He
wants to return to the army, and he’s exactly the kind of officer you want,” Bibi
said.

I brought Yoni in for a chat. Over the next several years, I would get to know
him much better, becoming not just friends but neighbors, when he bought a flat
a few floors up from ours. But even in this first meeting, I found him a contrast
to his younger brother. Bibi was practical, detail-oriented. Yoni was a more
complex character. He was interested in history, and philosophy. He wrote
poetry. He would sometimes feel the need to get off by himself, and just think.
He was a man of action, too. Taller and trimmer than Bibi, with a thick thatch of
dark hair swept back from a craggy face, he was the Central Casting image of a
soldier. He also had real, battlefield experience. Not only did I invite him to join
Sayeret Matkal. I put him in charge of our training teams. When Danny Yatom
left the following year to train as an armored officer, I made Yoni my deputy.

However different in some ways, the Netanyahu brothers were close. They
seemed almost driven, to excel and to succeed. As I got to know them both, I
sensed that the drive did not come merely from within. It came from their
upbringing, their family background, and in particular their father. Ben-Zion
Miliekowsky, as he then was, studied at Hebrew University at the same time as
my father, in the early 1930s, and was an impassioned supporter of Ben-
Gurion’s main right-wing Zionist rival, Ze’ev Jabotinsky. My father
remembered him gathering bemused groups of students during breaks from
classes, standing on an upturned wooden box, and proclaiming that the Arabs
would never willingly accept a Jewish state. Long before the 1948 war, and

Global Landscape (Azer)

While the global regulatory landscape varies, the CBD category outside of the U.S. has

been evolving rapidly, with more change likely to come with the WHO's current evaluation
of CBD, as well as its recent addition to the EU's Novel Food Catalogue. In Europe, CBD
products are now widely available in markets like the U.K., Italy and Switzerland, though
regulations vary with Italy allowing for “cannabis light products, with allowable THC of as
much as 0.6%, while in Switzerland CBD products can have as much as 1% THC, and are
classified as a tobacco substitute. In Latin America, hemp has been in production since the
1500s is also rapidly expanding their regulatory frameworks around marijuana and hemp.
Canadian licensed producers have been actively entering the market in Latin America to
capitalize on this evolving opportunity, including Canopy Growth, Tilray, Aurora and Cronos.

Regulatory Outlook (Eric Assaraf - Cowen Washington Research Group)

The 2018 Farm Bill declassifies industrial hemp as a Schedule | substance, shifts regulatory
authority from the DEA to the Department of Agriculture, and provides autonomy for
states to regulate the industry. However, the new law does not change the FDA's oversight
authority over CBD products and FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has made it clear that
his agency will continue to step in when certain health claims are made. Additionally, FDA
has stated that CBD cannot be added to food products sold across state lines or marketed
as a dietary supplement, regardless of whether it is hemp-derived. The FDA will explore
new pathways for CBD to be sold legally; however, it seems clear that there will be a period
of regulatory uncertainty over CBD products at the state and federal level.

Roberts, who showed the Herald the written instructions for the rendezvous, never picked up the girl because Roberts met a man on the trip who would
become her husband. The couple married and moved to Australia, where they currently live.

In 2007 — at the same time the FBI was investigating Epstein — Roberts, pregnant with her second child, said she unexpectedly received phone calls from
Maxwell and Epstein. She said they were worried that she had told police about them. She assured them she had not spoken to anyone, she said.

Shortly afterward, Roberts said, she was contacted by someone who claimed to be with the FBI. But she was afraid to tell that person details, fearing it was
really an Epstein associate posing as an FBI agent.

That agent, identified in court papers as Timothy Slater, confirmed that he and the other agent on the case, Nesbitt Kuyrkendall, called Roberts in January
or February 2007. Ina sworn statement, Slater said he informed Roberts that they suspected she was a victim of Epstein’s.

The agent said Roberts answered basic questions, but became uncomfortable and “asked that I not bother her again.”

Roberts said the agent didn’t try too hard to convince her to talk, and she was surprised when he hung up after asking her a few graphic questions about
her sex life. She said she was suspicious, but would have cooperated had the FBI talked to her in person and explained why they were asking about
Epstein.

“T was still scared to death,”’ Roberts said. “Jeffrey used to tell me that he owned the entire Palm Beach Police Department. I just didn’t want my family
harmed.”

She nevertheless was listed by federal prosecutors as one of Epstein’s Palm Beach victims.

As the years went by and Roberts had a daughter, she would be haunted by a fear that Epstein was still taking advantage of young girls. In 2011, she went
public in a paid interview with a British tabloid, the Daily Mail, asserting that she had had sex with Prince Andrew, one of Epstein’s friends, several times
when she was a teen.

In her 2015 affidavit, she discussed in detail some of her alleged sex encounters with the prince and Epstein’s other friends, including lawyer Alan
Dershowitz. Edwards included the affidavit in the court file as part of the Jane Does’ Crime Victims’ Rights Act case, at which time it became public.

Virginia Roberts says she was loaned out by Jeffrey Epstein to his friend Prince Andrew, shown here. He denies they had sex. COURTESY OF VIRGINIA ROBERTS

- the only relevant question is whether the pallbearers will be crying.

For Keating, the 20th-century leader exerting most influence on the coming century is
China's Deng Xiaoping.

If you look at the other figures of the century, Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin and Mao, none
will leave the legacy in terms of the 21st century that Deng leaves, he says. He walked

away from the ideology of the Communist Party just as effectively as Mikhail Gorbachev

walked away from the essence of the Soviet Union.

By 2050 Keating sees a world order with nations in terms of gross domestic product in
this hierarchy: (1) China, (2) US, (3) India, (4) Japan, (5) Brazil, (6) Russia, (7) Britain, (8)
Germany, (9) France and (10) Italy.

The key, however, is that Japan lags a distant fourth behind the top three.

On America, Keating is dismayed by the pivotal change in its outlook after the end of the
Cold War. When the Berlin Wall came down the Americans cried victory and walked off
the field, he says.

Yet the end of the Cold War offered the chance for America to develop a new world
order. It didn't know what to do with its victory. This at the moment the US should have
begun exploiting the opportunity of establishing a new world order to embrace open
regionalism and the inclusion of great states like China, India and the then loitering
Russia.

Well, frankly, the US didn't have the wisdom. It just wanted to celebrate its peace
dividend. The two Clinton terms and the two George W. Bush terms, that's four
presidential terms, have cost US mightily.

For Keating, the malaise in US politics is the problem. He says: The most compelling
thing I've seen in years is that in the great burst of American productivity between 1990
and 2008, of that massive increment to national income, none of it went to wages. By
contrast, in Australia real wages over the same period had risen by 30 per cent. Keating
sees this as the breakdown of America's national compact, the shattering of its
prosperity deal. He says American conservatives abandoned the middle ground
represented by Republican presidents such as Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon and
Bush Sr and became radicals. The derailment, he argues, began under Ronald Reagan
and reached its zenith under George W. Bush.

With the goodwill gone the US is not able to produce a medium-term credible fiscal
trajectory or get agreement on rebuilding its infrastructure. This paralysis “is significant
not just for the US but for the world.

Keating links the collapse of this prosperity compact to the financial crisis. Too many
Americans were unable to sustain themselves from wages and salaries.

: Bs Edwards is Entitled to Summary Judgment on the Claim of
Abuse of Process Because He Acted Properly Within the Boundaries of the
Law in Pursuit of the Legitimate Interests of his Clients.

Epstein’s Second Amended Complaint raises several claims of “abuse of process.” An
abuse of process claim requires proof of three elements: “(1) that the defendant made an illegal,
improper, or perverted use of process; (2) that the defendant had ulterior mative or purposes in
exercising such illegal, improper, or perverted use of process; and (3) that, as a result of such
action on the part of the defendant, the plaintiff suffered damage.” S & I Investments v. Payless
Flea Market, Inc., 36 So.3d 909, 917 (Fla, 4 Dist. Ct. App. 2010) (internal citation omitted), In
fac, this Court is very familiar with this cause of action, as Edwards has correctly stated this
eattae in his counterclaim against Epstein. Edwards is entitled to summary judgment because
Epstein cannot prove these elements.

The first element of an abuse of process claim is that a defendant made “an illegal,
improper, or perverted use of process.” On the surface, Epstein’s Complaint appears to contain
several allegations of such improper process. On examination, however, each of these
allegations amounts to nothing other than a claim that Epstein was unhappy with some
discovery proceeding, motion or argument made by Edwards. This is not the stuff of an abuse of
process claim, particularly where Epstein fails to allege that he was required to do something as
the result of Edwards’ pursuit of the claims against him, See Marty v. Gresh, 501 So.2d 87, 90
(Fla, 1* Dist. Ct. App. 1987) (affirming summary judgment on an abuse of process claim where

“appellant’s lawsuit caused appellee to do nothing against her will”).

It is not illegal to have Swiss accounts. But as you may know, it is a topic of considerable public debate, and
several governments have been investigating the owners of such accounts.

There are a number of ways such accounts and also offshore trusts have been used to avoid inheritance tax, UK
domestic tax, or tax imposed by other countries. Such accounts have also been used to launder money.

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011048.txt,"Tweaking the Axioms

My last argument reasoned from experience that we need no money motive to
consume, and that pay tends to cover our maintenance needs. But that wasn’t
strictly in the axioms. | assumed a mortal and reproducing population strategizing
for means to satisfy tastes, and more generally aims. I didn’t say out loud that the
population in fact survives. Now I do. Let’s specify that the population has motive
and means for lineage survival, whether in a group selection or kin selection sense.
The means can be specified as skill sets, as an adult norm, sufficient to earn
maintenance consumption needs for themselves and invested consumption needs
for their young together. As to motive, I will specify at last that maintenance
consumption is exhausted in satisfying our taste for survival. I already as much as

assumed this in arguing that we need no money motive to consume.

This assumption of motive and means amounts to the biological imperative. It is
hardly new to economics. It is the essence of Petty’s overlapping generations model
of 1662 in A Treatise of Taxes. It is the essence of the equilibrium wage theory of
Smith in 1776 and Ricardo 1817, where pay converges to the level holding the work
force intact. It is the essence of Malthus’ population principle of 1798 and 1801,
chosen by Senior as his first axiom in his Outline of 1836. It is the essence of the

productive consumption theory developed from Malthus through Mill in 1848.

It lapsed from attention with the marginalist revolution beginning with Jevons and
Menger in 1871, ironically the year of publication of Darwin’s The Descent of Man,
because the marginalists treated explanations of tastes as irrelevant. I happen to be
a huge fan of the marginalists. But they’ve made their point. The microeconomics
they founded is a rich and mature science. It needs no assumptions as to what
explains our tastes. But macro is not doing so well. I believe that it must start over,

and that a grasp of motives helps.

target multiples for the median large regional banks under coverage. We have weighted
the P/E and P/TBV factors equally at 40%, and our DCF analysis by 20%.

A superior profitability profile suggests an above peer multiple - however, a challenging
macro backdrop and specific industry headwinds restrain our P/E target. Our DCF
assumes a two-stage cost of capital of 9.6% and 11.2% and a terminal growth rate of
4%,

Risks are macro risks such as a lower for longer rate environment, the implementation
of a strict liquidity coverage ratio and further regulation on overdraft income that
restricts bank profitability.

U.S. Bancorp (USB)

We use a three-factor valuation framework (P/E, P/TBV, DCF} to arrive at our $50 PO,

Risks to our price objective are macro risks such as a double dip recession, the
implementation of a strict liquidity coverage ratio and further regulation on overdraft
income that restricts bank profitability. Specific to USB, risks are enhanced regulatory
scrutiny and capital standards as a Domestic SIFIl and an announcement of a large
expensive deal that could weigh on the stock price.

UMB Financial Corporation (UMBF)

We use a three-factor valuation framework (P/TBV, P/E, DCF) to arrive at our $78 price
objective and assign a 1.8x multiple to our 2Q17E TBY, in-line with peers, and we place
a 18x multiple on our 2017E EPS, above peers given our above median EPS growth
forecast. Our DCF model assumes cost of equity of 8% and a terminal growth rate of
4%,

Downside risks to our price objective are continued rising long rates, which could
negatively impact the company's sizable securities book and erode tangible book value.
In addition, a sudden outflow of deposits could impact EPS and the asset sensitivity of
UMBF's balance sheet to higher interest rates. Upside risks to our price objective are a
much faster asset mix change into higher yielding loans that significantly increases its
net interest margin.

Wells Fargo & Company (WFC)

weighted the P/E and P/TBV factors equally at 40%, and our DCF analysis by 20%.

Our 1.6x TBV multiple represents a 0.3x premium to our mega-cap median multiple, but
we believe this is justified due to WFC's superior returns on tangible equity (ROTE
consistent between 13%-14% throughout our forecast period, versus 12% for peers).
Our 12x EPS multiple is in line with our mega-cap median multiple. We believe WFC
deserves to trade at a premium due to better earnings growth, but we are assuming
WFC trades in line with peers due to a higher percentage of earnings from mortgage
banking and accretable yield, as well as potentially greater regulatory scrutiny as the
second largest US depository. Our DCF assumes a two-stage cost of capital of 11% and
a terminal growth rate of 4%.

Subject: Fwd: October 19, Heidelberg 
Importance: High 
Hi.. so, here is the event I am still invited to give in Germany. It is Oct 19th. I was previously invited to give a 
major lecture in Heidelberg Oct 14 but they had to cancel it after the university determination re australia was 
publicized by the bitch. That air ticket, which they had paid fo, was about 5250 euros. There is a $900 
cancellation fee, and they have agreed to let me keep the ticket if I pay them 4500 euros. I offered that to the 
other place but they only have $5K USD total, which includes the $4K fee they originally offered me. I am 
going to check other tickets now, but wanted to know if you might be flying to europe around then and could 
take a hitchhiker. :)

Hi Lawrence, 
just back from a long tour ,,on origins. 
As promised you will get my message promptly. 
As you may understand, before we start recruiting for the Festival our budget 
implies more freedom. Now I simply do not have the flexibility to decide so easily 
on amounts in „kilos. (especially as a prominent Nobel laureate shortly before 
deadline agreed to come and implied a pretty large sum). 
What I can offer you is 5k as a lump sum. This is the ultimate at the moment. 
I deeply regret these limitations but I cannot ignore redlines. 
So please let me know if you can or cannot come. 
As ever Jakob

Hi.. update.. noam cannot do anything anyway.. nor UK that week.. So, I have been able confirm I can get the 
ticket for the discounted amount of 4500 Euros.. Are you game with my proposal? I have until end of Sept to 
buy out the old ticket before they cancel it.

Well it depends on UK.. if they can't do it, then alas, it would be the whole thing.. I could check for a discount

with Noam Chomsky, and I am wondering whether, if I could convince him to join me in a dialogue at your 
place whether that might change the dynamics of the event for you, and free up some more money perhaps..

Hi Jakob 
There has been a complication. The Gottingen event had to be cancelled so that means I now do not have an air ticket to Germany. I 
am going to check whether I can arrange anything in the Uk which might cover part of the cost for a new ticket. In the meantime I 
thought I should let you know and ask whether it is possible to cover part or all of the cost for a ticket.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012921.txt,"1.5 Extraordinary Proof? 5

serve as proofs of CogPrime’s power for advanced AGI. We have used some CogPrime ideas in
the OpenCog framework to do things like natural language understanding and data mining, and
to control virtual dogs in online virtual worlds; and this has been very useful work in multiple
senses. It has taught us more about the CogPrime design; it has produced some useful software
systems; and it constitutes fractional work building toward a full OpenCog based implemen-
tation of CogPrime. However, to date, the things OpenCogPrime has done are all things that
could have been done in different ways without the CogPrime architecture (though perhaps not
as elegantly nor with as much room for interesting expansion).

The bottom line is that building an AGT is a big job. Software companies like Microsoft spend
dozens to hundreds of man-years building software products like word processors and operating
systems, so it should be no surprise that creating a digital intelligence is also a relatively large-
scale software engineering project. As time advances and software tools improve, the number of
man-hours required to develop advanced AGI gradually decreases — but right now, as we write
these words, it’s still a rather big job. In the OpenCogPrime project we are making a serious
attempt to create a CogPrime based AGI using an open-source development methodology,
with the open-source Linux operating system as one of our inspirations. But the open-source
methodology doesn’t work magic either, and it remains a large project, currently at an early
stage. I emphasize this point so that readers lacking software engineering expertise don’t take
the currently fairly limited capabilities of OpenCogPrime as somehow a damning indictment of
the potential of the CogPrime design. The design is one thing, the implementation another —
and the OpenCogPrime implementation currently encompasses perhaps one third to one half
of the key ideas in this book.

So we don’t have extraordinary proof to offer. What we aim to offer instead are clearly-
constructed conceptual and technical arguments as to why we think the CogPrime design has
dramatic AGI potential.

It is also possible to push back a bit on the common intuition that having a design for human-
level AGI is such an “extraordinary claim.” It may be extraordinary relative to contemporary
science and culture, but we have a strong feeling that the AGI problem is not difficult in the
same ways that most people (including most AI researchers) think it is. We suspect that in
hindsight, after human-level AGI has been achieved, people will look back in shock that it took
humanity so long to come up with a workable AGI design. As you'll understand once you’ve
finished Part 1 of the book, we don’t think general intelligence is nearly as “extraordinary”
and mysterious as it’s commonly made out to be. Yes, building a thinking machine is hard —
but humanity has done a lot of other hard things before. It may seem difficult to believe that
human-level general intelligence could be achieved by something as simple as a collection of
algorithms linked together in an appropriate way and used to control an agent. But we suggest
that, once the first powerful AGI systems are produced, it will become apparent that engineering
human-level minds is not so profoundly different from engineering other complex systems.

All in all, we’ll consider the book successful if a significant percentage of open-minded,
appropriately-educated readers come away from it scratching their chins and pondering: “Hmm.
You know, that just might work.” and a small percentage come away thinking Now that’s an
initiative I'd really like to help with!.

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025281.txt,"Commodities overview

Commodities — Key points

2 UBS

The impact of new quantitative easing (QE) measures on commodity prices is losing strength, as broadly
diversified commodity indices have not been advancing anymore on a month-on-month basis. Investors
have started to reflect on the underlying economic challenges that motivated the easing decisions by
key central banks. With global economic growth barely accelerating, the asset class will struggle to
appreciate firmly over the coming months. We therefore advise investors to have only low single digit
return expectations for commodities warranting a neutral stance.

Gold is less depending on economic growth, however the metal could be a beneficiary of ample
liquidity provided by central banks. But ebbing QE news flow at a later stage (6-12 months) might
challenge the necessary investment demand inflows to balance the market. Hence, we stay neutral
on precious metals.

The return outlook of the energy sector remains not compelling in 4Q12 and we stay neutral. Global
crude oil supply should expand firmly and surpass incremental demand in 4Q12. We think this will bring
Brent crude oil prices temporarily towards USD 95/bbI while WTI should slide towards USD 78/bbl in
4Q12. However, a weaker USD due to QE3, ongoing social turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa
and the risk that Iranian tensions have the potential to heat up after the US presidential elections are
likely to keep the oil price at around USD 105-110/bbl in 6 months. In addition, demand growth from
EM countries in 1Q13 could start to gather pace.

Base metal prices should hold their ground, with China's growth deceleration coming to an end. So
we keep our neutral stance. That said, it is too early to call for a strong extension of the liquidity
driven price rally seen until now, despite the RMB 1 trillion in infrastructure approvals by the NDRC
(National Development and Resource Commission) in rail, highways, ports and other infrastructure
projects. Many of the announced projects are already part of the 12th 5-year plan. The incremental
demand impact of speeding up investments should therefore be rather muted this time compared with
previous stimulus packages. Besides that, China's steel intensity for one unit of RMB of investment (FAI)
has halved over the last 5 years.

A 15% increase in grain prices remains our base case for 4Q12, with room for prices to top out in
1Q13. Demand rationing in case of corn and soybeans is still needed to limit the damage done to global
inventories by lower supply. The quarterly stock and the monthly WASDE report by the USDA are
reiterating the critical conditions of US grain inventories. The softs, on the other hand, should remain
under pressure due to ample South American production and export activity. That said, the sub-sector
already weakened quite a bit, which will limit the downside in the short run and we remain neutral.

TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023644.txt,"﻿The text of the television interview of the Deputy Crown Prince: Prince Mohammed bin Salman:
The Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdul Aziz, the Deputy Crown Prince, the Second Deputy of the Prime Minister, and the Chairman of the Council for Economic Affairs and Development, has held a television interview on Saudi Arabia's first channel for the most important local and regional issues, and he stated the followings:
* The national transformation program was designed to improve the performance of government agencies?
- That’s true, and for this reason there are indicators and targets have entered in 24 government agencies, the second batch will be launched in the near future or the coming weeks, and there are new entities, that were not included in the 24 parties in the national transformation program, will be added to it.
* Now it is been a year since the establishment of 2030 vision, How do your Highness see its impact on the growth, the unemployment and non-oil income? 
- I think that it has achieved so many achievements. If we look at 50 thousand feet, we will find that the deficit rate is less than all analysts’ anticipation, both at home and abroad for 2015 and 2016. And also for the budget of 2017 we will find non-oil revenues almost doubled in these years, the last two years from nearly 111 billion to nearly 200 billion Saudi riyals. We will also look at the fact that budget control has become much more accurate than a budget in the last year, which spends more than 25 % to 45 % to a budget where only less than 10 % is spent. All of which are more than 50,000 feet. In addition to that, the main economic indexes have been affected by eighties, the nineties, and 2009 fall in oil prices such as the unemployment index which increased in those sharp declines, while the inflation index rose very significantly. The investment index also fell very strongly, while in this crisis the oil prices fell very sharply in an unprecedented manner in the history of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and in a very rapid pace until it reached 27 dollars in a short period, and continued at this abysmal level for a year and more than a year. But, thanks to God, thanks to the guidance of his majesty the king, and the work of government agencies and officials and government employees who were able to maintain a lot of indexes without being affected negatively. Unemployment was maintained at its level and was not strongly affected negatively. Inflation was also not strongly affected negativly as the historical cases we have seen in the past. The investment index was not affected strongly and the growth index continued to rise on the GDB. It is true that it is below the global average but we have not entered a stage of contraction in the Saudi economy. Now the effects of these programs that will be launched will start to appear in late 2017. We will find their very strong impact starting from 2018 and 2019 on all these key economic indexes.
* Your Highness, Prince, with regard to the issue of unemployment from the beginning of this year and with the recession that the local market suffered, there was a layoff for people from their jobs, what is the plan for that? 
- As everyone knows, that any reform process and any screening process of the country will be accompanied by side effects. It is very normal with the oil drop to $ 27 and its continuation for a long time less than $ 40 have a lot of symptoms affecting the state spending. These ten programs are all in the different areas of spending between investment and spending from the private sector, which is a major incentive for jobs in the coming years. As everyone knows, the aim of Vision 2030 is to reach a 7% unemployment rate in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. With no doubt, these programs will make us into a better number than we are today in 2020.


* What is the reason for the suspension of allowances, and why they were returned?
- If we note, in the decision to stop allowances that it was temporary, and that in the same resolution there is a text that states that the decisions are reviewed periodically. And they were reviewed appropriately after the improvement of our oil revenues. This is a factor, and as you know in the program financial balance we had three scenarios for Oil which are:  the pessimistic scenario $ 45, the average scenario or a baseline of $ 50, and the optimistic scenario of $ 55. This is not the Kingdom's assessment for oil, but this is to arrange our securities with different oil prices. In the first quarter, we were close to the optimistic scenario which is $ 55, sometimes we go beyond it and sometimes we are less than, this is a positive element. The other positive element is that our non-oil revenues in the first quarter of 2017 have achieved more than we anticipate to achieve. This is another positive element, so the decision is no longer has to continue in this manner. So that, it was reviewed as stated in the resolution itself, while we exaggerate that this is a very great success for the competent authorities in the financial and the economic and investment sides as they were able to take us from this stage in less than 8 months. The work of a very great effort has been done in the oil agreement with the OPEC countries and non-OPEC countries is an agreement for the first time in history. We have always known in the past that the agreements were held between the OPEC countries only, and this is the first time in the history that the agreement held between the OPEC countries and countries outside OPEC. That made our position is very positive in terms of the governmental revenues of the oil. Also, the procedures taken in these non-oil revenues have greatly helped in addition to the investments and restructuring of many of the sectors under the Public Investment Fund have contributed to bringing in these revenues which have strengthened our position and contributed to a decision like this.
* The amounts of allowances, were they so impressive that they stopped?
- When we notice the price of oil is $ 27 and continue for months under $ 40, we do not know what is the obvious scenario for the next three or four years, and we do not know if our effort in the oil agreement will succeed or will not work. Also, do not know if our programs in our non-oil revenues will succeed or not, we also do not know if that our investments will come to fruition in a short period of time or we cannot make a profit to help the government budget in a short period. So that, we can take “the risk” at the expense of the national economy. These procedures have been done in the past, in the eighties and in 1997. But the difference between this period and the past periods is that we took a period of few months to went back to the normal position while in previous cases in our history and the history of other countries take years to return to normal course.
* I mean the size of the amounts Was it affect the support?
- without doubt. If you want to close all the taps that you have, you must take all measures until make sure that your affairs are in a good position, and then re-open it as appropriate.
* How do you respond to some Western press, which said that this decision came under popular pressure, and this is considered a decline?
- That is incorrect words, the deficit fell in the first quarter to 44%, this in itself proves the truth of our words that the deficit falls below what we expect, so why continue the austerity measures.
* What are the most important steps that achieved compensation in the budget deficit?
       1- Oil revenues are the most important factor, and the main reason for the oil agreement.
       2- There are some procedures that have been implemented in the non-oil revenues in the last two years.
       3- Revenues of the Public Investment Fund. And for the first time the Public Investment Fund enters the treasury of the state tens of billions annually which is 2015, 2016, and 2017 God willing and in an increasing manner.
  These are the three most important factors that made the deficit fall to 44%.
* What if the price of oil falls below $ 30?
- We expect the second, third, and fourth quarters will not be below the 44% expectation because we are back and spending again.
* What if oil returned and fell below $ 30, would we return to austerity and tighten the belt?
- Without a doubt, if we go through a critical stage we will return to the austerity measures, but what we are working on today and the initiatives that exist today will make us stronger in the receipt of shocks. And if our initiatives succeeded, we will need oil prices less than fifty dollars. This will make us receiving very strong shocks without the action of tighten the belt.
* After the return of the allowances. People began to look at the citizen account that it will not be completed?
- The unified account of the citizen is to compensate the citizen for any rise in the prices of energy, water or the like so that the citizen of the middle income and less does not affected, and the impact is on the rich foreigner or citizen. Today we want to redirect the support to be materially directed to the citizen. Middle-income or low-income earners decide to spend the amount they have spent in the past on the same expenditure (energy, water, gasoline, or other goods), or reduce their consumption, and spend that amount in another thing.
* About 12 million citizens have registered their information. Have you started benefiting from that?
- Now, we believe that those who deserve support are less than ten million, or nearly ten million, and the competent authorities are working to determine the final form.
* Do the ten million include the poor and the average?
- Of course, we are trying to be as generous as possible, and trying to include the largest possible categories, even if they are above the average. So that it has a strong impact on the Saudi citizen, but to date the details has not finished yet, and the competent authorities are working on it, and is supposed to be finished in the coming months.
* How will you deal with future unemployment, is there a number you have?
- If you notice in the 10 programs that have been launched, that it is required from each program when it is announced in the next six months to measure its impact on the main indicators of the economy, including the unemployment index. In the next six months, we will see the impact of each program that is launched on the unemployment, how would this program will provide number of jobs, and how many percent will affect unemployment. We expect that the impact of these programs will be very strong to reduce the unemployment rate, and I can only give you the real impact at the time of the announcement of each program.


* How much do your highness expect the anticipated increase in the public debt in 2017/2018?
- Public debt as announced in the fiscal balance program will not exceed 30%, we target the public debt on the GDB 30% and so far, we have not reached 30%. There are some expectations that even in 2020 we will be less than 30%. A public debt of 30% does not mean a problem, some of the countries in the world have GDB in some of them up to 50%, some up to 60% and some up to 200%, including G20 countries. If we look at the big countries, the five major economies have more than 30% public debt. So that, it is healthy for the Saudi economy to involve a percent of public debt, which means that we have opportunities for development programs on which we spend money. We have two options: to spend and continue to develop, to create jobs, to create opportunities, to create private sector opportunities, or to stop spending. Our public debt is very low, giving us a comparative advantage that we can rise to international rates and continue to spend.
* How do you see the future of the Public Investment Fund over the next three years? Would it be an internal or internal and external investment? 
- The Public Investment Fund is one of the most important pillars of Vision 2030. We have several opportunities to develop the size of the Public Investment Fund:
       1- Unutilized assets. Too many assets have been entered, some of which may have been reviewed or announced to the public investment fund. These will be reflected in the size of the fund, the size of the value of the fund, and the profits of the fund.
       2- We have heard that some of the reserves that are not of the state's funds need to be transferred to the public investment fund, about 100 billion riyals several months ago. Also, there is a restructuring of the public investment fund companies so that their performance, growth and profits are better than the previous. All of these will maximize the size of the Public Investment Fund, on top of this the offer of Saudi Aramco.
* His Highness the prince, What about Aramco? 
- As we state, the most important offer in the Public Investment Fund is the ARAMCO offer. This will provide huge sums to the Public Investment Fund and also it will help in targeting many sectors inside and outside Saudi Arabia. One of the most important sectors to be targeted by the Fund within Saudi Arabia, is the mining sector. According to the survey of the 1970s, which was re-examined last year, I think there are mining opportunities of (Trillion and three hundred billion US dollars). The value of minerals in Saudi Arabia, of which gold is more than 240 billion US dollars and that requires a very huge investment. It is always difficult for foreign and domestic investors to take risks in a new sector such as mining. Consequently, the investment should be through the Public Investment Fund. The company of Aramco contribution with part of the money (cash) in the fund will provide the Fund with the ability to invest in this new sector, which has now only utilized less than 3%, and we have another very important goal which is the local content target. Today's volume of Saudi Arabia purchases outside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on goods, commodities, activities or so on, amounting to US $ 230 billion. According to the vision of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 2030, half of this spending will be within the Kingdom, and when we talk about what are the most important local content items ($ 230 billion), the most important item is Military manufacturing, which ranges from $ 50 to $ 70 billion a year, sometimes increases, sometimes less. We are the third largest country in the world to spend 99% of the military armament outside the Kingdom. This is a huge opportunity to create large industries within the Kingdom, also to create jobs and create development. However, what distinguish this matter is that the decision is 100% totally owned by the government. The government today has made a decision requiring that any industry should be linked to local content (i.e. I will not buy from you unless you tell me how much you give me local content). There are types of industries, low-sensitive technology industries and in this case other countries do not have the embarrassment of being transferred to you 100% inside Saudi Arabia, such as light weapons or ammunitions or what can be included under it or spare parts or structures, etc. And there are a medium-sensitive technology industries, some countries have a certain sensitivity, we try to get out of the deal a certain percentage for the local content, and sometimes we manage to reach 70% of the local content, sometimes 50%, and sometimes 20%. There are also complex industries that countries refuse to transfer technology to Saudi Arabia. Here, we stipulate that the main materials are through Saudi Arabia, which has an indirect impact on the local content inside Saudi Arabia, but the condition in the competent authorities in Saudi Arabia today is that no weapon deal without local content targeting 100 % of industry transfer. If we do not succeed we must end up in 2030 with 50% local content. This means that from 50% ($ 70 billion) will be spent inside Saudi Arabia in 2030 and will gradually increase. His Highness has pointed out that today there is a range of armament deals will be announced in the coming period. In each deal, we will know how much the local content is, and how many job opportunities will be provided by it. Arming is the largest item in the local content. The second item is the automotive industry, where car purchases by the Saudis are almost $ 30 billion a year, sometimes higher than and sometimes less than. The positive element is that $ 13 billion of these purchases are purchases for the Saudi government and we can start with the first stage is to provide the needs of the Saudi government through Saudi manufacturing companies that the Saudi government is contributing to. This will bring us 40% to 43% in 2030 in the automotive industry. 
* Will there be a localization of the automotive industry?
- We will not try to offer goods to the citizen in the next ten years as cars, it will be very difficult to compete in prices and also to convince him of the quality required, but we can ensure that these deals for the government in exchange for creating this industry within Saudi Arabia, and the third most important item of the local content is entertainment and tourism (22 billion dollars a year out of Saudi Arabia on entertainment and tourism) This is the most difficult item because its decision in full to the Saudi citizen and there is no part of the purchases with the Saudi government, it is very difficult that you invest in an investment convince the Saudi citizen that instead of spending this money outside Saudi Arabia to spend it inside Saudi Arabia. Also target 50% in 2030. Under the local content, there are too many items, this (230 billion US dollars) of which we are targeting US $ 115 billion to be spent annually in Saudi Arabia and increasing gradually after 2030. Hence, until reaching 2030, these are all challenges and profitability in it are not as expected or as required and the risk is very high, no one will invest in it except the Public Investment Fund so that this sector succeeds and then privatize and sell in the stock market then Companies are listed in the stock market and the fund starts to recover its expenses and enters into another chance. This is the second sector targeted by the Public Investment Fund after mining. The third sector targeted by the Public Investment Fund is the logistics sector. We have three very large logistics opportunities and we operate very strongly. The most important opportunity is the Red Sea. 13% of the world trade passes through the Red Sea and Saudi Arabia provides nothing at this field (zero services), and here are huge opportunities to work along the Red Sea for many exports and imports of countries. We began today to work with many countries since the recent time headed by China and now we work with them on a huge initiative in the Industrial city of Jizan and there are other countries come successively. 
* Does this will include the development of ports?
- That is true. developing seaports or participate in the industrial cities on the Red Sea. Another opportunity we're working on is a Saudi and Gulf states exports to Europe, 40% of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states exports to Europe. Especially, the Gulf countries pass from the Arabian Gulf to the Strait of Hormuz to the Arabian Sea to Bab El Mandeb to the Red Sea to the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean Sea and this period takes the cost and security risk, while we can provide them passage through Saudi Arabia directly to the bridge of the King Salman, who announced it last year to North Sinai, which reduces the time and cost. Where security guarantees are much higher than those in which they pass. 
* Are you involved in the King Salman Bridge project?
- Without a doubt, this will create a lot of industries and businesses inside Saudi Arabia from connecting roads, connecting power grids, linking gas and oil pipelines, and connecting railways to North Sinai. The third opportunity we aim at in Logistics is aviation, today our brothers in the United Arab Emirates and in Qatar have done a very good job of flying in the Middle East, while they do not have a strong domestic market to rely on to take over and control the Middle East markets. Saudi Arabia has the largest domestic market as an airline market. Saudi Airlines companies should have a much larger stake in the Middle East Airlines today, this is also the third aspect we seek.
* What are the reasons for the absence of the Saudi aviation, is the weakness of the airports is the reason?
- The absence of strategy, there is no strategy and no vision. The tendency was a random move until we reached the stage we reached today, while if you set a goal and plans to reach this goal there will be an achievement of these results up to 100% or 50% or 30%. Briefly, the fund will be the main driver of the major sectors within Saudi Arabia. The fund will have a very large cash flow from Aramco and this will be directed in no less than 50% and up to 70% in new sectors within Saudi Arabia (mining, local content, logistics). After covering opportunities within Saudi Arabia, the remaining 50% and 30% will be directed to outside Saudi Arabia to the promising sectors that are possible to be in the forefront ten years from today, and. Details for all of this will be announced in the launch of the program of the Public Investment Fund in accurate and detailed manner.
* When the project was announced cash; people reacted that they wanted the habitation, what the opinion of Your Highness?
- We have so many fronts we are working on them, and we cannot then stop a certain entity that achieved an achievement because there is a delay in the other side. It will disrupt the work of the whole government, it is imposed on all sides to support, stimulate and reach an achievement, and the one that is delayed is to be investigated about the delay and its reasons and how we work on it. This is a side, the other side that spend on the public investment fund is not the state. It is one of the fund's unexploited assets. In the past, it was giving us a profit of 1%, and at the best case 2.5%, and there are bonds and funds outside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Today, we transfer these amounts to Saudi Arabia and we invest in sectors that give a profit of better than 2.5% or 1%, develop key sectors and contribute to the local content on the entertainment side. Ultimately, this will create profits for the Fund, the Fund will turn it to the state treasury that will make the state position more powerful so that it covers more expenses of “housing and other expenses” that the state need. In addition to creating job opportunities that contribute to solving many of the problems of Saudi citizens, as well as they contribute to the development of the private sector.
* Among the programs that were presented last Sunday the housing program and there was a reference to three solutions. What is the vision of Your Highness through the program to the issue of housing?
- We are optimistic and we expect the situation for us is more positive than we thought, there will be hundreds of thousands of free units in the housing program, there will also be more than one million units in soft loans for Saudi citizens. The first will be without payment for hundreds of thousands of units and there is no specific number, and the accurate number will be announced at the time of the launching of the housing program, but there will undoubtedly be more than one million units sold by the facilitator or loan from the Real Estate Development Fund, the Real Estate Development Fund will contribute to lending and also the easy sale, the Public Investment Fund will also contribute to the housing sector.
* Will the fund return to its previous role in pumping money?
- The Real Estate Development Fund is undoubtedly one of the main drivers of the development of the housing sector. We have three types of housing. The first one is the free one, hundreds of thousands, I cannot give you the final number. The second one is the housing supported by the real estate development fund. Third one is the housing from the main investor which is the government and it sells easily and at a discounted price to the Saudi citizen. This is a very long-term loan whose profit to the fund is only 3%, while the citizen can own his unit on the second day and he can pay for many years without affecting his main income. Not to mention, the free units as large as possible to citizens who cannot cover the costs of housing programs. 
* When Your Highness is expected to start the project launch?
- Imposed within 6 months, I do not expect it to be one of the first programs to be launched because it is very complex and has very high spending, I expect it will be launched in the third quarter of 2017.
* Your Highness the Prince, there is a fear haunt some economic writers about Aramco and that it is the property of the state and that it should not be offered for subscription opinion. What is your opinion?
- I think that this thought tends to be communist socialist thought that everything must be owned by the state even the bakery must be the property of the state. Fundamentally, there was an intention to put Aramco on the market, and that had been stated in the main documents in which Aramco was established under the reign of King Abdul Aziz - may God have mercy on him – at that time. Today, you have a very valuable company and you can keep this company in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, keep its impacts in Saudi Arabia, and make it grow in Saudi Arabia, while benefiting from its value by stimulating other sectors that are not in Saudi Arabia. This will help us capture many opportunities like we spoke at the beginning of the interview. If you did not put Aramco on the market means that we will continue 50 years or 40 years to develop the mining sector, it will take 40 years for us to develop local content, and it will take years to develop logistics services, such as what we lost 40 years ago while we were trying to develop these sectors. When we offer part of Aramco's shares and take this cash and create new and strong sectors in Saudi Arabia, we will develop the economy, create jobs, improve government and fund revenues and other benefits, and at the same time Aramco still in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
* How much will you sell, what is the percentage?
- There are two main factors to determine the percentage of the offering.
* What will we sell? Is the service, wells, or what?
- We sell the value of the company, while wells are owned by the state, only the company has the right to use these wells, which is in the past and still at the present and has not changed anymore. The size of the quota to be sold is governed by to two factors, one is the demand, is there a demand or not. Second, what do we have on (Pay Plan) as investments in or outside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. There was a request, but we need the cash. Because we do not have a sector that invests in Saudi Arabia or absorbs this investment, why do we sell a stake for Aramco, but if there is a request and find a sector that needs this investment, the second day we will sell. This is the two factors that will determine how much we sell from Aramco, but undoubtedly will not be far from 5% too much.


* When will the Aramco project be sold?
- 2018.
* Do you now work on papers and permits?
- That is right.
* If Aramco is sold. Who will determine the ceiling of Aramco's production?
- Determination of the production ceiling would be the prerogative of the Saudi government, increasing the production at the price that suits the company is in favor of the Government of Saudi Arabia. A part of the governmental revenues is from the oil tax (50%) on the oil sold or produced, as well as the taxes it receives from Aramco. The government's interest is to develop the profits of Aramco, meaning that the government will not take a decision that violates its interests and the interests of Aramco in the rate of production.
* Your Highness the prince, the subject of production with the economic vision and mentality in the market, will the production be freed from the political decision?
- Production is not a political decision, production is an economic decision, it was not a political decision at all in the past, production is an economic decision, what is the economic benefit to determine the appropriate production price, this is governed by supply and demand and coordination with OPEC countries and countries outside OPEC to coordinate the amount of supply and demand so that there is no collapse or confusion in oil prices.
* One of the programs that have been launched last Sunday, is the investment program to stimulate 100 companies to turn either to regional or to international companies, what are the companies targeted to raise their level?
- I cannot name companies now, there are companies where part of them is in the stock market and companies outside the stock market. We acquire more than 100 companies that have the opportunity to turn from a local company into a leading regional company. We also acquire companies that have the opportunity to turn from a leading regional company to a leading global company, and we have a group of companies that can achieve this transformation and this huge impact that will be reflected on the Saudi economy. They need easy procedures, facilities and agreements with other countries, facilitate their sales, and facilitate their spread. 
* Will the government negotiate on behalf of companies and take care of their interests?
- Undoubtedly, we can touch that all the governments of the world are doing this. The last of which was few days ago when we had the German Chancellor with the managers of the most important companies in Germany, and she was negotiating as if these companies are belonging to the German government, she also was entering in all the details for the success of the work of these companies. The Saudi government should play its role to turn the success of Saudi national companies. This will transform 100 Saudi companies from local leading companies to regional leading companies and from regional leading companies to global leading companies, and also this will provide us with experience in how to turn these companies into large ones so that after 2020 we operate programs targeting a wider range of these companies.
* Does this mean that the state can lend them?
- it may be according to what will be announced in the program.

* Private sector now complains of high operating costs, and believes that this will become harmful to the industry and in trade, what is the opinion of Your Highness regarding the high prices and the shrinking economic situation?
- I do not think this is accurate, but the programs that will come out will stimulate the private sector very strongly. Sales of the private sector will increase very strongly. If you spend hundreds of billions in a short period of time, this will undoubtedly have a very positive effect on the private sector. I would like to give you an example. In the past, we used to rely solely on government capital expenditure. Nowadays, in the coming years, we will have high government capital spending, that is the first thing. The second: there will be spending from the reserves mentioned in the fiscal balance program is 200 billion riyals for private sector development, this spending differs than the capital spending we are all used to. Thirdly: and it is important- it is the spend of the Public Investment Fund. The Public Investment Fund will spend in Saudi Arabia, after Aramco has been sold, more than SR 500 billion in just three years. You can imagine this spending in the military industry, the automotive industry, the entertainment industry, the tourism industry or in other industries. How will it affect all of the private sector, and this will stimulate their sales in very strong manner in all sectors, both in the retail, transport, services sector and so on. 
* Will you impose taxes on corporate income?
- No, this has not and will not be mentioned in the program of financial balance. We mentioned that there would be no taxes on wealth or any taxes on income.
* Companies coming to Saudi Arabia, Are there facilities for foreign investment?
- That is true, today, the Ministry of Commerce is working on screening the work of the Investment Authority. We worked different than what was happening in the past of waiting for the demand comes from the companies, but today we pick up the companies that we want to work in Saudi Arabia. There is a very long list of companies that the Investment Authority must seize each year and enter them in the Saudi market.
* Is there anyone who wants to enter but complain about the procedures we have?
- This is true, and they are all easy procedures and contribute very significantly to the work of these companies. For example, remind you the last event in the visit of German Chancellor, the German companies have had a problem that our license in Saudi Arabia only lasts for one year, while their strategies and investments are based on four years. They have been given a change in this aspect so that the license lasts for five years, this are easy procedures that greatly stimulate the work of foreign companies in Saudi Arabia.
* With respect to the health sector, it means the privatization of the health sector, it was published on the lips of the Minister in a symposium that the hospitals will be privatized, and then it was said that it will become some state-owned companies, what is the reality of the privatization of the health sector, and how it will be, and other important sectors?
- The health sector is privatized in all the successful globally countries. If we look at the United States for example, we do not find the US government owns hospitals, each hospital either owned by the private sector or non-profit sector. The role of the government is to guarantees a free treatment for Saudi citizens. Instead of we occupy a hospital and we spend on them and come at a quality that will be rejected by the citizen, we privatize and owned by companies and ensure the policy of insurance for every citizen. And the citizen has the choice of selecting the hospital which he wants to get the treatment in, whether private sector or non-profit sector. This will bring great competition to all private hospitals and provide quality services so that they attract this citizen who has an insurance policy and earn more profits, and it will create a better health sector with better services and much less corruption. Because it became some interests among stakeholders and it will ease the very high load of management for the Saudi government. It will also reduce the costs that the Saudi government spend on the health sector, while these expenses will be spent in other sectors that are in need for these expenses.  
* When does this wheel start?
- It is a very complex project, we expect that things will be clearer during the current year.
* What are the other sectors that can be privatized in the near future?
- The municipal services sector, also the transport sector, primarily airports, aviation and ports. Those are the main sectors that we are targeting at this stage.
* In the subject of vision, your Highness has mentioned that there will be an increase in the number of those wishing to perform Umrah and Hajj through the preparation of the two Holy Mosques and its facilitation. But Muslims in Pakistan, for example, or from other countries or Muslims residing here, believe that the fees will affect so that the turnout will be decreased, and instead of having a person four times of Umrah a year, he will perform it one time?
- This is an incorrect propaganda, and we know who is behind it, which is a loathing of Saudi Arabia. It hates the interests of Saudi Arabia in one way or another and tries to seize any opportunity to alienate the Muslim peoples from Saudi Arabia. First, before this decision, there were a fee for Hajj and Umrah of 50 Saudi riyals, even for who come for the first time should pay 50 riyals on the visas of Hajj and Umrah. This decision is not targeting the visas of Hajj and Umrah, but targets all visas of the Saudi government and to unite its price at one price. As awareness from the Saudi Government, in order to serve hajjis and pilgrims, the first Hajj and the first Umrah of any Muslim were paid at the expense of the government. If there is a Muslim wants to make the first pilgrimage, he will not pay the value of the visa, and the Saudi government will pay the visa. Also, if there is a Muslim wants to make the first Umrah, the Saudi government will pay the fees of the visa. But for those who are coming again for the second or third time, he firstly drains the Saudi economy and we served for the free first time. Secondly, he takes the place of a citizen in various Islamic countries wants to come for Hajj and Umrah.
* A minister has been exempted because of overrides and the abuse of power. Is this decision is for a activating the authority of corruption?
Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud - may Allah protect him - has made changes from the first day he took the judgment, sensing the importance of the role of the authority if corruption. And also, his dissatisfaction with the role that the Authority of Corruption are playing. If the fight against corruption is not at the head of power that is meaning that you do not have the fight against corruption and you will not succeed no matter how you worked. I assure you that there will never be an exception for anyone who involved in a corruption case, whether a minister, a prince, or whatever. Anyone who convicted by enough evidence against him will be charged.
* Will social media networking contribute to detecting corruption if any?
- We must not take documents on the issue of corruption from social networking sites, where we cannot identify the counterfeit from the non-counterfeited, the real or the not real, and who has a special agenda of those who do not have a special agenda. Any Saudi citizen can be in his hand any documents of corruption or information linked to anyone or else and he believes that there is corruption, he can submit this document to the competent authorities headed by the Anti-Corruption Authority, and he must be confident that the competent authorities are in turn.
* You Highness the Prince, the open war on Houthi in Yemen, will it last?
- No one wants to continue the war.
* What is its future in your opinion?
- No doubt that when the war had there was no option for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, it is a must to do it, or the other will be the scenario is much worse. First his coup on the legitimacy by militias, that classified as terrorist militias and we a negative experience with them in 2009. Secondly, these Militias are forming a threat to international navigation, and all Yemen's neighbors. The third, the terrorist activity which began in the other party in southern Yemen are active in a very strong exploitation of the work of these militias, and if we waited a little danger will become more complex and will become dangerous within the territory of Saudi Arabia, within the territory of the countries in the region, and in the major international crossing points. So that, we have had no other choice. I think the Saudi armed forces have achieved very big achievements. When the operations began, the legitimate control was almost zero% on Yemeni territory. Today, the legitimacy controls 80 or 85% of the Yemeni territory, while another alliance was found in northern Saudi Arabia in Iraq and Syria to fight Da'ash, which controls part of Iraq. 60 countries led by the United States from 2014, that was a year ago before us, and until today they did not do anything. But, we are 10 countries in the region and we were able to achieve an achievement in a shorter time than the war in Iraq and Syria, this is an achievement for the Saudi armed forces, Yemeni forces, and alliance forces. 
* As long as they continued to control the Yemeni territory, why legitimate authority does not move to Yemen?
- The legitimacy authority always moves between Yemen and Saudi Arabia and it has been in Aden for a long time and always avoid being the president and vice president are both in Yemen in order to mitigate the danger of the liquidation of Yemeni legitimacy, so they make steps in this way.
* There is a talk about a disagreement between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates about “El-Eslah group”, their role in the war, and the future of Yemen. What is the validity of this speech? 
- Rumors are too many and certainly enemies want to create as much rumors as possible among allies.
* Why are the areas under the control of al-Houthi, a more secure and stable like Sanaa than the legitimacy areas in Taiz and Aden?
- I want the source of your information, and I am skeptical of this thing completely.
* Some reports say that the alliance intelligence reports are ineffective with evidence that Houthi and Saleh still have weapons stocks?
- We can uproot Houthi and Saleh in just few days, and we can mobilize only the Saudi land forces alone and in a few days, clear all areas and the remaining 15% under the control of Houthi and Ali Abdullah Saleh. But the result will be victims in our forces by the thousands, and we will open condolences in every Saudi city and the second result is the victims of Yemeni civilians in very high and very large losses. And the time is in our side, the long breath is ours. We have the supply, we have all logistical supplies, and our morals are high. While the enemy has no supply, no money, and does not have a long breath. Time is in our favor and we will take advantage of the time that is in our favor for us. If we do not take advantage of the time that is in our favor, we have served the enemy.
* There are proposals from Ali Saleh. cannot this be a way to isolate Houthi?
- Ali Abdullah Saleh has a very big disagreement with Houthi and we know that he is today under the control and the custody of Houthi, if he is not under the control of guardianship of Houthi, his position will be completely different from his position today without a doubt. If Ali Abdullah Saleh left Sanaa to another area his position will be quite different from his position today. Today, he may be forced to many of the positions he mentioned.
* He submitted an initiative when his son came at the beginning of the war, but you refused?
- That is true, that we were trying to make a political initiative that would make us avoid the war and we were opening a discussion line at that time provided that they did not approach Aden, because if they approached Aden, it would be very difficult to discuss a political solution, and Houthi was courting in Yemen. Unfortunately, nothing has happened as we hope and we have been forced into operations.

* Your Highness the Prince, there are forces that are neither belonging to the legitimacy nor the coupists. Why do not the kingdom open lines with these forces?
- All lines are open whether the forces belong to the legitimacy or force belongs to Ali Abdullah Saleh, or those who are not belong to both sides. And every day we are attracting more.

* Are the tribes of the northern Yemen concealed neutrality? You met with the tribes how do you see them today?
- There is no doubt that the enthusiasm was very high among them and all of them are very much hatred of the Houthi group and want to get rid of them as soon as they can devote to Yemen's development programs.

* I refer to the subject of Egypt again. The relationships with Egypt were excellent. Then the Egyptian media began to suggest that the relations were almost broken, what is happening?
- You mean the media of “Muslim brotherhood”. The media criticizing Saudi Arabia or the Saudi-Egyptian relationship is the same criticizing President Sisi. The Saudi-Egyptian relationship has a strong and solid relationship in the deepest roots of the relations between the countries that are not affected in any way. In the history of Egypt and Saudi Arabia, they always stand with each other conditions and at all times. That situation did not change and there is no a situation of negative attitude of the Egyptian government towards Saudi Arabia, and also, there is no a situation of negative attitude of one of the Saudi government to the Egyptian government. Egypt has not been delayed for a moment to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Saudi Arabia will not be delayed for a moment to Egypt. This is a strong conviction between the leaders of the two countries, but also between the people of both countries. Without a doubt, the enemies of Saudi Arabia and Egypt will try to create rumors in one form or another, whether from Iranian propaganda or the media of “Muslim brotherhood” propaganda to cause a rift in the Saudi-Egyptian relationship, and the leadership of the two countries does not pay attention to these polemics and trivialities.

* Your Highness has mentioned the subject of King Salman Bridge between the Kingdom and Egypt. Do Your Highness bet on it? 
- That is true, the working relevant teams have started working in the offices, not in front of the media the bridge after the bridge has been approved. The results will be announced when laying the foundation stone with full details, and the time of laying the foundation stone before 2020 without a doubt.

* The islands. Have you finished the subject of islands?
- There were no problems with the islands originally.
* We heard the Egyptian media speaks about the subject that within the corridors of the courts?
- which occurred about a year ago is only a delimitation of the maritime boundaries. The islands are registered with Egypt as a Saudi islands and they are registered with Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as Saudi islands. And are also, registered in the international centers as Saudi islands. Only the demarcation of the maritime borders has been done. Both Egypt and Saudi Arabia has not relinquished any part of their territories. The demarcation of the border came for reasons of economic benefits that could be created after the demarcation of these borders, especially the King Salman Bridge, oil supply, gas supplies, power supply or train and roads that will target the port in North Sinai, and the exports of Gulf countries to Europe.
* Is it possible to see in the future a direct dialogue with Iran, despite what it is doing in the region?
- How to reach an understanding with one who has the regime is firmly convinced that his system is based on the ideology of extremism enshrined in the Constitution and stipulated in the command of Khomeini that he must control the Muslims of the Islamic world and the dissemination of the doctrine of Jaafari-Ethna Ashry ethnic of them throughout the Islamic world until the Mahdi appears. How can I convince this person? What are the interests between me and him? When I have a problem with another state, we start to solve it. For example, if there is an economic problem there is a continuation of what you want and what we want and how we understand it. Or a political problem, for example with Russia how to cooperate in Syria. What are your interests and what are mine. How do we cooperate in Yemen and what are your interests? How do we communicate with him ?! his logic is that the Mahdi will come and he must fertile the environment for the arrival of the Mahdi and they must control the Muslim world. They deprive their people for more than thirty years of development and put him in the stage of hunger and poor infrastructure to achieve this goal, they will not change their mind on the day and night. Otherwise, their legislation will end within Iran. What are the points of convergence that can be discussed with this system! They are almost nonexistent. This system has been tested at more than one stage, in the time of Rafsanjani and it turned out to be just plays. After the Khomeini revolution, the strategy of expansion came to anger the world and then the leader of the peace who was Rafsanjani until he gained the confidence of the world, including us, he gained our confidence. After reaching another stage and a good environment, an extremist leader is sent to continue the process of expansion, such as what we saw with Ahmadinejad in Iraq, Syria and other locations. Then another leader comes to preserve the gains to satisfy the world. And then an extremist commander comes in order to continue the deployment of expansion, this will not happen, this is over. The believer is not bitten twice from a hole. We have been bitten once, and we will not be bitten again. And we know that we are the main goal of the Iranian regime, to access to the Muslim Qibla is the major goal of the Iranian regime. We will never wait until the battle occurs in Saudi Arabia, but we will work to have the battle in Iran rather than in Saudi Arabia.
* What do you think of the solution in Syria, how do you see?
- Syria is undoubtedly a very complex situation, no doubt that former US President Barack Obama missed a lot of important opportunities that could have made a big change in Syria. Today, Syria has become an international issue. Russia is present there and it is a superpower and a big country. The United States of America exists and all five major countries are there. Any friction that may occurs between these big powers could cause a crisis which is much bigger than the Middle East crisis, the situation is very complex. Today we are trying to make the most gains for the interests of Saudi Arabia, the interests of the Syrian people and the countries of the region.

re your comment on predicting Trump, there is HL Mencken's famous phrase:

It is IMPOSSIBLE to underestimate the intelligence of the American people.”

and then from Richard Hofstadter's 1964 book on Ant-intellectualism in American Life:
There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has

been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that
democracy means that my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.”

Only thing stupefying me about Trump so far is that all his EPA appointees come from the great wasteland called

universal quantum computers was the first full treatment of the subject; the Deutsch-

When he initially proposed it, quantum computation seemed practically

quantum communication systems never would have taken place without his work. He has
made many other important contributions in areas such as quantum cryptography and
the many-worlds interpretation of quantum theory. In a philosophic paper (with Artur

argue that our knowledge of mathematics is derived from, and subordinate to, our
knowledge of physics (even though mathematical truth is independent of physics).

Because he has spent a good part of his working life changing people's
worldviews, his recognition among his peers as an intellectual goes well beyond his
scientific achievement. He argues (following Karl Popper) that scientific theories are
“bold conjectures, ” not derived from evidence but only tested by it. His two main lines of

Nixon’s official visit (the Shanghai Communiqué). The result was, as
he puts it, “a quasi alliance,” which, though initially intended to
contain the Soviet Union, ended up outliving the Cold War.

In this telling, however, Kissinger is able to take advantage of recent
research that illuminates the Chinese side of the story. The American
opening to China was also a Chinese opening to America, actuated
above all by Mao Zedong’s fear of encirclement. “Think about this,”
Mao told his doctor in 1969. “We have the Soviet Union to the north
and the west, India to the south, and Japan to the east. If all our
enemies were to unite, attacking us from the north, south, east, and
west, what do you think we should do?” The medic had no idea.
“Think again,” said Mao. “Beyond Japan is the United States. Didn’t
our ancestors counsel negotiating with faraway countries while
fighting with those that are near?” It was to explore the American
option that Mao recalled four Army marshals from exile. Skirmishes
were already underway between Soviet and Chinese forces on the
Ussuri River. In October 1970 Mao ordered China’s top leadership to
evacuate Beijing and put the People’s Liberation Army on “‘first-
degree combat readiness.” The stakes for China were high indeed—
higher than for the United States. As Kissinger shows, it was far
from unusual for Mao to refer to “our ancestors’ counsel.” Despite
his lifelong commitment to Marxism-Leninism, Mao was also steeped
in the classics of Chinese civilization, as were his close advisers. “We
can consult the example of Zhuge Liang’s strategic guiding
principle,” Marshal Ye Jian-ying suggested, “when the three states of
Wei, Shu, and Wu confronted each other: ‘Ally with Wu in the east
to oppose Wei in the north.’ ” The allusion, Kissinger explains, is to
Romance of the Three Kingdoms, a 14th-century epic novel set in the
so-called Warring States period (475-221 B.C.).

Herbie Hancock is a true icon of modern music. Throughout
his explorations, he has transcended limitations and

genres while maintaining his unmistakable voice. With an
illustrious career spanning five decades and 14 Grammy®
Awards, including Album of the Year for River: The Joni
Letters, he continues to amaze audiences across the globe.

There are few artists in the music industry
who have had more influence on acoustic and electronic
jazz and R&B than Herbie Hancock. As the immortal
Miles Davis said in his autobiography, “Herbie was
the step after Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk, and I
haven’t heard anybody yet who has come after him.”

Born in Chicago in 1940, Herbie was a child
piano prodigy who performed a Mozart piano concerto
with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at age 11. He
began playing jazz in high school, initially influenced
by Oscar Peterson and Bill Evans. He also developed a
passion for electronics and science, and double-majored
in music and electrical engineering at Grinnell College.

In 1960, Herbie was discovered by trumpeter Donald
Byrd. After two years of session work with Byrd as well as
Phil Woods and Oliver Nelson, he signed with Blue Note
as a solo artist. His 1963 debut album, ‘Takin’ Off’, was an
immediate success, producing the hit “Watermelon Man.”

In 1963, Miles Davis invited Herbie to join the
Miles Davis Quintet. During his five years with Davis, Herbie
and his colleagues Wayne Shorter (tenor sax), Ron Carter
(bass), and Tony Williams (drums) recorded many classics,
including ‘ESP’, ‘Nefertiti’ and ‘Sorcerer’. Later on, Herbie
made appearances on Davis’ groundbreaking ‘In a Silent Way’
and ‘Bitches Brew’, which heralded the birth of jazz-fusion.

Herbie’s own solo career blossomed on Blue Note,
with classic albums including ‘Maiden Voyage’, ‘Empyrean
Isles’, and “Speak Like a Child’. He composed the score to
Michelangelo Antonioni’s 1966 film ‘Blow Up’, which led to
a successful career in feature film and television music.

After leaving Davis, Herbie put together a new
band called The Headhunters and, in 1973, recorded ‘Head
Hunters.’ With its crossover hit single “Chameleon,”
it became the first jazz album to go platinum.

By mid-decade, Herbie was playing for stadium-sized
crowds all over the world and had no fewer than four albums in
the pop charts at once. In total, Herbie had 11 albums in the pop
charts during the 1970s. His ’7o0s output inspired and provided
samples for generations of hip-hop and dance music artists.

Herbie also stayed close to his love of acoustic
jazz in the ’7os, recording and performing with VSOP
(reuniting him with his Miles Davis colleagues), and in
duet settings with Chick Corea and Oscar Peterson.

In 1980, Herbie introduced the trumpeter Wynton
Marsalis to the world as a solo artist, producing his debut
album and touring with him as well. In 1983, a new pull to the
alternative side led Herbie to a series of collaborations with

Bill Laswell. The first, ‘Future Shock’, again struck platinum,
and the single “Rockit” rocked the dance and R&B charts,
winning a Grammy for Best R&B Instrumental. The video of
the track won five MTV awards. ‘Sound System’, the follow-up,
also received a Grammy in the R&B instrumental category.

Herbie won an Oscar in 1986 for scoring the
film “’Round Midnight”, in which he also appeared as
an actor. Numerous television appearances over the
years led to two hosting assignments in the 1980s: “Rock
School” on PBS and Showtime’s “Coast To Coast”.

After an adventurous 1994 project for Mercury
Records, ‘Dis Is Da Drum’, he moved to the Verve label,
forming an all-star band to record 1996’s Grammy-
winning ‘The New Standard’. In 1997, an album of
duets with Wayne Shorter, ‘1+1’, was released.

The legendary Headhunters reunited in 1998,
recording an album for Herbie’s own Verve-distributed
imprint, and touring with the Dave Matthews Band. That
year also marked the recording and release of ‘“Gershwin’s
World’, which included collaborators Joni Mitchell, Stevie
Wonder, Kathleen Battle, the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra,
Wayne Shorter and Chick Corea. ‘Gershwin’s World’ won three
Grammys in 1999, including Best Traditional Jazz Album
and Best R&B Vocal Performance for Stevie Wonder’s
“St. Louis Blues.”

Herbie reunited with Bill Laswell to collaborate
with some young hip-hop and techno artists on
2001's FUTURE2FUTURE. He also joined with Roy
Hargrove and Michael Brecker in 2002 to record a live
concert album, ‘Directions In Music: Live at Massey
Hall’, a tribute to John Coltrane and Miles Davis.

‘Possibilities’, released in August 2005, teamed
Herbie with many popular artists, such as Sting, Annie Lennox,
John Mayer, Christina Aguilera, Paul Simon, Carlos Santana,
Joss Stone and Damien Rice. That year, he played a number
of concert dates with a re-staffed Headhunters,
and became the first-ever Artist-In-Residence at
the Tennessee-based festival Bonnaroo.

In 2007, Hancock recorded and released ‘River: The
Joni Letters’, a tribute to longtime friend and collaborator Joni
Mitchell featuring Wayne Shorter, guitarist Lionel Loueke,
bassist Dave Holland and drummer Vinnie Colaiuta and co-
produced by Larry Klein. He enlisted vocalists Norah Jones,
Tina Turner, Corinne Bailey Rae, Luciana Souza, Leonard
Cohen and Mitchell herself to perform songs she wrote or was
inspired by. The album received glowing reviews and was a
year-end Top 10 choice for many critics. It also garnered three
Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year; Herbie is one
of only a handful of jazz musicians ever to receive that honor.

In 2010 Hancock released the critically-acclaimed
CD, ‘Herbie Hancock’s The Imagine Project,’ winner of two
2oll Grammy Awards for Best Pop Collaboration and Best
Improvised Jazz Solo. Utilizing the universal language of

music to express its central themes of peace and global
responsibility, the ‘Imagine’ project was recorded around
the world and features a stellar group of musicians
including Jeff Beck, Seal,Pink, Dave Matthews, The
Chieftains, Lionel Loueke, Oumou Sangare, Konono

#1, Anoushka Shankar, Chaka Khan, Marcus Miller,
Derek Trucks, Susan Tedeschi, Tinariwen, and Ceu.

Herbie Hancock also maintains a thriving career
outside the performing stage and recording studio. Recently
named by the Los Angeles Philharmonic as Creative Chair
For Jazz, he currently also serves as Institute Chairman of the
Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz, the foremost international
organization devoted to the development of jazz performance
and education worldwide. Hancock is also a founder of
The International Committee of Artists for Peace, and was
recently awarded the much esteemed “Commandeur des Arts
et des Lettres” by French Prime Minister Francois Fillon.

In July of 2011 Hancock was designated a UNESCO
Goodwill Ambassador by UNESCO Director-General Irina
Bokova. Recognizing Herbie Hancock’s “dedication to the
promotion of peace through dialogue, culture and the arts,”
the Director-General has asked the celebrated jazz musician
“to contribute to UNESCO’s efforts to promote mutual
understanding among cultures, with a particular emphasis on
fostering the emergence of new and creative ideas amongst
youth, to find solutions to global problems, as well as ensuring
equal access to the diversity of artistic expressions.” UNESCO's
Goodwill Ambassadors are an outstanding group of celebrity
advocates who have generously accepted to use their talent
and status to help focus the world’s attention on the objectives
and aims of UNESCO’s work in its fields of competence:
education, culture, science and communication/information

Now in the fifth decade of his professional life,
Herbie Hancock remains where he has always been: in the
forefront of world culture, technology, business and music.
Though one can’t track exactly where he will go next, he is
sure to leave his inimitable imprint wherever he lands.

peaks occurred more than two years after the peak in the growth rate of earnings. Moreover, stock
market returns have remained healthy during this period, with high odds of a positive outcome over
the subsequent 6-24 months (see Exhibit 1). In short, the market ultimately follows the path of
earnings and while their growth rate may be slowing, their absolute level is still rising.

Inflation and Interest Rates

Inflation data has remained at relatively low levels for all of 2018, as shown in Exhibits 2 and 3. In
fact, some of the most recent data released in October have ticked slightly lower. Average hourly
earnings dropped to 2.8% from the prior month’s level of 2.9%. Headline CPI dropped to 2.3% from
2./% and Core CPI ex-food and energy remain at a low 2.2%, unchanged from the prior month. The
Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation indicator, Core PCE, also remains low at 2.0% which is in line
with the Federal Reserve’s target, and unchanged from the prior month.

While 10-year Treasury yields have risen by 0.76% (or 76 basis points) over the course of 2018, we
do not think the resulting 3.2% yield is enough to derail US economic growth. Keep in mind that most
of the recent increase since late August was due to stronger real growth rather than runaway inflation
expectations. We expect interest rates to range between 3.0% and 3.5% in 2019 with a midpoint of
3.25%, barring any major geopolitical conflicts such as one between US and China and or escalating
conflicts in the Middle East.

Eye on the Market, April 9, 2012 (attached pdf is easier to read this week)

Topics: Q&A on the USA, with a watchful eye on the risk of giant man-eating plants; Spain

 

Our view for 2012 was that economic and equity market conditions in the US and Asia ex-Japan would be better than in Europe.  So far, that view is on track.  Spain in particular is in difficult shape (see page 5); its banks and government may have to borrow 1.5 trillion Euros over the next 12 months while in recession.  Both the ECB and EU will need to keep the spigot open to prevent Spain from becoming a bigger problem.  This week, some Q&A on the US recovery, flows into bonds and stocks, profits and P/E multiples, municipal bonds, and the long-term US fiscal situation. 

 

The Fed appears to be saying that no additional monetary easing is needed unless the economy worsens further.  Are there any signs that the US recovery is becoming self-reinforcing?

Durable goods consumption, equipment & software spending, vehicle sales, bank loans to companies, manufacturing payrolls (even after Friday’s disappointing report) and housing stats (building permits, multifamily housing starts) have improved over the last few months.  While delinquency rates are in better shape (credit card delinquencies are back to 2007 levels), household credit growth is still weak.  However, homebuilders are seeing stronger demand, and nationwide remodeling continues to rise.  We see opportunities in retailing and building products companies that may benefit from a continuation in these trends.

 



 

Has the data really been that good?  I heard better US economic data has a lot to do with the weather.

Parts of the US experienced the warmest March in recorded history.  Measured from December to February, the winter was the 4th warmest on record.  I don’t think there are reliable models to estimate the impact of demand being pulled forward, so we will have to see how consumer spending, housing and payrolls behave in the months ahead.  As our Chief Economist Michael Vaknin reminds me, other distortions come from the “catch-up” effect from Japan’s tsunami.  As shown below, some strength in auto sales came from pent-up demand for Japanese cars, a process which now seems complete.

 



 

So where does that leave the US payroll and growth picture?

The weakness in the payroll report was almost entirely concentrated in retailing.  Net of distortions and seasonal adjustments, it looks like payroll growth is running at 150-175k per month, and GDP growth is running at a 2.25% trend pace, both below prior recoveries.  While 2.25% is a barn-burner compared to Europe, it only corresponds to a modest improvement in employment.  That’s why 2013 US fiscal policy is so important: this is not a recovery that can withstand much tighter fiscal conditions.

 

So, how tight is US fiscal policy supposed to get next year?

Very, if you look at what is supposed to happen according to current law. In the chart, we show the annual change in the budget deficit over the last 25 years.  The impact of all provisions scheduled to expire and kick in during 2013 would be very large.  But if Congress and the President elect to extend current tax rates, retain lower payroll tax rates and extended jobless benefits, etc, the adjustment would not be as big, and only reflect expiration of Recovery Act provisions, the recently passed Budget Control Act, and some other smaller provisions.  There are of course plenty of permutations in between.

 



 

What direction is the Congress heading, and what did Larry Summers and Brad DeLong have to say about this recently?

Political outcomes this fall will affect what Congress does, but I get the sense that they will punt fiscal adjustments into the future if they can, and impose austerity of no more than 1% of GDP in 2013.   If so, Congress can point to a March 2012 paper by Summers and DeLong as justification.  The bottom line from the paper: don’t tighten fiscal policy when interest rates are near zero.  The authors assert that (a) additional government spending can ease the long-term budget constraint in conditions similar to today’s, and (b) tightening policy now would risk permanent loss of human capital, lower labor productivity growth and lower trend growth.  They have held these views for a while; the paper appears designed to convince others.

 

Advocates for more fiscal and monetary stimulus often point to the charts below.  Rising Federal debt has not resulted in higher interest rates, so why not keep borrowing more?  As for the Fed, balance sheet expansion prevented deflation and hasn’t resulted in an inflationary surge (core inflation measured over 3 months just came in below 2%), so why not keep doing it?   Aren’t these charts amazing?

 



 

They are amazing, but no one knows how long they can be sustained.  Even Summers and DeLong concede that “even if it is granted that the stimulus can be both timely and temporary, the question of how large it can be while preserving these attributes remains for future research”.    If one of these trends could not be sustained, my guess is that it would be fiscal constraints rather than monetary ones.  While it’s great to see rising Federal debt not adversely affecting Treasury markets, the chart on the left reminds me of The Day of the Triffids.

 

What is The Day of the Triffids?

It’s a 1951 science fiction novel.  There’s a meteor shower, and most people go outside to look at it.  The next morning, everyone who looked at the meteor shower ends up blind, and Earth is taken over by giant man-eating venomous plants.  The point: some amazing events which look benign have unforeseen consequences.  Will a pact of going for growth pay the freight of higher Federal debt in the long run?  Hard to say; there are not a lot of examples to draw from.  Economic theories and their associated debt bubbles don’t always work out as planned [a].  After WWII, the US also faced a debt ratio of 80% of GDP.  Austerity was not the answer back then; government receipts and outlays as a % of GDP did not change much during the 1950’s, and net debt was flat.  So how did US debt/GDP fall from 80% to 46% in just ten years?  Robust annualized real growth of more than 4.0%, and 2.0% inflation.  However, unique economic conditions and productivity gains of the 1950’s (e.g., interstate highway, rebuilding of Europe and Japan) may not be repeated, and the country was not headed into an entitlement time bomb.  If the US does not experience a growth/productivity boom, the burden of higher debt could last for a generation or more. A pro-growth Administration would probably help, but the difficulty lay in defining exactly what that means. 



 

Are there debt vs austerity parallels at the state and local level?

Yes and no.  At the state and local level, over last decade, more than 1 trillion in unfunded pension and healthcare (OPEB) related liabilities were recognized (they were accrued over a longer period).  Even these “as-reported” estimates, which come from the states, may be underestimated.  A 2011 analysis by the Joint Economic Committee shows that lower portfolio return assumptions on pension assets sharply increase the magnitude of underfunded pensions (see chart, right).

 



 

However, there’s more of an effort at the state/local level to address this issue than at the Federal level.  More than 40 states lowered pension benefit liabilities over the last 3 years according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Measures taken include raising employee contributions (while lowering employer payments), raising minimum retirement ages, cutting post-employment healthcare benefits and in some cases, switching to defined contribution from defined benefit plans.

 

The good news, to paraphrase Mark Twain, is that reports of municipal bonds’ demise have been greatly exaggerated.  From 1970 through to the end of 2011, municipal bonds rated by Moody’s experienced a grand total of 71 defaults among 17,700 issuers (11 of which occurred during 2010 and 2011).  General obligation bonds accounted for 5 defaults; 29 were related to housing; 22 for hospitals and healthcare; 3-4 each for education and infrastructure.  Utilities and cities registered 2 each, while counties, special districts, and water & sewer and experienced 1 each.  The average recovery for defaulted munis was 65%, compared to 49% on corporate senior unsecured bonds.  Last comment on municipals: while local tax collections are weak due to the collapse in home prices, state tax collections have been increasing for 7 quarters in a row.

 



 

OK, so the US economy is improving, but is still heavily dependent on monetary and fiscal stimulus to grow; and the only belt-tightening one can find is at the state and local level.   Since 2009, after equities collapsed and bond prices rose, how have many investors reacted?

By selling more equities and buying a lot more bonds.  See chart above (a global version of this chart looks roughly the same).    

 

Have investors been positioning this way since stocks are expensive?

Not really.  Insert a giant martini glass on the chart below from 1998 to 2001 (I hate using simple averages which include periods when the market had lost its collective mind).  The current P/E multiple is in the middle of the ex-bubble range of the last 25 years.  Some bank stocks look interesting, even after accounting for reliance on shrinking loan loss reserves to drive income, and ongoing regulatory uncertainty.  Most US banks are at or close to Basel 3 funding needs, have considerably fewer capital adequacy questions than their European counterparts, and do not rely on wholesale funding to finance loan portfolios.

 



Now that P/E multiples have risen off the bottom, what’s the outlook for P/E multiples and earnings from here?

The return on the S&P this year has been a function of P/E multiples rising (from 11.3x to 12.9x), a big part of which has been Apple (3% of the S&P index, 15% of S&P’s YTD returns).  As shown below, earnings revisions have been negative for 2012, but analysts are still optimistic about 2013.   According to Morgan Stanley, analysts are forecasting the highest percentage of companies posting 2013 margin expansion since 1970, and by a very wide margin.   In our view, it will be difficult for multiples to rise further unless earnings outperform expectations, particularly if Europe’s structural problems take center stage again. 

 

    

 

The place that worries me the most: Spain.  It ranks at or close to the bottom in a lot of categories (see table), and its growth outlook is poor.  Historically, this kind of thing has not ended well.  Spain has defaulted 13 times since 1500 AD; it’s probably going to take a lot of bilateral aid and ECB financing to prevent another one.

of time.

So [ have a timeframe not that was
provided by your client but that was provided by the
externalities of the case. And that timeframe
coupled with the manifests clearly exonerate me
without any doubt.

Q. Ll want to make sure that I understood what
you just said. I never flew down to Palm Beach
during the relevant timeframe?

A. Inever flew down and stayed at Jeffrey's
house in Palm Beach during that relevant period of
time.

Q. Okay. Se you want to withdraw the
statement that you never flew down to Palm Beach --

Q. Which of the manifests are you referring
to when you claim what you have claimed about the
manifests, Exhibit Number 6 or Exhibit Number 7?

A. [can only tell you that I have reviewed
the manifests and they show, to me, that I was never
on Jeffrey Epstein's airplane during the relevant
period of time. That's all I can tell you now.

I'm not in a position where I look at all
these documents now. If you point me to any
particular trip that shows that I was on Jeffrey
Epstein's plane, | would be happy to respond to
that.

Q. There are two separate collections of
documents purporting to be flight manifests for
Jeffrey Epstein's plane. When you made the public
statements that you made regarding the flight logs
or manifests exonerating you, were you referring to
Exhibit Number 6 or Exhibit Number 7?

A. Ihave no recollection as to which
particular exhibits, which are formed for purposes
of the legal case, | had reviewed. I know I had
reviewed the manifests. Not only had | reviewed the
manifests, but others reviewed the manifests and
have conclusively told me that their review of the
manifests shows that I was right.

MR. SCOTT: Objection, argumentative --

A. Let me be --

MR. SCOTT: -- mischaracterization.

A. Let me be clear. A, [never flew down on
Jeffrey Epstein's plane during the relevant period
of time.

BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. Flew down to where?

A. To Palm Beach or anywhere else. I was
never on Jeffrey Epstein's plane, according to the
flight manifests and according to my own records,
during the relevant period of time.

I have independent records of my travel
which demonstrate that I was not in Jeffrey
Epstein's house during the relevant period of time.
And -- but the -- talking about the manifests, the
manifests conclusively prove that ] was never on the
airplane during the relevant period of time.

So I don't know how you can claim that the
manifests show that I was with Virginia Roberts
during the relevant period of time. They do not do
that. And if you would testify under oath to that,
I think you could be subject to pretty -- pretty
scathing cross examination. So your statement is
categorically false, sir.

manifests and they confirmed your position?

MR. SCOTT: Objection, work product.

MR. SCAROLA: Well, you know, Mr. Scott,
he can't have it both ways. He can't insert
into the record the gratuitous statements that
he inserts into the record regarding others
having corroborated his inaccurate testimony,
and then refuse to tell us who those others
are. It constitutes a waiver of whatever
privilege might exist.

MR. SCOTT: He can -- he can tell who they

By Rebecca Rosenberg and Danika Fears January 7, 2015 | 2:38am

Jeffrey Epstein
Gregory P. Mango

Jeffrey Epstein may be a convicted pedophile and accused sex- slave master — but that didn’t stop him from getting some tender loving
treatment from the Manhattan DA's Office.

Prosectors went to bat for the billionaire pervert at a 2011 legal hearing, asking a judge to cut the filthy- rich felon a break on the severity of
his sex- offender status, according to court documents.

ADA Jennifer Gaffney supported a request by Epstein — who allegedly peddled $15,000-a-night teen “sex slaves” to rich men like Britain’s
Prince Andrew — that he only be listed as a Level 1 pervert during a hearing in Manhattan Supreme Court, according to legal transcripts.

The sicko investment magnate has just finished serving 13 months of an 18-month sentence in Florida for soliciting a minor girl for
prostitution. The hearing was to determine what kind of offender status he would have in New York, where he keeps a vacation home.

The city ADA argued that since “there was only an indictment for one victim,” Epstein shouldn’t have to register as Level 3 — which would
require he travel to New York every 90 days and check in with cops.

Subject: Fwd: Responding to yesterday's election 
Importance: High 
Look what has happened to your borough.. 
----------Forwarded message---------- 
From: Dr. Bruce L. Dennis < 
Date: Wed, Nov 9, 2016 at 10:14 AM 
Subject: Responding to yesterday's election 
To: 
> 
Dear Packer Families, 
Like many of you, I am writing this message on very little sleep. Last night was like no other in our 
political memory, defying the predictions of the most erudite pundits and political 
prognosticators. 
Today, we are spending a great deal of time unpacking the election results with our students 
across the three divisions — during morning meeting and throughout the day in Lower School 
classrooms, in Middle School advisories, during Upper School Community time, as well as in 
many individual classroom conversations. I write to assure you that we will do our best to handle 
these discussions with balance, sensitivity, and fairness. 
Given that last week's mock election among Packer's Upper School students showed that over 
8o% favored Secretary Clinton, I don't think it's a huge leap to assume that there was more 
disappointment than joy in Packer households as results unfolded last night. At the same time, 
there are certainly Packer families who support Mr. Trump and are pleased with this outcome. As 
a school community, we have an obligation to recognize that there will be a broad array of feelings 
generated by the election results, and it is our responsibility as a school to make space for these 
feelings to be expressed thoughtfully and compassionately, as well as to model the tolerance and 
acceptance of difference that are among our core values. No doubt, we have our work cut out for 
us, but I am confident in the good that we can do as a community. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033189 
There are abundant lessons to be learned from this election: that experts can be wrong; that our 
country is even more deeply divided than many of us had thought; and that abundant numbers of 
our fellow Americans feel a deep sense of despair and disaffection with the status quo of 
government. For us here at school, we will use this as an opportunity to talk with your children in 
age-appropriate ways about demographics, the economy, social policy, our democratic system, 
and the rule of law. We will also talk about the world's response to yesterday's election results, our 
individual responsibilities as citizens to continue to give voice to our beliefs, and appropriate 
channels of political activism. On a more basic level, we will stress the importance of not being a 
gloating winner or a sore loser, and about the strength of our nation, its history of responding to 
dramatic political change, and the hopefulness of the future. 
As for you, our families, I offer two resources. Last week at a NYSAIS heads-of-school conference 
that I attended, the University of Pennsylvania educator Ali Michael spoke about advancing our 
national dialogue about race. This morning Dr. Michael wrote a Huffington Post piece, What Do  
We Tell the Children?, a moving yet direct reminder of how we, as adults, can model our 
responses for the young people around us. Next Wednesday, November 16, from 6:3o to 8 
p.m., Semeka Smith-Williams and the PA Diversity Committee are holding a Post-
Election Healing evening here at Packer. 
Please reach out if you have questions, suggestions, or simply would like to share your thoughts, 
and take good care. 
Best regards.

shared Snowden’s anti-surveillance views. If Snowden then voiced
an interest in exposing the NSA’s secrets, this person could sup-
ply him with the necessary guidance, steering a still-unsuspecting
Snowden first to the Booz Allen position and afterward to his associ-
ates in Hong Kong. By taking sole credit for the coup in the video
that he made with Poitras and Greenwald in Hong Kong, he acted, as
he told Greenwald, to divert suspicion from anyone else. This move
could also give any collaborator he might have had in Hawaii time
to cover his or her tracks.

The astronomer Carl Sagan famously said in regard to searching
the universe for signals from other civilizations that the “absence
of evidence is not evidence of absence.” That injunction also applies
to the spooky universe of espionage. The fact that a mole hunt fails
to find a hidden collaborator at the NSA does not necessarily mean
such a mole does not exist. Historically, we have many notable cases
in which Russian moles eluded long, intensive investigations. Rob-
ert Hanssen penetrated the FBI for over twenty years for the KGB
without being caught. Similarly, Aldrich Ames acted as a KGB mole

© in the CIA for more than ten years and passed all the CIA’s sophisti- ©
cated lie detector tests. Both Hanssen and Ames eluded intensive FBI
and CIA investigations that lasted over a decade. According to Victor
Cherkashin, their KGB case officer, whom I interviewed in Moscow
in 2015, the KGB was able to hide their existence from investigators
for such a long period partly because of the widespread belief in U.S.
intelligence that moles were fictional creatures that sprang from the
“paranoid mind” of James Jesus Angleton. When I then cited the
signature line from the movie The Usual Suspects, “The greatest
trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn’t exist,”
Cherkashin thinly smiled and said, “CIA denial [of moles] certainly
helped.”

In view of such past successes of the Russian intelligence services,
it cannot be precluded that there was another person in the NSA
working with the enthusiastic Snowden as cover to prevent any light
from falling on his own surreptitious spying. While it may seem
extremely unlikely that Snowden had such assistance, the alterna-
tive scenario, that Snowden broke into the sealed compartments and

in order to take advantage of the new era.

Prior to the U.S. presidential election, and even dating back to the summer months when bond
yields bottomed, the economy was already beginning to improve. Corporate earnings were picking
up, the consumer was spending at a healthy clip, there were some subtle signs of positive surprises
in European economic activity, and the downturn in emerging markets (and negative earnings
revisions) ceased. We were certainly not waving the celebratory flag on growth, but the economy
was getting up off the ground, which is what risk assets, including equities, need sometimes.
However, the S&P 500—a major benchmark for U.S. stocks--had lost momentum heading into the
election, as investors worried that the secular stagnation era would continue and that monetary
policy had lost its effectiveness.

Market sentiment changed dramatically during the early morning hours on November 9. The
surprise victory by Donald Trump caught many investors off-guard. The potential for fiscal
stimulus measures, reduced regulation, corporate tax reform and other potential pro-growth
initiatives increased. Animal spirits perked up. Investor positioning was heavily skewed toward
long-duration fixed income, low-volatility equities and high-dividend-paying companies. These
areas significantly outperformed in the first half of the year but started to lose momentum once
rates bottomed mid-year. However, investor positioning did not change materially at first.
Portfolios were still generally overexposed to higher- quality, rate-sensitive investments—
otherwise known as “bond proxies.”

In our Hills Have Eyes strategy report, published on November 16, we outlined the need to
rebalance portfolios given our belief that we were already transitioning toward the late-cycle
expansion phase and that the new enthusiasm for pro-growth policies would begin to accelerate
investor flows toward more cyclical investments. Given the high degree of underexposure to late-
cycle investments by investors, we believed such a rotation would cause a “melt-up” in equities
toward new highs over time.

Diversification and rebalancing will be key

So, how are we going to manage portfolios in a world undergoing a major market regime shift, one
that is transitioning from the era of secular stagnation to fiscal reflation, and one that still has a
considerable amount of uncertainty? We are going to become more prescriptive, remain diversified
and balanced, but with more exposure to pro-growth, pro-cyclical areas. We will also likely
rebalance more often throughout the year as investor rotation gathers momentum during 2017 and
into 2018; and we look to periods of volatility as opportunities to add to areas we favor.

Fixed income still represents an important portfolio diversifier—and a volatility
dampener in unforeseen worst-case scenarios.

CHRISTOPHER HY ZY
CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, BANK OF AMERICA GLOBAL WEALTH AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

We expect business, consumer and investor confidence to continue to head higher well into 2017,

That was no mere academic problem in a conflict where, for decades, our
enemies had defined Israel’s mere existence as illegitimate. The reason for
Rabin’s reluctance to have his “deposit” presented as a set negotiating position
was that it meant dealing away our only card — territory — before the hard
questions about peace had been answered. When he phoned Christopher, I don’t
think I’ve ever heard him as angry. That was not what we agreed, he insisted.
He said it had spoiled any prospect of serious negotiations on the peace side of
the balance. Christopher didn’t agree there had been any real damage, nor that
Assad had failed to understand the context.

It might not have changed things anyway, since by this stage, the Oslo talks
had almost completed a draft agreement. In mid-August, Rabin gave Peres the
go-ahead to initial this “Declaration of Principles.” It provided for a period of
interim Palestinian self-government; the start of a phased Israeli withdrawal
from Gaza and the West Bank with the creation of a Palestinian police force to
deal with internal security; and a commitment to reach a full peace agreement
within five years. In early September, ahead of the formal signing of the Oslo
declaration, there was an exchange of “letters of recognition” between Arafat
and Rabin. Arafat’s letter also renounced “terrorism and other acts of violence”
and declared invalid “those articles of the Palestinian Covenant which deny
Israel’s right to exist.” A few days later, the signing ceremony was hosted by
President Clinton in Washington. Thus emerged the famous photo of Rabin and
Arafat shaking hands, on either side of Clinton, who was beaming, arms
outstretched in conciliation. They say a picture is worth a thousand words. In
this case, you needed barely a dozen. Rabin’s demeanor, his posture, the look
on his face, all seemed to say: “I would rather be shaking the hand of anyone on
earth than Arafat.” Still, the image was on front pages worldwide. The news
stories spoke of a new spirit of hope. Now that these old enemies had grasped
hands, surely a full peace agreement was within reach.

My feeling, as I watched it on TV in the kirya, was more guarded. I did hope
for peace, of course. I also recognized that the signing on the White House lawn
was just a beginning, and that my role would be to ensure that Israel’s security
needs were met under whatever formal peace agreement might eventually be
reached. And the security omens were hardly encouraging. Despite Oslo,
Palestinian attacks were continuing. Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and other dissident
factions saw Arafat’s concessions as treachery, and were setting out to drive
home that point with violence.

me, I’d be off to my adventures.

On the day before we were to be heading back to Palm Beach, Jeffrey
had a new proposition for me. I could make double the money I was
making, if I would look for pretty girls and convince them to come back
to Jeffrey’s to be further persuaded with money to engage in bi-sexual
and sexual acts with Jeffrey and I. I asked him how does one actually
propose such a thing to a complete stranger? “Well” he said in a build up
to another kind of lesson. “If | were you I would use your charm to entice
them and my money to bring them, I would tell them you work for a
multi-billionaire who has a taste for young, beautiful girls and with his
contacts in the acting, modeling, or rich husband world, your boss could
help them, All they have to do is come meet me first.” If ] wasn’t so
naive at the time I would’ve seen that’s exactly what he was doing with
me, my prospects were massage credentials, but with too much pain from
my past, | could only have hope. Not that I was a shy girl, but picking up
girls for one reason alone, only to be endorsed for her body, didn’t sound
like something I could do. But not wanting to displease my master, | told
him that I would give it a go. You could tell he was instantly excited with
my agreement, he started to reveal the politics of what kind of girls he
was looking for. He wasn’t into multi-cultural girls, a very chauvinistic
perception; he said they had to be uniquely gorgeous to be accepted by
him, but definitely no African-American girls, he was racist against
anything different to his kind, a very narrow minded way of thinking for
such a supposed brilliant man. The list went on and on. No girls with
tattoo’s or piercing’s, or gothics, no drug users, or prostitutes. Basically
he wanted everyone’s daughter that looked like the girl next door, with
blue eyes and blonde curly ringlets. I just nodded and smiled, wanting
this to be over with and move on to another conversation, but so worked
up from our previous talk, instead he persisted to show me exactly what I
was good for to him. He took me up to the highest loft in his large
mansion and he lay down on his large bed, expecting me to know exactly
what he wanted done. As always, I complied. Part of me hating him for
having to degrade myself to be so subservient to his sexual whims, and
another part of me was telling myself to be grateful for the opportunities I
was being given.

The battles in my head were beginning to cause me too much anxiety,
when we got back to Palm Beach, | asked my Mom to make me a
doctor’s appointment for some headaches I had been getting lately, so she
wouldn’t question me. | walked out of the doctor’s with a prescription for
a mind-altering anxiety tablet called “Xanax”, not only did it help with
anxiety but it also acted as blanket over terrible memories. So when I had
to perform degrading acts, I would take a few pills and forget what

happened within the next hour and be able to become someone without a
battling conscious.

I spent my sweet 16 birthday on his island in the Caribbean next to
“St. James Isle” he liked to call it “Little St. Jeff's”, his ego was as
enormous as his appetite for fornicating. I was given a birthday cake and
anew collection of designer make-up from London. Ghislane made a
joke after I blew out my array of candles and said, ’I’d be soon getting
too old for Jeffrey’s taste, and soon they'd have to trade me in.” She was
only half joking in a sad reality though. A few days after my birthday, a
girl was flying out to the island to join us for a few days before flying
back to N.Y.C. I was introduced to a pretty girl a few years my senior,
named Sarah. She had long ash blonde hair and big brown eyes that
hinted she had a cheeky nature. She had known Jeffrey before I had, and
he was supposedly trying to help her get an acting job in L.A. She was
obviously accustomed to the lifestyle he provided her, making it ever so
apparent with her prompt attention she lavished on him. She would do
things like strip nude and bathe around the swimming pool, taunting him
for sex. She was good at what she did, even putting me at ease with her
cool persona and funny jokes. Jeffrey told me privately that she was one
of his best at procuring young girls into her entrapment and delivering
them to him when he was in town, and when it came to time in the private
chambers with Jeffrey, Her and I, it wasn’t hard to comprehend. She was
devoted to the moment, giving Jeffrey every imaginable lustful desire he
could fathom. On the last night there we all took a trip over to St. James
to go for a stroll, odd I thought, it was past 7pm and Jeffrey rarely strayed
out past then, unless it was some event or dinner party. While Ghislane
and him looked the average couple strolling arm in arm through the
streets, he said to Sarah and I, “Why don’t you two hit the night club here
and see if there is anyone interesting to bring back for the evening?” It
was more of an order than a request and then I knew why we came out
tonight and why Sarah was invited, tonight was all about training, and
Sarah was going to show me the ropes in picking up girls. Although there
was no one to accustom to Jeffrey’s distinct taste to bring back, watching
Sarah flirt from girl to girl like a floating butterfly, gave me enough
insight into what I was expected to do.

Within Months I had become his handy little helper. Not only would I
run to his beckon call, but I also aided Ghislane in bringing in more girls
to keep the appetite of our sexually starving chief from going hungry. |
once asked Ghislane, why she did what she did for him, instead of having
a common monogamous relationship and getting jealous like normal
partners would? She replied simply “It takes the pressure off me having
to do it”. That said it all, we were all under the shade of Jeffrey’s money
tree, and not even someone like her could escape from its lure.

his “research,” and distorted the historical record. *° I exposed Faurisson’s deceptions in my own
writings, while continuing to defend his right to rewrite history.

Chomsky wrote an essay that he allowed to be used as a foreword to Faurisson’s next book,
about his career as a Holocaust denier! In this book, Faurisson again calls the gas chambers a lie
and repeats his claims about the “hoax” of the Holocaust.

Faurisson concludes that this passage proves (I) that a “special action” was nothing more than the
sorting out by doctors of the sick from the healthy during a typhus epidemic; (2) that the
“atrocious scenes” were “executions of persons who had been condemned to death, executions
for which the doctor was obliged to be present”; (3) that “among the condemned were three
women who had come in a convoy since the women were shot and not gassed (emphasis added).

Faurisson, who said he had researched the trial, knew that his own source, Dr. Kremer, had
testified that the gas chambers did exist. Yet he deliberately omitted that crucial item from his
book, while including the fact that the women were shot. Faurisson also knew that the three
women were “in good health.” Yet he led his readers to believe that Dr. Kremer had said they
were selected on medical grounds during an epidemic. Finally, Faurisson states that those who
were shot had been “condemned to death.” Yet he knew they were shot by the SS for refusing to
enter the gas chambers.

A French scholar named George Wellers analyzed this diary entry and the surrounding
documentation for Le Monde. He did actual historical research, checking the Auschwitz record
for October 18, 1942. His research disclosed that 1,710 Dutch Jews arrived that day. Of these,
1,594 were sent immediately to the gas chambers. The remaining 116 people, all women, were
brought into the camp; the three women who were the subject of the Kremer diary must have
been among them. The three women were, in fact, shot—as Faurisson concludes. But that fact
appears nowhere in Kremer’s diary. How then did Faurisson learn it? Professor Wellers was able
to find the answer with some simple research. He checked Dr. Kremer’s testimony at a Polish
war crimes trial. This is what Kremer said at the trial: “Three Dutch women did not want to go
into the gas chamber and begged to have their lives spared. They were young women, in good
health, but in spite of that their prayer was not granted and the SS who were participating in the
action shot them on the spot.” (emphasis added).

That is not “extensive historical research.” It is not research at all. It is the fraudulent
manufacturing of false antihistory. It is the kind of deception for which professors are rightly
fired: not because their views are controversial, but because they are violating the most basic
canons of historical scholarship. It is typical of Faurisson in particular, and of Holocaust denial
“research” in general. Yet Chomsky was prepared to lend his academic legitimacy to Faurisson’s
“extensive historical research.”

however, designated Hezbollah a terrorist
entity in 2004 without distinguishing
between the group's political and military
wings. A 2004 Dutch intelligence report
highlighted investigations that show
Hezbollah's political and terrorist wings
are controlled by one co-ordinating
council.

The European Union has taken action
against Hezbollah's interests in the past. In
May 2002, the European Union froze the
assets of a non-European terrorist group for
the first time by adding seven Hezbollah-
affiliated individuals, including
Mughniyeh, to its financial sanctions list
for terrorism. It did not, however, sanction
Hezbollah as an organization. On March
10, 2005, the European Parliament passed a
nonbinding resolution recognizing that
clear evidence exists of terrorist activities
on the part of Hezbollah and calling on the
European Council to take all necessary
steps to curtail them.

But the necessary steps did not occur.
Instead, most European countries preferred
to make convenient distinctions between
the different parts of Hezbollah, even when
the group's own leadership does not.

Today, as European leaders consider
whether to label Hezbollah a terrorist
group, they should judge the group by the
totality of its actions. Hezbollah cannot be

interest or an initial intention to do so. Iranian civilian casualties, for
example, could provoke Iran to step up its response. This becomes
more likely as the scale of a U.S. attack increases. Downed U.S.
aircrews could lead to search and rescue operations that could
become significant military actions in their own right. The need to
restrike targets that were missed or inadequately damaged could also
prolong the conflict and involve additional forces. As the conflict
developed, internal and external political pressures could press both
antagonists to escalate the fighting.

On the other hand, there may also be countervailing pressures. A very
successful operation could cause Iran to seek a rapid exit, at least
from the military aspect of the war. So, too, could increased domestic
unrest within Iran. International political pressure brought about by
economic disruption of the oil market and fears of military escalation
could work to restrain the United States. But we cannot rule out the
possibility of escalation, and that knowledge should reinforce the
need for clarity of purpose and a full understanding of the risks
involved before we pull the trigger.

How It Ends

Just as we cannot rule out escalation, we cannot rule out the harmful
protraction of a war. Every war has to end, but how it does so is no
simple matter. Even if it were soundly defeated, Iran could
complicate the endgame. It’s not simply a matter of our declaring
“mission accomplished” and bringing the troops home. As retired
Brigadier General Huba Wass de Czege writes:

Although Sun Tzu warned statesmen and generals many centuries
ago that long wars benefit no one, they continue to occur, and for
some very fundamental human reasons. Statesmen and generals who
start wars commit themselves to worthy war aims that are expressed
far too specifically—and too soon—in order to get the polity on
board. Then they conceive of a strategy based on what they think they

Most remarkably, Dershowitz took the public airwaves to represent that he wanted all of
the information surrounding the allegations to “be made public,” while implying that Edwards
and Cassell had something to hide. For example, on the BBChe claimed that he

wanted“everything to be made public”:

Q: Would you encourage that it now be made public?

A: Of course, of course. / want everything to be made public. I want
every bit of evidence in this case to be made public. I want every
allegation to be made public. | want to know who else she’s accused of
these horrible crimes. We know that she accused Bill Clinton of being on
Jeffrey Epstein’s island and participating in sex orgy with underage
girls. The records of the Secret Service will prove that President Clinton
never set foot on that island. So that she lied. Now it’s possible to have a
case of mistaken identification with somebody like me. It’s impossible to
have a case of mistaken identification with Bill Clinton.
My only feeling is that if she has lied about me, which I know to an
absolute certainty she has, she should not be believed about anyone
else. She’s lied clearly about me, she’s lied clearly about Bill
Clinton. We know that. We know that she’s lied about other public
figures, including a former prime minister and others who she claims to
have participated in sexual activities with. So I think it must be presumed
that all of her allegations against Prince Andrew are false as well.

I think he [Prince Andrew] should clear the air as well.
If you’re squeaky clean and if you have never done anything like this, you
must fight back with all the resources available to you. And that’s what I
will do. I will not rest or stop until the world understands no only that I
had nothing to do with any of this, but that she deliberately, with the
connivance of her lawyer, lawyers, made up this story willfully and
knowingly.

In the medium term, numerous opportunities for KUE should be generated by the increasing demand for
quality for-profit educational offerings by governments and citizens around the world

— Competitive pressures for development of human capital, deficiencies of national education
systems, growth of a middle-class in China, India and the Middle East, demand for English
language offerings and changing demographics are some of the primary drivers of increased
demand internationally.

— In China alone, 274 million children are under the age of 15, and 100 million are single-children
under the age of 25, as a result of the one-child policy. These demographics result in large
demand for education and increased spending capacity per child.

@ Favorable demographic trends and customer behavior in the U.S.

Growing number of working mothers

— According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimates, women are expected to represent
nearly 48% of the total U.S. workforce by 2012, up from 46.6% in 2002.9

— Inthe ULS., approximately 60% of mothers with children under the age of six are employed.

Increasing birth rate

-— There are approximately 24 million children under the age of five in the U.S. today. According to
the U.S. Census Bureau, absolute birth rates are going to continue to increase, and the population
of children in the U.S. five and under is expected to increase to approximately 27 million by 2015.°

Essential nature of the service to fhe consumer

— As with healthcare, parents are primarily focused on the quality of the service that their child
receives and the proximity of the center to their home or work; price is typically a secondary
consideration. By relieving parents of the requirement fo stay at home with their children, ECE
allows both men and women to participate in the workforce and generate income for the

sound ideal and hot for the taste of a young girl and knew | would be
point blank lying, so I told her some of the truth which was that he was
really rich and paid good money for a massage and useful to have around
as a contact. I told her he’d give her two hundred dollars for a two-hour
massage with me leading the way and warning her he was known to be
frisky during the session. Unexpectedly she said she could use the money
and then came the part that I hated the most, but had to do so they
wouldn’t be as shocked as I was the first time I had met him. “He does
like us to be nude though and sometimes asks for more than just the
massage itself”. All I could do was wait for a response after a shocking
sentence like that, and depending on the girl, most were sadly taken back
by the money. Her carefree attitude seemed to disillusion for a moment
when she gave it some thought and asked me “He’s not like, fat and ugly,
is he”? ““ No...no...not at all” I replied, “He’s got more of a Richard
Gere appeal to him”. Trying to make him sound a little more measurable
than just a rich old man that likes to be with girls younger than half his
age. “Well then, what time shall we meet tonight’? She asked next.
Great, I thought, Jeffrey would be most pleased with my find. “Knock on
my room quietly, you’re going to be a surprise. Be there at around half
past seven tonight and I will introduce you to Jeffrey”. She threw the butt
of the second jay we shared in the bushes and we strolled into a
homemade fudge boutique to get some relief for the munchies we now
had.

When I got back to the hotel at around a quarter to six o’clock pm as
requested I’d be, nobody was back yet, so I took the time to set up the
oils and bath in my room for his massage tonight. I thought I would plan
it so the girl would be cleaning off, as Jeffrey liked before he had sexual
contact with a new girl and he could walk in and be surprised to find a
strange beautiful girl in my room who wanted to massage him. Jeffrey
walked through the door not long after 1 was done prepping for the night
ahead, looking like he had a rough day at the office, which was very rare
for him. He sat down on the bed and I asked him how his day was. He
didn’t want to talk much about it, saying it was boring and long, rather
asking what I got up to for the day. Being coy about having a jay and his
unexpected surprise to come, I told him it was a great day of shopping
and sight seeing and I even brought him back some local made fudge
from the shop that had fulfilled my chocolate cravings only hours ago.

around with breadbaskets filled with creamy clam chowder and it smelled

collared shirt and put on his normal attire of sweatpants and a sweatshirt.
Ushering him out the door for dinner when he was more relaxed I was
lucky when he said he was starving and quickly got dressed. We just
found a quite spot to eat that was next to the wharf and got back to the
hotel just in time for our surprise guest. He wanted to go have a shower
and settle down for a massage, so I told him Id join him in a minute, I
just had to make a phone call real quick which he thought was odd and
asked me if everything was alright, I reinstated that I’d just be a minute,
trying not to let on about anything. The knock came quietly on my
room’s door just on time, as we had planned and | told her my idea to
surprise him. I let her into the bathroom where she orchestrated my plan
perfectly. Jeffrey finished his shower without me and when he called out
for me I told him that I needed him to have a look at something in my
room real quick. Not giving in to what it was that he would be looking at,
he came into the room where [ opened my bathroom door to reveal a
beautiful nude girl bathing in a thick amount of soap bubbles in my tub
looking at him with an alluring intrigue. His grin went from ear to ear
when she stood up and introduced herself letting the bubbles run down
her glistening body at an ever-slow pace. It was a proud moment for
Jeffrey, I had done well in his eyes, and she was not like the other girls [
had brought to him before, degraded from a lifetime of abuse off the
streets. This girl was exactly his pro quo looking sweet and innocent as
the girl next door. My efforts were to show him I knew that my only
responsibility was to keep him happy at all costs. I led her through the
massage on Jeffrey and of course afterwards gratifying his perversion
with his lustful requests to be fondled and watch us become more than
just friends. I didn’t feel too bad at the time with his coercion providing
many financial rewards making his scheme enticing to a young,
impressionable teen not realizing the terrible memories left to come from
all of this. Afterwards he paid her the usual two hundred dollars he gave
to everyone for their time and took down her name and phone number
writing it in his infamous little black book of the contacts he met in every
city but only the ones he really liked made it down in his records.

We went out the next afternoon as I had suggested last night and we ate
our clam chowder breadbaskets over looking the wharf’s bay, watching
the seals playfully barking at each other on the rocks nearby. Shortly after
we were driven to the private airstrip and took off for Los Angeles. On
the plane was an unexpected visitor. Matt Groening the producer of the
“The Simpson’s” T.V show was catching a ride with us. I was so excited,
as I loved watching his show and acted like a star struck fan, asking him
everything from his initial idea for creating the show to where he got his
characters from. He told me it was all based on his own family make up,

and that the initial withdrawals and redeployments went ahead smoothly. And
they did. But I also was soon playing a part in a renewed effort by Rabin to use
the momentum of Oslo to achieve peace agreements with our other Arab
neighbors: the Syrians, although he knew that would be tough, and first the
Jordanians. I would always have had some role, by virtue of the need for a chief
of staff to weigh in on security issues. But as Yitzhak had done from the start,
he involved me and others in his inner political circle in wider discussions on
the whole range of negotiating issues. Especially after Oslo, he seemed
determined to keep Peres’s role to an absolute minimum.

No peace talks are ever completely straightforward, but the process with
Jordan was very close to that. The main issues on the Jordanian side involved
ensuring a proper share of scarce water supplies; and dealing with Israel’s de
facto control of a fairly large area near the southern end of our border. A
number of kibbutzim and moshavim were farming the land there. But under the
post-1948 armistice, it had been allocated to Jordan. Israel’s priorities were to
put in place a fully open relationship of peace and cooperation, and to get
assurances Jordan would not allow its territory to be used by Palestinian groups
to launch terror attacks.

I was struck by how much more easily compromises can be found if you
truly trust the party on the other side. From my earlier meeting with Hussein in
England, before the Gulf War, I’d been impressed by the king’s thoughtful and
measured, yet warm and open, demeanor. That, in itself, inspired trust. But ever
since 1967, even in times of high tension, Israel and Jordan had kept open secret
lines of communication, and both sides had generally demonstrated a shared
desire, and ability, to steer clear of conflict. The main trade-off in the search for
a formal peace turned out to be not too difficult. We agreed to ensure water
provision, and to accept Jordanian sovereignty over the 1949 armistice area, in
return for which the king allowed the Israelis who had been working the land to
stay in place as lessees. On the final Wednesday of October 1994, near our
border crossing in the Arava desert, I watched as Rabin, King Hussein, and
President Clinton formally seal the full “Treaty of Peace Between the State of
Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.”

Not everyone—even university professors—seem to understand this important distinction. I
encountered this intellectual muddle-headedness in 2010 when I received an honorary doctorate
from Tel Aviv University and was asked to deliver a talk on behalf of the honorees. In my talk, I
defended the right of professors at the University of Tel Aviv to call for boycotts against Israeli
universities. This is part of what I said:

Israeli academics are free to challenge not only the legitimacy of the Jewish state but even,
as one professor at this university has done, the authenticity of the Jewish people. Israeli
academics are free to distort the truth, construct false analogies and teach their students
theories akin to the earth being flat—and they do so with relish and with the shield of
academic freedom. So long as these professors do not violate the rules of the academy,
they have the precious right to be wrong, because we have learned the lesson of history
that no one has a monopoly on truth and that the never-ending search for truth requires, to
quote the title of one of Israel's founders' autobiographies, trial and error. The answer to
falsehood is not censorship; it is truth. The answer to bad ideas is not firing the teacher,
but articulating better ideas which prevail in the marketplace. The academic freedom of
the faculty is central to the mission of the university.

After defending their right to freedom of expression, I exercised my own right to express my own
views about the merits and demerits of their ideas:

But academic freedom is not the province of the hard left alone. Academic freedom
includes the right to agree with the government, to defend the government and to work
for the government. Some of the same hard leftists who demand academic freedom for
themselves and their ideological colleagues were among the leaders of those seeking to
deny academic freedom to a distinguished law professor who had worked for the military
advocate general and whose views they disagreed with. To its credit, Tel Aviv University
rejected this attempt to limit academic freedom to those who criticized the government.

Rules of academic freedom for professors must be neutral, applicable equally to right and
left. Free speech for me but not for thee is the beginning of the road to tyranny.

Following my talk a group of Tel Aviv professors accused me of McCarthyism and of advocating
censorship. The Chronicle of Higher Education “reported” that I was pressuring the University to
take action against professors who support boycotts against Israeli Universities. I responded:

I continue to oppose any efforts by any university to punish academics for expressing anti-
government views. But I insist on my right to criticize those with whom I disagree. Surely
that is the true meaning of academic freedom. I urge your readers to read the full text of
my controversial talk at Tel Aviv University.*

person’s views on the merits of his speech arose in the context of efforts by Norman Finkelstein, a

European Union: Everywhere you look, a crisis
Timothy Garton Ash

June 16, 2011 -- Like an overladen container lorry laboring up a
steep hill, the European Union is close to stalling. Greece is the most
urgent part of this crisis. Between the fury on the streets of Athens
and the continued disunity of decision-makers in Brussels, Berlin,
Frankfurt and Luxembourg, the crunch could come any day. But it's
not just Greece. In Ireland, Portugal and Spain too, the anger is
boiling over, as people feel that the young, the poor and the
unemployed are being forced to pay for the selfish improvidence of
their politicians — and of the French and German bankers, who
loaned profusely where they should not have loaned at all.

Across the Continent, the legions of the indignados, as they are called
in Spain, and the aganaktismenoi (the outraged), as they say in
Greece, are growing. And it's not just the Eurozone. Every single
major project of the European Union is faltering. France and Italy are
suggesting that the achievement of the Schengen area, in which 25
European countries have removed border controls, should be chipped
away, just because a few thousand people from convulsed North
Africa have taken refuge on the Italian island of Lampedusa. Many
European countries are already in a panic about the integration of
immigrants and people of migrant origin, especially those who are
Muslims. Solidarity and social justice, central values of the post-1945
European project, are in retreat almost everywhere as a result of
growing inequality and spending cuts to tackle public debt.

In the Arab Spring, Europe faces the most hopeful set of events in the
21st century so far, comparable in scale and potential to 1989; but the
Continent's collective and institutional response to this historic

In his motion, Dershowitz never recounts the heavy burden that he must carry to seal the
records at issue. To be sure, Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420 allows for the sealing
of “confidential” materials. But the Rule begins by recounting the overarching principle that
“t]he public shall have access to all records of the judicial branch of government, except as
provided below.” Fla. R. Jud. Admin. 2.420(a). This rule is a codification of the Florida
Supreme Court’s admonition that a “astrong presumption of openness exists for all court
proceedings. A trial is a public event, and the filed records of court proceedings are public
records available for public examination.” Barron vy. Florida Freedom Newspapers, Inc., 531
So.2d 113, 118 (Fla. 1988) (emphasis added). In light of this presumption of openness, “[t]he
burden of proof in [closure] proceedings shall always be on the party seeking closure.” Jd. To
obtain a sealing order, the party seeking sealing must carry a “heavy burden.” Id.

Remarkably, Dershowitz fails to acknowledge these well-settled principles. More
important, he even fails to cite (much less discuss) the limited substantive exceptions to this

general principle of access— and which specific exception he believes applies to this

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018549.txt,"they've met other dudes who talk nonstop about how women are vain and stupid and
hysterical and, snicker snicker, why do we let those dumb bitches even vote and, oh by
the way, did you know that lots of girls like to be choked and isn't that sooo significant... ?
And so these decent guys who are talking to me -- they have learned to associate
discussions of female sexual submission with anti-feminism, and with attempts to
disempower women in other spheres.

Being decent guys, this worries them, because they know that people of all genders
deserve equal opportunity. But it is all a red herring! It's a series of illusions thrown up by
BDSM stigma; by the idea that sexual kinks always mean something about the rest of a
person's life; by people who don't comprehend that everyone has the right to consent; and
by blatant, uncomplicated misogyny! Female sexual submission isn't even close to a
threat to women's liberation, unless we allow it to be. If we weren't constantly forced to
deal with the broken assumptions of a broken misogynist culture, this question would
never occur to anyone!

It doesn't matter nearly as much what the cultural patterns are around sexual submission,
as it does how we deal with sexual submission. If your partner is submissive, you can
respect their desires and also respect them as a person. As I already noted, in BDSM this
means communicating carefully, like with safewords and/or other tactics. Some people
can have great sexual communication that's totally non-verbal -- but I always encourage
explicit verbal communication because for many people, it's easier to make intentions and
desires clear that way, and tactics like safewords provide a fallback in case there's a
mistake.

So: what does inherent female submission mean for women, for feminism, for equal
rights, for women who work, for powerful women? For housewives? For disabled
women? For female rape survivors? For rape survivors of other genders?

Say it with me now: It's the wrong question. The mere act of asking this question implies
a cultural context that is seeking excuses to disempower women. Female sexual
submission means nothing...

... except what every woman wants it to mean, for herself.

The Keys to the Kingdom
Are Missing

There’s a zero percent chance the Russians or Chinese have
received any documents.

—EDWARD SNOWDEN, Moscow, 2013

A CRITICAL MISSING PIECE in the Snowden enigma is the where-
abouts of the NSA documents. Greenwald told the Associated
Press that the documents that Snowden had taken from the NSA
constituted “the instruction manual for how the NSA is built” and
that they “would allow somebody who read them to know exactly
how the NSA does what it does, which would in turn allow them to
evade that surveillance or replicate it.” Snowden, for his part, said on
camera in his Hong Kong interview in June 2013 that NSA investi-
gators would have “a heart attack” when they discovered the extent
of the breach.

Ledgett, the NSA official who had conducted the damage assess-
ment, while not having a heart attack, confirmed that Snowden had
taken a massive number of documents and among them was what
he deemed the NSA’s “keys to the kingdom.” These keys could pre-
sumably open up the mechanism through which the United States
learns about the secret activities of other nations and, by doing so,
bring down the American signals intelligence system that had for

but she doesn’t know if the other girls would even respond. Wen-

dy’s always seemed so much cooler than kids Mary's age. This
other girl’s just a mystery. And when Wendy does turn around to
speak to Mary, her stare seems to slice right through the younger
girl.

“Remember,” Wendy says, according to a probable cause affi-
davit filed by the Palm Beach police. “When he asks how old you
are, say eighteen.”

The light changes, and Wendy turns back around but keeps
looking at Mary in the rearview mirror.

“Got it?” |

Mary nods.

“| mean it,” says Wendy.

Who would believe her? Anyone can see that Mary is younger
than that.

“Okay,” she says. “I got it. Eighteen.”

Mary takes out her flip phone and sends Joe a text: “Your
cousin is a BAMF.”

A badass motherfucker.

There’s no reply.

“Or maybe she’s just a bitch,” Mary texts.

Still no reply.

Joe must still be in church, Mary thinks.

They pass El Bravo Way and turn onto El Brillo Way.

Wendy’s driving slowly now, right at the speed limit. Once
more, she says: “When the man asks your age, say eighteen.”

Mary nods again and smiles, slightly. She wants Wendy to
see her smiling. To know that she’s got it all under control. But
Wendy's eyes are on the front gate now. It opens, she parks, and
they walk past a guard.

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010815
"
IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016893.txt,"How does one test for thinking? By the Turing Test? Unfortunately, that requires
a thinking judge. One might imagine a vast collaborative project on the Internet, where
an AI hones its thinking abilities in conversations with human judges and becomes an
AGI. But that assumes, among other things, that the longer the judge is unsure whether
the program is a person, the closer it is to being a person. There is no reason to expect
that.

And how does one test for disobedience? Imagine Disobedience as a compulsory
school subject, with daily disobedience lessons and a disobedience test at the end of term.
(Presumably with extra credit for not turning up for any of that.) This is paradoxical.

So, despite its usefulness in other applications, the programming technique of
defining a testable objective and training the program to meet it will have to be dropped.
Indeed, I expect that any testing in the process of creating an AGI risks being
counterproductive, even immoral, just as in the education of humans. I share Turing’s
supposition that we’ll know an AGI when we see one, but this partial ability to recognize
success won’t help in creating the successful program.

In the broadest sense, a person’s quest for understanding is indeed a search
problem, in an abstract space of ideas far too large to be searched exhaustively. But there
is no predetermined objective of this search. There is, as Popper put it, no criterion of
truth, nor of probable truth, especially in regard to explanatory knowledge. Objectives
are ideas like any others—created as part of the search and continually modified and
improved. So inventing ways of disabling the program’s access to most of the space of
ideas won’t help—whether that disability is inflicted with the thumbscrew and stake or a
mental straitjacket. To an AGI, the whole space of ideas must be open. It should not be
knowable in advance what ideas the program can never contemplate. And the ideas that
the program does contemplate must be chosen by the program itself, using methods,
criteria, and objectives that are also the program’s own. Its choices, like an AI’s, will be
hard to predict without running it (we lose no generality by assuming that the program is
deterministic; an AGI using a random generator would remain an AGI if the generator
were replaced by a pseudo-random one), but it will have the additional property that there
is no way of proving, from its initial state, what it won ’t eventually think, short of
running it.

The evolution of our ancestors is the only known case of thought starting up
anywhere in the universe. As I have described, something went horribly wrong, and
there was no immediate explosion of innovation: Creativity was diverted into something
else. Yet not into transforming the planet into paper clips (pace Nick Bostrom). Rather,
as we should also expect if an AGI project gets that far and fails, perverted creativity was
unable to solve unexpected problems. This caused stasis and worse, thus tragically
delaying the transformation of anything into anything. But the Enlightenment has
happened since then. We know better now.

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030582.txt,"So he is not without humor, even though he doesn’t drink or smoke, and hates restaurants.

“Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects,” newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He was certainly
preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few moments in his company and
you know this to be true.

When I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that “Andy’”—as Jeffrey
calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his strange title is. Because if one thing’s
for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what he’s talking about far more than “Andy” does. Which is
why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other financiers hang out with him.

And Ghislaine?
Full disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It’s almost impossible not to.

She is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I’ve spent hours talking to her about
the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is curious. She has spent weeks at the bottom
of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent me a DVD of the fish there. Her rolodex would blow away
almost anyone else’s I can think of—probably even Rupert Murdochs’. She is very well-read and can talk about most things for
hours. She is passionate about Bill Clinton with whom she is close friends.

Yet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-Platero, (known
fondly to her close friends as “the Tennis Goddess”) Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When it comes down to things she
really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her vulnerability.

And that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey.

“He saved her,” Iremember a close friend of mine telling me. “When her father died, she was a wreck; inconsolable. And then
Jeffrey took her in. She’s never forgotten that—and never will.”

In many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect replacement for her
father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his sexual pecadillos, but then Ghislaine’s
father was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving a massive “black hole” he’d fraudulently created. To
Ghislaine, Jeffrey’s habits may not have seemed that strange.

In fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful people in the end
either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl issues, and moved countries to avoid
paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You don’t tend to get to the top by being the world’s most
balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett didn’t quite manage a normal life—whatever that is. He had a second
“wife” for many years whose existence he has been open about.

So what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven’t spoken to her orto Jeffrey, but I suspect that her loyalty to friends
like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she’|l be out and about as always. Look at Waksal and Stewart. No one
sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up for all sorts of blemishes.

e Attempts to control the agendas, participant name lists, what is written, and
what is said at joint scholarly conferences held in China, and now sometimes
even in the United States. (A recent technique is to require that a talk or paper
by an American participant in a Chinese organized event be handed over to the
organizing group for vetting well before the event itself, so a participant can be
disinvited, if necessary.)

e Restriction of internet and email communications when in China.

e¢ Monitoring, even following, some American scholars by security services while
in China.

e Demands for censorship by foreign publishers of their digital content as a
condition for allowing it to be made available online in China.

e Insistence on censorship of Chinese-language editions of foreign books by the
State Press & Publishing Administration. This places foreign authors in the
difficult position of having to acquiesce to such censorship in order to have
translations of their books published in China.

e Censorship of online archives of PRC journals and publications, such as
the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database. American
universities each pay tens of thousands of dollars annually for access to these
electronic databases. However, recent research has shown that CNKI in particular
is now “curating” its catalogs and holdings by deleting articles the current
government appears not to wish to see remaining in the historical record.” Since
American universities have started to dispose of paper copies of many of the
journals carried in CNKI (China National Knowledge Information) periodical
index, this amounts to PRC distorting the historical record, not just for China
but for the entire world.

In addition to these specific restrictions affecting American scholars, the PRC
government also influences the field of Chinese studies in the United States (and
elsewhere) via controls over key regions of their country (especially minority areas
such as Tibet and Xinjiang) and by putting no-go zones around a wide variety of
research subjects within the broader areas of politics, religion, ethnography, and civil
society that cannot be researched in-country. As a result, American professors cannot
themselves work in these areas, nor can they in good conscience advise their graduate
students to work on these subjects either because of risk to the researcher’s career, as
well as to the human subjects whom researchers would be observing or interviewing.
Such restrictions have real consequences for the open future of Chinese studies around
the world.

connects theoretical insights to puzzles in our current
understanding of the properties and interactions of
matter. She has developed and studied a wide variety of
models to address these questions, the most prominent
involving extra dimensions of space. Her work has
involved improving our under-standing of the Standard
Model of particle physics, supersymmetry, baryogenesis,
cosmological inflation, and dark matter. Randall’s research
also explores ways to experimentally test and verify ideas
and her current research focuses in large part on the Large
Hadron Collider and dark matter searches and models.
Randall has also had a public presence through her
writing, lectures, and radio and TV appearances. Randall’s
books, Warped Passages: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Universe’s
Hidden Dimensions and Knocking on Heaven's Door: How
Physics and Scientific Thinking Hluminate the Universe and the
Modern World were both on The New York Times list of 100
Notable Books of the Year. Higgs Discovery: The Power of Empty
Space was released as a Kindle Single in the summer of 2012
as an update with recent particle physics developments.

PETER RAVEN

Peter H. Raven, a leading botanist and advocate of
conservation and biodiversity with a notably international
outlook, is president emeritus of the Missouri Botanical
Garden and George Engelmann Professor of Botany
Emeritus at Washington University in St. Louis. In addition,
Dr. Raven is a Trustee of the National Geographic Society
and Chairman of the Society’s Committee for Research and
Exploration. For more than 39 years, Dr. Raven headed the
Missouri Botanical Garden, an institution he nurtured to
become a world-class center for botanical research, education,
and horticulture display. During this period, the Garden
became a leader in botanical research and conservation
in Latin America, Africa, Asia, and North America.

Dr. Raven first realized in the mid 1960s that
the rapid growth of the human population, consumption,
and the spread of polluting technologies were threatening
biological diversity to a degree that had not been realized
earlier. He soon became an outspoken advocate of the need
for conservation throughout the world based on efforts to
attain sustainability and social justice everywhere. He was
described by Time magazine as a “Hero for the Planet,” and
has received numerous prizes and awards, including the
International Prize for Biology from the government of Japan;
Volvo Environment Prize; the Tyler Prize for Environmental
Achievement; the Sasakawa Environment Prize; and the
BBVA Prize for Ecology and Conservation, Madrid. In October
2009 he was awarded the first RBG Kew International
Medal, given on the occasion of the 25oth anniversary of
the Gardens; in January 2010, the Award for International
Scientific Cooperation of the Chinese Academy of Science
and the Friendship Award (for promoting international
cooperation) from the government of China. Earlier in 2012,
he received an award from the President of Mexico for his
work with Mexican scientists and institutions over the years.
Earlier in his career, Dr. Raven held Guggenheim and John
D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Fellowships.

In 2001, Dr. Raven received the National Medal of
Science, the highest award for scientific accomplishment in
the United States. He has been president of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science, Sigma Xi, the
American Institute of Biological Sciences, and a number of
other organizations. He served for 12 years as Home Secretary
of the National Academy of Sciences, to which he was elected
in 1977. He is also a member of the American Academy of
Arts and Sciences and of the American Philosophical Society,
of the academies of science in Argentina, Australia, Austria,
Brazil, Chile, China, Denmark, Georgia, Hungary, India, Italy,
Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Sweden, Ukraine, the U.K. (the
Royal Society), and of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences and
the Academy of Sciences for the Developing World (TWAS).

Dr. Raven is Co-editor of the Flora of China,
a joint Chinese-American international project that is
leading to a contemporary, 50-volume account on all the
plants of China scheduled for completion at the end of
2012. He was the first chair of the U.S. Civilian Research
and Development Foundation, a private, congressionally-
chartered organization that funds joint research with the
independent countries of the former Soviet Union.

Dr. Raven has written numerous books and
publications, both popular and scientific, including Biology
of Plants (co-authored with Ray Evert and Susan Eichhorn,
W. H. Freeman and Company/Worth Publishers, New York),
the internationally best-selling textbook in botany, of which
the eighth edition appeared in 2011; and Environment (co-
authored with Linda Berg, Wiley & Sons, New York), a leading
textbook on the environment, now in its eighth edition (2011).

Dr. Raven received his Ph.D. from the University
of California, Los Angeles, in 1960 after completing his
undergraduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley.
He has been awarded honorary degrees by a number of
universities in the United States and around the world.

denounce violence against Israel. But the symbolism of Mitchell
leaving several days before Obama's biggest week of outreach to the
region projected a vacuum of confidence that anything hopeful,
however remote, was on the horizon.

He wouldn't be leaving at this important hour if he knew there was
going to be a significant change in the administration's attitude
toward the peace process, said Middle East analyst Gregory Orfalea,
who formerly taught at Georgetown's School of Foreign Service.
He's leaving because it's status quo.

Mitchell will be replaced—in the interim by his deputy, David Hale—
and another official will take a crack at the quandary. But despite new
momentum from Netanyahu's visit next week and Obama's speech
Thursday, Mitchell's departure could signal stagnant talks for the next
several years. According to Fawaz Gerges, director of the London
School of Economics' Middle East Center, the reality is that, with
Mitchell leaving, Barack Obama basically lost the ideological battle
[over how to confront the peace process]. By now he'll have to wait
for the second term before you can get another concerted effort.

covers national energy and environmental policy.

White Castle. Twenty five years ago, I had a friend with a peculiar way of responding to seeing things he didn’t like on TV: he
would throw White Castle hamburgers at the screen. I always thought this was a bad way to waste a good hamburger, but I had
one of those moments the other night when watching news reports on debt ceiling discussions. Media outlets have referred to
President Reagan’s scolding of Congressional Republicans for delaying debt ceiling increases, and the 18 increases that took
place during his Presidency. The implication: reservations about raising the debt ceiling are as irresponsible now as they were
then. This is a disingenuous argument; in the 1980’s, the debt ceiling being debated was 50% of GDP, and had no
bearing on the solvency of the United States. Today, the proposed increase raises the debt limit twice as high, measured
relative to GDP or government revenues. While a default is a very bad idea (deserving of a White Castle hurling of its own),
unconstrained debt growth with no plan to slow it is bad as well. Some suggest we not worry about debt growth, since demand
from foreign central banks and the Federal Reserve would keep yields in check. That logic is irresponsible at best. Debt limit
legislation is a rocky but healthy way for a democracy to decide whether mega-deficits are in the long-term public interest.

Over the last few days, the Gang of Six plan, the Reid-McConnell plan and the Obama-Boehner plan have all been
raised up the flagpole and then lowered. By the end of the process, we’re still looking for deficit reduction of $3 trillion+
over 10 years (relative to the CBO Alternative case in which there is no deficit reduction at all). However, Congress is running
short on time, and may have to do a smaller debt ceiling increase/deficit reduction first. For now, we wait to see the balance of
spending cuts and revenue increases 1 will be agreed to. Last week’s Profiles in Courage piece walked through the history and
dynamics of this process, so we won’t repeat that here. Here’s our take on what has been proposed so far, with the caveat
that many plans are not crystal clear what baseline they are using 2 , or what steps they recommend to get to that baseline first.

1 On the AMT: the Tax Policy Center estimates that if the AMT is not indexed to inflation, it would impact 31 million filers in 2012 (and
raise $132 billion in revenue), compared to 4 million filers in 2011 (and $39 billion in revenue).
2 For example: the Gang of Six state that they used the President’s budget as a baseline (scored by CBO in March 2011), reduced deficits by
$3.7 trillion, and ended up with a 71% debt/GDP ratio; but they do not explain how they get to the President’s baseline in the first place.

I have a feeling that revenue increases will be a material (e.g., 25% or more) part of the deal. The Peterson Foundation’s
sampling of 6 policy groups shown below indicate that 5 of 6 recommend revenue increases compared to where we are today;
the Heritage Foundation’s “Woody Guthrie Memorial Budget Plan” is the only exception. What kind of revenue increases?
Raising the top two brackets, which would affect joint filers with adjusted gross incomes above $212,300, would raise $450-
$700 billion over 10 years (depending on whether you use OMB or CBO numbers). If they cannot agree to raise rates, another
option (as in the Gang of Six plan) would be reductions in the deductibility of state and local taxes, sales taxes, mortgage
interest, etc. As this gets sorted out, let’s hope everyone recognizes that the US tax system is already progressive. As shown in
the chart below, effective Federal tax rates for low earners have dropped to zero over the last decade, even after including FICA
taxes. News reports that the US tax system is regressive make me want to throw hamburgers at the screen.

Europe: Finally (!!), but now what?
For the first time since 2009, it felt last week like European policymakers were trying to get out in front of things. In exchange
for a modest amount of “private sector involvement”, Germany agreed to more generous financing terms for Greece, Ireland
and Portugal, and an expanded role for the EU-IMF lending facility (see following page). What would the plan accomplish if
implemented? While Greek debt to GDP ratios would remain well over 125% of GDP (the IMF estimate for next year is a
ridiculous 170%), Greece’s near-term financing obligations would decline, due to debt buybacks, exchanges into long maturity
bonds, and interest grace periods on new EU loans. More broadly, the plan also allows for money to be lent to countries before
they enter into an IMF program, for recapitalization of banks. All things considered, it’s the broadest defense of the
Monetary Union so far. On paper, it even looks like a free ride for holders of Greek paper that don’t participate in the debt
exchanges (they would be paid at par). So, what’s not to like? Well, there are still questions about Greece:
• There’s a big difference between generous financing terms and generous economic terms. Greece must still meet an
enormous 5%-6% primary budget surplus target (government revenues less spending, pre-interest) during a recession
• Greece must execute on its asset sale targets, despite having little success or experience doing this in the past
• Banks listed in the IIF document (the committee representing them) are under no binding legal obligation to participate in
the debt exchanges, and may turn out to own less Greek debt than currently believed. [Note: bank participation in the Latin
Brady bond era was high, since at the time, banks held almost all the paper, and in the form of illiquid loans].
The big question: would Germany still live up to the deal if Greece missed deficit targets or assets sales, if bank participation
was too low, or if hedge funds (once referred to by the Chairman of the German Social Democratic Party as a “swarm of
locusts”) reaped large free rider windfalls? Ultimately, this is a political question. If “yes”, Germany will underwrite Greece
no matter what; if “no”, then a broader, coercive Greek restructuring might follow in the not-so-distant future 3 .
3 This could get complicated. If there is a need for further debt forgiveness for Greece, will policymakers find a way to “ring-fence” the
banks that participated in the first round, and impose losses just on the hold-outs? Will the EU tell banks that if they don’t participate, their
older bonds will not be eligible for financing at the ECB?

What the EU gave: an easing of lending conditions, and an expanded role for the EU lending facility (EFSF)
* Another 109 bn for Greece, allowing the country to continue to pay off maturing debt (to those not participating in the exchanges)
* Rate on new EU loans to Greece, Portugal and Ireland cut to 3.5%, maturities on new & old loans extended from 7.5 to 15-30 years
* 10 year grace period on interest on new EU loans to Greece; the unpaid interest accumulates
* EU loan facility has the ability to buy sovereign debt in the secondary markets, including a plan to purchase 40 bn of Greek debt
(most likely including much of the Greek debt purchased by the ECB)
* EU loan facility has the ability to lend to countries (even those not in an IMF program) to recapitalize their banks
* Language (with no specifics) regarding the use of EU structural funds to boost growth in Greece
What the EU gets: more austerity, Maastricht with teeth (?) and private sector involvement in Greek debt rollover
* Legally binding national fiscal framework to be developed by end of 2012; fiscal deficits brought to 3% by 2013 at the latest
* Private sector involvement in Greek debt rollover, committed in principle by 30 financial institutions listed in the document released
by the Institute of International Finance; target participation rate of 90%; exchange appears to result in Selective Default credit rating
* Voluntary participation options include exchanging existing debt into 15 or 30 year bond with AAA-guarantees of principal. Bonds
exchanged at par will carry low coupons (4.25% effective), while bonds with higher coupons will be exchanged at a 20% discount

In addition to execution risk in Greece, we are left with
3 other concerns. First, while there’s enough in the EU-
IMF lending facility 4 to deal with problems in Greece,
Portugal and Ireland, if you include Spain, it gets tight
(note: the chart excludes costs to recapitalize banks). If
Italy or Belgium entered Europe’s Liquidity Hospital, a lot
more money might be needed from European parliaments
(in one worst-case scenario, Alliance Bernstein estimates
that the EU lending facility would have to increase from
440 bn to 1.7 trillion Euros, mostly from Germany). Italy
faces a multi-notch downgrade from Moody’s, which is
not going to help. As we discussed two weeks ago, Italy
has been a model citizen in terms of running low budget
deficits for 20 years, but still cannot escape the confines of
its very large existing debt stock (120% of GDP).

Second, as shown below, Europe is now a two-speed economy, with the periphery stuck in neutral (industrial production is one
proxy for this; there are others, such as unemployment, consumption, export shares, etc). If the idea behind the EU/IMF effort
is that austerity will boost growth and lead these countries back to the public markets, there is very little momentum in this
direction. If the status quo in the periphery does not change, all the EU package does is allow the current approach
more time to fail.

The third concern: Germany as paymaster. We are often told that Germans across both major parties are unflinching
supporters of the European project, and will do whatever it takes to prevent a break-up. The objections from members of the
Bundesbank are described as lonely voices of opposition that carry no weight 5 . But how large are the costs going to be?
German politicians and voters may see current circumstances as exceptional, and that if they just agree to one more package, the
problem will go away. However, we are starting to see analyses of how costly a permanent transfer union may be for
Germany. Bernard Connolly at Hamiltonian Advisors sent me a recent paper from the Centrum fur Europaische Politik 6 in
Freiburg, which provides some clues. They see three alternatives for the deficit countries:
• massive reduction in regulations and unit labor costs to regain competitiveness
• exit from the EMU, re-introduction of national currencies
• permanent transfer union from surplus countries to deficit ones
On the last option, they estimate a “creditworthiness gap” in European deficit countries of Eur 108 billion in 2010. The gap
measures how much European deficit countries rely on capital inflows to fund consumption, rather than investment (which
contributes to future GDP). Germany’s share of the European surplus is around ¾, so let’s assume a pro-rata burden on
Germany to maintain the transfer union. As a result, the theoretical economic cost could be 3.3% of German GDP every year,
which as shown, gets close to some expensive episodes in German history. If German citizens were faced with costs this high,
it could be a White Castle hamburger-throwing moment of national proportions.

Bottom line. At a time when European equities are trading close to 2009 lows relative to earnings and book value, this package
could result in a relief rally for European equities, particularly banks. The chance of a disorderly default in 2011 has decreased
markedly, and a process has been put in place to create more seamless transfers to areas (and banks) in need. But the size of the
transfer union fund is not big enough to allay all concerns, particularly with Spain and Italy growing at anemic levels, and there
is execution risk in Greece.
Recent bank stress tests conducted by the EU concluded that only Eur 2.5 billion of capital needs to be raised (70 to 80 billion
sounds more reasonable to us). And in the package announced last week, the following Orwellian clause indicates how
European policymakers feel about rating agencies these days:
Point 15. We agree that reliance on external credit ratings in the EU regulatory framework should be
reduced, taking into account the Commission's recent proposals in that direction, and we look forward to the
Commission proposals on credit ratings agencies
In Europe, denial appears to be an essential ingredient to the process (See “Five Stages of Greece”, June 30, 2011). Last
week’s package is a bold step towards Federalization and the worst-case outcomes have been avoided (money market
failures, bank runs, etc), but markets will remain nervous about Europe.
5 Bundesbank President Weidmann, in response to last week’s package: “By transferring significant risks to the support-giving countries and
their taxpayers, the Euro area has taken a large step to socialising risks created by unsound government finances and macroeconomic
problems. This weakens the foundations of the fiscal self-responsibility that EMU is built on”.

Topics: US debt ceiling negotiations, a more ambitious European bailout plan (finally), and how large cap growth stocks
and rising corporate profits are patiently waiting for both of them to end
While we’re waiting: large cap growth stocks
One day, the melodramas around US and European sovereign debt will end. While we’re waiting, one of the asset classes that
looks attractive is large cap growth stocks. As shown below (for a universe of 300 U.S. large cap growth stocks that meet
certain earnings quality and stability factors), free cash flow relative to both revenues and stock prices looks good compared
to the last four decades. This is where we believe investors should be adding exposure if they are underweight versus their
desired equity allocations. This is also an asset class where active management can still provide a lot of value; the dispersion of
large cap growth managers is higher than large cap core, large cap value and international equity manager dispersion.
Q2 earnings season in the US is off to a good start. Nearly
30% of the S&P has reported, and results have generally been
positive. Earnings are beating consensus estimates by almost
4% (7.4% ex-financials), all ten sectors are beating on revenue
targets, and only 7% of companies are reporting belowconsensus
earnings. Given earnings expectations for 2011 at
$98.50, the S&P 500 is trading at a reasonable 13.5x forward
multiple. However, y/y earnings growth expectations appear
to be flattening out for both 2011 and 2012 at around 11%-
12%. While Q2 earnings are doing well so far, some company
guidance for the remainder of the year has been below
consensus, which would be consistent with the recent batch of
reports indicating a slowdown in manufacturing and service
sector surveys.

yet that also has its own self-model and global workspace. Both the individuals and the meta-
mind should be capable of deliberative, rational thought, to have a true “mindplex.” It’s unlikely
that human society or the Internet meet this criterion yet; and a system like an ant colony seems
not to either, because even though it has some degree of intelligence on both the individual and
collective levels, that degree of intelligence is not very great. But it seems quite feasible that
the global brain, at a certain stage of its development, will take the unfamiliar but fascinating
form of a mindplex.

Currently the best way to explain what happens on the Net is to talk about the various
parts of the Net: particular websites, social networks, viruses, and so forth. But there will come
a point when this is no longer the case, when the Net has sufficient high-level dynamics of its
own that the way to explain any one part of the Net will be by reference to it relations with
the whole: and not just the dynamics of the whole, but the intentions and understanding of
the whole. This transition to Net-as-mindplex, we suspect, will come about largely through the
interactions of AI systems - intelligent programs acting on behalf of various individuals and
organizations, who will collaborate and collectively constitute something halfway between a
society of AI’s and an emergent mind whose lobes are various AI agents serving various goals.

The Phase 2 Internet, as it verges into mindplex-ness, will likely have a complex, sprawling
architecture, growing out of the architecture on the Net we experience today. The following
components at least can be expected:

e A vast variety of “client computers,” some old, some new, some powerful, some weak —
including many mobile and embedded devices not explicitly thought of as “computers.”
Some of these will contribute little to Internet intelligence, mainly being passive recipients.
Others will be “smart clients,” carrying out personalization operations intended to help
the machines serve particular clients better, general AI operations handed to them by
sophisticated AI server systems or other smart clients, and so forth.

e “Commercial servers,” computers that carry out various tasks to support various types
of heavyweight processing - transaction processing for e-commerce applications, inventory
management for warehousing of physical objects, and so forth. Some of these commercial
servers interact with client computers directly, others do so only via AI servers. In nearly
all cases, these commercial servers can benefit from intelligence supplied by AI servers.

e The crux of the intelligent Internet: clusters of AI servers distributed across the Net, each
cluster representing an individual computational mind (in many cases, a mindplex). These
will be able to communicate via one or more languages, and will collectively “drive” the
whole Net, by dispensing problems to client-machine-based processing frameworks, and
providing real-time AI feedback to commercial servers of various types. Some AI servers
will be general-purpose and will serve intelligence to commercial servers using an ASP
(application service provider) model; others will be more specialized, tied particularly to a
certain commercial server (e.g., a large information services business might have its own AI
cluster to empower its portal services).

This is one concrete vision of what a “global brain” might look like, in the relatively near term,
with AGI systems playing a critical role. Note that, in this vision, mindplexes may exist on two
levels:

e Within AGI-clusters serving as actors within the overall Net
e On the overall Net level

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029433 
Estate Planning After the Enactment of the Tax Cuts 
and Jobs Act 
On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs 
Act into law. The new legislation represents a compromise between 
House and Senate Republicans on their respective tax overhaul 
proposals, and is the most significant tax reform legislation to be 
enacted in over thirty years. Although the inherent complexities of the 
new legislation, combined with the whirlwind pace of its passage, poses 
many questions for analysts and tax practitioners alike as they begin to 
navigate the new tax system, we do have an understanding of what the 
new law will mean for high net worth individuals interested in advancing 
their estate planning goals. 
Most of the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) became 
effective on January 1st, and will sunset (or default to prior law) after 
December 31, 2025, absent further congressional action. In addition to 
extensive income tax related changes, including modifications to the 
individual and corporate income tax rates, doubling of the standard 
income tax deduction, capping of the state and local tax deduction, 
elimination of the personal income tax exemption, increase in the 
exemption for the alternative minimum tax, and decrease in the 
mortgage interest deduction, the Act temporarily doubles the federal 
estate, generation-skipping transfer (GST) and gift tax exemption 
amounts, thereby offering high net worth families enhanced planning 
opportunities.

Hi Sue,

Regarding your first question: pursuant to Civil Rights Law § 50-b, our office’s practice in appellate sex
crimes matters is to file documents under seal. This is not particular to People v. Epstein; it is routine
across our appellate filings. My understanding is that it is also the Appellate Division’s (the court's)
practice to maintain such seal.

That being said, | have discussed your second question with our attorneys. If the Post petitions the
court, and the court asks the People for our positon, we will not oppose the petition for a redacted brief.

Thanks.

Since 2010, American (and other foreign) researchers have encountered a
progressively more restrictive research environment in China. One American scholar
noted that a previous research project that involved on-the-ground interviews

across many provinces was no longer possible. The registration and information
requirements of the 2017 Law on the Management of Foreign NGOs is part of the
problem, she believes, by severely constraining opportunities to conduct joint
projects and research in China. It has also become exceedingly difficult to arrange
interviews with Chinese think-tank scholars and government officials; many
institutional libraries are now off-limits; central-level archives are inaccessible

with provincial and local ones also increasingly circumscribed; survey research is
impossible (unless in partnership with an approved Chinese counterpart, which is
increasingly hard to find); and other bureaucratic impediments make it increasingly
difficult for foreign think-tank researchers to undertake their basic jobs of
researching China. At the same time, Chinese researchers working in the US are able
to schedule appointments easily with their American counterparts and government
officials, enjoy open access to American libraries and government archives, are able
to conduct surveys anywhere, and may travel freely around the United States to do
field work.

US Think-Tank Centers in China

Only two American think tanks operate real satellite centers in Beijing, and one does
so in Hong Kong. Both Beijing centers are cohosted by, and located on, the campus

of Tsinghua University. One has a robust program of research by Chinese fellows,
brings in people from the think tank’s other centers, has a young ambassador program
for Americans and Chinese, and boasts a “wide open internet.” One center uses its
facilities primarily for presentations from the resident fellows and other visitors. Some
talks are open to the public, but most are restricted to faculty and graduate students.
The center’s ambitions were originally greater: for example, to host a set of annual
conferences with senior experts and officials on both sides. However, the Chinese side
could not live up to its side of the bargain, demanding that senior US officials attend
while not delivering Chinese officials of equivalent rank.

These two centers have also become caught up within the increasingly strained
US-China relationship as well as the tightening political atmosphere inside China.
According to one affiliated research fellow, “connections with the center are a liability
because institutions and people can cause you problems if you don’t say the right
things.” At least one of the centers in Greater China has occasionally limited its public
programming from addressing sensitive political issues, because it did not want to
jeopardize the institution’s presence in China and Asia. Yet that think tank’s other
staffers and fellows have also proved adept at circumventing political restrictions by,

TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024117.txt,"﻿7. What is the difference between money laundering and terrorist financing?
ln contrast to money laundering, which involves the disguising of funds derived from illegal activity so they may be
used without detection of the illegal activity, terrorist financing can involve the use of legally derived money to carry
out illegal activities. The objective of money laundering is financial gain or the hiding or disguising of illicit proceeds,
whereas with terrorism, the objective is to promote the agenda or cause of the terrorist organization. For example, it
is widely believed that the terrorist activities of September 11,2001, were partially financed by legally obtained funds
that had been donated to charities. Both money launderers and terrorists, however, do need to disguise the
association between themselves and their funding sources.
8. ls the approach to combat money laundering and terrorist financing the same?
Although some of the risk factors and red flags that apply to other types of money laundering also may apply to
terrorisl fìnancing, the patterns of activity tend to be very different. Terrorist fìnancing often involves very small
amounts of fundð, which may be moved through charities or nontraditional banking systems, whereas other types of
money laundering may involve large volumes of funds. lt is important to understand the different patterns to protect
against the risks.
Overv¡ew of U.S. AML Laws and Regulations
9. What are the key U.S. AML laws and regulations?
The key U.S. AML laws and regulations are the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (BSA) and the Uniting and Strengthening
Americã by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to lntercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (commonly
referred to as the USA PATRIOT Act).
The BSA was the first major money laundering legislation in the United States. lt was designed to deter the use of
secret foreign bank accounts and provide an audit trail for law enforcement by establishing regulatory reporting and
recordkeeping requirements to help identify the source, volume and movement of currency and monetary instruments
into or out of ihe United States or deposited in financial institutions. For additional guidance on the Bank Secrecy Act,
please refer to the Bank Secrecv Act section.
The USA PATRIOT Act was signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 26,2001, following the
terrorist activity of September 11. Title lll, the lnternational Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing
Act of 2001 , deals with money laundering and terrorist financing. Title lll made significant changes to money
laundering regulations, imposed enhanced requirements for AML programs, and significantly expanded the scope of
coveragelo nonbank financial institutions. lt requires financial institutions to establish AML programs that include
policies, procedures and controls, designation of a compliance officer, training, and independent review. lt also
requires, among other things, that certain financial institutions establish customer identification procedures for new
accounts as well as enhanced due diligence (EDD) for correspondent and private banking accounts maintained by
non-U.S. persons. For additional guidance on the USA PATRIOT Act, please refer to the USA PATRIOT Act section'
10. What other AML laws have been enacted in the United States?
ln addition to the BSA and Title lll of the USA PATRIOT Act, other AML laws include the Money Laundering Control
Act of 1986 (MLCA), the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, the Annunzio-Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act of 1992, the
Money Laundering Suppression Act of 1994 (MLSA), and the Money Laundering and Financial Crimes Strategy Act
of 1 998.
The MLCA established two AML criminal statutes that, for the first time, made money laundering a criminal offense,
with penalties of up to 20 years and fines of up to $500,000 for each count. Additionally, the MLCA prohibits the
structuring of currency transactions to avoid filing requirements and requires financial institutions to develop BSA
compliance programs.
The primary purpose of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 was to provide funding and technical assistance to state and
local units óf government to combat crime and drug abuse. This Act increased the civil and criminal penalties for
money laundering and other BSA violations to include forfeiture of any property or asset involved in an illegal
transaction related to money laundering. lt introduced the'sting' provision, which enables law enforcement to
represent the source of funds involved in a transaction as the proceeds of unlawful activity. This Act also required the
identification and recording of purchases of monetary instruments, including bank checks or drafts, foreign drafts,
cashier's checks, money orders or travelels checks in amounts between $3,000 and $10,000 inclusive. This
legislation, in conjunction with the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Reauthorization Act of 1998,
protiviti 111

authorized the Director of the ONDCP to designate areas within the United States that exhibit serious drug traffìcking
problems and harmfully impact other areas of the country as High lntensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HlDTAs). The
HIDTA program aims to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of drug control efforts among local, state and federal
law enforcement agencies.
The Annunzio-Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act of 1992 gave protection from civil liability to any financial institution,
or director, officer or employee thereof, who/that makes a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) under any local, state or
federal law. The Annunzio-Wylie Act made it illegal to disclose when a SAR is filed. lt also made it illegal to operate a
money transmitting business without a license where such a license is required under state law, and required all
financial institutioni to maintain records of domestic and international funds transfers. ln addition, this Act introduced
the'death penalty, mandating that bank regulators consider taking action to revoke the charter of any banking
organization that is found guilty or pleads guilty to a charge of money laundering.
The Money Laundering Suppression Act of 1994 (MLSA) specifically addressed money services businesses (MSBs),
requiring each MSB to register and maintain a list of its agents. ln addition to making it a federal crime to operate an
unregistered MSB, the MLSA encouraged states to adopt uniform laws applicable to MSBs. lt also established
procédures that allowed banks to exempt certain customers from Currency Transaction Report (CTR) filing.
Continuing with the trend of developing a national strategy to combat money laundering, the Money Laundering and
Financial Ôrimes Strategy Act of 1998 called for the designation of areas at high-risk for money laundering and
related financial crimes by geography, industry, sector or institution. Some of these areas were later designated as
High Risk Money Laundering and Related Financial Crimes Areas (HlFCAs). The HIFCA program was created to
coórdinate the efforts of local, state and federal law enforcement agencies in the fìght against money laundering.
The lntelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 amended the BSA to require the U.S. Treasury
Secretary to prescribe regulations requiring certain financial institutions to report cross-border electronic transmittals
of funds, if the Secretary determines such reporting is 'reasonably necessary' to aid in the fight against money
laundering and terrorist financing.
11. What is the role of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and how does it fit into
AML laws and regulations?
The purpose of OFAC is to promulgate, administer and enforce economic and trade sanctions against certain
individuals, entities and foreign government agencies and countries whose interests are considered to be at odds
with U.S. policy. Sanctions programs target, for example, terrorists and terrorist nations, drug traffìckers and those
engaged in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
Overviews and details of the OFAC Sanctions programs can be found on OFAC's website at www.treas.oov/ofac
OFAC regulations are not part of AML compliance per se, but since the OFAC Sanctions lists include alleged money
launderers and terrorists and USA PATRIOT Act requirements mandate that certain financial institutions vet customer
names against the OFAC list, institutions often consider the OFAC program to be a subset of their overall AML
program. For additional guidance, please refer to the
Sanctions Proorams section.
12. How can one measure the effectiveness of an AML regime?
A number of factors can be considered when assessing the effectiveness of an AML regime, including the number of
money launderingiterrorist financing investigations, prosecutions and convictions, number and amount of
frozen/seized assets, identification of deficiencies in financial institutions in examinations by regulatory authorities,
and quality of coordination among financial institutions, regulatory and law enforcement authorities. For additional
guidance on tools and techniques used to assess the effectiveness of AML systems, please referto the Financial
Action Task Force section.
13. How do U.S. regulations compare to international AML regulations?
The United States' role as a leader in the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing dates back 40 years
to the passage of the Bank Secrecy Act in 1970. Through the ensuing decades and especially following the terrorist
activities of September 11,2001 , the United States has reinforced its commitment through the passage of a number
of additional money laundering-related laws, issuance of extensive regulatory guidance and aggressive enforcement.
That said, the United States, as with many other major jurisdictions, is not in full compliance with the FATF
Recommendations. ln fact, FATF in its most recent assessment of the United States' anti-money regime, identified
several areas in need of improvement, including: customer due diligence relating to beneficial owners, authorized
protiviti 112

signers, legal persons and trusts; ongoing due diligence; and general requirements for designated nonfinancial
bùsinesseõ and professions (DNFBP¡) (e.g., casinos, accountants, attorneys, dealers in precious metals and stones'
real estate agents).
For additional guidance, please refer to the Financial Action Task Force and Mutual Evaluations sections.
For additional guidance on international perspectives, please refer to the
section.
14. What are the consequences of not complying with AML laws and regulations?
The consequences of noncompliance with AML laws and regulations may include regulatory enforcement actions,
civil and criminal penalties, seizure and forfeiture of funds, and incarceration for the individuals involved. Depository
institutions also may be subject to restrictions on growth and expansion and, in the extreme, may have their
charters/licenses revoked, a consequence known as the'death penalty. For additional guidance, please refer to the
Enforcement Actions section.
15. What factors are considered by law enforcement when it assesses whether an institution
or its personnel are guilty of aiding and abetting money laundering or terrorist financing?
When assessing whether an institution or its personnel are guilty of aiding and abetting money_laundering or terrorist
financing, the author¡ties consider, among other factors, the following 'standards of knowledge':
. Reckless Disregard -
r Willful Blindness - Deliberate ignorance and failure to follow up in the face of information that suggests
probable money laundering or illicit activity
o Collective Knowledge - Aggregates/attributes the knowledge of employees to the employing company
Careless disregard for legal or regulatory requirements and sound business practice
It is important to remember that under U.S. law, a company may, in general, be held liable for the actions of its
employees, regardless of the number or level of employees involved in the wrongdoing.

Financial Crimes Enforcement Network
23. What is the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and what is its role in AML
regulation?
The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Treasury Department, was established in
1990 by Treasury Ordel|05-08. lts mission is to safeguard the financial system from abuses of financial crime. lt is
the Finâncial lntelligence Unit (FlU) of the United States, formed to support law enforcement and the fìnancial
community in the fight against money laundering, terrorist financing and other financial crimes through the collection,
analysis and sharing of gSR information. FinCEN seeks to provide adequate financial intelligence to law enforcement
without overburdening the financial community or compromising the privacy of individuals.
The many partnerships of FinCEN are not limited to the United States, but expand internationally to law enforcement,
financial institutions and regulatory authorities in foreign countries' as well.
While FinCEN relies primarily on federal functional regulators to examine financial institutions and enforce AML
compliance, the reguiators look to FinCEN for guidance in the implementation of the BSA and USA PATRIOT Act'
f¡nigru has issued regulations, in concert with federal functional regulators and the lnternal Revenue Service (lRS),
related to BSA and AML compliance. FinCEN may issue enforcement actions for violations of the BSA and USA
PATRIOT Act through ¡ts Office of Enforcement jointly or unilaterally. The Office of Enforcement evaluates
enforcement matters, including the assessment of civil money penalties.
24. ln what types of initiatives does FinCEN engage?
ln 1992, as part of the Annunzio-Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act, FinCEN formed the Bank Secrecy Act Advisory
Group (BSAAG), a task force established to coordinate and inform the fìnancial community about BSA-related
matters. The BSAAG includes senior representatives from financial institutions, federal law enforcement agencies,
regulatory agencies, and others from the public and private sectors. ln 2009, the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task
foice 1fÉeff) was established as a multi-agency task force with federal, state and local partners to improve efforts
to investigate and prosecute significant financial crimes, recover proceeds for victims, and address financial
discrimination in the lending and financial markets.
FinCEN also has created several communication systems to facilitate the sharing of information among both
domestic and international entities. The BSA E-Filing System allows fìnancial institutions to file electronic BSA forms,
such as CTRs and SARs, quickly and securely. The Gateway program enables law enforcement agencies and
financial industry regulators to have expedited access to BSA records fìled with FinCEN. The Law Enforcement and
Financial lnstituiionlnformation Sharing (LEFllS) system allows law enforcement to receive feedback from financial
institutions on subjects of money laundering and terrorism investigations, and is used to facilitate information sharing
among financial institutions. FinCEN also developed the Egmont Secure Web (ESW), which is a private network that
allowJconnected FlUs to interface with FinCEN and each other to access information related to money laundering
trends, analytical tools and technological developments via e-mail.
Additional tools include the Geographic Threat Assessments and Nontraditional Methodologies Sections, a resource
center for emerging methods of money laundering and terrorist financing.
FinCEN also collaborates with other FlUs globally to exchange information supporting AML and counterterrorism
initiatives worldwide, and assists other countries with developing their FlUs. For additional guidance on FlUs, please

26. How does FincEN interact with banking and securities regulators?
ln2OO4, FinCEN entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with federal banking regulators. The MOU
sets forih procedures for the administration of the BSA, Titles I and ll of Pub. L. 91-508, as amended' codified at 12
u.s.c. s 1829b,12 U.S.C. SS 1951-1959, and 31 U.S.C. SS 5311-5332; information relating to the primary federal
regulato-rs' policies and proðõdures for examination of BSA compliance; significant BSA compliance issues at banking
orlanizations supervised by the regulators; and analytical data based_on or derived from information provided by the
relulators. The MOU also gives F|ñCEN authority to issue its own enforcement actions, even when regulators may
noi think it is necessary. Oñ April 26,2005, FinCEN and the New York State Banking Department entered into a
similar MOU; shortly thereafter, a number of other states followed suit'
ln late 2006, the SEC and FinCEN entered into an MOU under which the SEC provides FinCEN with detailed
information on a quarterly basis regarding the AML examination and enforcement activities of the SEC and the Self-
Regulatory Organizationé (SROs). ln return, FinCEN provides assistance and analytical reports to the SEC.
protiviti I 1e

ln June 2011, FinCEN entered into an MOU with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which provides
the CFPB direct electronic access to BSA information and analytical materials (e.9., analytical tools, BSA information
reviews, etc.) as required and appropriate forthe exercise of the CFPB's regulatory authority. ln return, the CFPB,
upon request, will provide reports on the results of its investigations or examinations and statistical information related
to any inquiries to assist FinCEN in understanding and analyzing the value of BSA information.
Enforcement Actions
27. What types of enforcement actions are available to regulators for addressing AML
Compliance Program deficiencies and violations?
Regulators have a range of enforcement tools available to address AML Compliance Program defìciencies and
violations of AML laws and regulations.
While enforcement actions against nonbanks have increased in recent years, the number of enforcement actions
issued by bank regulators coñtinues to outnumber those of other agencies, at least in the United States. Examples of
enforcement actions available to U.S, bank regulators in order of severity are:
. Commitment Letter: A Commitment Letter is an agreement between a bank's board of directors and a bank
regulator in which the board, on behalf of a bank, agrees to take certain actions to address issues or concerns
surfaced by the regulator. A Commitment Letter is not legally binding, but the failure of a bank to live up to the
terms of the Commitment Letter may subject the bank to more formal regulatory action.
. Memorandum of Understanding: A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is an agreement between a bank's
board of directors and one or more regulatory agencies. The content of an MOU may be similar or identical to
more formal enforcement actions, but MOUs are nonpublic documents and, similar to Commitment Letters, not
legally binding.
. Formal Agreements: A Formal Agreement is an agreement between a bank's board of directors and one or
more regulatory agencies. While the contents of a Formal Agreement may mirror those of an MOU, violations of
a Formal Agreement can provide the legal basis for assessing civil money penalties (CMPs) against directors,
officers and other institution-affiliated parties.
o Gonsent Order or Order to Cease and Desist (C&D): Consent Orders and Orders to Cease and Desist are
agreements between a bank's board of directors and one or more regulatory agencies. Violations of a Formal
Agreement can provide the legal basis for assessing civil money penalties (CMPs) aga¡nst directors, offìcers and
other institution-affiliated parties. The regulator's decision to issue a Consent Order or Order to Cease and Desist
rather than a formal agreement is based on its assessment of the severity of the bank's problems.
¡ Civil Money Penalties (CMPs): Civil money penalties are financial penalties that may be imposed by a regulator
against a bank or an individual(s) for a violation of law or regulation or noncompliance with a formal enforcement
action.
o ,,Death Penalt¡/': Under the Annunzio-Wiley Act of 1992, bank regulators have the option - in fact, are obligated
to consider - whether the license/charter of a depository institution that is found guilty or pleads guilty to money
laundering charges should be revoked. The revocation of a license/charter is known as the Death PenalÇ.
Unlike the formal enforcement actions issued by bank regulators, which are usually very prescriptive as to the actions
that must be taken to address the identified deficiencies, the enforcement actions taken by securities and
futures/commodities regulators generally report findings that detail the nature of the deficiency, but do not prescribe
specific corrective action (and accompanying fines have been modest compared to those levied against banks).
28. Does FinCEN have enforcement authority?
FinCEN does have enforcement action authority, which it often uses in conjunction with a financial institution's
functional regulators.
29. Beyond the actions and penalties that may be imposed by regulators, are U.S.
companies subject to any other potential actions?
Yes. Other actions, such as Deferred Prosecution Agreements (DPA), may result from legal actions.
protiviti l20

30 What is a Deferred Prosecution Agreement?
A DPA is an agreement entered into between a prosecutor and a defendant in a criminal case whereby in exchange
for successful completion of agreed-upon commitments, the criminal charges against the defendant will be dismissed
in their entirety by the prosecutor.
31. What enforcement actions have had a significant impact on the AML landscape?
Certain enforcement actions stand out because of the size of the penalties imposed on the institutions and/or the
media attention they received. Examples would include:
o BankingOrganizations:
ABN Amro: ln December 2005, ABN Amro was assessed an $80 million Civil Money Penalty (CMP) for
failure to implement an adequate system of internal controls reasonably designed to assure compliance
w1h U.S. AML laws and regulations. The CMP cited deficiencies within the North American Regional
Clea¡ng Center (NARCC), a unit within the New York Branch of ABN Amro that operated as a clearing
center for funds transfers in U.S. dollars for members within the ABN Amro network and more than 400
third-party financial institutions. Specific findings included the following:
. Failure to staff the compliance function and train compliance personnel adequately
. Failure to file accurate and timely Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs)
. Lack of formal procedures for collecting and reviewing due diligence and assessing the risks of
foreign financial institutions accessing correspondent banking services
. Lack of adequate monitoring of funds transfers for potentially suspicious activity, particularly
funds transfers conducted by financial institutions independent of the ABN Amro network
. Failure to incorporate information on subjects of previous SAR filings, terminated relationships,
and publicly available information on shell companies into its suspicious activity monitoring
program
. Failure to investigate alerts and utilize the capabilities of its automated monitoring software to
manage its money laundering and terrorist financing risk effectively
American Express: ln August 2007, American Express lnternational Bank (AEIB) was issued a Cease
and Desist (C&D) order and assessed a $20 million CMP and $55 million forfeiture. American Express
Travel Related Services Co. (AETRSC) also was assessed a $5 million CMP. Cross-border payment
made total effective charges, including forfeiture, $65 million. AEIB provided private banking services to
high net worth clients and AETRSC operated as a money services business (MSB). Specific findings
included the following :
. Failure to implement comprehensive customer due diligence (CDD) and enhanced due
diligence (EDD) processes
. Failure to implement effective control measures for bearer shares and other private investment
companies (PlCs)
. Failure to adhere to the internal policies for periodic reviews of high-risk accounts
. lnadequate transaction monitoring system due to data integrity and other problems
r lnadequate independent testing of the AML Compliance Program
. Failure to provide adequate oversight of and accountability for the AML Compliance Program
by management of AEIB and its parent company, AEB
Wachovia: ln March 20'10, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), FinCEN and the U.S.
Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that Wachovia Bank, N.4., had agreed to a Deferred
Prosecution Agreement with a forfeiture of $110 million with the DOJ, a civil money penalty of $50
million, a C&D with the OCC, and a civil money penalty (CMP) of $1 l0 million with FinCEN. FinCEN
agreed its CMP would be satisfied by the payment of the DOJ forfeiture. Specifìcfindings included the
following:
. Failure to implement adequate policies, procedures and controls for bulk cash transactions
conducted by high-risk casas de cambìo and other foreign correspondent banking customers
protiviti 121
. Failure to conduct monitoring of the high volume of monetary instruments through casas de
cambio and other foreign correspondent customers using Remote Deposit Capture (RDC)
servlce
. Failure to monitor sequentially numbered traveler's checks used by casas de cambio and other
foreign correspondent customers in a manner compliant with internal policy on these
transactions
. Failure to institute appropriate risk-based monitoring of foreign correspondent banking
customers - primarily as a result of setting alert parameters based on staffing capacity
. Failure to file timely SARs on several foreign correspondent banking customers
. Failure to report cash structuring activity
HSBC: ln October2010, the Federal Reserve Board announced that it had issued a Cease and Desist
Order between HSBC North America Holdings, lnc, (HNAH), New York, New York, a registered bank
holding company (BHC), and the Federal Reserve Board. The order requires HNAH to take corrective
act¡on to improve its firm-wide compliance risk management program, including its anti-money
laundering compliance risk management. Concurrent with the Federal Reserve Board's announcement
of its enforcement action, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced its issuance of a
Cease and Desist Order against HSBC Bank USA, N.4., Mclean, Virginia (HBUS, a subsidiary of
HNAH), for violating the Bank Secrecy Act and its underlying regulations.
HSBC was directed to use its financial and managerial resources as a source of strength for its bank
subsidiaries, and in particular HBUS, to ensure that it complies with the OCC Consent Order regarding
HBUS' BSA/AML program. lt was also directed to 'retain an independent consultant acceptable to the
[Chicago Federal] Reserve Bank to complete a review of the effectiveness of the firm-wide BSA/AML
Compliance Program adopted by HNAH (the 'BSA/AML Review'), and to prepare a written report of
findings and recommendations (the 'BSA/AML Report'). ln another section of the Order, HNAH was
directèd to 'submit to the [Chicago Federal] Reserve Bank an acceptable written program designed to
reasonably ensure the identifìcation and timely, accurate, and complete reporting by HNAH and its
subsidiaries of all known or suspected violations of law or suspicious transactions to law enforcement
and supervisory authorities, as required by applicable suspicious activity reporting laws and
regulations.'
The OCC Order states that the agency found deficiencies in HBUS' BSAJAML Compliance Program - in
particular, deficiencies in internal controls for customer due diligence, procedures for monitoring
suspicious activity and independent testing. The Order also cited aggravating factors 'such as highly
suspicious activity creating a significant potential for unreported money laundering or terrorist financing.
Specific cited deficiencies included special handling of wire transfers of customers domiciled in
countries risk-rated as 'standard' or'medium,' resulting in limited and ineffective BSA/AML monitoring
of two{hirds of the bank's wire activity; failure from 2006 to 2009 to monitor bulk cash transactions with
foreign affìliates; failure to perform customer due diligence or enhanced due diligence for its foreign
affiliates, inhibiting its assessment of customer risk and the identification of suspicious activity in
accounts of those affiliates; failure to address a backlog of suspicious activity alerts (due to inadequate
staffing), which caused the bank to file many late SARs; and failure to appropriately designate
customers as 'high-risk'for BSA/AML monitoring, even when a customeis association with PEPs could
harm the bank's reputation. ln July 2012, HSBC was the subject of a hearing held by the Senate
Permanent Subcommittee on lnvestigations entitled 'U.S. Vulnerabilities to Money Laundering and
Terrorist Financing: HSBC Case History.'
Citibank: ln April 2012, the OCC issued a Cease and Desist Order against Citibank, N.A. for violations
of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and underlying regulations. According to the OCC, the order requires
the bank to take comprehensive corrective actions to improve its BSA compliance program.
The compliance program allegedly had defìciencies with respect to internal controls, customer due
diligence, the independent BSA and the anti-money laundering audit function, monitoring of its remote
deposit capture and international cash letter instrument processing in connection with foreign
correspondent banking, and suspicious activity reporting related to that monitoring. These fìndings
resulted in violations by the bank of statutory and regulatory requirements to maintain an adequate BSA
compliance program, file suspicious activity reports, and conduct appropriate due diligence on foreign
correspondent accounts.
protiviti 122

As part of the Order, the Bank is required to arrange for an independent look back for suspicious activity
covering areas (and presumably time frames) to be designated by the bank's Examiner-in-Charge.
. Broker-Dealers:
o ETRADE: ln January 2009, FINRA assessed a $1 million penalty against ETrade Securities and E
Trade Clearing LLC for failure to implement AML policies and procedures to reasonably detect and
report potentially suspicious securities transactions. Alerts triggered in the automated monitoring system
were limited to those with money movements, thereby eliminating detection and review of potentially
suspicious matched or washed trades. The firms relied upon analysts to monitor high-volume online
trading activity for potentially suspicious activity manually, without providing necessary automated
monitoring tools.
Additionally, in July 2008, both firms reached a $1 million settlement with the SEC for failure to
document their Customer ldentification Program (ClP) and verify the identities of more than 65,000
clients from October 2003 to June 2005.
r Money Services Businesses (MSBs):
Sigue Corporation: ln January 2008, FinCEN assessed a $12 million CMP on Sigue Corporation for
faiiure to implement an effective AML Compliance Program in all four core elements as defined in the
USA PATRIOT Act: internal controls, designation of compliance officer/personnel, training, and
independent testing. The U.S. Department of Justice assessed a $15 million forfeiture and entered into
a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA). Payment of the forfeiture satisfied the FinCEN penalty.
Specific findings included the following:
. Lack of defined roles and responsibilities of the compliance function
. Failure to implement a risk-based suspicious activity monitoring program commensurate with
dollar volume and geographic reach
'
Lack of effective supervision and control over agents (e.9., agents advising customers to
structure transactions to evade AML reporting requirements)
. Failure to investigate alerts in a timely manner
'
'
Failure to file complete, accurate or timely Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs)
lnadequate and untailored training program and/or training program not completed by all
employees/agents
. lnadequate independent testing (e.g., not risk-based, insufficient testing, narrow scope) that
failed to identify system problems within the AML Compliance Program
From 2010 to 2011, seven MSBs were subject to enforcement actions primarily for failure to register
with FinCEN as an MSB. All were acting as independent money transmitters. A summary of fìndings
included the following :
. Failure to register as an MSB or complete biennial renewals with FinCEN
. Failure to implement an AML program as required for money transmitters
. Failure to report potentially suspicious transactions on SARs
. Structuring currency transactions to evade BSA reporting requirements
. Conspiracy to commit food stamp fraud
32. What have been the most common deficiencies in AML Compliance Programs?
Some common themes have been:
Program Violations: Overall failures supported by'pillaf violations, i.e., the failure of an institution to address
adequately its obligation to designate a qualified AML compliance officer; develop and implement appropriate
policies, procedures and controls; provide adequate training; and perform periodic independent testing of its AML
Compliance Program.
Systemic and Recurring Violations: Pervasive control breakdowns
protiviti 123
. lsolated and Technical Violations: Limited instances of noncompliance that do not threaten overall program
effectiveness
Some common problems and issues include, but are not limited to, the following:
¡ AML compliance officer (as well as other employees) lacks sufficient experience andior knowledge regarding
AML policies, procedures and tools
¡ lnsufficienVinadequate resources dedicated to AML compliance
o Lack of specific and customized training of employees with critical functions (e.9., account opening, transaction
processing, risk management)
r Failure to conduct adequate risk assessments (e.g., customer risk assessment, business line risk assessment,
OFAC risk assessment)
o Failure to incorporate risk assessments into a transaction-monitoring process, customer acceptance standards,
audits, testing or training
r lnadequate Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures (e.9., ClP, CDD and EDD at or after account opening,
including inadequate controls over required fìelds, inadequate methods of obtaining and/or maintaining current
informatlon, lack of reporting capabilities over missing information, and lack of verification procedures)
r Poor documentation maintained for investigations that did not lead to SAR fìlings
. Poorfollow-up on SAR actions (e.9., close, monitor)
. Lack of reporting of key SAR information to senior managemenVboard of directors
o lnadequate tuning, validation and documentation of automated monitoring systems
o Overreliance on software to identify transactions for which CTRs and/or SARs must be filed without fully
understanding how the software is designed and what information it does/does not capture
r Exclusion of certain products from transaction monitoring (e.g., loans, letters of credit, capital markets activities)
. Lack of timeliness when filing CTRs and SARs (e.g., reports are manually fìled via certified mail, and the date
postmarked is not noted)
o Lack of or inadequate independent testing of the AML Compliance Program
o Lack of or untimely corrective actions to prior examination or audit findings
To identify potential gaps in a fìnancial institution's AML Compliance Program, regulatory enforcement actions for
AML defiðiencies agãinst other (similar) financial institutions should be reviewed to identify the specific violations and
related action steps-. This enables fìnancial institutions to recognize and correct any potential weaknesses of their
own before their next regulatory examination.

worse if tensions continue to ratchet upward. They see a heightened
possibility of actual military conflict in the Gulf, where one-fifth of
the world's oil supplies traverse the shipping lanes between Saudi
Arabia and Iran. Growing hostility between the two countries could
make it more difficult for the U.S. to exit smoothly from Iraq this
year, as planned. And, perhaps most dire, it could exacerbate what
many fear is a looming nuclear arms race in the region.

Iran has long pursued a nuclear program that it insists is solely for the
peaceful purpose of generating power, but which the U.S. and Saudi
Arabia believe is really aimed at producing a nuclear weapon. At a
recent security conference, Prince Turki al Faisal, a former head of
the Saudi intelligence service and ambassador to the U.K. and the
U.S., pointedly suggested that if Iran were to develop a weapon,
Saudi Arabia might well feel pressure to develop one of its own.

The Saudis currently rely on the U.S. nuclear umbrella and on
antimissile defense systems deployed throughout the Persian Gulf
region. The defense systems are intended to intercept Iranian ballistic
missiles that could be used to deliver nuclear warheads. Yet even
Saudis who virulently hate Iran have a hard time believing that the
Islamic Republic would launch a nuclear attack against the birthplace
of their prophet and their religion. The Iranian leadership says it has
renounced the use of nuclear weapons.

How a string of hopeful popular protests has brought about a
showdown of regional superpowers is a tale as convoluted as the
alliances and history of the region. It shows how easily the old
Middle East, marked by sectarian divides and ingrained rivalries, can
re-emerge and stop change in its tracks.

There has long been bad blood between the Saudis and Iran. Saudi
Arabia is a Sunni Muslim kingdom of ethnic Arabs, Iran a Shiite
Islamic republic populated by ethnic Persians. Shiites first broke with
Sunnis over the line of succession after the death of the Prophet

unlock my very soul.

Jeffrey told me the towels were on the heated rack just outside the
shower and asked me to get one and pat him down. Again putting himself
first as I sat there freezing while I compliantly patted down his body with
the white fluffy towel until he was dried. I nearly expected him to ask me
to dress him as well, but not surprisingly that came later down the track
too. I dried myself off and wiped the make-up from under my eye’s,
keeping quiet not.sure what to really say and half-embarrassed from the
entire evening’s events that just took place. I just remained silent whilst
we both got dressed until he brought me downstairs where Ghislane was
sitting at a desk holding his black leather duffel bag. When she moved
from the chair to let Jeffrey sit down, she passed him the bag and began
to tell me that | had great potential to be a massage therapist, they really
liked my style and who knows where this could lead too. She asked to see
me again tomorrow, same time after work. He opened the bag, revealing
stacks of brand-new hundred dollar bills separated with rubber bands to
count by the thousands. He grabbed one stack and took out two crisp
notes, placing them in my hand. He laughed that it was nearly my whole
week’s wage at Mar-A-Lago. Only there I didn’t have to degrade myself
as his new little toy.

When | got home my parents were anticipating my arrival. I kept it
simple and sweet with my folk’s, only telling them of the lessons about
the body I had received and the future prospects in massage therapy that
lie ahead. Nobody questioned who I was working for and complimented
my ability to be a hard worker. | quickly got out of that conversation
afraid I might give away a hint of shame in my eyes but no one caught
on. I excused myself to the bathroom to have a shower and stared into the
mirror for a moment, asking myself if] could really go through with this
only to mentally respond by reminding myself this would be as good as it
gets for a girl of my stature and limitations. I scrubbed myself rigidly in
the shower as if it would wash away the filthiness of the night, but it
didn’t help, I could still feel their hands in me and all over me and inside
of me. Trying to sleep that night was nearly impossible too, closing my
eyes only to drift away to flashbacks of the moments I had to give myself
to Jeffrey and Ghislane, each replay an exploitation of my vulnerability.

The next morning | awoke feeling anxious about the day ahead, trying to
push yesterday's memory from my thoughts, I was quiet for the whole
trip to work with my Dad. Before we got out of his car in the parking lot
he asked me if everything was okay, I lied, for his sake and mine. My life
was being transformed and I didn’t even know it yet, but soon enough I
would be a brainwashed tool only used for the sexual pleasure of others.

About to be entrapped in the same life | had broken free from only
months ago.

Convincing myself in order to succeed I had to step up from being a
girly teenager and start thinking like a young woman, it would be my
ticket to a great career and a fortunate life. I told myself “So what if I had
to bargain my body to this rich old geezer, some girls get themselves
through college by becoming a stripper and using their bodies to pay for
degrees, others go down even worse paths.” T guess it was just another
way to fathom the road I was going down, the effectiveness of the lies |
forced myself to believe was working as [ continued to tell myself J had
to make it any way | could rather than ever letting myself sleep on the
streets again. | was trading one shocking lifestyle for another, thinking |
was choosing the right one. If | could go back in time to ever meet myself
I would choose this time in my life. I’d start with a good hard smack to
my head to first shake some things up in there and next J would tell that
girl she could actually make it on her own if she just worked hard at
earning an honest wage and built her life up slowly. There is no rush or
time limit to ever stop reaching for achievement. Sadly enough I probably
wouldn’t of even believed myself anyways, learning my life’s hard
lessons through the experiences I continued to suffer.

I went to work at Mar-A Lago that day trying hard not to think of what
lay ahead in the afternoon too come, but the later the hour got the more
distinguished the knots became in my stomach. I spoke to no one of the
details to my explicit interview but told one girl how I was so happy I
was now Officially studying massage therapy, another lie. My friend was
surprised and intrigued that these people who could afford the best of the
best of therapists in the world chose an untrained fifteen-year-old girl to
perform a massage. She never said it in words, but her body language told
me she knew exactly why they wanted to use me and it wasn’t fora
therapeutic reason either and deep down inside [ understood.

The rest of the afternoon slipped away quickly and before I knew it I

attempt to help put us on the political offensive, after I was asked to record on of
Labor’s TV campaign messages. I knew what I wanted to say. I’d talked it over
with the small group of campaign experts Peres had asked me to assemble
alongside Ramon’s main team. Rather than ignore Bibi, I was going to use my
position as his former commander in Sayeret Matkal, someone who knew him
well, to explain why Peres should lead Israel.

“How many of us can really understand what it means to be a Prime Minister?”
I began. “As head of intelligence, and chief of staff, I have seen, close-up, what it
takes to be a Prime Minister. It is not a game. We’ve had good Prime Ministers:
Ben-Gurion, Peres, Rabin, Begin... Bibi, we know each other well, from the days
when you were an officer under my command. A young officer, and a good one.
Prime Minister is the most important and serious role in this country. Bibi, it’s not
yet you. We need an experienced leader, who will know how to guide us with
wisdom, strength and sensitivity. Shimon Peres is that man.”

Yet we were never going to be able to avoid engaging with Bibi altogether. The
face-to-face television debate between the two candidates was set for May 27, two
days before the election. By American standards, the format was fairly tame. No
direct exchanges were permitted, only a series of questions directed at each
candidate by a leading political journalist, Dan Margalit. Still, it would place
Shimon and Bibi side by side. We spent two days prepping Peres, with Avraham
Burg — an early Peace Now supporter, former Peres aide and Knesset member —
standing in for Bibi. Avraham played the role well, anticipating the lines of attack
Shimon would face. But as I watched, I worried that even he couldn’t replicate one
of Bibi’s key advantages. During his time at the embassy in Washington, and
especially as UN ambassador, Bibi had become a frequent presence on American
television interview shows. Always articulate, he was now also an experienced,
and completely comfortable, television performer. In our debate rehearsals, Peres
sounded well versed on all the issues. Yet I sensed his problem wasn’t going to be
the message, but the medium. He sounded a bit distant, unengaged, almost as if the
TV debate was something he knew he had to go through, but which he thought
slightly sullied the proper purpose of politics.

In the real debate, Shimon seemed to convey the sense that merely being in the
same studio with a pretender as raw and untested as Bibi was offensive. When each
of the candidates was given the opportunity at the end to ask a single question of
the other, Peres didn’t even bother. He did come over as the man with much more

there are issues he cannot avoid. He may,
however, choose to raise them in private
talks with Israeli leaders rather than in
public. His message is expected to be
twofold: Israel should not delay in granting
statehood to the Palestinians, however
painful that choice may be, and it should be
careful not to make an eternal enemy of
Iran. Both conflicts have the potential to
isolate Israel internationally and threaten its
long-term interests, if not its actual
existence.

In his first term of office, Obama resisted
Netanyahu’s pressure to wage war on Iran.
This was no more than a semi-success,
however, since he managed to blunt
Netanyahu’s belligerence only by imposing
on Iran a raft of sanctions of unprecedented
severity. They have halved Iran’s oil
exports, caused its currency to plummet
and inflation to gallop, severed its relations
with the world’s banks and inflicted severe
hardship on its population.

The key question today is this: What are
Obama’s intentions? Is he seeking to bring
down Iran’s Islamic regime, as Israel
would like, or is he simply seeking to limit
its nuclear ambitions? If ‘regime change’ is
his aim then sanctions will have to be
tightened even further and extended
indefinitely. But if Obama’s aim 1s to strike

and she also found that other women started coming to her for references.

As one woman in the film put it, in those days, women who sought abortions were all
hysterical and desperate and scared: if you needed an abortion, you knew you would
have to come up with some fabulous amount of money and take a life-threatening risk.
Some women committed suicide when they got pregnant instead. Information about
abortion was at a premium.

So Heather Booth began looking for abortion doctors, and better than that, she started
vetting them. After finding the doctors, she sought testimonials about those doctors.
Common problems with abortion doctors ranged from being rude to actually assaulting
their patients; some doctors, who already charged sky-high prices, would demand more
money at the last minute. Booth kept a list of abortion doctors who didn't do those things.
Pretty soon, there were other women who had her list too, and they were vetting doctors
and spreading the word as well. The group also provided counseling before and after the
procedure, letting the patients know what they could expect -- physically and
emotionally. They called themselves Jane: a woman who called them and asked for
Jane was seeking an abortion.

After some time, the women of Jane figured out that abortion isn't a complex procedure,
and they convinced a doctor to teach them how to do it safely. And then they taught each
other. So then they didn't have to refer patients to doctors: they did all the abortions
themselves, and they did them for whatever the patient could spare rather than charging
prices that were out of reach for many women. Jane members continued to provide
emotional support, as well: in the documentary, one member reminisces about how she
would have patients over to dinner with her kids and talk to them for a while before
performing the procedure. It got to the point where doctors and medical students sent
women to Jane, rather than getting referrals from Jane.

That is positive activism. That is building the world we want to see.

When abortion was legalized in 1973, the group quietly disbanded. Some members of
Jane went on to be involved in other parts of the feminist movement or to found respected
women's health organizations.

It's not that Jane had no problems; the organization was not transparent, for example, and
it sounds like there was a fair amount of gossip and internal difficulties. These are typical
issues within small groups, and the stigma and anxiety of what they were doing can't
possibly have helped, but still, it's important to work against those problematic patterns
from the beginning. It's worth it, I think; I'm increasingly convinced that the most
positive direct change can be traced to small, grassroots, community groups. Which
means that making sure your small, grassroots community group is egalitarian but well-
organized can have ripple effects all down the line.

Another example of such a group might be Chicago's Rape Victim Advocates. RVA was
established in 1974 by doctors and nurses who were appalled by how badly rape
survivors were treated in the emergency room. Back then, there was no public
understanding of how traumatic rape could be, and little understanding of survivors’

to implement countless regulations, devices, and design changes that made technology
progressively safer. The fact that some regulations (such as using a cell phone near a gas
pump) are ludicrously risk-averse underscores the point that we have become a society
obsessed with safety, with fantastic benefits as a result: Rates of industrial, domestic, and
transportation fatalities have fallen by more than 95 (and often 99) percent since their
highs in the first half of the 20th century.”° Yet tech prophets of malevolent or oblivious
artificial intelligence write as if this momentous transformation never happened and one
morning engineers will hand total control of the physical world to untested machines,
heedless of the human consequences.

Norbert Wiener explained ideas, norms, and institutions in terms of computational
and cybernetic processes that were scientifically intelligible and causally potent. He
explained human beauty and value as “a local and temporary fight against the Niagara of
increasing entropy” and expressed the hope that an open society, guided by feedback on
human well-being, would enhance that value. Fortunately his belief in the causal power
of ideas counteracted his worries about the looming threat of technology. As he put it,
“the machine’s danger to society is not from the machine itself but from what man makes
of it.” It is only by remembering the causal power of ideas that we can accurately assess
the threats and opportunities presented by artificial intelligence today.

Powerful industry leaders often strive to restrict entry of new en-
terprises and innovations. But slowing down or stopping new, more 
productive technologies to protect prior capital investments creates a 
positive-feedback loop by preventing capital from investing in profitable 
new opportunities. If capital can't migrate to new profitable investments, 
the economy goes into a protracted stall. 
Lange described the struggle that pits capitalist against capitalist in 
stark terms. He writes: 
The stability of the capitalist system is shaken by the alternation of at-
tempts to stop economic progress in order to protect old investments and 
tremendous collapses when those attempts fail.' 
Tools Sign Comn 
Attempts to block economic progress invariably fail because new en-
trepreneurs are continually roaming the edges of the system in search of 
innovations that increase productivity and reduce costs, allowing them to 
win over consumers with cheaper prices than those of their competitors. 
The race Lange outlines is relentless over the long run, with proiluctiv-
ity continually pushing costs and prices down, forcing profit margins to 
shrink. 
While most economists today would look at an era of nearly free 
goods and services with a sense of foreboding, a few earlier economists 
expressed a guarded enthusiasm over the prospect. Keynes, the venerable 
twentieth-century economist whose economic theories still hold consider-
able weight, penned a small essay in 1930 entitled Economic Possibilities 
for Our Grandchildren, which appeared as millions of Americans were 
beginning to sense that the sudden economic downturn of 1929 was in fact 
the beginning of a long plunge to the bottom. 
Keynes observed that new technologies were advancing productivity 
and reducing the cost of goods and services at an unprecedented rate. They 
were also dramatically reducing the amount of human labor needed to 
mind from a preoccupation with strictly pecuniary interests to focus more 
on the arts for life and the quest for transcendence. 
Both Lange and Keynes foresaw, back in the 1930s, the schizophrenia 
that lies at the nucleus of the capitalist system: the inherent entrepreneurial 
dynamism of competitive markets that drives productivity up and mar-
ginal costs down. Economists have long understood that the most efficient 
economy is one in which consumers pay only for the marginal cost of the 
goods they purchase. But if consumers pay only for the marginal cost and 
those costs continue to race toward zero, businesses would nor be able to 
ensure a return on their investment and sufficient profit to satisfy their 
shareholders. That being the case, market leaders would attempt to gain 
market dominance to ensure a monopoly hold so they could impose prices 
higher than the marginal cost of the products they're selling, thus prevent-
ing the invisible hand from hurrying the market along to the most efficient 
economy of near zero marginal cost and the prospect of nearly free goods 
and services. This catch-22 is the inherent contradiction that underlies 
capitalist theory and practice. 
Eighty years after Lange and Keynes made their observations, con-
temporary economists are once again peering into the contradictory work-
ings of the capitalist system, unsure of how to make the market economy 
function without self-destructing in the wake of new technologies that are 
speeding society into a near zero marginal cost eL. 
Lawrence Summers, U.S. secretary of the treasury during President 
Bill Clinton's administration and former president of Harvard University, 
and J. Bradford DeLong, a professor of economics at the University of Cal-
ifornia, Berkeley, revisited the capitalist dilemma in a joint paper delivered 
at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's symposium, Economic Pol-
icy for the Information Economy, in August 2001. This time, there was 
much more at stake as the new information technologies and the incipient 
Internet communication revolution were threatening to take the capitalist 
system to a near zero marginal cost reality in the coming decades, 
"
IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013632.txt,"would otherwise be a complicated beyond reach situation. One of the properties
found around singularities, is the Joss of absoluteness in contextual characteristics
such as the scale of the observation. We no longer can say that what we are
studying happens in inches or miles, in seconds or days, now or in the past. In the
place of a single unit of relevant measurement, we have a distribution of spatial and
temporal feature sizes that stretch toward both the infinitely small and the infinitely
large.

We can illustrate a dynamical transition involving the passage of the system
through a singularity by using the metaphor of another kind of water experiment. If
we pour a small amount of water through a filter full of coffee grounds, or watch our
coffee maker do it, the first spurt of water makes an incomplete path of wet grounds
in the bed of dry ones. The next bit of water soaks this path more thoroughly and
may form additional and multiple, new and branching, incompletely penetrating
paths. Eventually, on just one more of these pourings, a connection in the paths
occur, such that the water snakes all the way through the coffee grounds and the
first brown drop of coffee falls into the pot. At this flow singularity and opposite to
the dynamic of a faucet water drop, a discontinuous system of pathways becomes
continuous in finite time in a process called percolation,

Trying to set up a predictive model, we can count the number of water
deliveries that occur before the first drop finds its way through. Repeating the
experiment many times yields a span of the number of pours required to reach the
singular point of percolation. If we do the experiment enough times, the distribution
of the number of pours required to reach percolation will range from one toward
infinite. In the neighborhood of the transition, time as recorded as the number of
small pouring events may stretch.

In aa comparable system, as elegantly described by Detrich Stauffer in his
Springer-Verlag book on percolation, multiple hot spots in the woods can suddenly
fuse into a forest fire. Isaiah said, “...glorify the Lord in the growing fires of dawn...”
Faith fires spreading through a faithless dense forest, its hot irregular front damped
by the disbelief of water-filled leaves, or disillusionment gaps of already burned out

trees, can, under the right motivating conditions of dryness, wind velocity, tree

Berkeley, where her students work across different applications, from assistive robots to
manufacturing to autonomous cars, and draw from optimal control, planning, estimation,
learning, and cognitive science. Barely into her thirties herself, she has co-authored a
number of papers with her veteran Berkeley colleague and mentor Stuart Russell which
address various aspects of machine learning and the knotty problems of value alignment.

She shares Stuart’s preoccupation with AI safety: “An immediate risk is agents
producing unwanted, surprising behavior,” she told an interviewer from the Future of
Life Institute. “Even ifwe plan to use AI for good, things can go wrong, precisely
because we are bad at specifying objectives and constraints for AI agents. Their
solutions are often not what we had in mind.”

Her principal goal is therefore to help robots and programmers alike to overcome
the many conflicts that arise because of a lack of transparency about each other's
intentions. Robots, she says, need to ask us questions. They should wonder about their
assignments, and they should pester their human programmers until everybody is on the

Still, that doesn't mean that straight, dominant, big-dicked dudes who love boning thin
chicks feel totally okay about the current state of affairs. It just means they tend to have
less immediate motivation to question it. They also have less of an eye for spotting
gender oppression, because -- though they've got their own boxes hemming them in --
they're still more privileged than the rest of us, and the nature of privilege is to blind the
privileged class to its existence.

A male submissive once told me, Lots of heteronormative men know something is
wrong with the way we think about sex and gender. I can see them struggling with it
when we talk. They can't put their finger on it; they have a hard time engaging it. But I
engage it all the time; I have to, because my sexuality opposes it.”

When is it to a man's advantage to examine and question masculinity and stereotypes of
male sexuality? Which men are motivated to do so?

It's tempting to assert that men whose desires fit neatly (or at least mostly) within the
stereotype have it made -- after all, their sexuality works within the norm so many of us
struggle to escape. But I've had this assumption corrected several times, usually by smart
stereotypical men themselves. At one point, while developing a sexuality workshop, I
sent the outline to a bunch of friends. The original draft contained this paragraph: Our
sexual scripts favor a certain stereotype of men and male sexual pleasure, which makes it
hard for women to figure out what we really want and what we really enjoy, and also
makes it harder for non-stereotypical men to figure that out. One friend sent that
paragraph back, having quietly appended: ... as well as for stereotypical men to discover
or explore new desires beyond the stereotypical script.”

When we discuss the limitations around sexuality from a non-normative perspective, how
do we exclude normative people who might develop themselves in new directions if they
had the chance? What do normative men stand to gain by thinking outside the box about
masculinity and sexuality?

Envisioning and Addressing Adverse Outcomes

ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY

e Noconsensus reality, inability to coordinate large-scale positive action
e Concrete version of emergent social failure from Al technology

DISCUSSION

Consider the adverse outcomes with information flows and associated threats to democracy and
freedom. What surprises might lurk in our future around costly outcomes in this realm? How
might we thwart attacks on manipulating content from people, and on harnessing or hacking
someone’s identity? What might be done to thwart a march to adverse outcomes for information,
freedom of thought, democracy? What recommendations might be made about steps for moving
forward?

POTENTIAL GOALS

e Seek a better understanding of the technological, social, political and economic aspects around
uses of Al for generating, optimizing information and propaganda.

e Identify potential blueprints for institutional interventions that may prevent/slow/detect the
scenario unfolding

e Develop ideas for coordinating relevant actors (advertising agencies, political parties) and/or
carriers (media outlets, digital platforms) to prevent the worst versions of the scenario.

e Identify potential approaches to thwarting attacks harnessing identify, including certification of
identity by owners, identifying mechanisms for thwarting generation and distribution of false
content. Possibilities of new approaches to minimizing threat with fines, other regulatory activity.

Work stoppage threat gets Waste Management to table

By JONATHAN AUSTIN
Daily News Staff

A Waste Management Authority
contractor had planned a work stop-
page this week because the Virgin Is-
lands Waste Management Authority
owes vendors a lot of money and they
can’t keep working for nothing.

However, discussions with adminis-
trators at Waste Management led Peter
Caproni, owner of Your Environmental
Services Inc., to say he’s holding off on
urging garbage collection vendors to
stop work on Wednesday.

“T’m not intent on messing up our
communities,” said Caproni, whose
company picks up the bin sites on St.
John.

“We've created a dialogue. I am
a fair person,’ Caproni said. “I want
to listen to what they have to say. It
seems as though they’re going to put
together an offer.”

Caproni had told The Daily News
on Monday he was announcing a
work stoppage beginning Wednesday.
He said he and other haulers were go-
ing to stop emptying scores of bins
across St. Thomas and St. John be-
cause Waste Management had failed
to pay them for weeks or months.

Caproni said he has worked 26
years in trash removal and roll on/

roll off services in the territory. He
said his company empties “all the
rear load bins on St. John,’ and does
emergency Waste Management Au-
thority work on St. Thomas.

Contacted by The Daily News,
Waste Management Authority execu-
tives were unaware Caproni and pos-
sibly two other haulers were walking
off the job.

Roger Merritt Jr., the newly hired
executive director of the agency, said
Monday evening he wants to meet
with all the contracted haulers to see
what they are owed and come up with
a plan to get them paid.

“T understand that the haulers need
to get paid,” Merritt said. “We need
to ensure we are able to make timely
payments.”

Caproni said he is willing to lis-
ten, but the answer has to be that the
Waste Management Authority comes
up with payment for services already
rendered.

“The solution is, you pay your bills
on time,” he said.

Patrick Charles, one of the vendors
Caproni mentioned, said Monday that
he has “reasons to be on board” with
a work stoppage, though he couldn’t
make such a decision alone.

“T realize that he is upset,’ Charles
said, referring to Caproni. “It is time

Police: Ex-employee filing

By BRIAN O’CONNOR
Daily News Staff

Police officials dismissed this week
multiple complaints filed by a former
employee against high-ranking mem-
bers of the V.I. Police Department.

The complaints are all filed by
Lynne Harrison, the former director
of the Police Training Bureau.

In one such complaint, Harrison
alleges Deputy Commissioner Curtis
Griffin Jr. was “receiving compensa-
tion when absence from employment
without proper leave documentation,”
and “payroll fraud/embezzlement
— falsifying timekeeping records,
or when employees are not working
while on the job.”

In a letter attached to the claim,
Harrison says that from August 2016
to the present, Griffin received com-
pensation while not reporting for
duty at the department.

“In addition, he has not left for-
warding contact information to those
under his supervision and often was
not available during contact attempts
occurring during normal working
hours,” Harrison wrote. “Griffin was
available only via VIPD email which
was delayed or not deliverable, thus
leaving him ineffective and not suit-
able to be classified as working tele-
commuting.”

Griffin dismissed the complaints

against him, and said he welcomed
an investigation.

“IT want them to investigate be-
cause I’m hoping — when all is done
— I’m hoping that maybe I can sue
her for slander,” he said. “I have noth-
ing to hide.”

Harrison’s letter calls for Griffin to
be investigated.

“While his explanation of absence
has been reported as a long term med-
ical procedure, due to the extraordi-
nary length of absence, previous ab-
sences, and non-contact information,
a full investigation is warranted to in-
sure the people of the Virgin Islands
have not been deprived of its funds
due to improper payroll deductions
or notifications,” she wrote.

The complaint was one of 10 filed
after Harrison lost her job as direc-
tor of the police department’s Train-
ing Bureau, according to copies fur-
nished by Harrison.

She filed a citizen’s complaint after
her termination alleging that Police
Commissioner Delroy Richards Sr.
had violated department policy and
that he had ignored requests for the
correction of a violation.

Harrison also filed a complaint
alleging Griffin’s administrative as-
sistant, Le-Reeda Lake, was absent
on sick leave for four weeks without
prior notice; that special assistant to
the commissioner Capt. Mary Dug-

for anybody to get upset. I’m in
agreement with him.”

Charles said his firm empties bins
on St. Thomas and hauls trash from
Waste Management Authority collec-
tion sites in a number of government
housing communities.

Regarding how much Waste Man-
agement owes him, Charles replied:
“It depends on what you call a lot.
They’re two months behind, now.”

Caproni wouldn’t say how
much Waste Management owes
him in total.

“It’s a big amount of money,” he
said. “I’m fed up with the whole
thing.”

Caproni said he estimated that
Waste Management owes various
vendors millions of dollars.

The Waste Management Author-
ity’s inability to pay vendors has been
a topic during Senate testimony over
the years.

Steve Aubin, who was interim ex-
ecutive director of the Waste Man-
agement Authority for most of 2016,

told the Senate Finance Committee in
July that the contractors needed to be
paid.

“Tt is clear that the contractors
are bearing the brunt while trying to
provide critical services in hopes of
payment by the authority as soon as
possible,” he said.

Aubin ran the agency after the re-
tirement of May Adams Cornwall un-
til Merritt was hired last month.

“The financial condition of the
Virgin Islands Waste Management
Authority is dire and requires im-
mediate attention and relief,’ Aubin
told senators in July. “The author-
ity’s available cash to pay its con-
tractors/vendors timely is critically
limited, resulting in delayed pay-
ments to its contractors/vendors;
growing accounts payable, which
is currently on the order of $10
million for its major contractors/
vendors; and non-compliance at the
Anguilla and Bovoni landfills with
court ordered mandates.”

An example of the outstanding

obligations owed by Waste Manage-
ment has been highlighted for the
last two years in Senate testimony
during the budget process. For Fiscal
Year 2016, the agency noted it owed
vendor Gem’s Construction $200,000
from fiscal year 2012 to pay for gar-
bage collection services on the island
of St. Thomas.

The Waste Management Authority
noted that it was “unable to identify a
revenue source” to pay Gem’s for the
years-old debt.

During testimony on the Fiscal
Year 2017 budget, Waste Manage-
ment again listed $200,000 owed
to Gem’s Construction for garbage
collection on St. Thomas. However,
Waste Management officials said the
$200,000 was owed from the 2011
fiscal year.

No one from Gem’s Construction
was available for comment Monday
afternoon.

Merritt said he believes the Waste
Management Authority can address
the overdue debt owed to the vendors.

“T think we can. We’ve got to get
a plan in hand and get them paid. If
they provide a service, they should
get paid,” he said.

‘frivolous’ complaints against top cops

gan had potentially disclosed confi-
dential department information to a
third-party vendor for personal gain,
and had used threatening behavior to
create a hostile work environment,
and that she had obstructed Harri-
son’s performance of her duties.

Harrison further alleged that Lt.
Maria Colon-Jones had disrupted a
training presentation, and she said
her termination was retaliatory for
asking for sick leave to be treated for
Zika.

Harrison said that she eventually
fled the Virgin Islands in fear of her
life and that the police department
still owes her $5,000 in back pay,
Harrison said.

Harrison said Monday she’s sub-
mitted her complaints to Gov. Ken-
neth Mapp.

“T was the director of training and
was fired without cause,” she said. “I
had filed several complaints.”

Harrison said she requested 10 days
of medical treatment off-island to com-
bat a Zika infection on Oct. 18.

“Two hours later, I was terminat-
ed,” she said.

Documents provided by Harrison
show she was suspended without pay
on Oct. 18, and terminated on Oct.
28.

Griffin said that while he was un-
dergoing cardio rehab in Florida, he
started hearing about issues involving

Harrison. Ultimately, Richards made
the decision to terminate Harrison,
Griffin said.

“Subsequent to her termination,
she started sending complaints,” he
said. “She said she heard that while
I was away I was practicing law and
not really sick.”

Harrison wasn’t his supervisor,
and wasn’t aware of how the accumu-
lated sick time was being used, Grif-
fin said.

“She submitted so many com-
plaints against so many people,” he
said. “It’s obvious that it’s frivolous.”

The complaints have not yet re-
sulted in an internal investigation,
Richards said.

“T found she was too much of a
distraction for us to move forward
with the actions as required of us by
the mandates of our consent decree,”
Richards said about his decision to
terminate Harrison.

Harrison had failed to submit to a
department background check in a
timely manner, Richards said.

“The department brought her in
on an interim basis initially, and then
she was asked to comply with the
package that we provided in order to
conduct a background investigation,”
he said. “She offered resistance. She
believed she could complete her own
timeline.”

Harrison said she had asked for 10

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014500

days to secure her college transcripts.

“My email specifically says I am
not saying I don’t want a background
check,” she said.

Richards said he ultimately direct-
ed Harrison’s complaints to the legal
department, but he said Harrison
continued to send letters and emails.

A response from the department’s
legal counsel provided by Harrison
says simply that Harrison couldn’t
use the citizen’s complaint process to
complain about things that happened
while she was the director of the
Training Bureau, and that each com-
plaint will be closed as it is received.

“Tn some of her letters and emails,
she appeared very threatening,”
Richards said. “In one of her emails
she wrote ‘You are sicker than a tree
branch that’s going to be cut down
very soon.’ It’s one ignorance after
another.”

Harrison disputes that charac-
terization.

“I’m very professional,” she said.

Griffin was on legitimate sick leave
when he was in Florida, Richards
said.

“He was being treated and he en-
tered into a program in Florida,” he
said. “The woman is on a witch hunt
all over.”

grats- first at 22 and then at 19 that were done without my consultation and were resolved soley as a result
of my last minute intervention. . 600 million in after tax savings was just accomplished. (BTW- for some
reason you left the 30 million outstanding that I had said should only be done if” that was my additional

fee. and not used for non biz purposes and not art.

Sorry but .,

in June and then again Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout first projected at 20 . but less when
artspace and debt taken out, - then only after weeks, when you delayed any detailed discussion of money
wanting to give the issue a thoughtful response ( which I fully understand ) . you unilaterally changed our
agreement.. 5m would be reserved for the future ? . and out of the remaining 15m ,? 1 would receive only a
third. (note: I'm confident that both the debt , and the art space investment will also lead to a write- off of
another 30 m. plus ) In my dining room ,you were surprised when I said that i require most people to pay
their advisory fee up front so that I am assured that I will be properly compensated for my work when
strategies are implemented . you may recall that you appeared offended and said  are you suggesting that 1
would go back on my word  I said no , of course not ! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is
that when amounts get large, people tend to get unhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay.

I include below the email i sent to you on April 15, the day i was examining your returns It laid out my
understanding of the compensation agreed for a transaction of the magnitude to the penny of the one just
completed.ic 600m When it appeared that the transcation would and could go foward I was the first to point
out that our agreement would cost you too much money, therefore

more details

From day one I proposed to discount our agreement toa 50-60 million range. An extremely fair price for
all the transactions just completed . including Phaidon. - I was never told that this was out of range. in
fact, alternative methods of payment .ie my plane, or an -in-kind payment were discussed (

ie including keeping the 30m portion of the fee outstanding till March ) ,I provided , only because you
specifically requested a detailed step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that 1 was given
access to. ( Phaidon was never forthcoming ) in order to make my many corrections . ( as i said more needed
on phaidon ). Iwas then told that Alans involvement warranted a discount. Even in the best of light ,
though it is beyond question that not one time in the three years of his retainer has he ever proposed a
unique idea. (including any way to deal with the use issue on debras death ,or even the most basic review of
your largest asset by far , the BRH agreement. ) O.K. - lets say he made a contribution to the plan and stretch
reality beyond the pale and say it was 50 %. though no one could posit such a large amount unless they were
wearing a clown suit. , the payment and our formula of 37 percent associated with the deal was known . It
had both sent in writing and spoken about on the phone numerous times , a detailed execution plan was
provided . then and only then, after the entire transaction was laid out for the group to follow You told

me that after a number of conversations with brad karp that a total of only 20m would be paid , (and even that
was more than you originally contemplated ) for both transactions . Leon I feel It was remarkably unfair. Did
brad even knew of our prior agreements.? ?, I would ask that you I and Brad karp sit together if you think it
would be helpful. . I would like to send him this email, with your consent of course. Ifthe transactions were
never consummated , i would not be owed a dime, however , the expected fee was known up front. , the
detailed step by step plan was followed and overseen by me, the amount that I had requested before the
transaction had even begun, had already been heavily discounted, out of friendship, . I believe the decision re
only paying 20m has frankly , left me felling quite uneasy. and colors the view about the Athene or
Rothschild transaction.

Another analyst noted that we need “a granular view on issues of sharp power.”

He pointed in particular to Confucius Institutes, arguing that he would not accept
Confucius Institute-sponsored research, but was fine with language training, although
it would be better to get them off campuses. He laughed at the idea that they were
“effective instruments of Chinese propaganda.” Along these lines, a few individuals
indicated that they were less concerned about Chinese influence in the social sciences
and more concerned about reports that Chinese students and postdocs in scientific
research labs bring restricted technologies back to China.

Finally, there were calls from some analysts for far more reciprocity than currently exists.
These analysts felt that the playing field between the two countries was out of balance
and argued that there should be a much stronger dose of reciprocity and “hardball” in
US-China exchanges, arguing that the American side should curtail or cut off contacts
until Chinese institutions were willing to operate at a level of openness similar to that
found in their American counterparts.

Conclusion and Recommendations

American think-tank scholars working on China face an increasingly challenging
research environment. But in this challenge, they are hardly unique. Members of
the media and the civil society/NGO world also share similar, even more daunting,
challenges. The process for obtaining visas has become more onerous; the quality of
engagement with Chinese counterparts has declined and become more difficult; and
opportunities to do field-based research, as well as archival work, have diminished.
Track 2 dialogues are viewed with increasing skepticism as to their value by more
and more US scholars and policy specialists, who find their Chinese colleagues ever
more unable and/or unwilling to share their perspectives in an open and meaningful
manner. Many think-tank analysts are responding by limiting their Track 2 efforts and
changing the way they conduct their research.

At the same time, a small but growing group of well-funded Chinese scholars and
officials are proactively seeking to shape the American narrative and American views
of China. They are doing so by supporting and funding joint projects with American
partners in ways that reflect Chinese government priorities, but they give them the
opportunity to choose and work with only those American scholars viewed by China
as sympathetic to China’s goals. To date, these efforts do not appear to have influenced
the US debate over China in a significant manner, but it is important to be aware of
the money and effort being thrown at the endeavor.

Chinese funding of American think tanks remains limited. C.H. Tung, through his
China-US Exchange Foundation, is to date the most common source of financial
support, although most report his funding as “hands-off.” A few Chinese companies

Huntington’s terms, the rise of modern institutions that could
peacefully channel citizen participation.

Socioeconomic development, meanwhile, has proceeded apace:
Between 1990-2010 Tunisia’s Human Development Index (a
composite measure of health, education and income compiled by the
UN) rose 30 percent, while Egypt’s rose 28 percent. Both countries
produced tens of thousands of college graduates with no discernable
future and a lopsided income distribution in which a disproportionate
share of the gains from growth went to a small group of politically
connected insiders. Huntington’s analysis of Egypt in the 1950s and
1960s thus remains eerily relevant today.

In Political Order Huntington was also making a broader point about
the process of development itself. The significance of his book needs
to be seen against the backdrop of post-World War II modernization
theory, which in turn drew on classic 19th-century European social
theory articulated by academics like Edward Shils, Talcott Parsons
and Walt W. Rostow. American modernization theory argued that
development was a single, seamless process. Economic development,
changing social relationships like the breakdown of extended kinship
groups and the growth of individualism, higher and more inclusive
levels of education, normative shifts toward values like
“achievement” and rationality, secularization and the growth of
democratic political institutions, were all seen as an interdependent
whole.

By pointing out that the good things of modernity did not necessarily
go together, Huntington played a key role in killing off
modernization theory. Political development was a separate process
from socioeconomic development, he argued, and needed to be
understood in its own terms. The conclusion that flowed from this
point of view seemed at the time counterintuitive to the point of
stunning: Without political development, the other aspects of

with a “hummingbird mind,” Richard Saul Wurman
seeks ways to make the complex clear. Recognizing at
an early age that his ignorance is his greatest asset, he
has made it his mission to sort through the abundance
of information that is available on every topic, and
design the techniques to make it understandable.

In doing so he has continually sought to put himself
in the presence of extraordinary people, including (all now
all deceased), Francis Crick, Richard Feynman, Jonas Salk,
Eva Zeisel, Louis I. Kahn, Charles Eames, Frank Stanton and
Schuyler van Renssalaer Cammann, and Arnold Toynbee.
There are many others. The only two bosses he had who
didn’t fire him were Lou Kahn and Charlie Eames.

As aresult, Wurman has had many lives: as an author

city of Tikal and current project 19.20.21.); teacher (Cambridge

lack of basic freedoms. He doesn’t care.

Indeed, that was the point. Turki — and by implication all of Saudi
Arabia — has had it with the United States. The kingdom will not be
lectured to. It is sick and tired of American favoritism to Israel — the
exuberant congressional reception for Binyamin Netanyahu, for
example — and the administration’s decision to oppose any effort in
the United Nations to create a Palestinian state. In this matter,
America is doing what Israel wants.

“In September, the kingdom will use its considerable diplomatic
might to support the Palestinians in their quest for international
recognition,” Turki wrote. “American leaders have long called Israel
an ‘indispensable’ ally. They will soon learn that there are other
players in the region — not least the Arab street — who are as, if not
more, ‘indispensable.’ The game of favoritism toward Israel has not
proven wise for Washington, and soon it will be shown to be an even
greater folly.”

This is not your usual diplomatic language — and even for Turki it is
rough. It shows, though, a not-surprising frustration in the Arab
world with American policy tethered for the moment to a quite
stubborn and unimaginative Israeli policy. Both countries are
suffering from a surfeit of democracy. Israel’s governing coalition is
held hostage by the right; America’s governing coalition is in the
same fix.

Turki does not run out of wagging fingers. He says that those who
think that the United States and Israel will determine the future of
Palestine are dead wrong. “There will be disastrous consequences for
U.S.-Saudi relations if the United States vetoes U.N. recognition of a
Palestinian state. It would mark a nadir in the decades-long
relationship as well as irrevocably damage the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process and America’s reputation among Arab nations. The

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013140.txt,"224 12 The Engineering and Development of Ethics

‘T will not harm humans, nor through inaction allow harm to befall them. In situations
wherein one or more humans is attempting to harm another individual or group, I shall endeavor
to prevent this harm through means which avoid further harm. If this is unavoidable, I shall
select the human party to back based on a reckoning of their intentions towards others, and
implement their defense through the optimal balance between harm minimization and efficacy.
My ultimate goal is to preserve as much as possible of humanity, even if an individual or
subgroup of humans must come to harm to do so.”

However, it’s obvious that even a more elaborated principle like this is potentially subject to
extensive abuse. Many of the genocides scarring human history have been committed with the
goal of preserving and bettering humanity writ large, at the expense of a group of “undesirables.”
Further refinement would be necessary in order to define when the greater good of humanity
may actually be served through harm to others. A first actor principle of aggression might
seem to solve this problem, but sometimes first actors in violent conflict are taking preemptive
measures against the stated goals of an enemy to destroy them. Such situations become very
subtle. A single simple maxim can not deal with them very effectively. Networks of interrelated
decision criteria, weighted by desirability of consequence and with reference to probabilistically
ordered potential side-effects (and their desirability weightings), are required in order to make
ethical judgments. The development of these networks, just like any other knowledge network,
comes from both pedagogy and experience — and different thoughtful, ethical agents are bound
to arrive at different knowledge-networks that will lead to different judgments in real-world
situations.

Extending the above “mostly harmless” principle to AGI systems, not just humans, would
cause it to be more effective in the context of imitative learning. The principle then becomes an
elaborated version of “I will not harm sentient beings.” As the imitative-learning-enabled AGI
observes humans acting so as to minimize harm to it, it will intuitively and experientially learn
to act in such a way as to minimize harm to humans. But then this extension naturally leads
to confusion regarding various borderline cases. What is a sentient being exactly? Is a sleeping
human sentient? How about a dead human whose information could in principle be restored via
obscure quantum operations, leading to some sort of resurrection? How about an AGI whose
code has been improved — is there an obligation to maintain the prior version as well, if it is
substantially different that its upgrade constitutes a whole new being?

And what about situations in which failure to preserve oneself will cause much more harm to
others than acting in self defense will. It may be the case that human or group of humans seeks
to destroy an AGI in order to pave the way for the enslavement or murder of people under the
protection of the AGI. Even if the AGI has been given an ethical formulation of the “mostly
harmless” principle which allows it to harm the attacking humans in order to defend its charges,
if it is not able to do so in order to defend itself, simply destroying the AGI first will enable the
slaughter of those who rely on it. Perhaps a more sensible formulation would allow for some
degree of self defense, and Asimov solved this problem with his third law. But where to draw
the line between self defense and the greater good also becomes a very complicated issue.

Creating hard and fast rules to cover all the various situations that may arise is essentially
impossible — the world is ever-changing and ethical judgments must adapt accordingly. This
has been true even throughout human history — so how much truer will it be as technological
acceleration continues? What is needed is a system that can deploy its ethical principles in an
adaptive, context-appropriate way, as it grows and changes along with the world it’s embedded
in.

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022323.txt,"move above parity is unlikely as the RBA should step in. Therefore buy 2m 0.9750 call against selling 2x 0.9900 calls. The AUDUSD
risk reversal looks cheap (calls expensive relative to puts). This suggests selling high-strike calls, either outright for those that do not
expect further AUD appreciation or to finance a low-strike call for a short-term carry position.

Long KRW NDF : this trade will benefit should CNY appreciation or band widening expectations gain additional traction

Long USD TRY: the market remains relatively short TRY, and with risk premium in USDTRY declining the most among major
currencies, these short positions are likely to be at risk from carry traders.

2) HY vs IG compression trade in Europe: Six weeks of retail outflows from high-grade funds but retail inflows into high-yield funds
shows that the compression trade in credit is firmly entrenched in Europe. There is a structural reach for yield and this trade still has
some legs. I would however hedge out rate risk and stick with spread risk. I will point out that more than $200bn of “cov-lite” loans
have been issued so far this year, more than double the $100bn sold in 2007. The record issuance means that about 56 per cent of new
leveraged loans are now cov-lite !!

3) Long Europe small caps: This is a leveraged trade to a European recovery. European small + mid caps have a higher potential for
upside. As European economies improve and small to mid cap valuations in the region continue to look attractive, a re-acceleration of
sales and earnings at these companies should drive better performance in European small to mid caps versus the US. Investors looking
for yield will find higher levels in Europe versus the US with European small to mid caps yielding near 3% versus approximately
1.4% in the US.

4) Long IT stocks: overall IT spend is expected to grow 0.9% in 2014 compared to ~0.7% growth. Corporate spending sentiment now
is on the uptick prompting this move. Also keep an eye on data center growth. Demand for data center services is due to, First,
technological evolution -> driving up computing density (servers) and utilization rates (virtualization), therefore data center space
must constantly evolve to meet power and cooling needs. Second, increased cost consciousness and core competency focus -> driving
greater acceptance of data center outsourcing within Enterprise IT departments.

5) Long Italian Banks / Italian Govvies: another leveraged play on the European periphery recovery. Unicredit clearly stands out.
UCG will definitely gain from the European banking union theme. There has been recent talk of this year / early 2014 as a point when
impaired loan growth may finally subside and I expect a wide range of cost cutting action. Our strategists think Italy looks attractive
in a twin deficits framework and should benefit from improving fiscal and credit impasse, political risk premium should decline,
therefore they recommend buying 10y Italy vs Germany at 230bps, targetting a spread at 200bps

6) Euro Inflation floors: In the euro inflation options market, 5y 0% inflation floor prices are close to their lows. This is not consistent
with the Sy inflation swap rates which are by themselves close to lows -> meaning deflation is closer-to-the-money. Inflation volatility
has collapsed, probably mostly for purely technical reasons as is all other vol !!. Deflation is not anyone's central case, but a
underpriced tail risk. This creates opportunity for those prepared to pay premium for this risk and therefore would recommend
buying the charted 5y 0% zero coupon floors at or around the current level of 20c.

7) KOSPI Calls: The KOSPI2 has been trading within a tight range, realizing only 9.8% over the past 30 days, the lowest globally.
Low realized vol has capped short-dated implied vol, driving 1m ATM vol to 12.8%, near all time lows. The Index broke out from a
tight range last week and investors should consider buying short-dated calls for upside exposure or replace outright longs with calls.
The differential between positioning in EM equities and European equities has reached an extreme — worst on record and 2.4 stdev
below its 10-year average. Even the NKY 3M ATM vol dropped to an 8-month low !!!

8) UK Banks: On the back of weak FICC earnings across the street, Barclays I feel has hit Rock Bottom. This reflects the sentiment
around FICC geared investment banks generally, but also the horrible six months that management has seen. My personal view is that
rates + credit will recover in 2014 as tapering will create a steeper curve and volatility. I also think Barclays leverage ratios will
improve soon and Barclays will push through an aggressive cost cutting plan.

Quick Macro Snippet:

What should we be focused on: The most important market drivers will now be the 1) US labor market data and 2) Eurozone inflation.
An improvement in the former will determine the timing and pace of Fed tapering. A decline in the latter will determine whether the
ECB will stay on hold, or loosen policies. The Sep NFP is on Tuesday stay focused.

Gold some technicals - couldn't resist: The bears are still fighting the recent up move, here are some technicals to rebase...

The volatility in gold over the past several days has been impressive. A close above 1330 (Oct-08 high) would be the first sign of
basing and a turn higher, while bulls gain control only AFTER a close above 1375 (Sep-19 high). A close below 1270 exposes the
Jun-13, bear trend lows of 1180

TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029427.txt,"﻿PRESERVING MONGOLIAN SOVEREIGNTY AND CULTURE
MONDAY, JUNE 19, 2017
The sovereignty of Mongolia is under siege.
The People’s Republic China (PRC) regards Mongolia as its “Ukraine” i , ii . Covertly the PRC has
ambitions not simply to make Mongolia a client or puppet state, as it was under Soviet domination,
but to integrate it with the PRC through a “voluntary” referendum, just as the Russians engineered
the assimilation of Crimea in 2014.
This was Mao Tse-tung’s prophecy and intent once China could establish parity or surpass Soviet
military and economic might. iii
As the world’s attention is focused on China’s South China Sea claims, an asymmetrical war is also
being conducted by the PRC to achieve Mongolian assimilation. Russian influence is being
marginalized, as are Mongolia’s ‘3 rd Neighbor’ partners such as Japan, South Korea, Germany, and
the US iv . China’s penetration and Sinification of Mongolia’s natural resources, financial system,
businesses, infrastructure, media, social media, culture, religion, security, electoral system, and
political body are each battle fronts in a multi-pronged asymmetrical campaign to isolate and then
assimilate Mongolia v .
Preserving Mongolian sovereignty demands a global awareness of the PRC’s covert intent. An
education campaign is needed both within Mongolia and globally to counter a) the PRC’s revisionist
historical justification for claiming Mongolia as their Crimea vi and b) the PRC’s effort to isolate
Mongolia and control all aspects of Mongolia’s economy, resources, politics, and culture.
Without a counter-campaign Mongolia will in a decade’s time be assimilate and Sinicized like Inner
Mongolia and Manchuria vii . Mongolians will become strangers in their own land.
China’s assimilation of Mongolia will not only be a tragedy for the Mongolian people and the hope
for Central Asian democracy, but a threat to the balance of power in Eurasia.
i In negotiations in 1956 between the Soviets and the PRC, the Soviet negotiator, Sergo Mikoyan, and CCP
Politburo member Liu Shaoqi and Premier Zhou Enlai, the Chinese hoped to connect the granting of Mongolia
independence with the question of Stalin’s “mistakes.” The Chinese requested the Soviets cancel Mongolia
independence in the wake of Khrushchev’s condemnation of Stalin’s personality cult. Liu Shaoqi drew a
parallel between Mongolia and Ukraine. He declared that Mongolia was China’s “Ukraine”. Source: “New

iii On 2 September 1964 during Mao’s talk with the Japanese group of socialists, Mao announced that much of
Siberia and Far East once belonged to China: “About a hundred years ago the area of to the east of Baikal
become the territory of Russia and from then on Vladivostok, Khabarovsk, Kamchatka and other points are
the territory of the Soviet Union. We have not yet requested settling this account!” The publisher of the
article writes that Mao makes this claim based on “the fact that many hundreds of years ago Chinese troops
came to these areas and that once the Chinese Emperor collected tribute from the local people. Sournce: “In

years later, I raised this at one of the separate aseifa meetings held by young
people on the kibbutz, only to be told we’d never wanted to employ outsiders in
the first place. It was only because of Ben-Gurion that we felt unable to refuse.
I’m sure that was true, but it seemed to me an incomplete answer, and an
evasion. It struck me as an exercise in finding a verbal rationale for a situation
that was obviously unjust.

It was an accidental glance up from picking carrots which focused in my
mind the sense of unfairness I felt. We were working on a tract of about seven
acres of rich, dark soil where we grew carrots, tomatoes and potatoes and
eggplants. I think I was 11 or 12. We had assembled in the early afternoon near
the kibbutz garage. We piled on to a flatbed trailer, a dozen kids and a dozen
Yemeni women. We were towed by a tractor driven by a man named Yankele.
He was in his mid-40s. Like my father, he was one of the original group at
Mishmar Hasharon. Before the Yemenis came, he had worked planting and
harvesting. Now, he was responsible for “managing” the Yemenis, and us kids
as well, during our fieldwork. He paced among us every half-hour or so to make
sure the work was going smoothly. Though the area was ankle-deep in mud
during in the winter, it was hot and dusty in the summer. I’d been working for
an hour or so, crouching alongside Baddura, when I looked up. On the edge of
the field, under the shade of a clump of banana trees, I saw Yankele. He had a
set of keys on a metal chain. He was twirling them around his finger, first one
way, then the other, as his eyes tracked us and our Yemeni co-workers. Like a
kibbutznik-turned-plantation-owner.

As a February baby, I was the youngest in our age group. In the tiny world of
the kibbutz, there were not enough children to organize separate school classes
for each year. When I started school, I was five-and-a-half. Most of the others
were six. A few had already turned seven. Maybe it was this age pressure, or
maybe something inside me, but from the outset, I had a thirst for knowledge. I
was aware early on that some of the schoolwork came easily, almost
automatically to me: numbers and math and reasoning most of all. I also began
reading books, even if I could not fully understand them. By the time I was
eight or nine, I was burying myself in volumes of the children’s encyclopedia at

Jeffrey Epstein's Society Friends Close Ranks 
by Alexandra Wolfe  
Alexandra Wolfe is a former contributing editor to Conde Nast Portfolio. She has written for publications 
including the New York Times, New York magazine, the New York Observer, and the Wall Street Journal, 
where she wrote design and lifestyle features for the Weekend Journal section. Before that, she was a reporter 
at the New York Observer. She is currently working on a book called American Coddle, about America's 
culture of entitlement. 
X Close 
No, back then Epstein was mid-makeover. He had monarchy in-house and famous faces at his table. Former 
Bear Stearns CEO James Cayne had just endorsed Epstein on his science foundation's website (which has been 
since removed). It seemed Epstein had joined the ranks of former President Clinton, director Roman Polanski, 
and former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer, whose sex scandals faded in comparison with their celebrity. 
The conventional wisdom among his friends was that Epstein has been victimized by greedy, morally dubious 
teenage girls and unscrupulous lawyers. I've never condoned paying for sex, but if the young lady lied about 
her age it's her own fault, explained one socialite, who along with hedge-fund manager Wilbur Ross and real-
estate magnate Leon Black hobnobbed with Epstein at a Southampton movie screening just two months after 
his release from community control in Florida. 
Much of Epstein's entrée into New York society can be credited to Ghislaine Maxwell, the superbly well-
connected daughter of the late press magnate Robert Maxwell. Epstein started dating her in the 1990s. The 
romantic relationship ended after a few years, but they have remained close ever since. Last week two victims 
publicly alleged that Ghislaine procured them for Epstein, one at age 15 from a Mar-a-Lago country club locker 
room. Virginia Roberts, now 27, who was Epstein's sexual plaything for several years, told the Mail on 
Sunday. Ghislaine sent me to a dentist to have my teeth whitened and I went for Brazilian waxes. He wanted 
me to look pre-pubescent. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021090 
Now, New York friends are suddenly hesitant to talk about Maxwell. She's a high-end 'fixer', and so what? 
they ask. No one in café society gives a damn that a 15-year-old girl gives massages, says one frequent 
charity-benefit guest. She gets people into parties and runs around for a lot of people. As to the fallout from 
her association with Epstein, he says, If you're Mike Huckabee it would matter but not if you're Ghislaine 
Maxwell. 
The crowd at the events top publicist Peggy Siegal has organized for Epstein proves the point, at least behind 
closed doors. I and many others that know him describe him as brilliant, says Siegal. His unique mind is 
what attracts the world's smartest people to his home. Last September, with Siegal's help, Epstein hosted a 
Break Fast after Yom Kippur. A group of 120 friends brought their children over for a buffet dinner. One 
attendee, Jonathan Farkas, a New York real-estate heir, has known Epstein for 35 years and visited him while 
he was in prison. The side I've been reading about is a side I don't know, he says. Farkas considers Epstein 
one of the smartest people he knows and often asks him for investment advice. Unless I've seen it, I don't focus 
on it, he says. 
From a cerebral and business side he's worshipped, says socialite Debbie Bancroft. He's incredibly 
charming and handsome. He's an extraordinary package so I can see why people don't want to believe what 
they hear. If people come out of jail and are still successful, people are very forgiving, shockingly so. 
Renowned scientists whose research Epstein has generously funded through the years also stand by him. 
Professor Lawrence Krauss, a theoretical physicist and author of Quantum Man, has planned scientific 
conferences with Epstein in St. Thomas and remained close with him throughout his incarceration. If 
anything, the unfortunate period he suffered has caused him to really think about what he wants to do with his 
money and his time, and support knowledge, says Krauss. Jeffrey has surrounded himself with beautiful 
women and young women but they're not as young as the ones that were claimed. As a scientist I always judge 
things on empirical evidence and he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I've never seen anything 
else, so as a scientist, my presumption is that whatever the problems were I would believe him over other 
people. Though colleagues have criticized him over his relationship with Epstein, Krauss insists, I don't feel 
tarnished in any way by my relationship with Jeffrey; I feel raised by it.

>> Here is another that kind of wraps up my feelings about Trump

>> Raccoon's in your basement! An interesting analogy

>> You've been on vacation for two weeks, you come home, and your basement is infested with

raccoon's. Hundreds of rabid, messy, mean raccoon's have overtaken your basement. You want them gone
immediately so you hire a guy. A pro. You don't care if the guy smells, you need those raccoon's gone
pronto and he's the guy to do it! You don't care if the guy swears, you don't care if he's an alcoholic, you don't
care how many times he's been married, you don't care if he voted for Obama, you don't care if he has
plumber's crack...you simply want those raccoon's gone!

Soe

>> You want your problem fixed! He's the guy. He's the best. Period. That's why Trump. Yes he's a bit of
an ass, yes he's an egomaniac, but you don't care.

>> The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two-faced & gutless, illegal's are
everywhere. You want it all fixed! You don't care that Trump is crude, you don't care that he insults people,
you don't care that he had been friendly with Hillary, you don't care that he has changed positions, you don't
care that he's been married 3 times, you don't care that he fights with Megyn Kelly and Rosie O'Donnell, you
don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslin terrorist,...this country is weak, bankrupt, our
enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegal's, we are becoming a nation of victims where
every Tom, Ricardo and Hamad is a special interest group with special rights

>> to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in; “AND WE JUST
WANT IT FIXED” and Trump is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.

bis

>> You're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic Party, Republican Party, and sick of illegal's. You just
want this thing fixed. Trump may not be a saint, but doesn't have any lobbyist money influencing him, he
doesn't have political correctness restraining him, all you know is that he has been very successful, a good
negotiator, he has built a lot of things, and he's also not a politician, so he's not a cowardly politician. And he
says he'll fix it. You don't care if the guy has bad hair. You just want those raccoon's gone. Out of your house!

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016844.txt,"Dan Dennett is the philosopher of choice in the AI community. He is perhaps best
known in cognitive science for his concept of intentional systems and his model of human
consciousness, Which sketches a computational architecture for realizing the stream of
consciousness in the massively parallel cerebral cortex. That uncompromising
computationalism has been opposed by philosophers such as John Searle, David
Chalmers, and the late Jerry Fodor, who have protested that the most important aspects
of consciousness—intentionality and subjective qualia—cannot be computed.

Twenty-five years ago, I was visiting Marvin Minsky, one of the original AI
pioneers, and asked him about Dan. “He’s our best current philosopher—the next
Bertrand Russell,” said Marvin, adding that unlike traditional philosophers, Dan was a
student of neuroscience, linguistics, artificial intelligence, computer science, and
psychology: “He’s redefining and reforming the role of the philosopher. Of course, Dan
doesn’t understand my Society-of-Mind theory, but nobody’s perfect.”

Dan’s view of the efforts of AI researchers to create superintelligent AIs is
relentlessly levelheaded. What, me worry? In this essay, he reminds us that Als, above
all, should be regarded—and treated—as tools and not as humanoid colleagues.

He has been interested in information theory since his graduate school days at
Oxford. In fact, he told me that early in his career he was keenly interested in writing a
book about Wiener’s cybernetic ideas. As a thinker who embraces the scientific method,
one of his charms is his willingness to be wrong. Of a recent piece entitled “What Is
Information?” he has announced, “TI stand by it, but it’s under revision. I’m already
moving beyond it and realizing there’s a better way of tackling some of these issues.” He
will most likely remain cool and collected on the subject of AI research, although he has
acknowledged, often, that his own ideas evolve—as anyone ’s ideas should.

House Counsel joins. She is already in the mix as a possible next attorney
general, but, in fact, will withdraw from consideration in part to work with
Epstein.

Larry Summers wife, Elisa New, drops by. She teaches Americna
poetry at Harvard and is putting together a proposal for a series on poetry
that WGBH in Boston may produce and Epstein is advising on where she
might go for added support (he also makes mince meat of her budget).

Perhaps it’s just the ultimate feminist nightmare: Men (and a few
opportunistic women) continue to come to Epstein’s because, no matter their
public bows to modern manners, they simply don’t care that he offends
every aspect of feminist sensibility; when it comes to power, feminism
doesn’t count.

Or, it’s a guilty pleasure. People who know Jeffrey exchange
“Jeffrey” stories. “That’s Jeffrey,” says Mort Zuckerman, the real estate
billionaire and publisher of the Daily News (ever vitriolic in its coverage of
Epstein), with a twinkle in his eye and obvious enjoyment, to tales of
Epstein escapades. It is an outréness that Epstein seems delighted to
cultivate. In Epstein’s Paris apartment, 20,000 square feet on the Avenue
Foch, a neighborhood otherwise occupied by foreign potentates, there is a
stuffed baby elephant in his living room—that 1s, the elephant in the room.
The single book on his bedside table is Lotlita (he is, beyond the joke, a
great Nobokov fan).

Or, in a more sophisticated view, it’s a two tier understanding of the
world. There is a media version of the world, which most of us live in and
largely accept, and are certainly influenced by. And then there are those
people who live in the media itself and therefore know that it’s mostly bunk.
If the media says it, as likely some version of the opposite is true. I might
guess too that for many of his visitors there’s an order of identification: there
but for the grace of God. Any hyper-prominent person might, at any time,
run afoul of prosecutors, the political moment, the media, or the Internet hoi
polloi.

Epstein is the Dreyfus of the rich.

And then there is the glue of wealth. Once, at lunch in the Epstein
dinning room with Bill Richardson, the former Governor of New Mexico,
and past Presidential aspirant, when Epstein left the room for a few minutes,
I asked the obvious question, the one everybody asks each other, “How did
you meet Jeffrey?” Richardson seemed surprised: “Jeffrey,” he said, as

must make room for the equality of the sexes and the rights of
religious minorities. Property rights must be rooted in law and
protected by an independent judicial system. While governments
have a role in the economy, the mechanisms of the market must
ultimately be allowed to work their way.

We do not agree among ourselves about the proper sequence of these
changes. We know that in the short run, democratic voting
procedures may not produce liberal governments. We know that
demagogues and aspiring despots can use the language and even the
mechanisms of democracy to build personal dictatorships (Napoleon
III and Hugo Chavez, for example). We know that popular opinion is
sometimes more nationalistic than elite opinion and that gains for
democracy do not always lead to more foreign policy cooperation. In
most cases, progress toward stable and peaceful democratic
government comes slowly if it comes at all; even if you believe in
‘democratic peace theory, hoping that the democratization of other
countries will solve American foreign policy problems is a fool’s
game.

Yet we also know — or at least we believe — that in the long run a
more democratic world is a better if not always a safer world, and that
it would be immoral as well as impractical to stand in the way of the
changes that need to come.

If we add the conservative mission of the United States to the
revolutionary agenda, the problems of American foreign policy
become more complex still. We are trying to carry out a vast
reordering of global society even as we preserve the stability of the
international political order: we are trying to walk blindfolded on a
tightrope across Niagara Falls — while changing our clothes.

The uncertainties and risks that surround us should not be
underestimated. There has never been a worldwide revolution of this
kind before; nobody knows for sure how best to speed the plow.

wrote in his book that the ability of Russian intelligence to conceal
this penetration for more than half a century “broke the record for
secret keeping.”

This Russian ability to penetrate U.S. intelligence was not entirely
defeated by America’s implementation of more sophisticated secu-
rity procedures, such as the polygraph examination and extensive
background checks. In 1995, eleven years before Snowden joined it,
the CIA’s inspector general completed a study of the KGB’s use of
false defectors to mislead the U.S. government from the end of the
Cold War in the late 1980s through the mid-1g990s. It found Rus-
sia had dispatched at least half a dozen double agents who provided
misleading information to their CIA case officers.

Because the KGB operation went undetected for nearly a decade,
the disinformation prepared in Moscow had been incorporated into
reports (which had a distinctive blue stripe to signify their impor-
tance) that had been provided to Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush,
and Bill Clinton. Even more shocking, in tracing the path of this
disinformation, the inspector general found that the “senior CIA

© officers responsible for these reports had known that some of their ©
sources for this information were controlled by Russian intelli-
gence,” yet they did not inform the president and officials receiving
the blue-striped reports that they included Russian misinformation.
What the CIA director John Deutch called “an inexcusable lapse”
also reflected a form of institutional willful blindness in U.S. intel-
ligence, borne out of a bureaucratic fear of career embarrassment so
well described in Le Carré’s spy novels. Detecting intelligence fail-
ures has, if anything, become even more difficult in the age of the
anonymous Internet.

The Snowden breach demonstrated the NSA had few if any fail-
safe defenses against would-be leakers of communications intelli-
gence. In the new domain of cyber warfare, conventional defensive
rules do not apply. “There are no rivers or hills up here. It’s all flat.
All advantage goes to the attacker,” General Hayden said in an inter-
view in 2015 with the publisher of The Wall Street Journal. His point
was that because there are no defensive positions, the United States
in cyber warfare must rely on an aggressive offensive. If fully suc-
cessful, such an offensive would so deeply penetrate the defenses of

she said..'Very good!' 
Who said, 'Government of the People, by the People, for the People, shall 
not perish from the Earth?' 
Again, no response except from Little Hodiaki, 'Abraham Lincoln, 1863'.. 
'Excellent!', said the teacher continuing, 'let's try one a bit More difficult.: 
Who said, 'Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country?' 
Once again, Hodiaki's was the only hand in the air and he said;'John F. Kennedy, 1961'. 
The teacher snapped at the class, 'Class, you should be ashamed of yourselves, Little Hodiaki isn't from this 
country and he knows more about our history than you do.' 
She heard a loud whisper: fuck the Japs,' 
'Who said that? I want to know right now!' she angrily demanded. 
Little Hodiaki put his hand up, 'General MacArthur, 1945.' 
At that point, a student in the back said, 'I'm gonna puke.' 
The teacher glares around and asks, 'All right!!! Now who said that!?'

Again, Little Hodiaki says, 'George Bush to the Japanese Prime Minister,1991.' 
Now furious, another student yells, 'Oh yeah? Suck this!' 
Little Hodiaki jumps out of his chair waving his hand and shouts to the teacher, 
'Bill Clinton, to Monica Lewinsky, 1997!' 
Now with almost mob hysteria someone said, 'You little shit. If you say anything else, I'll kill you.' 
Little Hodiaki frantically yells at the top of his voice,'Michael Jackson to the child witnesses testifying against 
him, 2004.' 
The teacher fainted. 
As the class gathered around the teacher on the floor, someone said,'Oh shit, We're screwed!'

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020001.txt,"target of a renewed and eager cultivation by, with quite some irony, both Blair and
Murdoch. Lacking a circle of influence in almost all of the many areas of government with
which he was now involved, Kushner was both susceptible to cultivation and more than a
little desperate for the advice his cultivators had to offer. Blair, now with philanthropic,
private diplomatic, and varied business interests in the Middle East, was particularly intent
on helping shepherd some of Jared’s Middle East initiatives.

In February, Blair visited Kushner in the White House.

On this trip, the now freelance diplomat, perhaps seeking to prove his usefulness to this
new White House, mentioned a juicy rumor: the possibility that the British had had the
Trump campaign staff under surveillance, monitoring its telephone calls and other
communications and possibly even Trump himself. This was, as Kushner might
understand, the Sabbath goy theory of intelligence. On the Sabbath, observant Jews could
not turn on the lights, nor ask someone else to turn on the lights. But if they expressed the
view that it would be much easier to see with light, and if a non-Jew then happened to turn
them on, that would be fine. So although the Obama administration would not have asked
the British to spy on the Trump campaign, the Brits would have been led to understand
how helpful it might be if they did.

It was unclear whether the information was rumor, informed conjecture, speculation, or
solid stuff. But, as it churned and festered in the president’s mind, Kushner and Bannon
went out to CIA headquarters in Langley to meet with Mike Pompeo and his deputy
director Gina Haspel to check it out. A few days later, the CIA opaquely reported back that
the information was not correct; it was a “miscommunication.”

OOK Ok

Politics had seemed to become, even well before the age of Trump, a mortal affair. It was
now zero-sum: When one side profited, another lost. One side’s victory was another’s
death. The old notion that politics was a trader’s game, an understanding that somebody
else had something you wanted—a vote, goodwill, old-fashioned patronage—and that in

Curiously, for a man who seemed to have led a movement based in anger and
retribution, Trump was very much (or believed he was very much) a politician of the old
stripe—a let’s-work-it-out guy. You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours. He was, in his
mind, the ultimate tactician, always knowing what the other guy wanted.

Steve Bannon had pressed him to invoke Andrew Jackson as his populist model, and
he had loaded up on Jackson books (they remained unread). But his real beau ideal was
Lyndon Johnson. LBJ was a big man who could knock heads, do deals, and bend lesser
men to his will. Trade it out so in the end everyone got something, and the better
dealmaker got a little more. (Trump did not, however, appreciate the irony of where

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019858.txt,"Supreme Court Rejects Newman Requirement of “Pecuniary or Similarly Valuable” Personal
Benefit for Insider Trading Liability for Tipping Family and Friends (continued from page 2)

The Supreme Court affirmed Salman's conviction,
holding that a gift of inside information to family or
friends is sufficient to prove a “personal benefit”
for insider trading tipping liability. The Court rea-
soned that such a gift can be inferred to “provide
the equivalent of a cash gift.”* Specifically, the
Court reasoned that if the tipper personally traded
on inside information himself for a profit, but gave
the proceeds to his brother, the tipper received a
personal benefit (cash) and is liable for insider
trading. So, it reasoned, where a tipper achieves
effectively the same result by gifting the informa-
tion to his brother with the expectation that the
brother will trade on the information to obtain a
cash profit, the result should be the same.

Importantly, the Supreme Court explicitly stated
that it was narrowing the Second Circuit’s land-
mark Newman decision. It stated, “[t]o the extent
the Second Circuit held that the tipper must also
receive something of a ‘pecuniary or similarly
valuable nature’ in exchange for a gift to family
or friends,... we agree with the Ninth Circuit that
this requirement is inconsistent with Dirks,” a prior
Supreme Court ruling.’ This significantly lowers the
standard of proof for insider trading tipping liability
in cases involving family or friends. The govern-
ment often cannot find evidence of money or a sim-
ilarly valuable quid pro quo between the tipper and
tippee in insider trading cases. So it is much easier
to prove a case of insider trading by arguing that
the exchange of information was a “gift,” which

essentially only requires some evidence (even cir-
cumstantial evidence such as phone logs) that the
tipper gave information to the tippee.

So where does this leave the Newman decision?
The Newman decision itself was not overturned by
the Supreme Court, because Newman also relied
on the lack of proof that the tippees who traded on
inside information knew that the tippers provided

.

inside information in exchange for a personal ben-
efit—especially since the tippees were several
steps removed from the original tippers. In addi-
tion, Newman's “pecuniary or similarly valuable”
benefit test should still apply to cases that do not
involve tipping family or friends.

Nevertheless, the Sa/man decision tips the scales
back in favor of the government in tipping insider
trading cases. The SEC and federal prosecutors
have shown in the past that they will bring cases

of “friendship.” And they will bring insider trad-

per, director of national intelligence, justified the secret intelligence
budget by saying in an open session of Congress, “We are bolstering
our support for clandestine SIGINT [signals intelligence] capabilities
to collect against high priority targets, including foreign leadership
targets,” and to develop “groundbreaking cryptanalytic capabilities
to defeat adversarial cryptography and exploit Internet traffic.” It
was no secret to Congress, even before Snowden, that the NSA was
attempting to monitor the Internet. What was a closely held secret
before Snowden revealed it was that the NSA had found a way in
2007 to intercept Internet traffic before it was encrypted.

Through all this tumult, the heart of the NSA’s activity remained
its five-thousand-acre base at Fort Meade, Maryland. It commanded
the most powerful mechanism for intercepting communications that
the world had ever seen. No other country came close to its tech-
nology for intercepting information. The NSA not only was able to
intercept secret information from potential adversaries but also—at
least until the Snowden breach—managed to conceal these means
from them. As long as these adversaries remained blind to the ways

© in which their communications were being intercepted, deciphered, ®
and read by the NSA, they could not take effective countermeasures.
Consequently, the NSA had the capability to provide the president
and his advisers with continuous insights into the thinking and
planning of potential enemies.

Keeping its sources and methods secret was no easy task. The
NSA’s technicians had to deal with continuous technical challenges
to provide a seamless harvesting of data from a wide range of com-
munication devices, including telephones, computers, and the Inter-
net. It required continuous intra-agency communications between
the NSA’s own intelligence officers and a growing number of civilian
technicians. It even had its own “ Wiki-style” network through which
they could discuss problems, called the NSANet. Because it could
not tightly control access to this technical network, it expunged any
mention of the sources and methods from the material circulated on
the classified NSA network. Instead, it stored them in discrete com-
puters, called compartments, which were disconnected from other
computers at the NSA. These compartments could only be accessed
by a limited number of analysts and NSA executives who had a need

credit that he believed solely to be his. Both he and Kushner, the two most important
figures in the White House after the president, seemed professionally mute. Still, Bannon
seemed to be everywhere, and the president was convinced—trightly—that it was the result
of Bannon’s private press operation. More often than self-mockery could sustain, Bannon
referred to himself as “President Bannon.” A bitter Kellyanne Conway, regularly dissed
for her own spotlight grabbing, confirmed the president’s observation that Bannon stepped
into as many White House photo ops as possible. (Everybody seemed to keep count of
everybody else’s photo bombs.) Bannon also did not much bother to disguise his
innumerable blind quotes, nor to make much of an effort to temper his not-so-private slurs
against Kushner, Cohn, Powell, Conway, Priebus, and even the president’s daughter
(often, most especially, the president’s daughter).

Curiously, Bannon never expressed a sideways thought about Trump—not yet.
Trump’s own righteousness and soundness was perhaps too central to Bannon’s construct
of Trumpism. Trump was the idea you had to support. This could seem to approach the
traditional idea of respecting the office. In fact, it was the inverse. The man was the vessel:
there was no Bannon without Trump. However much he might stand on his unique, even
magical-seeming, contributions to the Trump victory, Bannon’s opportunity was wholly
provided by Trump’s peculiar talent. He was no more than the man behind the man—
Trump’s Cromwell, as he put it, even though he was perfectly aware of Cromwell’s fate.

But his loyalty to the idea of Trump hardly protected him from the actual Trump’s
constant briefs against him. The president had assembled a wide jury to weigh Bannon’s
fate, putting before it, in an insulting Borscht Belt style, a long list of Bannon’s
annoyances: “Guy looks homeless. Take a shower, Steve. You’ve worn those pants for six
days. He says he’s made money, I don’t believe it.” (The president, notably, never much
took issue with Bannon’s policy views.) The Trump administration was hardly two months
old, yet every media outlet was predicting Bannon’s coming defenestration.

One particularly profitable transaction with the president was to bring him new, ever
harsher criticism of his chief strategist, or reports of other people criticizing him. It was
important to know not to say anything positive to Trump about Bannon. Even faint praise
before the “but’”—“Steve is obviously smart, but ...”—could produce a scowl and pout if
you didn’t hurry to the “but.” (Then again, saying anyone was “smart” invariably incurred
Trump’s annoyance.) Kushner enlisted Scarborough and Brzezinski in something of a
regular morning television Bannon slag-a-thon.

H. R. McMaster, the three-star general who had replaced Michael Flynn as National
Security Advisor, had secured the president’s pledge that he could veto members of the
NSC. Kushner, a supporter of McMaster’s appointment, had quickly ensured that Dina
Powell, a key player in the Kushner faction, would join the NSC and Bannon would be
removed.

»> PREFACE TO THE EXPANDED AND
UPDATED EDITION

Tie 4-Hour Workweek was turned down by 26 out of 27 publishers.

After it was sold, the president of one potential marketing partner, a large bookseller, e-mailed me
historical bestseller statistics to make it clear—this wouldn’t be a mainstream success.

So I did all I knew how to do. I wrote it with two of my closest friends in mind, speaking directly to
them and their problems—problems I long had—and I focused on the unusual options that had worked
for me around the world.

I certainly tried to set conditions for making a sleeper hit possible, but I knew it wasn’t likely. I hoped
for the best and planned for the worst.

May 2, 2007, I receive a call on my cell phone from my editor.
“Tim, you hit the list.”

It was just past 5 P.M. in New York City, and I was exhausted. The book had launched five days
before, and I had just finished a series of more than twenty radio interviews in succession, beginning at 6
A.M. that morning. I never planned a book tour, preferring instead to “batch” radio satellite tours into 48
hours.

“Heather, I love you, but please don’t $4%* with me.”
“No, you really hit the list. Congratulations, Mr. New York Times bestselling author!”

I called a close friend of mine inquiring about the GV market and aircraft that are “not published”. As of today, there are
eight (8) of these aircraft that are not yet on the market.

in 1973.

Is there any wonder many of these men vote for Donald Trump — a “strong

man” who promises to do something about it?

But the top 5% — where the foxes are — gained income. Their wages are up

more than 50% over the same time.

Why?

Because they take more and more money from the rest of us.

He wrote several books on logic, illustrated with wonderful
problems involving fish, kittens, and gorillas - much less boring than the
brown, grass-eating cows of modern textbooks. Kittens and gorillas are
not usually in much contact, but I did find one hit on Google, pictured!
The words we organize into books, poems and plays are not just
a random jumble; they have structure and a logic to them. We group
verbs, subjects and objects together to form sentences and, at a larger
scale, characters have motivations and relationships: this character
loves that character, the valet had the candlestick in the ballroom and
could not have stabbed the butler in the kitchen, and so on. We have
dictionaries to define words, but to truly understand the information
they convey we need to understand the logical rules governing how they
can be combined.

A s well as giving us Alice, the Jabberwocky, and the Cheshire Cat,

Everyday conversation is fragmented and repetitive. Fortunately,
now and again, we say something definitive. For example, “This gorilla is
brown.” The statement links a property, ‘brownness; to a thing, ‘a gorilla.
Logical statements are precise but often need to be put in context. IfI were
standing in a forest when I made my statement you must guess I mean the
nearest gorilla. The word “This implies nearness, but nearness is not well
defined. Better to be precise. “The gorilla I am closest to, measured by line
of sight distance is the Pantone shade dark brown? However, if I talked
like this all day I would not have many friends.

Logical Beginnings

The formal study of logic began in 3848c with the publication ofa treatise
called the Organon by the Greek philosopher Aristotle. A student of
Plato, Aristotle taught many of the famous leaders of his time, including
Alexander The Great. Ancient Greece was not some idyllic think tank. If
you annoyed the political establishment you might find yourself having
to leave town in a hurry. This happened to Aristotle after Plato’s death,
and he spent nearly a decade touring Europe. Eventually, he returned to
Athens where he published his study on logic.

In the Organon, Aristotle examined groups of up to four statements,
each containing up to four relationships. For example: All kittens eat fish.
Some kittens eat fish. No kittens love gorillas. No gorillas eat kittens -
luckily. It is possible to put two statements back to back and infer things.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026841.txt,"than ever before. Nor is this an accident-because despite Samuel
Huntington's foreboding, what has occurred over recent generations is not a
clash of civilizations but a fusion of civilizations.

To put it simply, the great world civilizations, which used to have detached
and separate identities, now have increasingly overlapping areas of
commonality. Most people around the world now have the same aspirations
as the Western middle classes: they want their children to get good
educations, land good jobs, and live happy, productive lives as members of
stable, peaceful communities. Instead of feeling depressed, the West should
be celebrating its phenomenal success at injecting the key elements of its
worldview into other great civilizations.

The march of reason, triggered in the West by the Enlightenment, is
spreading globally, leading to the emergence of pragmatic problem-solving
cultures in every region and making it possible to envisage the emergence of
a stable and sustainable rules-based order. There is every reason to believe,
moreover, that the next few decades can be even better for humanity than
the last few-so long as the West does not lose confidence in its core values
and retreat from global engagement. The greatest danger of the current
pessimism, therefore, is that it might become a self-fulfilling prophecy,
leading to fear and withdrawal rather than attempts to reinvigorate the
existing global system.

The origins of the contemporary era lie in the West's transformation during
the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and the Industrial Revolution. No
other civilization can take credit for giving birth to modernity. This was not
done with some benign intent to uplift humanity in general; there were
many problems along the way, and the explosion of Western power across
the globe had some terrible consequences for other cultures and regions. Yet
the ultimate result was the diffusion of a modern outlook that relies on
science and rationality to solve problems, much to the ultimate benefit of
the planet's population.

As recently as half a century ago, for example, there was a global clash of
economic ideologies. Nikita Khrushchev, the former leader of the Soviet
Union, could claim that the state was better at delivering basic goods to
citizens than free markets were, but today such a view would be laughed at.
The market economy has made Chinese and Indian workers today far more
productive than they were under Mao Zedong or Jawaharlal Nehru, India's
first prime minister. Societies now accept the simple fact that workers need
material incentives to be productive, which has led to increased dignity and
self-worth. The vast majority of humanity is literate, is at least somewhat
mobile, and has access to the world's store of existing knowledge. Around
half of the adults in the world own a smartphone, and there are now more
connected mobile devices in total than there are people on the planet.

The spread of science and technology, meanwhile, has also improved human
dignity and well-being. Most people used to experience lives that were nasty,

Comparison of a three-year average of the concentrations of Primary and Secondary Drinking
Water Standards from the City’s annual compliance monitoring events (circa 2006, 2007, and
2008) to the results from HSA’s November 2008 distribution system tap sampling reveals
relative equivalence with irrelevant differences between select parameters concentrations since
the averaged City results are less than respective MCLs (see Table 1).

With the exception of the occasional spike in concentrations of DBPRs (and corresponding
stronger taste of chlorine in the delivered drinking water) resulting from the City’s need to
increase the application of sanitizing chemicals (i.e. chlorine) to treat supply water, HSA
concludes that the quality of the potable water product delivered to the Town by the City meets
or beats the criteria for the standards established under rule 62-550, F.A.C.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026699.txt,"Sovereigns see potential in Indian private markets
Despite tactical switching between developed
markets, increasing investment into emerging markets
remains a long-term strategic objective for many
sovereigns (as stated in our 2016 report). Stock
markets have relatively small coverage of emerging
market economies, driving greater emphasis on
illiquid real asset categories. In fact, many sovereigns
use infrastructure deals to manage near-term macro
and geopolitical risk, as outlined in our 2015 study.
However, challenging placement dynamics and
uncertainty over commodity prices mean sovereigns
are being more selective in their emerging market
investments, focusing on the identification of high-
growth markets.

While many emerging markets have struggled with
slow commodity price recovery and political instability,
India has experienced consistent growth in GDP (figure
11). However, India’s economic structure is complex
and publicly listed investments have relatively low
coverage of the wider economy (with stock market
capitalisation 65% of GDP in India, relative to 146% in
the US and 112% in the Uk). Indeed, many sovereigns
are focusing on opportunities within Indian private
equity (as seen in India’s increasing private sector
attractiveness in figure 12), seeking returns from its
rapid urbanisation.

Typically, in emerging markets sovereigns have
faced considerable regulatory and governance
challenges to direct private equity investment, leading
them to seek assistance from external managers.
However, in 2016 India introduced reforms to foreign
direct investment, loosening government restrictions
on investment in certain sectors, with wider reform
expected in 2017. This has enabled large investment
and liability sovereigns to invest heavily in Indian
private equity, and many funds are developing internal
management expertise based in India to have greater
access and control over private equity investments.

Despite sovereign desire to invest directly in Indian
private equity, the development of local management
capability is often complex and deployment of assets
to meet targets will be lengthy. While concerns
remain over governance and liquidity of private equity
investments in emerging markets, sovereigns note
that local management teams are best equipped to
deal with these concerns.

cultivation of such a ruthlessly skeptical approach morally repugnant, and we can
anticipate that even the most proficient system-users would occasionally succumb to the
temptation to “befriend” their tools, if only to assuage their discomfort with the execution
of their duties. No matter how scrupulously the AI designers launder the phony “human”
touches out of their wares, we can expect novel habits of thought, conversational gambits
and ruses, traps and bluffs to arise in this novel setting for human action. The comically
long lists of known side effects of new drugs advertised on television will be dwarfed by
the obligatory revelations of the sorts of questions that cannot be responsibly answered
by particular systems, with heavy penalties for those who “overlook” flaws in their
products. It is widely noted that a considerable part of the growing economic inequality
in today’s world is due to the wealth accumulated by digital entrepreneurs; we should
enact legislation that puts their deep pockets in escrow for the public good. Some of the
deepest pockets are voluntarily out in front of these obligations to serve society first and
make money secondarily, but we shouldn’t rely on good will alone.

We don’t need artificial conscious agents. There is a surfeit of natural conscious
agents, enough to handle whatever tasks should be reserved for such special and
privileged entities. We need intelligent tools. Tools do not have rights, and should not
have feelings that could be hurt, or be able to respond with resentment to “abuses” rained
on them by inept users.'* One of the reasons for not making artificial conscious agents is
that however autonomous they might become (and in principle, they can be as
autonomous, as self-enhancing or self-creating, as any person), they would not—without
special provision, which might be waived—share with us natural conscious agents our
vulnerability or our mortality.

I once posed a challenge to students in a seminar at Tufts I co-taught with
Matthias Scheutz on artificial agents and autonomy: Give me the specs for a robot that
could sign a binding contract with you—not as a surrogate for some human owner but on
its own. This isn’t a question of getting it to understand the clauses or manipulate a pen
on a piece of paper but of having and deserving legal status as a morally responsible
agent. Small children can’t sign such contracts, nor can those disabled people whose
legal status requires them to be under the care and responsibility of guardians of one sort
or another. The problem for robots who might want to attain such an exalted status is
that, like Superman, they are too invulnerable to be able to make a credible promise. If
they were to renege, what would happen? What would be the penalty for promise-
breaking? Being locked in a cell or, more plausibly, dismantled? Being locked up is
barely an inconvenience for an AI unless we first install artificial wanderlust that cannot
be ignored or disabled by the AI on its own (and it would be systematically difficult to
make this a foolproof solution, given the presumed cunning and self-knowledge of the
AI); and dismantling an AI (either a robot or a bedridden agent like Watson) is not killing
it, if the information stored in its design and software is preserved. The very ease of
digital recording and transmitting—the breakthrough that permits software and data to be,

fean Lue,

lam really sorry you feel so bad and { know it has been a mental and psychological frustration. As you
know | chose to partner with you due to your reputation in the business for being a top scout and
developing a couple world class agencies in the past. | knew what you could bring and | knew what |
could bring and contribute and | thought it would be a great partnership. Clearly, | never expected to
have the level of challenges we have had recruiting new models over the last several years. | could have
never foreseen the problem of your friendship with Jeffrey Epstein turning into the situation it has
where you are seen as guilty by association when you have never done anything or even been convicted
ofacrime. Frankly, | don’t understand the necessity for Conchita Sarnoff or anyone else to continue to
defame your name and MC? by asscciation.

It is true that we constantly have to justify ourselves when recruiting new models. The industry is
extremely competitive and as a parent myself if faced by the same information and having to make a
tough decision between too agencies | would not pick MC2 if | saw the article online about you. You
have to read closely to see there is not a charge against you but the implication is strong and of course
now days everyone believes everything they read online even more than the traditional newspapers of
the past.

| know you are now feeling like a liability to MC2. But you personally are not a liability to MC2 but this
published information online is a liability. We are not a large enough company, nor do we have the
capacity to fight this on a global level. On a google search in America we have put enough information
online to not have it popping up so blatantly but we have no controls over the rest of the world or the
finances to control this situation and we are affected as every major model agency recruits it’s best
models from all the various countries abroad. This has stunted our growth and our billing over the past
6 or 7 years. In fact, we do not even know who avoids us based on finding this information. | have been
surprised how challenging it is for us to grow due to this problem.

| have also had a tremendous amount of worries from our clients that we are vendors for that are large
American corporations likes Kohls, JC Penney, Sears, Nordstrom, Target, Neiman Marcus, Macys, Saks,
Belk, and so forth that require vendor agreements and for us to be considered an upstanding

Did you ever consider that Loudoun was a target? That your community was induced to walk it's own

Because now child exploitation is deeply embedded within your community with your own people

this very system that will be used to take the futures of your Loudoun children (see more of the

Mubarak family’s attempt to turn Egypt into a family possession.
The Army has ruled Egypt since the overthrow of King Farouk,
playing liberals and religious conservatives off against each other. It
looks set to go on doing that for some time to come. In Yemen,
Bahrain and Syria, the counsel of the idealists seems dark and
confused. US policy overall seems to have found the ‘sour spot’ that
is the particular curse of the Obama administration: too friendly to
the revolt to earn the trust and gratitude of the despots, too cautious
and compromising to win many friends on the street.

Overall I am more cautious than optimistic about where the Arab
Spring is headed. There is little prospect for the kind of rapid
economic growth that could improve the prospects for young
unemployed and underemployed Arabs. Foreign investment and
tourism have already been badly hit by the unrest of the last six
months, and the Arab regimes are turning to aid donors and
organizations like the IMF and the World Bank in increasing
desperation.

Culturally, many of the necessary preconditions are not in place. The
poor quality of most Arab universities, the limited access to serious
political history and discourse among all but a handful of Arab
intellectuals, the suppression of political life under past dictatorships,
the weakness of Islamic political thought in recent centuries and the
absence of a robust and deeply rooted tradition of Islamic democracy
all work against the rapid widespread development of stable liberal
democracy in the Arab world.

Putting the dark economic outlook together with the problematic
cultural and political situation makes optimism a tough position to
hold. Without in any way scanting or minimizing the idealism,
dedication and vision of the democrats rising in the Arab world
today, they still seem a long way from winning. They remind me still
of the Marquis de Lafayette during the French Revolution: they

DP: The modern era for Muslims began with Napoleon’s invasion of
Egypt in 1798. Muslims experienced a great shock at seeing how
advanced the blue-eyed peoples from the north had become. It would be
roughly analogous to the Eskimos coming down south and decimating
Westerners, who would uncomprehendingly ask in response, “Who are
these people and how are they defeating us?”

TB: So how did they respond?

DP: Muslims over the past 200 years have made many efforts to figure out
what went wrong. They have experimented with several answers. One was
to emulate liberal Europe—Britain and France—until about 1920. Another
was to emulate illiberal Europe—Germany and Russia—until about 1970.
The third was to go back to what are imagined to be the sources of Islamic
strength a millennium ago, namely the application of Islamic law. That’s
Islamism. It’s a modern phenomenon, and it’s making Muslims the center
of world unrest.

TB: But it is also creating discomfort?
DP: It has terribly deleterious effects on Muslims. Many of them are put

off by Islam. In Iran, for example, one finds a lot of alienation from Islam
as a result of the Islamist rule of the last 30-odd years.

TB: Has it happened anywhere else?

DP: One hears reports, especially from Algeria and Iraq, of Muslims
converting to Christianity. And in an unprecedented move, ex-Muslims
living in the West have organized with the goal of becoming a political
force. I believe the first such effort was the Centraal Comité voor Ex-
moslims in the Netherlands, but now it’s all over the place.

TB: Nonetheless, Islam has lasted for 1,500 years.

DP: Yes, but modern Islamism has been around only since the 1920s, and
I predict it will not last as a world-threatening force for more than a few
decades. Will Muslims leave the faith or simply stop practicing it? These
are the sort of questions I expect to be current before long.

TB: What about Islam in the United States?

"
IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011510.txt,"the summer of 1956, Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal, which had been
owned by the British and French.

Ben-Gurion was emboldened to go war by the fact that both Britain and
France wanted to retake the canal. Under an agreement reached beforehand,
Israel was to begin the hostilities, after which the British and French would
enter under the guise of separating Israeli and Egyptian forces. Ben-Gurion’s
hope was to end the threat of fedayeen strikes, at least in the south, by taking
control both of Gaza and the enormous natural buffer afforded by the Sinai
Desert. Militarily, it went to plan. On October 29, 1956, Yigal and other
paratroopers from Battalion 890 were dropped deep into the Sinai. They landed
near the entrance to the Mitla Pass, a sinuous route between two lines of craggy
hills 25 miles from the canal. British and French air strikes began three days
later. Nasser pulled most of his forces back across the canal. By early
November, Israel was in control of Gaza and the whole of the Sinai.

Politically, however, Ben-Gurion and his European partners had
catastrophically miscalculated. Britain and France were fading imperial powers.
The balance of power after the Second World War rested with America and the
Soviet Union. Both were furious over the obviously pre-arranged seizure of
Sinai, Gaza and the canal. It took a while for the message to sink in. In a speech
to the Knesset after the conquest was complete, Ben-Gurion declared the post-
1948 armistice null and void, and said Israel would never again allow “foreign
forces” to control the territory it had captured.

A few days later, however, he had no choice but to deliver a different
message in a radio address to the country. He had at least managed to secure a
concession with the help of the Americans. The Sinai and Gaza would be placed
under supervision of a UN force. He also got a US assurance of Israel’s right of
passage through the Straits of Tiran to the Red Sea, and an agreement that if the
Egyptians blocked Israeli shipping we would have the right to respond. But he
announced that we would be leaving every inch of territory taken in the war. By
early 1957, we did so. The one lasting gain came in Gaza. On their way out,
Israeli troops destroyed the fedayeen’s military installations, and cross-border
attacks from the south ceased.

Unlike in 1948, the Sinai War touched me directly. I never felt Israel’s
existence was in danger. The fighting was brief and far away. But Mishmar
Hasharon had a small role in the war plan. Ben-Gurion and Dayan were
concerned that the co-ordinated attack might lead to a wider war, with the
possibility that Egyptian warplanes might get involved as they had in 1948.

reaction to Jack Ma's prediction and
do you agree?

RLK: The public stance of China has
to be strong. The legitimacy of the
government and of the Communist
Party is based on two primary
factors. One is the economic
development.

RLK: China is celebrating this year
40 years of reform and opening up
really having created an economic
miracle, an astonishing 50 times
increase of GDP per capita. So that
has been terrific. The second area is
national pride and national
rejuvenation. And frankly, China as
almost every other country, if the
two come into conflict, the latter
has to prevail, especially in China
with a history of 100 years of
bullying, as they say, by foreign
powers, mostly Western, and then
of course Japan.

i

>> Donald Trump is a genuine phenomenon. He may or may not become the Republican nominee for
president. He may or may not win the presidency even if he becomes the nominee. Yet it is clear that he is
a phenomenon and that any history of the 2016 presidential race will have to spend a good bit of time
analyzing Trump and his impact.

bas

>> From the time he announced on June 16, Trump has dominated social and mainstream media. He
dominates the conversation despite the lack of paid advertising. Trump says outrageous things and his
supporters shrug it off. At every turn, his poll numbers continue to rise.

>>

>> As a step toward understanding this amazing performance, I spent part of the Christmas break reading
his first bestseller, ‘The Art of the Deal’. Written in 1987, this book is a classic among American business
books and has influenced a generation of entrepreneurs. Trump wrote ‘The Art of the Deal’ when he was
41 years old and having a successful run. The book’s popularity contributed to Time Magazine’s decision
to feature Donald Trump on its cover in January 1989.

>

>> The portrait that emerges from this easy-to-read and remarkably interesting book is of an aggressive,
ambitious person who is constantly pushing, constantly learning, and always seeking the next

challenge. Reporters and analysts who are trying to understand Trump would be well served by slowing
down and reading this nearly three-decade-old bestseller.

"
IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016878.txt,"concept of “Pareto-topia”: the idea that AI, if done right, can bring about a future in
which everyone ’s lives are hugely improved, a future where there are no losers. A key
realization here is that what chiefly prevents humanity from achieving its full potential
might be our instinctive sense that we’re in a zero-sum game—a game in which players
are supposed to eke out small wins at the expense of others. Such an instinct 1s seriously
misguided and destructive in a “game” where everything is at stake and the payoff is
literally astronomical. There are many more star systems in our galaxy alone than there
are people on Earth.

Hope

As of this writing, I’m cautiously optimistic that the Al-risk message can save humanity
from extinction, just as the Soviet-occupation message ended up liberating hundreds of
millions of people. As of 2015, it had reached and converted 40 percent of AI
researchers. It wouldn’t surprise me if a new survey now would show that the majority
of AI researchers believe AI safety to be an important issue.

I’m delighted to see the first technical Al-safety papers coming out of DeepMind,
OpenAI, and Google Brain and the collaborative problem-solving spirit flourishing
between the Al-safety research teams in these otherwise very competitive organizations.

The world’s political and business elite are also slowly waking up: AI safety has
been covered in reports and presentations by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers (IEEE), the World Economic Forum, and the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD). Even the recent (July 2017) Chinese AI
manifesto contained dedicated sections on “AI safety supervision” and “Develop[ing]
laws, regulations, and ethical norms” and establishing “an AI security and evaluation
system” to, among other things, “[e]nhance the awareness of risk.” I very much hope that
a new generation of leaders who understand the AI Control Problem and AI as the
ultimate environmental risk can rise above the usual tribal, zero-sum games and steer
humanity past these dangerous waters we are in—thereby opening our way to the stars
that have been waiting for us for billions of years.

Here’s to our next hundred thousand years! And don’t hesitate to speak the truth,
even if your voice trembles.

stewardesses bygone times).

At one point, sliding into the seat beside me, Geraldine Laybourne,
then the head of the Nickelodeon network, whispered, with more awe than
horror, “This could be the closest ve ever come to pure evil.” (One more
thing about this trip: Google founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, came
out to see the plane and, with a few other Googlers, literally ran whopping
from one end of the plan to the other. Then they described for Epstein, in
what I can not now remember as put on or entrepreneurial brainstorm, a
brand extension in which they would market a line of Google bras with the
Os as convenient cups.)

Not long after this trip, Epstein’s assistant called to invite me for tea at
his house in New York, where Epstein, with what seemed to me little
understanding of the subject, began to ask me about media—the upside,
downside, and nature of media coverage. This magazine was then soliciting
him for a profile, as was Vanity Fair, who had assigned the British tabloid
reporter, Vicki Ward, to the job.

Both profiles pivot on the Clinton connection and detail the same
quandary, how a man without clear institutional bona fides nevertheless
achieves wealth and influence. Ward, who would more recently assert in the
Daily Beast, that she was barred by Vanity Fair from writing about under-
age sex evidence (a fact that could be read the other way: Vanity Fair, even
looking to take down Epstein, did not find the evidence credible), went
down a rabbit hole of possible questionable contacts who might or might not
have been the source or sources for Epstein’s wealth, seemed to get no
closer to an answer, beyond confirming her own sense of dubiousness.

Epstein, sensing that he might be exposing himself, tried to stop the
process (Ward, well known for an operatic view about her reporting exploits,
says he threatened her), called Carter and said he was having second
thoughts about being a public figure.

“Then you should live in a two bedroom apartment in Queens,”
responded Carter.

And then the troubles began.

Epstein, in man-who-can-have-everything fashion, has, for many
years, ordered up a daily massage following his workout sessions.

“Often these were massage massages,” says Epstein matter of factly,
“but sometimes these were happy ending massages, especially in Palm
Beach, where there are many massage parlors—‘Jack Shacks,’ they’re
called—that do outcalls. There was no sex. An often there was no happy

what General Tzur really wanted to know. I think what he actually wanted to
gauge was whether / felt confident. He wanted to reassure himself he wasn’t
taking any more than the obvious risks in sending us, in Uri Ilan’s footsteps,
back into Syria. Fortunately, he didn’t ask whether I was sure we’d succeed. If
he had, I would have said, yes, we were prepared. But there was no way we
could be certain. Still, he must have got what he wanted. When we reached the
edge of Netanya, he shook my hand, wished me luck and went on his way.

The rest of the team was waiting at the crossroads for me to join them. Two
teams, in fact: mine, with whom Id be crossing into Syria in less than 10 hours’
time, and our hillutz, or back-up. A hillutz was always a part of sayeret
operations. The back-up group would stay on the Israeli side of the border. If we
got into trouble, they’d come in after us.

Even after my briefing for the chief of staff, we had one last stop to make on
the way north. It was at the headquarters of the army’s northern command. It
was in a Tegart fortress, one of dozens built by the British around the country,
with watchtowers on each corner of the outer walls. The northern commander
was an equally forbidding figure. Avraham Yoffe had served in the British
artillery in the Second World War and the Golani Brigade in 1948. He used to
joke with other officers that while they looked like a bunch of kids, he was the
only one with the true bearing of a general.

He must have been busy when we arrived, because we ended up hanging
around in the courtyard for nearly 20 minutes. Just as I was beginning to worry
that the timetable for what really mattered — our climb up onto the Golan — was
being put at risk, I noticed that off to the side was a beautifully polished jeep. I
assumed it belonged to General Yoffe, who was known to be an avid hunter and
would later become the head of Israel’s National Parks Authority. It had a
padlocked metal grill on the back which held two jerrycans of gasoline. Yori
Cohen, the commander of the back-up team, and I spotted the fuel containers at
the same time. We couldn’t help smiling. Yes, we were about to embark on an
operation which, assuming we didn’t fail, would finally give Israel real-time
intelligence from across our border for the first time since the 1950s. But we
were still Sayeret Matkal, still chronically short of gasoline for our field
exercises. And I still hadn’t forgotten how to pick a lock. As Yori stood guard, I
broke into the grill and removed the jerrycans, one for each of us, and closed it
again. Then, after briefing the general, we headed to our setting-off point. Yoffe
himself left to join Avraham Arnan and Meir Amit’s intelligence deputy,

preferential attachment, because Atoms with more links will tend to get more STI, and thus
will tend to get selected by more cognitive processes, which will cause them to grow more
links. For this reason, in most circumstances, a CogPrime system in which most link-building
cognitive processes rely heavily on ECAN to guide their activities will tend to contain a small-
world-network Atomspace. This is not rigorously guaranteed to be the case for any possible
combination of environment and goals, but it is commonsensically likely to nearly always be
the case.

One consequence of the small worlds structure of the Atomspace is that, in exploring other
properties of the Atom network, it is particularly important to look at the hub nodes. For
instance, if one is studying whether hierarchical and heterarchical subnetworks of the Atomspace
exist, and whether they are well-aligned with each other, it is important to look at hierarchical
and heterarchical connections between hub nodes in particular (and secondary hubs, etc.). A
pattern of hierarchical or dual network connection that only held up among the more sparsely
connected nodes in a small-world network would be a strange thing, and perhaps not that
cognitively useful.

15.3 Dual Network Structure

One of the key theoretical notions in patternist philosophy is that complex cognitive systems
evolve internal dual network structures, comprising superposed, harmonized hierarchical and
heterarchical networks. Now we explore some of the specific CogPrime structures and dynamics
militating in favor of the emergence of dual networks.

15.3.1 Hierarchical Networks

The hierarchical nature of human linguistic concepts is well known, and is illustrated in Figure
15.2 for the commonsense knowledge domain (using a graph drawn from WordNet, a huge con-
cept hierarchy covering 50K+ English-language concepts), and in Figure 15.4 for a specialized
knowledge subdomain, genetics. Due to this fact, a certain amount of hierarchy can be expected
to emerge in the Atomspace of any linguistically savvy CogPrime, simply due to its modeling
of the linguistic concepts that it hears and reads.

Hierarchy also exists in the natural world apart from language, which is the reason that many
sensorimotor-knowledge-focused AGI systems (e.g. DeSTIN and HTM, mentioned in Chapter
4 above) feature hierarchical structures. In these cases the hierarchies are normally spatiotem-
poral in nature - with lower layers containing elements responding to more localized aspects
of the perceptual field, and smaller, more localized groups of actuators. This kind of hierarchy
certainly could emerge in an AGI system, but in CogPrime we have opted for a different route.
If a CogPrime system is hybridized with a hierarchical sensorimotor network like one of those
mentioned above, then the Atoms linked to the nodes in the hierarchical sensorimotor network
will naturally possess hierarchical conceptual relationships, and will thus naturally grow hier-
archical links between them (e.g. InheritanceLinks and IntensionalInheritanceLinks via PLN,
AsymmetricHebbianLinks via ECAN).

Thanks for sending. A wide area of agreement, but not total. 
On confronting dogma, I of course agree — though in my opinion the secular religions — nationalist fanaticism, etc. — are 
much more dangerous. And if some find rational discussion offensive — as, for example, mainstream academics find 
dismantling myths of American exceptionalism or Israeli self-defense or Obama's mass murder campaign, etc., 
offensive — so be it. 
But I don't see why that should extend to ridicule. That includes astrologists. Astronomers can refute astrology, while 
recognizing that perfectly honest and deluded people may believe it and should be treated with respect, while their 
beliefs are confronted with evidence. I also don't see why we should ridicule religious dogma, just as I don't think we 
should ridicule the much more pernicious secular dogmas. Rather, we should respond to irrational belief with argument 
and evidence, while recognizing that their advocates (like most of the intellectual world in the case of secular dogma) 
are people who we should be responding to but without ridiculing them. It may be hard sometimes. For example, when 
the icon and founding father of sober non-sentimental Realism in International Affairs informs us that the US, unlike 
other countries, has a transcendental purpose, and the fact that it constantly acts in contradiction to its purpose 
doesn't matter because the facts are just abuse of history while real history is the evidence of history as our minds 
reflect it, then it's hard to avoid ridicule. But we should. There's no point ridiculing virtually the entire IR profession 
and the major journals, even though such extraordinary irrationality leads to major human disasters. 
On Davis, I frankly think that's a non-issue. If she decides she cannot do her job as the conditions of employment 
require (including following the law), then she can quit and look for another job. As in any other such case.

e “Did you ever have any physical contact with E.W.?”
e ‘What is the actual value that you contend the claim of E. W. against you has?”

The matters addressed in these questions were the central focus of Epstein’s claims
against Edwards. lEpstein’s refusal to answer these and literally every other
substantive question put to him in discovery deprived Edwards of even a basic
understanding of the evidence alleged to support claims against him and substantiated
Edwards’ position that no such evidence ever existed. Epstein’s case was doomed to
fail on the basis of the “sword and shield” doctrine alone. But other grounds were
equally and independently fatal to Epstein’s attempt to use the legal system to scare
Edwards into submission.

All of Edwards’ conduct in the prosecution of valid claims against Epstein was
protected by the absolute bar of the litigation privilege.

And most fundamentally, Epstein’s claims against Edwards were not only unsupported
by but also directly contradicted by all of the record evidence. From the beginning,
Edwards diligently represented three victims of sexual assaults perpetrated by Epstein.
Each and every one of Edwards’s litigation decisions was grounded in proper
litigation judgment about the need to pursue effective discovery against Epstein,
particularly in the face of Epstein’s stonewalling tactics. Edwards’s successful
representation finally forced Epstein to settle and pay appropriate damages. Effective
and proper representation of child victims who have been repeatedly sexually
assaulted cannot form the basis of a separate, “satellite” lawsuit, and therefore
Edwards was entitled to summary judgment on those grounds as well.

Facing these insurmountable obstacles, on the eve of the scheduled hearing on
Edwards’ Motion for Summary Judgment, Epstein dismissed all of his claims against
Edwards.

Put simply, Epstein made allegations that he knew were baseless, that he never
intended to try to support, and that were precluded as.a matter of well-established-law.
His lawsuit was merely a desperate measure by a Serial pedophile to prevent being
held accountable for repeatedly sexually abusing minor females. Epstein’s ulterior
motives in filing and prosecuting his lawsuit are blatantly obvious. Epstein's behavior
is another clear demonstration that he feels he lives above the law and that because of
his wealth he can manipulate the system and pay for lawyers to do his dirty work -
even to the extent of having them assert baseless claims against other members of the
Florida Bar. Epstein’s Complaint against Edwards was nothing short of a far-fetched,
fictional fairy-tale with absolutely no evidence whatsoever to support his preposterous

—LEWIS CARROLL, Alice in Wonderland

The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt
the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.

— GEORGE BERNARD SHAW, Maxims for Revolutionists

SPRING 2005 / PRINCETON , NEW JERSEY

I had to bribe them. What other choice did I have?

They formed a circle around me, and, while the names differed, the question was one and the same:
“What’s the challenge?” All eyes were on me.

My lecture at Princeton University had just ended with excitement and enthusiasm. At the same time, I
knew that most students would go out and promptly do the opposite of what I preached. Most of them
would be putting in 80-hour weeks as high-paid coffee fetchers unless I showed that the principles from
class could actually be applied.

Hence the challenge.

I was offering a round-trip ticket anywhere in the world to anyone who could complete an undefined
“challenge” in the most impressive fashion possible. Results plus style. I told them to meet me after class
if interested, and here they were, nearly 20 out of 60 students.

The task was designed to test their comfort zones while forcing them to use some of the tactics I teach.
It was simplicity itself: Contact three seemingly impossible-to-reach people—J.Lo, Bill Clinton, J. D.
Salinger, I don’t care—and get at least one to reply to three questions.

Of 20 students, all frothing at the mouth to win a free spin across the globe, how many completed the
challenge?

Exactly ... none. Not a one.

There were many excuses: “It’s not that easy to get someone to ...” “I have a big paper due, and ...”
“IT would love to, but there’s no way I can....” There was but one real reason, however, repeated over and
over again in different words: It was a difficult challenge, perhaps impossible, and the other students
would outdo them. Since all of them overestimated the competition, no one even showed up.

According to the rules I had set, if someone had sent me no more than an illegible one-paragraph
response, I would have been obligated to give them the prize. This result both fascinated and depressed
me.

The following year, the outcome was quite different.

I told the above cautionary tale and 6 out of 17 finished the challenge in less than 48 hours. Was the
second class better’? No. In fact, there were more capable students in the first class, but they did nothing.
Firepower up the wazoo and no trigger finger.

The second group just embraced what I told them before they started, which was ...

temporarily necessary, but always under the strict control of the political police in order
to avoid ideological contamination of the people and the excesses of which they are
capable. The government continues to uphold the supremacy of centralized planning
over the market, and the virtues of frugality and non-consumption.

If an entrepreneur wants to evaluate the country risk before investing anywhere, he
looks at the Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s ratings. According to these risk rating
companies, Cuba appears on the most dangerous fringe. There is a very long history of
arrests or simply noncompliance with obligations, and of re-financing which has turned
out to be useless. They haven’t been able to pay their debts due to a serious and basic
problem: Cuban society is very unproductive due to the collectivist economic system
that they have imposed on it, and because of the size and priorities of public
expenditures decided on by the government.

The Cuban State lacks substantial reserves, and barely generates sufficient income to
survive from month to month. This means that it does not have its own resources to
undertake the large public works that it needs, and it requires international loans in
order to confront them, which becomes a serious problem because it does not possess
reliable credit.

In Cuba there are no impartial courts to which one can resort in the case of a dispute of
civil law, much less criminal law. There is an absolute legal defenselessness in the face
of any conflict with the government or with a state-owned enterprise. The government,
according to its needs, arbitrarily pursues, imprisons, or releases any citizen, including
foreign businessmen with whom it has a dispute. In other words, the reverse of a true
State of Law. That circumstance can be testified to by dozens of persons, including the
Panamanian Simon Abadi, the Chilean Max Marambio, or the Canadian SArkis
Yacoubian.

Foreign businessmen located in Cuba live under the “not-so-discreet” surveillance of the
security forces, always in the paranoid search for the mythical and evil agent of the CIA.
Many of the Cuban officials and simple neighbors or potential friends don’t dare to link
themselves to foreign businessmen out of fear of losing the government’s trust, or are
forced to inform in writing about any voluntary or involuntary contact they’ve had with
them.

Cuba has not resolved the very important problem of currency. Officially, the dollar
exchange is approximately on a par with the Cuban peso. On the parallel market it’s 24
pesos to 1 dollar. Cubans collect in pesos, but the government sells to them in dollars,
which creates significant dissatisfaction and an obvious sense of injustice.

Salaries are very low (some USS24 a month), which determines the nonexistence of a
potential market of 11 million consumers. Cubans have the lowest purchasing power
per capita in Spanish-speaking America.

The banking system is insufficient and primitive. Dollar deposits — as has happened in
the recent past — may be frozen at the discretion of the government.

Bureaucracy is very slow and insecure. Officials don’t dare to make decisions, and the
instructions they receive are sometimes contradictory.

The hiring of workers is done through a state-owned company that charges investors in
dollars and pays in pesos to the Cubans assigned to these jobs. In the transaction, the
Cuban State keeps 94% of the salary. That practice contravenes international
agreements signed with the ILO.

For over half a century, Cubans have been accustomed to stealing from the State in
order to survive, by swelling on the black market the product of that theft. These habits

computer. The sophistication is achieved through reading and writing
many numbers in parallel, and chaining the steps together so that if you
read a particular number it triggers another read/write process, and so
on. I’m glossing over some details such as logical functions but, if you
know how a modern computer chip is constructed, my description is
not far off. Almost all logic today is implemented in tables to achieve the
speeds we expect from modern chips.

All modern computers are clocked. A small piece of quartz rock
has been polished, coated with metal, and wired up to a control circuit in
the computer. When you apply voltage to the rock it bends and absorbs
energy. When the voltage is taken away it bends back and gives out the
energy. This is effectively a pendulum and it can be used to make an
accurate clock. I used to design these for a living. Every logic gate in a
computer is connected to this clock, and each time the clock ticks the
logic gates in a computer compute.

Most modern computers are entirely synchronous. The clock rate
is set so that the gates in the computer fully recover by the time of the
next tick, and every gate is therefore ready in its standard position when
the next instruction arrives. The human brain does not have a central
clock. Each neuron acts independently — firing regardless of whether the
neurons it is adjacent to are ready or not. It is wrong to think of the brain
as digital. Each neuron does fire and recover, but it may be triggered again
before it fully recovers. This makes for a chaotic and essentially analogue
operation. If one neuron fires when a second has only half recovered, then
it gets half an effect. Ifthe neuron is 80% recovered, an 80% effect. Neuron
recovery time is quite long, perhaps as much as 1/1000 of a second, and
they are wired in three dimensions to as many as 10,000 other neurons.
It is perfectly possible for a set of neurons to run one ‘program’ when
they are rested and a completely different ‘program’ when they are 50%
recovered and yet another programs if triggered from different starting
locations. I have said ‘program, but arguing a brain runs a ‘prograny is
misleading. It is not organized like this.

Neural Networks

A neural network is our best attempt at a computer model for the human
brain. Each neuron is represented by an entry ina table. The entry records
all the connections to it, along with the strength of each connection —
these are called ‘weights. In some models the connections can be both

strike for the next day.

With the meeting over and the decision made, Trump, in a buoyant mood, came back to
chat with reporters traveling with him on Air Force One. In a teasing fashion, he declined
to say what he planned to do about Syria. An hour later, Air Force One landed and the
president was hustled to Mar-a-Lago.

The Chinese president and his wife arrived for dinner shortly after five o’clock and
were greeted by a military guard on the Mar-a-Lago driveway. With Ivanka supervising
arrangements, virtually the entire White House senior staff attended.

During a dinner of Dover sole, haricots verts, and thumbelina carrots—Kushner seated
with the Chinese first couple, Bannon at the end of the table—the attack on Al Shayrat
airfield was launched.

Shortly before ten, the president, reading straight off the teleprompter, announced that
the mission had been completed. Dina Powell arranged a for-posterity photo of the
president with his advisers and national security team in the makeshift situation room at
Mar-a-Lago. She was the only woman in the room. Steve Bannon glowered from his seat
at the table, revolted by the stagecraft and the “phoniness of the fucking thing.”

It was a cheerful and relieved Trump who mingled with his guests among the palm
trees and mangroves. “That was a big one,” he confided to a friend. His national security
staff were even more relieved. The unpredictable president seemed almost predictable.
The unmanageable president, manageable.

Fig. 138.2: Calvin’s Model of Distributed Attractors in the Brain

hypotheses interesting and highly promising, yet feel it is also important to separate out the
notion of glocal memory for separate consideration.

Regarding specifics, our suggestion is that Calvin’s approach may overemphasize the dis-
tributed aspect of memory, not giving sufficient due to the relatively localized aspect as ac-
counted for in the [QKIKF08] results discussed above. In Calvin’s glocal approach, global mem-
ories are attractors and local memories are parts of attractors. We suggest a possible alternative,
in which global memories are attractors and local memories are particular neuronal subnetworks
such as the specialized ones identified by [QIXIKF 08]. However, this alternative does not seem
contradictory to Calvin’s overall conceptual approach, even though it is different from the par-
ticular proposals made in [Cal96].

The above paragraphs are far from a complete survey of the relevant neuroscience literature;
there are literally dozens of studies one could survey pointing toward the glocality of various
sorts of human memory. Yet experimental neuroscience tools are still relatively primitive, and
every one of these studies could be interpreted in various other ways. In the next couple decades,
as neuroscience tools improve in accuracy, our understanding of the role of glocality in human
memory will doubtless improve tremendously.

mothers knew where they were.

‘One very young-looking girl was called Tila. I just thought, “You really shouldn’t be here”, but I made

myself switch off as I had no proof.’

The couple, who have been married for 24 years, still Island guest: Model Naomi Campbell stayed as a guest on

find it hard to comprehend that Epstein is a convicted °

sex offender.

‘He was a very kind man and, while I don’t approve of things he’s been accused of, I liked him very much,’

says Miles.

While Cathy says she was always suspicious about the girls’ ages, Miles insists: ‘I took the view that what
went on behind closed doors was not my business and it is not my place to judge. If anything was going on

we didn’t want to know.

‘Our job was about discretion. We have a clear conscience that we didn’t witness anything untoward.
Whatever went on at the other houses — and yes, we heard things from other members of staff — it didn’t,

to my knowledge, happen at our property.’

Miles also says that on several occasions he refused Epstein’s requests to smuggle female guests in by
boat, to circumvent the strict immigration policies of St Thomas, the island with authority over Little St

James, which would have meant logging names and passport numbers.

But he was aware that Epstein found others to do his bidding. For as the couple were told when they were

hired: ‘What Jeffrey wants, Jeffrey gets.’

The words came from Ghislaine Maxwell, who was then Epstein’s girlfriend. She flew to South Africa with
Andrew Shannon, a lawyer, to interview the Alexanders in 1998, after they had replied to a small ad for

‘management couple sought to run private island’.
After apparently passing the interview, they were invited to meet Epstein in New York.

‘It was very strange,’ said Miles. “We were taken by a driver to an office near Madison Square Garden. A
gentleman wearing a polo shirt and jeans stepped out of the lift, asked if we had a good trip, shook our
hands and left. That was it. Then Miss Maxwell came back and said we had the job.’

Ghislaine then took them to ‘the big house’ in Manhattan, which is said to have been the scene of sex

parties and where young girls were allegedly hired as playthings for Epstein’s wealthy male friends.

Epstein has a Web page on myspace.com that features one girl using the name Pimpin'
Made EZ.

Although no charges of witness tampering have been filed, the parents of at least one of
the teenage victims complained to police of being followed and intimidated by two men.
Police determined that their vehicles were registered to two private investigators. Mr.
Goldberger denied knowing anything about it.

Police also note in their reports that the state attorney's office offered Mr. Epstein a plea
deal that would have placed him on probation for five years, allowing him ultimately to
walk away with no criminal record at all.

I asked Mr. Krischer's spokesman, Mike Edmondson, why the case was referred to a
grand jury instead of Mr. Epstein being charged and facing a trial before a jury. And
shouldn't the victims' credibility be a factor to determine whether a crime's been
committed, not whether a jury will convict? (After all, as Mr. Goldberger told The Palm
Beach Post of Mr. Epstein, He's never denied girls came to the house.)

Especially, I asked Mr. Edmondson to explain: Why shouldn't the public look at this case
and think there are two kinds of justice - one for the wealthy and one for the rest of us?

Mr. Edmondson said he could not comment on the case because it is active, but on the
latter point, he offered, for the sake of philosophical debate: Whether wealth buys a
different standard of justice across the country ... the answer to that would, of course, be
yes.

But in this case, he said, regardless of the battery of attorneys, the outcome would be the
same. Every issue that was debated in public was debated in our office before this case
went to the grand jury.”

In this case, it is not the victims' credibility but the state attorney's that deserves
questioning.

AGREEMENTS

Certain key terms of the following incentive plans and employment agreements of the Company, which
are subject to and qualified in their entirety by reference to any underlying documentation as applicable,
are outlined below. Copies of such documentation have been provided or are available upon request and
the summaries below are quajified in their entirety by reference to such documentation.

15.4. Long Term Incentive Plan and Agreements of Knowledge Learning Corporation

Effective as of December 6, 2005, KLC put in place a long term incentive plan (LTIP) for officers,
employees or consultants, providing for incentive compensation payments based upon the achievement
of certain performance criteria determined by KLC’s Compensation Committee. Under the terms of the
long term incentive award agreements entered into with eligible recipients pursuant to the LTIP, if the
recipient is terminated by KLC without cause after the first year of any 3-year performance cycle, the first
of which begins in 2006, or upon death, permanent disability or retirement after the first 6 months of any
performance cycle, the recipient is eligible to receive a pro rata portion of any incentive award earned.
The recipient is also eligible to receive a pro rata portion of any incentive award earned in the event of a
sale of KLC or a termination of the LTIP.

15.2. Profits Interest Grants

KUE expects to grant profits interests in KUE to its (or its subsidiary’s) present and future officers,
directors, employees and consultants, aggregating up to 2% of KUE's aggregate profits, subject to
increases approved by the Independent Committee. Such grants would be dilutive to the holders of Units.

15.3. Stock Appreciation Rights Plan of Knowledge Schools, inc.

KSI established a stock appreciation rights (“SAR) plan for directors, officers, employees or consultants
of KS! and its subsidiaries on April 25, 2004, pursuant to which a maximum number of 18,410 phantom
shares (which may be converted to options) may be granted and an equivalent of 4,353.860 phantom
shares are issued and outstanding. SARs may be granted under the plan until April 24, 2014 and shall
vest and become exercisable as set forth in the holder's SAR agreement. These phantom shares will
provide the holders with the appreciation in value of the equivalent of 1.6% of KSI's equity (after payment
of $7.8 million to KLC’s departing chief executive officer in settlement of his SARs, and based on
273,904.89884 shares as of April 28, 2006). Beginning in 2006, incentive compensation at the KLC level
to management will be made through the LTIP described above, while directors of KSI may continue to be
granted SAR.

15.4. Stock Option Grants by Knowledge Schools, Inc.
Les Biller and Stephen Goldsmith have been granted options to purchase an aggregate of 3,412.6 shares
of common stock of KSI. Les Biller is on the Advisory Board of KUE and a director of KSI. Stephen

Goldsmith is the Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning & Worldwide Government Programs for KUE
and a director of KSI. KSI may issue similar options from time to time.

15.5. Employment Agreements

With one exception, the Company's executives do not have long-term employment agreements. KLC

to his religious base. In fact, the relationship between Hamas and al
Qaeda, and between Hamas and al Qaeda-like jihadists in Gaza, is far
more contentious. Zawahiri has blasted Hamas for adhering to
ceasefires with Israel, not immediately implementing Islamic law in
Gaza, and otherwise deviating from the pure faith of jihadism.

To prevent these ideas from eroding its support, Hamas has harshly
repressed al Qaeda-inspired jihadists in Gaza, arresting and even
torturing some of the individuals linked to these groups, according to
Israeli sources. In 2009, one Salafi-jihadist preacher declared Gaza to
be an Islamic state; Hamas stormed the mosque that was his base,
killing him and over 20 others.

But the biggest difference is that Hamas is a success while al Qaeda is
a failure. Hamas has gone from a small group overshadowed by Yasir
Arafat's Fatah to a large and powerful organization. Whether we like
it or not, Hamas is the government of Gaza -- and terrorism helped
them get there. And with the fall of Mubarak and the emergence of
the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt as an important political actor
there, Hamas may gain influence. Al Qaeda, in contrast, is if
anything farther from its goals of ending U.S. regional influence and
establishing a caliphate than it was 15 years ago.

Despite Netanyahu's rhetoric, Hamas cannot simply be wished away
when it comes to the peace process. It represents a large portion of
Palestinian opinion, and it has repeatedly demonstrated that it can use
suicide bombers, rocket attacks, or other forms of terrorism to disrupt
any talks. But the group's occasional pragmatism suggests that under
the right conditions it can be convinced not to play the spoiler. Such
an effort may fail and involves many sticks as well as carrots, but a
similar effort with al Qaeda would be a fool's errand.

Netanyahu's government may be dead-set against talking with Hamas,
but treating it like al Qaeda and using this as a reason to not negotiate
with moderates like Abbas only convinces skeptical Palestinians that

Since the theme of this book is change—change in the freedom of expression, change in the way
homicides are prosecuted and defended, change in the nature of media coverage of high profile
cases, change in the uses and misuses of “human rights,” change in attitudes toward race, change
in the relationship between religion and government, and change in the way law is taught and
learned—it is appropriate to end with changes I have experienced in my own personal and
professional life over the years.

During each of my seven decades of adult life, I have undergone significant change, beginning in
my second decade, when I was a teenager about to enter college, through my eighth decade as I

a civil war in Syria. Israel would thus find itself fighting three battles
simultaneously. The only way to do that is to be intensely aggressive,
making moderation strategically difficult.

Israel responded modestly compared to the past after the Eilat
incident, mounting only limited attacks on Gaza against mostly
members of the Palestinian Resistance Committees, an umbrella
group known to have links with Hamas. Nevertheless, Hamas has
made clear that its de facto truce with Israel was no longer assured.
The issue now is what Hamas is prepared to do and whether Hamas
supporters, Saudi Arabia in particular, can force them to control anti-
Israeli activities in the region. The Saudis want al Assad to fall, and
they do not want a radical regime in Egypt. Above all, they do not
want Iran's hand strengthened. But it is never clear how much
influence the Saudis or Egyptians have over Hamas. For Hamas, this
is emerging as the perfect moment, and it is hard to believe that even
the Saudis can restrain them. As for the Israelis, what will happen
depends on what others decide - which is the fundamental strategic
problem that Israel has.

in this way they are accomplices to a cover-up. This is also to say that the characterization provided
by John and Avery Gunther in their April 2011 Superior Court filing for a Protection Order against me
and their admissions in this filing of having provided derogatory information to various persons

themselves or children Anjulee and Xian Gunther.

of a different investigation was also under the purview of attorney Starr and formal investigation of
the results of Starr's investigation were drowned out by the details of the Lewinsky affair.) This is a
bit strange considering the Lewinsky affair was a moral failing and not an actionable criminal one as
would have been the others had any proof surfaced.

economics called “capital theory”. My next generation theory, really Petty’s of 1662,
proposes what the average-risk time discount rate is and why. Present value of each
expected instant of future satisfaction grows at that rate as time shortens the
discount period. It disappears, as apples from the tree, when expectation matures

into reality.

This diamond ring parable is full of useful lessons. | think it contains substantially all
of economics. “Consider the lilies of the field.” “They also serve who only stand and
wait.” A chemist would testify that the ring has done nothing. An economist sees
plenty happening. Economics is abstraction. Physical capital is not things, and
human capital is not people. It’s all in the mind. What an economist sees is present
value evolving with time as expectations ripen and eventuate. Output is not what we
do, although it has to do with what we do. It is the passage of time. Exhaust is the

fruition of time and the harvest reaped.

Only when we allow psychic values can we say that all behavior is economic

behavior. It is choices among alternatives. That’s what makes economics philosophy.

Axioms

Then what should its axioms be? We would like empirical or real-world certainties. |
find none beyond Descarte’s cogito. Philosophy is certain of next to nothing. We
settle for working assumptions. We want ones as safe and few as possible. Those of
economics have usually been left implicit since the marginalist revolution. I dropped
the course because | felt their need. It should do no harm, at this point, to risk the

opposite extreme. Let’s try putting everything on the table.

My first axiom, in that spirit, will be unguided natural causality. This need not alarm
the devout. It is the working assumption of all science. Working assumptions are
not creeds. | cannot rule out the possibility of occasional or even continuous

intervention by God to explain what we see. But we know to act as if we ruled it out

TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026648.txt,"﻿Saudi Arabia lobbies to amend JASTA law which allows 9/11 victims
to sue the Gulf state
Following an extended trip to the United States, Adel al-Jubeir told reporters on Sunday he has been
trying “to persuade [US lawmakers] that there needs to be an amendment of the law,” the Justice Against
Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA), that legitimizes lawsuits by Americans regarding terrorist attacks
committed on US soil.
US House adopts ’Sue the Saudis’ 9/11 bill
the Saudi minister said.
“We believe the law, that curtails sovereign immunities,
represents a grave danger to the international system,”
Jubeir said at a joint press conference with visiting US
Secretary of State John Kerry, as cited by AFP news agency.
Saudi Arabia has repeatedly expressed these views since the
US Congress passed the legislation in September, overriding
US President Barack Obama’s veto of JASTA. This time,
however, negotiations on the matter have already been held,
“The question now becomes how do you go about amending the law,” he said.
Fifteen out of the 19 hijackers involved in the 9/11 attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people were Saudi
subjects. The kingdom, however, has denied any ties to the hijackers.
The JASTA law allows attack survivors and relatives of attack victims to file lawsuits against foreign
countries for acts of terrorism that kill Americans on US soil. Also known as House Resolution 3815, it
creates an exception to the sovereign immunity law introduced in 1976, allowing US citizens to sue foreign
governments in US federal court and demand compensation if those governments are proven to bear some
responsibility for attacks within the US.
This exception drew concern from many countries – both in the Gulf and globally – that the legislation
will erode sovereign immunity, considered one of the founding principles of international relations.
Some British, French, and Dutch lawmakers have
threatened retaliatory legislation to allow their courts to
pursue US officials, which is why outgoing President Obama
vetoed JASTA in the first place, explaining that it would
harm American interests as it opens the United States up to
private lawsuits over its military missions abroad.
Saudis reject US 9/11 act as threat to sovereignty,
Russia says it damages international law
“The United States is, by eroding [the sovereign immunity]
principle, opening the door for other countries to take
similar steps and then before you know it international order becomes governed by the law of the
jungle,” the Saudi foreign minister said.
Saudi Arabia recently warned it would pull its money out of the US economy, selling up to $750 billion in
US treasury securities and other assets, before lawsuits demanding compensation start pouring in and put
these assets in jeopardy. However, responding to a question on whether Saudi Arabia was still
reconsidering its investment strategy on Sunday, Jubeir assured reporters that it plans to continue with its
investments and does not plan to decrease them.
“[The Kingdom] has tremendous investments in the United States and we review those investments on a
regular basis. There are issues associated with risk, but our objective is to increase those investments.
We won’t decrease them,” he said, as cited by Reuters. The US Treasury Department said that the
kingdom owned $116.8 billion in securities in the US as of March this year.

Responsibility:
Identify and implement new opportunities to leverage marketing materials.

Expectations:

e Ideas are researched for feasibility and effectiveness.

e Chosen projects are designed and sent out within the budget and timeline.

Contract Solution:

I would utilize e-mail and Skype to communicate any new ideas and opportunities to leverage marketing
materials. I have recently proposed creating a one-page calendar of our program deadlines to distribute
to our recent seminar alumni in a fall mailing. This way students will have an easy way to remember all
of our deadlines for our programs and may potentially boost our number of applicants.

Expectations:

° Online efforts are increasingly cost effective.

e Marketing Director is informed of web-based marketing results as requested.

Contract Solution:

I am familiar with our online advertising efforts and can continue to help with this process from a
distance. I will be able to access Facebook Ads, Google Ads, Blog Ads and aid Keri in gathering and
entering data. I have experience working with our Facebook and Google Ads and have created images
for Blog Ads in the past. Launching new Ads will be easily managed abroad.

Responsibility:

Expectations:
e Attractive, updated photos will be available for program and marketing uses.

Contract Solution:

As stated above with the stock photo inventory, I am still able to complete this task remotely by
conducting image searches on web databases such as iStockphoto.com. The Seminar Photo Contest will
also be used as a tool to aid in this compilation of images while I am abroad.

In order to more effectively track the cost of production of our print materials, I think [company name]

re taboo
, maybe climate change is a good way of dealing with overpopulation. _ . the earths forest
fire. potentailly a good thing for the species

Making having children expensive in terms of upbringing and missed opportunity (like in the west) is a more
humane way. Environmental stress while leaving near rock bottom tends to lead people to have more
children, because there is no missed opportunity, and high mortality requires more attempts at procreation.
Humans are a hardy species, outside of focused famine events and wars only small fractions of any given
population die.

I suspect that strong reductions in population will come from large-scale failure of agriculture. The climate
change itself with result in migration and wars, but most people will probably survive that. But who knows, I
might be wrong.

too many people, so many mass executions of the elderly and infirm make sense
is the fundamental fact that everyone dies at some time .make it imporrisbole to ask so why
not earilier. if the brain discards unused neurons , why shold socieity keep their equivalent

The radical idea of treating individuals in a society as cells and the society itself as a well-organized
organism is fascism, or course. Probably the most efficient and rationally stringent way of governance, if
someone could pull it off in a sustainable way; and if it is aggressive and expansive, its efficiency makes it a
virus that everybody will want to stomp out. Fascism makes romantic doo-gooders like me very
uncomfortable (I visited KZ Buchenwald five times and it had a profound influence on me; we East Germans
inoculated ourselves very thoroughly against fascism), and the general public will not be willing to consider
it.

I rather like the treatment Fascism gets in the Amazon Series The Man in the High Castle, which explores
what would have happened if the Germans and Japanese had won the war: A society that tries to function as
a brutal and ruthlessly efficient machine, eliminating all social and evolutionary slack. It is very dark, but not
a flat caricature of pointless evil for its own sake. Heinlein's late book Starship Troopers explores fascism,
too, but unlike Philipp K Dick he does not see it as a form of insanity, but as the most desirable order.

I find your political incorrectness very fascinating. In the beginning, I thought it is a form of costly
signaling, but now I think you are simply entirely unconstrained in your thoughts. How did you manage in
your youth? Did you get in trouble, or did you keep your thoughts to yourself? I wonder what kind of person
you want to transform into.

It was interesting to notice that at the Forbidden Research conference, nobody managed to say anything
remotely out-of line. One large discussion group wanted to address the question of whether democracy still
works, and mostly expressed their disagreement with Trump. Ideology is like halitosis: easy to see in others,
hard in oneself. A speaker felt that the media stifle all criticism of Trump, another wanted to remove men
and Elon Musk from government, and everybody strongly agreed that we need more diversity everywhere.

As I watched the president, “davening” in his yamulka, I thought of Jules Farber’s quip: “The time
is at hand when the wearing of prayer shawl and skullcap will not bar a man from the White
House—unless, of course, the man is Jewish!”

Following the service, the Clintons invited us to join them for dinner at the Savoir Faire
Restaurant in Edgartown. We had already eaten before the service, but we readily accepted. My
wife, Carolyn, my son Elon and I dined with the Clintons. We were later joined for dessert by
Vernon Jordan and his wife, Anne.

The dinner was relaxed. The President discussed movies with my producer son, while my wife
and I discussed health care policy with Hillary. The President told a joke that wasn’t particularly
funny. My family has very high standards of humor, so we didn’t laugh. The president,
apparently thinking we didn’t hear or get the punch line, repeated it. This time, we laughed—a
bit. When the dessert was brought, the waiter put a large chocolate bombe in front of the
president. My son thought it was large enough to be shared by the table and so he raised his
spoon to take a piece. The president stared him down, saying with his eyes, “that’s all mine!”
Elon dropped the spoon and the president consumed the entire bombe. (Today, Bill Clinton is a
vegan—no more bombes for him!)

At the end of the evening, over dinner, the president lifted a glass of champagne to toast the
Jewish New Year. As I touched my glass to his, I gave the traditional Jewish toast,
“L’Chaim’—to life. President Clinton responded, “This has been a really great evening.”

A few days later, I wrote the following about President Clinton’s historic visit to the Martha’s
Vineyard synagogue:

Skeptical as most American Jews are about any lowering of the wall of separation
between Church and State, we still want the President of the United States to be the
President of all the people. We are the most diverse, heterogeneous, multiethnic-nation in
history, in which more than 150 religious groups practice a wide array of rituals and
express an even wider array of beliefs. Our president, unlike the Queen of England, is not
the Defender of the Faith. He is the defender of the Constitution, which prohibits the
establishment of religion, guarantees its free exercise and forbids any religious test for
office.

President Clinton frequently attends church services of his own Baptist denomination, as
well as of other Christian denominations. He lights the national Christmas tree and this
year also lit Hanukkah candles in the White House.

I then contrasted President Clinton’s warm actions with the response I received from former
President Gorbachev several years earlier. I had been invited to speak at an international
conference in the Kremlin, during the week of the Jewish New Year. I invited the then-president
to join the Jewish invitees at the conference to services in Moscow. He refused, suggesting to me
that an appearance at a synagogue would not help his prospects for holding on to the office he
would soon be losing.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028071.txt,"There was another, slightly less noble, reason I wanted to set the record
straight with Rabin. Though only gradually did I admit this even to myself, I
realized that my experience in a regional command had ticked the one missing
box in the CV of our top generals, meaning that I might indeed be a candidate to
succeed Moshe Vechetzi as chief of staff. At first, I resisted taking the prospect
too seriously. The job of ramatkal not only carried responsibility for overall
command of the armed forces. Since our country still faced multiple security
threats, the chief of staff was, along with Prime Minister and Defence Minister,
among the most important, influential and visible positions in Israeli public life.
Yet as the April 1987 date for the changeover drew nearer, it was difficult not to
think about it. Not only was I apparently under consideration. To judge from
media reports, and officers’ smalltalk, it appeared that Rabin had whittled down
the possibilities to two. One was Dan Shomron, and I was the other.

Still, it was only when Rabin phoned me early in 1987 that I knew it was
true — and that I would not be getting the top job. “Ehud,” he said, “I wanted
you to know I’ve decided on Dan to be the next ramatkal. I want you to be his
deputy.” I can’t say I was surprised he’d chosen Dan. It wasn’t just that he was
more experienced, or even that, since he was older, missing out on the top job
this time would probably mean missing out for good. Yitzhak had always
valued Dan’s directness and honesty, his courage and record of service. Above
all, ’'d long sensed that he felt a special debt to Dan: for Entebbe. At a time
when so much could have gone wrong, it was Dan who had taken a firm,
confident, successful hold on the operation.

Still, I was now 45. For me no less than for Dan, I knew that if I was passed
over as chief of staff, there was no guarantee I’d be chosen the next time. “I
respect your decision,” I told Rabin. “And I have no doubt Dan will be a good —
a very good — chief-of-staff.” But I had to consider my own future. “Even
though I’m grateful for the offer of deputy,” I said. “I think it’s better for me to
leave. To open up a new chapter, and do something else in life.”

Rabin said he couldn’t accept that. “Come see me,” he said. “Now.” When I
got to Jerusalem, I emphasized again that I had no doubt Dan would lead the
armed forces well. But I said my decision to leave the military wasn’t a mere
whim. I had been thinking about my own future and my family’s. We had three
young daughters. A few months earlier, we had moved home again, into a wide,
one-story rambler with a big yard out back. It was in a new town called Kochav
Yair, just inside Israel’s pre-1967 border with the West Bank, and it struck me

The exchange of notes goes on for a few days and the two seem to be
getting on well. There is even a little romance in the air. When the week is
over I open the door and the two meet. The graduate student says, “Hello.
It’s nice to finally meet you in person.’ The man is puzzled because, of
course, she has spoken to him in Chinese. He knows no Chinese.

“Tm terribly sorry, but I don’t speak Chinese,” he says.

She is puzzled, “But I spoke with you this last week!”

“No, I really don't speak it,” he says.

And, of course, he is telling the truth. The book he has been using
contains the rules for answering questions in Chinese, but he has
absolutely no knowledge of the language. I'll leave to your imagination
whether the two strike up a real relationship and live happily ever after.

This is the Story of the Chinese Room. The setup is able to fool
someone into believing there is a Chinese speaking person in the room,
yet there is not. Where does the understanding of Chinese lie? The man
definitely does not understand Chinese. And the book clearly does not
understand Chinese because it is an inanimate object. Yet the person
outside the room is convinced she is communicating with a Chinese
speaker. The analogy to a computer is clear. The book is software and
the man blindly following instructions is the hardware. John Searle,
who devised the thought experiment uses it to show computers can
never understand because there is no place in a mechanistic system for
understanding to exist.

The Chinese Room has sparked huge argument in philosophical
circles; let me boil it down to its simplest form. First, let's refute Searle's
position with the ‘System Argument.

The man plus the book form a system. Systems understand; their
individual components do not. My blood does not understand. My brain
without blood would not understand — it would be dead! Plug my brain
into a good supply of blood; add a dash of glucose, and it will understand
the most complex of things.

The systems argument is elegant and most scientists think this is the
definitive argument against Searle, but Searle has a neat way to counter
it. “Imagine”, he says, “that the man memorizes the book and leaves the
room. Now there is no system, there is just the man, but the man still does
not understand Chinese; he is just parroting rote-memorized words and
rules.” Computers, Searle argues, process syntax — the rules of language;
humans understand semantics — the contextual meaning of language.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) proponents hate the Searle argument.
They believe the memorization of a set of words and rules is exactly what
gives us knowledge of Chinese. That is why we go to school!

Inside Job (2010) 
wrote: 
NYT Critics' Pick This movie has been designated a Critic's Pick by the film reviewers of The New York Times. 
Henry Paulson, Ben Bernanke and Timothy Geithner in the documentary Inside Job. 
Sony Pictures Classics 
Who Maimed the Economy, and How 
By A. 0. SCOTT 
Inside Job, a sleek, briskly paced film whose title suggests a heist movie, is the story of a crime without 
punishment, of an outrage that has so far largely escaped legal sanction and societal stigma. The betrayal 
of public trust and collective values that Mr. Ferguson chronicles was far more brazen and damaging than 
the adultery in Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel, which treated Hester more as scapegoat than villain. 
The gist of this movie, which begins in a mood of calm reflection and grows angrier and more incredulous 
as it goes on, is unmistakably punitive. The density of information and the complexity of the subject 
matter make Inside Job feel like a classroom lecture at times, but by the end Mr. Ferguson has 
summoned the scourging moral force of a pulpit-shaking sermon. That he delivers it with rigor, restraint 
and good humor makes his case all the more devastating. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031826 
He is hardly alone in making it. Numerous journalists have published books and articles retracing the 
paths that led the world economy to the precipice two years ago. The deregulation of the financial 
services industry in the 1980s and '9os; the growing popularity of complex and risky derivatives; the real 
estate bubble and the explosion of subprime lending — none of these developments were exactly secret. 
On the contrary, they were celebrated as vindications of the power and wisdom of markets. Accordingly, 
Mr. Ferguson recycles choice moments of triumphalism, courtesy of Lawrence H. Summers, George W.  
Bush, Alan Greenspan and various cable television ranters and squawkers. 
Even as stock indexes soared and profits swelled, there were always at least a few investors, economists 
and government officials who warned that the frenzied speculation was leading to the abyss. Some of 
these prophets without honor show up in front of Mr. Ferguson's camera, less to gloat than to present, 
once again, the analyses that were dismissed and ignored by their peers for so long. 
Dozens of interviews — along with news clips and arresting aerial shots of New York, Iceland and other 
disaster areas — are folded into a clear and absorbing history, narrated by Matt Damon. The music (an 
opening song, Big Time, by Peter Gabriel, and a score by Alex Heffes) and the clean wide-screen 
cinematography provide an aesthetic polish that is welcome for its own sake and also important to the 
movie's themes. The handsomely lighted and appointed interiors convey a sense of the rarefied, 
privileged worlds in which the Wall Street operators and their political enablers flourished, and the 
elegance of the presentation also subliminally bolsters the film's authority. This is not a piece of ragged 
muckraking or breathless advocacy. It rests its outrage on reason, research and careful argument. 
The same was true of Mr. Ferguson's previous documentary, No End in Sight, which focused on 
catastrophic policies carried out in Iraq by President George W. Bush's administration just after the 
overthrow of Saddam Hussein. But whereas that film concentrated on a narrow view of a complex subject 
— the conduct of the war rather than the at least equally controversial rationale for fighting it — Inside 
Job offers a sweeping synthesis, going as far back as the Reagan administration and as far afield as 
Iceland in its anatomy of the financial crisis. 
Perhaps unsurprisingly, many of the highest-profile players declined to be interviewed. Mr. Summers 
appears only in news footage, and none of his predecessors or successors as Treasury secretary — not 
Robert E. Rubin or Henry M. Paulson Jr. or Timothy F. Geithner — submit to Mr. Ferguson's questions. 
Nor do any of the top executives at Goldman Sachs or the other big banks. Most of the interviewees are, 
at least from the perspective of the filmmaker, friendly witnesses, adding fuel to the director's 
comprehensive critique of the way business has been done in the United States and the other advanced 
capitalist countries for the past two decades. 
Both American political parties are indicted; Inside Job is not simply another belated settling of 
accounts with Mr. Bush and his advisers, though they are hardly ignored. The scaling back of government 
oversight and the weakening of checks on speculative activity by banks began under Reagan and 
continued during the Clinton administration. And with each administration the market in derivatives 
expanded, and alarms about the dangers of this type of investment were ignored. Raghuram Raj an, chief 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031827 
economist at the International Monetary Fund, presented a paper in 2005 warning of a catastrophic 
meltdown and was mocked as a Luddite by Mr. Summers. 
Meanwhile, some investment bankers — at Goldman Sachs in particular — were betting against the 
positions they were pushing on their customers. An elaborate house of cards had been constructed in 
which bad consumer loans were bundled into securities, which, were certified as sound by rating agencies 
paid by the banks and then insured via credit-default swaps. One risky bet was stacked on top of another, 
and in retrospect the collapse of the whole edifice, along with the loss of jobs, homes, pensions and 
political confidence, seems inevitable. 
How did this happen? Mr. Ferguson is no conspiracy theorist; nor is he inclined toward structural or 
systemic explanations. Markets are not like tectonic plates, shifting on their own. Visible hands write laws 
and make deals, and in this case a combination of warped values and groupthink seems to have driven 
very intelligent men (and they were mostly men) toward folly. In addition to business and government, 
Mr. Ferguson aims his critique at academia, suggesting that the discipline of economics and more than a 
few prominent economists were corrupted by consulting fees, seats on boards of directors and 
membership in the masters of the universe club. 
When he challenges some of these professors, in particular those who held positions of responsibility in 
the White House or in the Federal Reserve, they are reduced to stammering obfuscation — Markets are 
complicated! Who could have predicted? I don't see any conflict of interest — and occasionally provoked 
to testiness. Mr. Ferguson, for his part, cannot always contain his incredulity or rein in his sarcasm. 
Occasionally his voice pipes up from off camera, saying things like, You can't be serious! 
But it is hard to imagine a movie more serious, and more urgent, than Inside Job. There are a few 
avenues that might have been explored more thoroughly, in particular the effects of the crisis on 
ordinary, non-Wall-Street-connected workers and homeowners. The end of the film raises a disturbing 
question, as Mr. Damon exhorts viewers to demand changes in the status quo so that the trends 
associated with unchecked speculation of the kind that caused the last crisis — rising inequality, neglect 
of productive capacity, endless cycles of boom and bust — might be reversed. 
This call to arms makes you wonder why anger of the kind so eloquently expressed in Inside Job has 
been so inchoate. And through no fault of its own, the film may leave you dispirited as well as enraged. Its 
fate is likely to be that of other documentaries: praised in some quarters, nitpicked in others and 
shrugged off by those who need its message most. Which is a shame. 
Inside Job is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some drug and sex references and pervasive 
obscenity, though not the verbal kind.

Google's business and whether Amazon plays fair in the market for generic products.

° President Trump has said his administration is seriously looking into monopolistic
behavior of Facebook, Google and Amazon.

Some analysts predict an economic slowdown — even if it doesn’t lead to a recession like
the one in 2008 — will be enough to change the global attitude around big American
companies.

So the really shocking thing this year is that the only major economy in the world where
growth has actually accelerated this year is America. And this is because of the tax cuts, the
deregulation, the other stimulus which has been put into work. And that has also helped the
earnings of companies. My point is, from next year onwards, those effects begin to fade.

— Ruchir Sharma, chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley on Fareed Zakaria GPS

The FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) that pushed the
stock market to record highs have not been immune from this year's market rout.

° The mood has changed. Investors are asking a lot more questions right now, says
Larry Glazer, a Managing Partner at Mayflower Advisors, which manages $3 billion.
Momentum has faded on these names.

° Adding to potential concern: possible regulatory action could translate into higher
costs, particularly for Google or Facebook.

° Facebook has been under such a dark cloud for so long that now everybody is
expecting the worst, Paul Meeks, a technology portfolio manager at Wireless Fund, told
AX10s.

The other side: I don't see a looming recession. And even if there was, people aren't going
to target these companies if there is a recession, says Nicholas Economides, Professor of
Economics at NYU Stern School of Business.

° Economides argues that, even if there was a mild reduction in GDP growth, it
wouldn't significantly impact the high tech sector.

° For companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter, their main revenue streams are
from ads. They gain market share from brands converting traditional ad spend to digital ads.
This conversion is not so dependent on the growth of GDP, because they are still in the
process of converting ads of different formats to digital ads, and that's something that will
continue, regardless of GDP growth.

The bottom line: Tech companies that have long been the darlings of investor portfolios
will likely find themselves in much weaker positions.

Chapter 15: The changing impact of the media on the law

Criminal trials involving life and death, such as the O.J. Simpson case, or rape, such as the Mike
Tyson cases, always generate massive media coverage, especially when famous people are in the
dock. Some civil trials, especially those with allegations of sexual misconduct, are also widely
covered. In this chapter, I focus on two such cases—both quasi-criminal in nature, both involving
allegations of improper sexual relations—that reflect the changing impact of the media on our
legal process. I also relate my involvement in other high profile cases in which celebrities and
public figures have become the focus of media attention. Based on these and other cases, I draw
conclusions about the nature of celebrity justice and the impact of the media on high visibility
cases.

In the days before radio and television, trials were covered primarily by the print media.
Newspapers wrote articles about notorious cases. Pamphlets were issued containing excerpts
from the transcripts. Some lawyers became famous even without the benefit of the electronic
media. Daniel Webster, Abraham Lincoln, William Jennings Bryant, Clarence Darrow were all
household names. So were some of their famous and infamous clients.

The advent of gavel to gavel television coverage has changed the way in which the public views
the law and the way in which the law operates. It has turned lawyers into celebrities and clients
into household names. Today, everyone has an opinion on the high profile cases of the day, and
these opinions have impact not only in the court of public opinion but in the courthouse as well.
No lawyer, especially those who practice criminal or constitutional law, can afford to ignore the
impact of this phenomenon on tactics and strategy. Cases can be won or lost as easily on the
courthouse steps as in the courtroom itself.

I have played a role in the ongoing debate regarding the manner by which trials are covered, most
particularly whether they should be televised. (I think they should and have strongly advocated
that view in debates, on television and in articles.) Several of my cases were among the first and
most widely televised trials, in our history. In others, I have served as a real-time commentator
for trials covered by network television and Court TV.

Throughout my career, I have tried to use the media to the advantage of my clients, and the media
has tried to use me and my clients in an effort to sell soap and other commercial products.
Sometimes the relationship is symbiotic. More often it is antagonistic. It is rarely neutral. This is
especially the case involving the many celebrities I have represented.

Although the vast majority of my clients over the years have been obscure and often
penurious—about half of my cases have been without any fee—the media often portrays me as a
“celebrity” or “high profile” lawyer. I don’t like those characterizations of my life-work, but there
is some truth in it, because many of my cases have been extensively covered by the media. That is
in the nature of criminal or constitutional lawyer, since cases involving my specialties tend to raise
issues of public interest. It is also true that because I have become relatively well known as a
result of these cases, I receive calls from famous people seeking my advice or my representation.

I don’t like the term “celebrity lawyer” because it suggests that I select my cases on the basis of
the status of the client, rather than the nature of the case or cause. Nothing could be further from

reflecting the balance in each part of the south.

Israeli troops might still have to cross into Lebanon, but only for brief,
targeted operations to preempt preparations for a terror attack. “We need to
remember what we’re there for,” I said. “We have no territorial claims. It’s to
protect the north of Israel. But it will end up being about protecting our own
troops inside the security zone. It will be like the Bar-Lev line in 1973, fighting
for fortifications we don’t need.” I couldn’t persuade him. I’m sure he
understood the argument, and he may even have agreed. But when Katyushas
next fell on northern Israel, he as Minister of Defense, not I, would be the one in
the political firing line.

Far from straining our relations, our frank exchanges on Lebanon seemed to
build further trust between us. We worked closely on a range of issues. When
Sayeret Matkal or another intelligence unit planned an operation across our
borders, both of us would present the action to the cabinet. During the
operations, I’d be either in the kirva or a forward command post. Since nearly
all of them happened after nightfall, Yitzhak would usually be back home,
asleep, by the time they ended. I would phone him. The trademark voice — slow,
gravelly, deep even when he was wide awake — would answer. I’d tell him the
mission was over and — with only one exception during my period as head of
intelligence — successful. “Todah,” he would say. “Lehitraot.” Thanks. Bye. He
was never a man to waste words.

For one of the very few times I can remember, He phoned me one morning in
October 1985. It came a couple of days after an especially gruesome Palestinian
terror attack. Even with Arafat now more than a thousand miles away in Tunis,
much of Rabin’s focus was taken up in responding to, or trying to preempt,
Palestinian terrorism. The issue was especially sensitive politically in the wake
of a war in Lebanon that was supposed to have eliminated that threat. For Rabin,
moreover, it had become personal. He’d had to sanction an unprecedented
exchange of 1,150 Palestinian security prisoners earlier in the year to secure the
freedom of three Israeli soldiers, including one of our men from Sultan Yacoub,
who had ended up in the hands of the radical Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine — General Command. Now a group from another of the radical factions,
the Palestine Liberation Front, had hijacked an Italian cruise ship called the
Achille Lauro en route from Egypt to Israel. They murdered one of the
passengers, a wheelchair-bound, 69-year-old Jewish American named Leon
Klinghoffer, and dumped his body overboard.

New book paints sordid picture of Trump real estate 
deal involving Russian oligarch and Jeffrey Epstein

A new book claims Jeffrey Epstein played a key role in a shady Palm Beach real estate deal between President 
Donald Trump and a Russian oligarch. 
Michael Wolff's forthcoming book, Siege, details the 2004 property deal that involved the future president, 
Deutsche Bank, a child predator and an ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin, reported The Guardian. 
ADVERTISING 
According to Wolff's account, Epstein showed his friend Trump a $55 million mansion he planned to buy, but 
Trump instead went behind his back to buy the foreclosed property for about $40 million. 
Epstein didn't believe Trump could raise that much money on his own, through an entity called Trump 
Properties LLC that was entirely financed by Deutsche Bank, Wolff wrote. 
The billionaire financier knew Trump had been loaning out his name in real estate deals for a fee, and he 
suspected the freshly minted reality TV star was fronting for the mansion's real owners. 
44,-er. 
Epstein threatened to expose the deal until he found himself under investigation by Palm Beach police for child 
sex abuse and human trafficking, and he eventually served 13 months in county jail as part of a controversial 
plea agreement brokered by Trump's future Labor Secretary Alex Acosta. 
Trump later put the mansion on the market for $125 million, despite making only minor improvements to the 
property. 
It was purchased for $96 million by Dmitry Rybolovlev, a Kremlin-linked industrialist — which meant Trump 
made $55 million on the deal despite risking none of his own money. 
Wolff offers two possible theories for the deal. 
The author suspects that Trump may have earned a fee for hiding a shadow owner who possibly was funneled 
cash by Ryboloyley for reasons beyond the property's value. 
Or, Wolff theorizes, Ryboloyley essentially bought the house from himself, with Trump as an intermediary, to 
launder ill-gotten money. 
This, Wolff wrote, was Donald Trump's world of real estate. 
Ryboloyley tore down the mansion in 2016 and sold off the property as three lots for less than the $115 million 
he had invested in it.

independently targeted warheads. Combined with the state-of-the-
art technology it had licensed from Russia, its systematic use of
espionage even made it possible for China to build its own stealth
fighters.

Unlike the United States, China did not achieve this remarkable
capability to launch independently targeted miniaturized nuclear
weapons and stealth them by investing hundreds of billions of dol-
lars in developing them. It obtained this technology mainly through
espionage. The Chinese intelligence service stole a large part, if not
all, of America’s secret technology for weaponizing nuclear bombs
during the 1980s and 1990s. The theft was so massive that in 1998
the House of Representatives set up a special bipartisan investiga-
tive unit called the Select Committee on U.S. National Security and
Military/Commercial Concerns with the People’s Republic of China.
Based on the intelligence amassed by the NSA, the CIA, and other
intelligence services, it concluded in its report that the Chinese intel-
ligence service had obtained both by electronic and by conventional
spying the warhead design of America’s seven most advanced ther-

© monuclear weapons. Moreover, it found that espionage successes ®
allowed China to so accelerate the design, development, and test-
ing of its own nuclear weapons that the new generation of Chinese
weapons would be “comparable in effectiveness to the weapons used
by the United States.” Further, the committee reported that these
thefts were the “results of decades of intelligence operations against
U.S. weapons laboratories.” The Chinese intelligence service further
obtained from private U.S. defense contractors through cyber espio-
nage important elements of the stealth technology used in advanced
planes and submarines. China shared (or exchanged) the fruits of its
espionage on nuclear warhead design with North Korea, Pakistan,
Iran, and Russia.

Despite its formidable intelligence coups in the United States, the
Chinese intelligence service managed to remain among the most
elusive of America’s intelligence adversaries. Its espionage organi-
zations are hidden behind layers of bureaucracy in the Ministry of
State Security, Chinese Communist Party structures, and the second,
third, and fourth department of the General Staff of the People’s
Liberation Army. Much of its cyber-espionage units are concealed

driven that benefits from variation (e.g., recreation).

6. Regret is past-tense decision making. Eliminate complaining to minimize regret.

Condition yourself to notice complaints and stop making them with a simple program like the “21-day
no-complaint experiment” made famous by Will Bowen, where you wear a single bracelet and move it
from one wrist to the other each time you complain. The goal is 21 days without complaining and you
reset to 0 each time you slip up. This increased awareness helps prevent useless past-tense deliberation
and negative emotions that improve nothing but deplete your attention.

DECISION-MAKING ISN’T to be avoided—that’s not the problem. Look at a good CEO or top corporate
performer and you'll see a high volume of decisions.

It’s deliberation—the time we vacillate over and consider each decision—that’s the attention
consumer. Total deliberation time, not the number of decisions, determines your attention bank
account balance (or debt).

Let’s assume you pay 10% over time by following the above rules but cut your average “decision
cycle” time by an average of 40% (10 minutes reduced to 6 minutes, for example). Not only will you
have much more time and attention to spend on revenue-generating activities, but you'll get greater
enjoyment from what you have and experience. Consider that 10% additional cost as an investment and
part of your “ideal lifestyle tax,” but not as a loss.

Embrace the choice-minimal lifestyle. It’s a subtle and under-exploited philosophical tool that
produces dramatic increases in both output and satisfaction, all with less overwhelm.

Make testing a few of the principles the first of many fast and reversible decisions. _—FEBRUARY 6,

The Not-to-Do List: 9 Habits to Stop Now

“N
ot-to-do” lists are often more effective than to-do lists for upgrading performance.

The reason is simple: What you don’t do determines what you can do.

Here are nine stressful and common habits that entrepreneurs and office workers should strive to
eliminate. The bullets are followed by more detailed descriptions. Focus on one or two at a time, just as
you would with high-priority to-do items.

1. Do not answer calls from unrecognized phone numbers.

Feel free to surprise others, but don’t be surprised. It just results in unwanted interruption or poor
negotiating positions. Let it go to voicemail, and consider using a service like GrandCentral (you can
listen to people leaving voicemail or receive them as text messages) or Phonetag.com (receive voicemails
as e-mail).

a good thing for the species

Making having children expensive in terms of upbringing and missed opportunity (like in the west) is a more
humane way. Environmental stress while leaving near rock bottom tends to lead people to have more
children, because there is no missed opportunity, and high mortality requires more attempts at procreation.
Humans are a hardy species, outside of focused famine events and wars only small fractions of any given
population die.

I suspect that strong reductions in population will come from large-scale failure of agriculture. The climate
change itself with result in migration and wars, but most people will probably survive that. But who knows, I
might be wrong.

too many people, so many mass executions of the elderly and infirm make sense
is the fundamental fact that everyone dies at some time .make it imporrisbole to ask so why not earilier. if
the brain discards unused neurons , why shold socieity keep their equivalent

The radical idea of treating individuals in a society as cells and the society itself as a well-organized organism
is fascism, or course. Probably the most efficient and rationally stringent way of governance, if someone
could pull it off in a sustainable way; and if it is aggressive and expansive, its efficiency makes it a virus that
everybody will want to stomp out. Fascism makes romantic doo-gooders like me very uncomfortable (I
visited KZ Buchenwald five times and it had a profound influence on me; we East Germans inoculated
ourselves very thoroughly against fascism), and the general public will not be willing to consider it.

I rather like the treatment Fascism gets in the Amazon Series The Man in the High Castle, which explores
what would have happened if the Germans and Japanese had won the war: A society that tries to function as a
brutal and ruthlessly efficient machine, eliminating all social and evolutionary slack. It is very dark, but not a
flat caricature of pointless evil for its own sake. Heinlein's late book Starship Troopers explores fascism,
too, but unlike Philipp K Dick he does not see it as a form of insanity, but as the most desirable order.

I find your political incorrectness very fascinating. In the beginning, I thought it is a form of costly
signaling, but now I think you are simply entirely unconstrained in your thoughts. How did you manage in
your youth? Did you get in trouble, or did you keep your thoughts to yourself? I wonder what kind of person
you want to transform into.

It was interesting to notice that at the Forbidden Research conference, nobody managed to say anything
remotely out-of line. One large discussion group wanted to address the question of whether democracy still
works, and mostly expressed their disagreement with Trump. Ideology is like halitosis: easy to see in others,
hard in oneself. A speaker felt that the media stifle all criticism of Trump, another wanted to remove men
and Elon Musk from government, and everybody strongly agreed that we need more diversity everywhere.

I noticed some time ago that Joi has remarkable public communication skills. He picks controversial, insight-
laden topics, but sanitizes them by carefully replacing the parts of content that would divide his audience with
symbolic messages that everybody can fill with their own content in a way that resonates with them. The non-
controversial parts will still be insightful. He manages to come across as very subversive, while rarely
offending anyone (except the hard scientists, that miss hard substance).

He also asks influential people and smart students or faculty to write parts of his essays and speeches for him.
This invests them in his success, especially because he is going to reward and acknowledge them. Very few of
his ideas are original, instead he is good at identifying and testing thoughts he reads or hears from others.

even faster in ratio to capital.

What | have just modeled is depreciation rising exponentially from zero at the start
to a maximum at the end. National accounts show the exact opposite. They show it
decreasing exponentially from a maximum at the start. The reason for the difference
is instructive. I would rather trust the present value formula to show what assets
are worth subjectively to their owners. The national accounts prefer to trust
evidence as to what they are worth to others if sold. That’s a solid method too if the
evidence is likely to prove representative. It isn’t in cases where transactions are
more likely to have been driven by pressure to sell than pressure to buy. Plant is
generally tailored to purposes of its first owner, and not meant to be resold. Plant
sales tend to follow disappointing results. These are likelier to come early as
business plans are first tested. That could explain why evidence without logic has

suggested that depreciation tends to start fast and slow down with time.

] would recommend that national accounts continue tracking actual sales as an
indicator of true depreciation curves, but limit the study to rental buildings
expected from the start to be resold several times. | mean apartment buildings,
office buildings and warehouses designed along standard lines. Many investors
specialize in buying and selling these tradable assets for portfolio purposes.

Pressure to buy and pressure to sell tend to balance.

I can testify that prices bid for them are found either by discounted cash flow or
internal rate of return (IRR) methods. IRR is a variant of the same thing. A bid price
is modeled as the original negative cash flow in evaluating the proposed purchase.
Then the positive cash flows at each year’s end are modeled, and the discount rate
found which nets present value of all flows together to zero. If this rate is judged
competitive, the purchase goes ahead. This method was originated by Keynes in the

General Theory as his “marginal product of capital”.

I hope all is well with you. As per Peggy Siegal's office, I have included here the invitation to the IFP Gotham Awards 
ceremony, which will be held on Monday, November 27 at Cipriani Wall Street in New York City. 
This year's ceremony is going to be another successful event. We couldn't be more thrilled with this year's impressive 
group of Tributees. The Actress Tribute will go to Nicole Kidman and the Actor Tribute to Dustin Hoffman. The 
Director Tribute will be given to Sofia Coppola, with the Cinematographer Tribute going to Ed Lachman. With the 
Industry Tribute, we will be honoring Jason Blum, founder of Blumhouse Productions. And we simply couldn't be more 
pleased to honor Vice President Al Gore with this year's special Humanitarian Tribute. With nominees this year 
ranging from Willem Dafoe, Adam Sandler and Robert Pattison to Margot Robbie, Lois Smith and Mary J. Blige, this 
year's ceremony looks to be the most star studded ever.

Thanks Darren 
Good news! 
I'm under the impression that checks will be exceptional (they are more cumbersome to handle), and we will 
use mostly wires. 
Considering the time difference, my heavy travel and my own propension to do things at night and on week-
ends I would much prefer having an internet code and be able to organize everything online when I need to. 
When I use Interaudi (my US bank), they can do that, store the recurring beneficiaries, and do wires in 
multiple currencies, but I am not familiar with DB. 
Of course, you could also have the same access and help me when needed. 
Also, your point about bookkeeping is mitigated by the fact that, in any case, I will also need to have someone 
keeping track of the receipts and inventory, before shipping proofs to you. In any case there will be need for 
some work on my side before final filing is done. 
On the other hand, if there is a checks and balances control issue, there could be a cap to my wiring powers 
(like the 10 K we discussed), that would be absolutely fine for me if this is the intent. 
Please do let me know. 
We can also talk about it (in Hawai now, free after 2 PM your time) 
In any case, this is good and happy news. I'll review the first list of payments over the week-end.

Happy to talk to you almost anytime today until around 3PM. Just tell me what number I should reach. 
Not sure what got lost in translation here: never had the intention to go to any art fair or art show or 
anything of the kind. 
All the artists we have in mind or send to you are people we have direct connections with. Not just their 
studio, but also their home. They are people the work of whom we follow, and many of them are already 
friendly (Arianna, Cali have had dinner or stayed home). 
The idea is absolutely to have an impact on the ecosystem and to make a difference by supporting great 
artists when they need it. 
Galleries references are important, because galleries allow artist to reach a broader audience. We would go 
directly to the source. 
This is why it's important for me to go to LA or Berlin (or elsewhere) because those artists are not rich yet, 
they dont travel so much. They belong to a scene, and it does make a big difference to them if you connect in 
person. 
The spirit is to have an impact on young, talented folks, and absolutely to stay at the source. 
Once again, not sure was drifted away from this in communication

Figure 4.16 shows how the latter 5 of these dimensions are derived from underlying urges and
modulators. Note that these dimensions are not orthogonal; for instance resolution is mainly in-
versely related to arousal. Additional dimensions are also discussed, for instance it is postulated
that to deal with social emotions one may wish to introduce two more demands corresponding
to inner and outer obedience to social norms, and then define dimensions in terms of these.

for instance, “Anger ... is characterized by high arousal, low resolution, strong motive dominance,
few background checks and strong goal-orientedness; sadness by low arousal, high resolution,
strong dominance, few background-checks and low goal-orientedness.”

I’m a bit skeptical of the contention that these dimensions fully characterize the relevant

Epstein's home that showed he knew the girls were underage. Yet Mr. Krischer was more swayed by Epstein's
lawyers, who attempted to impugn the girls' character by showing they had chatted on myspace.com about
smoking marijuana and drinking. He should have let a jury decide whether the victims - and Epstein - were
credible.

Ultimately, one charge against Epstein finally reflected the age of one victim, and the plea agreement left
Epstein labeled a sex offender. With that additional charge, if Epstein had been convicted at a trial, he could
have been sentenced to anything from probation to 15 years in prison, Assistant State Attorney Lanna
Belohlavek said, adding that the recommended guideline sentence was 21 months.

Epstein also won't have to certify to the court that he is receiving counseling, typically required of sex
offenders, because he has a private psychiatrist. But without court supervision, who will ensure Epstein is in
fact being treated?

The plea deal also drops a federal investigation of Epstein. If a federal investigation was warranted, how does

Police chief's reputation helps discredit attacks

By Larry Keller
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer

Monday, August 14, 2006

In the case of Palm Beach financier Jeffrey Epstein, it seems, at times, as if two men are accused of
wrongdoing: Epstein and Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter.

Epstein, 53, was indicted last month on a charge of felony solicitation of prostitution solely because of Reiter's
craziness, one of Epstein's lawyers said. His department disseminated a distorted view of the case and
behaved in a childish manner when the grand jury didn't indict Epstein on the charges it sought, another
Epstein lawyer complained. To hear the Epstein camp tell it, Reiter, 48, is a loose cannon better suited to be the
sheriff of Mayberry. They whisper that he's embroiled in a messy divorce.

Reiter did in fact file for divorce from his wife, Jill, last year, after 24 years of marriage. They have a son, 18,
and a daughter, 14. The couple is scheduled to go to mediation next week, Aug. 16. Nothing in the court file
suggests their split is particularly ugly.

Reiter incurred the wrath of the Epstein camp as well as the state attorney's office for two reasons. First, he
pressed for Epstein to be charged with the more serious crimes of sexual activity with minors. Second, he
slammed State Attorney Barry Krischer in blunt language seldom used by one law-enforcement official
concerning another because of what he perceived as that office's mishandling of the case.

In a letter to Krischer written May 1, Reiter called his actions in the Epstein case highly unusual. He added,
I must urge you to... consider if good and sufficient reason exists to require your disqualification from the
prosecution of these cases.

In short, Reiter told the county's top prosecutor for the past 13 years that he ought to get off the case. It looks
like a departure from professionalism, Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said of
Reiter's letter.

Following Epstein's indictment, Reiter referred the case to the FBI to determine whether the super-rich, super-
connected defendant had violated any federal laws.

Reiter won't discuss the case or the broadsides aimed at him. But others almost uniformly use one word to
describe the chief: professional.

the Subscription Agreement in its entirety so as to fully understand the representations and warranties it is
required to make pursuant to the Subscription Agreement.

The Units cannot be resold or otherwise transferred unless they are subsequently registered under the
Securities Act and other applicable securities laws, or exemptions from such registration requirements are
available. It is not contemplated that registration of the Units under the Securities Act or other securities
laws will ever be effected. There is no public market for the Units, and none is expected to develop.
Therefore, an investor that purchases the Units may be required to hold the Units for an indefinite period
of time. The Units, if certificated, will bear a legend describing such transfer limitations.

17.2. United States Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974

An investment in the Units and the underlying Common LP Units and Class A Shares by certain U.S.
employee benefit plans is subject to additional considerations because the investments of such plans are
subject to the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of the U.S. Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and restrictions imposed by Section
4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “IRC”). For these purposes the term
“employee benefit plan” includes, but is not limited to, qualified pension, profit-sharing and stock bonus
plans, Keogh plans, simplified employee pension plans and tax deferred annuities or IRAs established or
maintained by an employer or employee organization. Among other things, such employee benefit plans
should give consideration to:

« whether the investment is prudent under ERISA.

e whether in making the investmeni, that plan will satisfy the diversification requirements of ERISA;
and

« whether the investment will result in recognition of unrelated business taxable income by the pian
and, if so, the potential after-tax investment return.

The person with investment discretion with respect to the assets of an employee benefit plan, often called
a fiduciary, should also determine whether an investment in the Units and the underlying Common LP
Units and Class A Shares is authorized by the appropriate governing instrument and is a proper
investment for the plan.

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the IRC also prohibit employee benefit plans, and also [RAs
that are not considered part of an employee benefit plan, from engaging in specified transactions
involving “plan assets with parties that are “parties in interest” under ERISA or “disqualified persons”
under the IRC with respect to the plan.

In addition to considering whether the purchase of Units and the Common LP Units and Class A Shares is
a prohibited transaction, a fiduciary of an employee benefit plan should consider whether the plan will, by
making such an investment, be deemed to own an undivided interest in the assets of KUE or the General
Partner, with the result that KUE or the General Partner would be subject to the regulatory restrictions of
ERISA, including its prohibited transaction rules, as well as the prohibited transaction rules of the IRC.

The U.S. Department of Labor regulations under ERISA provide guidance with respect to whether the
assets of an entity in which employee benefit plans acquire equity interests would be deemed “plan
assets” under some circumstances. Under these regulations, an entity's assets would not be considered
to be “plan assets” if, among other things:

{a} the equity interests acquired by employee benefit plans are publicly offered securities,
Le., the equity interests are widely held by 100 or more investors independent of the

Mohamed Bouazizi and the symbolism of his fate that sparked all the
revolutions across the Middle East.

The images of the rebels in Libya liberating their country (as it seems
they are close to doing) and chanting songs of freedom, like their
Egyptian and Tunisian counterparts before them, will no doubt be
another powerful inspiration and morale booster for the Syrian
people.

Qaddafi’s departure will also make it possible for the international
community to devote more attention and energy to Syria and come up
with more creative and coordinated policies to assist the Syrian
people, short of bombing Damascus or sending arms. That all eyes
are currently on Assad is certainly bad news for the dictator.

Yet whatever the international community devises, the Syrian protest
movement must do a better job organizing and convincing the world
that it is more or less ready to take over once Assad falls. For that, the
protesters need to create a truly united and inclusive political front
(the National Council which the Syrian opposition formed today in
Istanbul is a good first step, but it remains leaderless and still needs
to come up with a tangible platform that goes beyond the demands
for freedom and regime change).

Interviews with Arab intellectuals and ordinary citizens broadcast on
satellite TV channels across the Arab world tell us that many Arabs
believe that the rebels in Libya have made a mistake in asking for
Western (“colonial”) military intervention. But the rebels' salvation is
that they quickly came together and formed a transitional council,
gaining world recognition and persuading major powers that the
alternative to Qaddafi is indeed viable.

Right now, the West, and especially Syria’s neighbors, are concerned
that Assad’s departure will lead to chaos and perhaps even sectarian,
civil war that could spill over to other parts of the region.

The Guild decided to abandon any pretense of reporting neutrally on human rights and has
continued to serve only as the legal and political arm of the hard left. It has now lost all of its
credibility as a human rights organization.

Nor was the Guild alone in shifting from “a purely human rights perspective” to a largely political
perspective that used the label of human rights selectively against its ideological enemies. Other
organizations which were founded on the principles of neutral human rights, such as Human
Rights Watch,'” the Carter Center and Amnesty International,

'® As an early supporter of Human Rights Watch and an admirer of its founder, I have taken upon myself
the responsibility of monitoring its actions very carefully—of guarding the guardians. I was particularly
critical of its reporting on Israel’s war against Hezbollah in 20___, after Hezbollah fired thousands of
rockets at civilian targets in the north of Israel.

I focused on the highly publicized “conclusion” reached by Human Rights Watch allegedly after extensive
“imvestigations” on the ground:

“Human Rights Watch found no cases in which Hezbollah deliberately used civilians as shields
to protect them from retaliatory IDF attack.” (emphasis added)

After investigating a handful of cases, Human Rights Watch found that in “none of the cases of civilian
deaths documented in this report [Qana, Srifa, Tyre, and southern Beirut] is there evidence to suggest that
Hezbollah forces or weapons were in or near the area that the IDF targeted during or just prior to the
attack.”

No cases! None! Not one! That’s what Human Rights watch reported to the world.

But anyone who watched even a smattering of TV during the war saw with their own eyes direct evidence
of rockets being launched from civilian areas. Not Human Rights Watch. “Who are you going to believe,
me or your lying eyes?” That’s not Chico Marx. It’s Human Rights Watch. Their lying eyes belonged to
the pro-Hezbollah witnesses its investigators chose to interview—and claimed to believe. But their
mendacious pens belonged to Kenneth Roth, HRW’s Executive Director, and his minions in New York,
who know how to be skeptical when it serves their interests not to believe certain witnesses. How could an
organization, which claims to be objective, have been so demonstrably wrong about so central a point in
so important a war? Could it have been an honest mistake? I don’t think so. Despite its boast that
“Human Rights Watch has interviewed victims and witness of attacks in on-on-one settings, conducted on-
site inspections ... and collected information for hospitals, humanitarian groups, and government
agencies,” it didn’t find one instance in which Hezbollah failed to segregate its fighters from civilians.

In arriving at this counter-factual conclusion, Human Rights Watch willfully ignored credible news
sources, such as The New York Times, The New Yorker and other sources.

After I exposed the double standard practiced by Human Rights Watch, its founder, Robert Bernstein, wrote the
following in the New York Times.

As the founder of Human Rights Watch, its active chairman for 20 years and now founding chairman
emeritus, I must do something that I never anticipated: I must publicly join the group’s critics. Human
Rights Watch had as its original mission to pry open closed societies, advocate basic freedoms and support

Edwards and Cassell instead want him to rule that prosecutors violated the Crime Victims’ Rights Act.
Once that determination is made, Marra could then decide what remedies to impose, the two lawyers
argue.

Under the act, neither of their clients can seek “damages” from the government but the attorneys have
suggested Marra could order the government to pay the women restitution, impose a monetary
sanction and pay their legal fees.

Still, Cassell insisted: “This isn’t about money, it’s about justice.”

Cassell, who is a law professor at the University of Utah, said the case is being watched closely by
victims’ rights advocates along with federal lawmakers who pushed the legislation through Congress
and have publicly questioned prosecutors’ handling of Epstein’s case.

A decision ordering federal prosecutors to reopen the investigation could establish a national
precedent, he said. “It will be a big win for the victims,” Cassell said. “That's the way we look at it.”

NEW: 3 things to know from Wellington council
meeting Tuesday

by Kristina Webb, Palm Beach Post Staff Writer

Here are three things to know after Tuesday night’s Wellington
council meeting: 1. The village council held its final vote and
approved the coming fiscal year’s tax rate, 2.43, and $110 million
budget. Though the tax rate is down from this year’s 2.44, residents
still will see a slight increase in their tax bills because property...

Walt Disney

The Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is one of the strongest brands in the world. It also possesses multiple revenue
streams and pricing power. Q1 EPS jumped 23% year over year based on record revenue. When a company
delivers record revenue, that trend doesn’t make a sudden U-turn. If there's going to be a turnaround for the
worse, it will take time to play out, giving you time to exit your position. (For related reading, see: This

Company Is No Mickey Mouse Operation.)

CBS

CBS Corp.'s (CBS) Q4 revenue increased 3% and diluted EPS improved 8%. CBS also announced a $1 billion
share buyback in the first quarter. This will significantly reduce the share count, which should improve
earings. CBS will once again have Thursday Night Football, and it will be the home of Super Bowl 50. It’s
also home to regular-season NFL games, March Madness and The Masters. However, its reach goes well
beyond sports.

Comcast

FY2014 revenue at Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) increased 6.4%. Operating cash flow and EPS improved 6.9%
and 25%, respectively. Comcast also increased its dividend 11% and announced that $4.25 billion of its $10
billion share buyback program would take place in 2015. (For more, see: This Company is as Unavoidable as it
is Unloved.)

Twenty-First Century Fox

Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.'s (FOXA) Q2 operating income before depreciation and amortization increased
12%. Fox studios enjoyed 24 Academy Award nominations in 2015, making it the industry leader. Twenty-First
Century Fox also recently created the Europe’s leading pay TV business.

Google

Google Inc. (GOOGL) is known as more of a technology company than a media company, but its YouTube
segment consumes approximately 15% of all broadband traffic in the United States and Canada (only Netflix,
Inc. (NFLX) is higher at 35%). Google also makes this list because of its $62.63 billion in cash, which means it
can enter any business it pleases. If it chooses to expand its media presence, then it would likely steal share
from some of the current industry leaders. (For related reading, see: How Google's Self-Driving Car Will
Change Everything.)

Speculative Media Stocks
Charter Communications

Q4 revenue jumped 9.9% at Charter Communications, Inc. (CHTR) thanks to higher customer penetration on
Internet, video, and commercial businesses. Another positive is that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A) recently
increased its position in CHTR by adding 1.2 million shares. CHTR now represents 1.35% of the fund’s
portfolio. The reason CHTR is on the speculative list is a lack of profitability.

Discovery Communications

Differentiation is the key here thanks to Discovery Communications, Inc.'s (DISCA) success with docudramas.
In FY2014, revenue increased 13%, adjusted earnings per diluted share improved 13%, free cash flow increased
2%, and $1.4 billion worth of stock was repurchased. The biggest risks here are a challenging U.S. market and
currency headwinds. It should also be pointed out that there is an 11% short position on the stock. (For related

“exogenous” or unexplained by whatever we suppose that we give up in exchange.
This book takes the next step in the same direction. The role of thrift is zero. It is
politicians, not economists, who will be flummoxed. The double tax and the tax
preference for capital gains are examples of policies favoring investment over
consumption to benefit growth. The record shows no such benefit in any country

ever. From all evidence so far, free growth theory is free growth fact.

A New Way to Measure

What this book tries to add is not only the next step in Solow’s direction. My
simultaneous rates method offers a new means of testing. Twentieth century growth
theory, led first by Keynes’ colleague Sir Roy Harrod and then by Solow, has tried to
gauge the effectiveness of consumption restraint by a different method from Mill’s
and mine. It has looked for effects on later output rather than on current capital
growth. | call it the lagged flows method. Why the lag? Because if output is growth of
wealth (capital) plus consumption, a shift from the third to the second cannot
change output at the same time. Rather output should benefit after a lag of a few
years for the capital that produces it to accumulate. Capital investment plants a tree,

and output growth is the new fruit expected to follow.

The lagged flow method makes sense, and there was nothing better until data for
market-valued capital began appearing in 1990 or so. But the lag tends to blur
causality. Later changes in output could have later causes. And output itself, after
the lag, could not be measured reliably for lack of the same data. It has been
measured as gross or net domestic product, reported as the sum of consumption
and book investment. Books don’t get the news until new assets are bought or new
products sold. We just saw the anomalous book results reported for 1929, 1930,
1933 (the opposite distortion), 1937 and 2008. Those are not the only examples. My
method measures output as consumption plus change in market-valued capital. It
seems to me that Piketty and Zucman ought to have shown output this way, at least

as an alternative version. Isn’t it inconsistent to measure capital at market, but to

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013020.txt,"104 5 A Generic Architecture of Human-Like Cognition

left as implicit emergent phenomena. For instance, creativity is obviously very important to
intelligence, but, there is no creativity box in any of these diagrams — because in our view,
and the view of the cognitive theorists whose work we’ve directly drawn on here, creativity
is best viewed as a process emergent from other processes that are explicitly included in the
diagrams.

5.4 Interpretation and Application of the Integrative Diagram

A tongue-partly-in-cheek definition of a biological pathway is a subnetwork of a biological
network, that fits on a single journal page. Cognitive architecture diagrams have a similar
property — they are crude abstractions of complex structures and dynamics, sculpted in ac-
cordance with the size of the printed page, and the tolerance of the human eye for absorbing
diagrams, and the tolerance of the human author for making diagrams.

However, sometimes constraints — even arbitrary ones — are useful for guiding creative ef-
forts, due to the fact that they force choices. Creating an architecture for human-like general
intelligence that fits in a few (okay, seven) fairly compact diagrams, requires one to make many
choices about what features and relationships are most essential. In constructing the integrative
diagram, we have sought to make these choices, not purely according to our own tastes in cog-
nitive theory or AGI system design, but according to a sort of blend of the taste and judgment
of a number of scientists whose views we respect, and who seem to have fairly compatible,
complementary perspectives.

What is the use of a cognitive architecture diagram like this? It can help to give newcomers
to the field a basic idea about what is known and suspected about the nature of human-like
general intelligence. Also, it could potentially be used as a tool for cross-correlating different
AGI architectures. If everyone who authored an AGI architecture would explain how their archi-
tecture accounts for each of the structures and processes identified in the integrative diagram,
this would give a means of relating the various AGI designs to each other.

The integrative diagram could also be used to help connect AGI and cognitive psychology
to neuroscience in a more systematic way. In the case of LIDA, a fairly careful correspondence
has been drawn up between the LIDA diagram nodes and links and various neural structures
and processes [F B08]. Similar knowledge exists for the rest of the integrative diagram, though
not organized in such a systematic fashion. A systematic curation of links between the nodes
and links in the integrative diagram and current neuroscience knowledge, would constitute an
interesting first approximation of the holistic cognitive behavior of the human brain.

Finally (and harking forward to later chapters), the big omission in the integrative diagram
is dynamics. Structure alone will only get you so far, and you could build an AGI system with
reasonable-looking things in each of the integrative diagram’s boxes, interrelating according to
the given arrows, and yet still fail to make a viable AGI system. Given the limitations the
real world places on computing resources, it’s not enough to have adequate representations
and algorithms in all the boxes, communicating together properly and capable doing the right
things given sufficient resources. Rather, one needs to have all the boxes filled in properly
with structures and processes that, when they act together using feasible computing resources,
will yield appropriately intelligent behaviors via their cooperative activity. And this has to do
with the complex interactive dynamics of all the processes in all the different boxes — which is

11. Over the next few weeks, Jeffrey Epstein and Ghis-
laine Maxwell trained me to do what they wanted, including
sexual activities. The training was in New York and Florida,
at Epstein’s mansion. It was basically every day and it was
like going to school. I also had to have sex with Epstein many
times.

12. I was trained to be “everything a man wanted me to
be.” It wasn’t just sexual training—they wanted me to be
able to cater to all the needs of the men they were going to
send me to. They said that they loved that I was very compli-
ant and knew how to keep my mouth shut about what they
expected me to do.

13. Epstein and Maxwell also told me that they wanted
me to produce information for them in addition to perform-
ing sex on the men. They told me to pay attention to the
details about what the men wanted, so I could report back to
them.

14. While I had juvenile hopes of bettering my life, from
very early on I was also afraid of Epstein. Epstein told me he
was a billionaire. I told my mother that I was working for
this rich guy, and she said “go, go far away.” Epstein had
promised me a lot, and I knew if I left I would be in big trou-
ble. I was witness to a lot of illegal and bad behavior by
Epstein and his friends. If I left Epstein, he knew all kinds of
powerful people. He could have had me killed or abducted,
and I knew he was capable of that if I did not obey him. He
let me know that he knew many people in high places. Speak-
ing about himself, he said “I can get away” with things. Even
as a teenager, I understood what this meant and it scared me,

what Nicole Bacharan, a social scientist, calls “the one-man soap
opera.”

These were more than peccadilloes. But sharp elbows were needed to
shift France from sleepwalk mode.

Only in recent weeks has the distance traveled come into focus:
France, reintegrated in 2009 into the command structure of NATO,
spearheading the United Nations-backed NATO military operation in
Libya; providing armed muscle to the U.N. forces in Ivory Coast; and
giving its pacifist-trending ally Germany a lesson in 21st-century
Atlanticism.

Adenauer and de Gaulle must be turning in their graves. Here was
Germany standing wobbly with Brazil, Russia, India and China —
and against its closest allies, France and the United States — in the
U.N. vote on Libyan military action. And here was France providing
America’s most vigorous NATO support.

This was a dramatic inversion of postwar roles. It revealed the drift of
a navel-gazing Germany unprepared to lead despite its power and
impatient with Adenauer’s Western anchoring. It also demonstrated
France’s break under Sarkozy from the posturing Gaullist notion of a
French “counterweight” to America. These are seismic European
shifts.

In Benghazi, the capital of free Libya, when they see a NATO aircraft
they say, “There goes another Sarkozy.” After the French shame of
Rwanda, a genocide where Mitterrand let time do its fullest work,
that’s something.

Perhaps it’s only now with Sarkozy that another, deeper French
shame is passing, one Mitterrand and Chirac knew: the “strange
defeat” of 1940 with its paralyzing subsequent obfuscations.
Certainly, a presidential election next year has not been unrelated to
Sarkozy’s activism. Nor has a compensatory urge after France took

“Tt was all done with little publicity and little fanfare, and we gave only two days for
registering,” he said.

The objective of the course, Professor Dershowitz said, would be “to assess the role of the
lawyer, as professional and citizen, in both the domestic and foreign aspects of the
conflict.” He said the course would explore “the relevance of law to this country’s
involvement in Vietnam.””°

Time Magazine began its story this way:

“Viet Nam is the most significant social, political and legal issue of the day,” said Harvard
Law Professor Alan Dershowitz last week. “And a law school should be concerned with
the issues of the day,” Dershowitz had just finished giving the first class in a brand-new,
ten-week Harvard course entitled “The Role of the Law and the Lawyer in the Viet Nam
Conflict.” It has no exam or grades, offers no credit, and involves a good deal of reading
over and above the students’ already heavy regular work load. But it has a record
enrollment of more than 400—one-quarter of the student body—and is one of the most
popular courses in the 150-year history of the school.

The course will cover such questions as the international-law aspects of the war, the
division of war-making responsibility between the President and Congress, free speech and
dissent, the draft and the rights of an inductee, and the status of a conscientious objector
to a specific war.

Lawyers who were contemplating legal action against the war sat in on the class and several
faculty members, who were not involved in the teaching, attended as well. I received dozens of
requests for copies of the materials from professors at other schools who wanted to offer the
course to their students. For me, it was the beginning of a practice that I have followed
throughout my teaching career: offering courses about highly relevant contemporaneous issues
that respond to interesting teaching moments. Over the half-century of my teaching at Harvard
Law School, I have offered a new course just about every year. Many of them have dealt with
pressing issues of human rights generated by the conflicts of the day.

In addition to teaching courses I wrote article on human rights and brought lawsuits challenging
human rights abuses. And I participated in political campaigns to end apartheid, the War in
Vietnam and other human wrongs. My early work on human rights won me a coveted
Guggenheim fellowship and other honors. It also earned me the media title “Global Watchdog.”
In an article by that name, the reporter interviewed me about my definition of human rights:

“T’m less concerned with causes than I am with concepts of equality, fairness, due process,
civil liberties, and free speech...”

ongoing regional crises. It thus is a vote that could have significant
consequences.

The Palestinian Divide

Let's begin with the issue not of the right of a nation to have a state
but of the nature of a Palestinian state under current circumstances.
The Palestinians are split into two major factions. The first, Fatah,
dominates the West Bank. Fatah derives its ideology from the older,
secular Pan-Arab movement. Historically, Fatah saw the Palestinians
as a State within the Arab nation. The second, Hamas, dominates
Gaza. Unlike Fatah, it sees the Palestinians as forming part of a
broader Islamist uprising, one in which Hamas is the dominant
Islamist force of the Palestinian people.

The Pan-Arab rising is moribund. Where it once threatened the
existence of Muslim states, like the Arab monarchies, it is now itself
threatened. Mubarak, Syrian President Bashar al Assad and Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi all represented the old Pan-Arab vision. A
much better way to understand the Arab Spring is that it
represented the decay of such regimes that were vibrant when they
came to power in the late 1960s and early 1970s but have fallen into
ideological meaninglessness. Fatah is part of this grouping, and while
it still speaks for Palestinian nationalism as a secular movement,
beyond that it is isolated from broader trends in the region. It is both
at odds with rising religiosity and simultaneously mistrusted by the
monarchies it tried to overthrow. Yet it controls the Palestinian proto-
state, the Palestinian National Authority, and thus will be claiming a
U.N. vote on Palestinian statehood. Hamas, on the other hand, is very
much representative of current trends in the Islamic world and holds
significant popular support, yet it is not clear that it holds a majority
position in the Palestinian nation.

text and history indicate, these statutes were designed to address problems that are truly national
and international in scope: human trafficking in § 1591; telephone or Internet sexual predation in
§ 2422; and sex tourism in § 2423. Unlike the alleged conduct at issue here, those problems
unquestionably present multi-jurisdictional obstacles that States and localities cannot confront
effectively on their own. Mr. Epstein’s conduct was purely local in nature, and the State of
Florida and Palm Beach County are effectively prosecuting and punishing that conduct.

Although CEOS asserts, “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look precisely like the
cases that came before it is not dispositive” (CEOS letter at p. 4), the fact is this case does not look
anything like those cases. The facts here do not carry any of the hallmarks that typify an appropriate
federal prosecution for child exploitation as reflected in all such prior federal prosecutions.
Specifically, the facts here do not carry the hallmarks for a sex trafficking or child prostitution
prosecution.. Mr. Epstein did not target minors. In fact, the evidence indicates just the opposite.
There was no travel in interstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual activity.
There was no prohibited use ofa facility of interstate commerce. There was no commercial for profit
sexual enterprise. There was no force. There was no violence. There was no use of drugs or
alcohol. There was no child pornography. .

18 U.S.C. § 1591 is clearly designed to combat organized rings of individuals who engage in
the business of human trafficking, involving both a commercial and coercive component. As
President Bush has noted:

generally speaking, trafficking in persons refers to actions, often including the use of
force, fraud or coercion, to compel someone into a situation in which he or she will
be exploited for sexual purposes, which could include prostitution or pornography, or
for labor without compensation, which could include forced or bonded labor. . .
trafficking in persons is often linked to organized crime, and the profits from
trafficking enterprises help fund other illegal activities. The growth of vast
transnational criminal networks supported in part by trafficking in persons fosters
official corruption and threatens the rule of law.”

This in no way describes the case here. Yet the USAO has been unwavering in its single
minded focus to stretch the limits of these federal statutes beyond their intended use, and beyond
precedent, in order to prosecute Mr. Epstein. As the CEOS letter acknowledges, the legal theories
the USAO intends to attempt to pursue against Mr. Epstein are “novel,” having never before been
sanctioned by federal law. They should not be sanctioned now. As the Supreme Court recently
pronounced, when a statutory term in a criminal statute could support both a narrow or broad
application of the federal criminal law, “the tie must go to the defendant.” United States v. Santos,
553 U.S.___ and Cuellar v. United States, 553 U.S ___ (June 2, 2008), Slip Op. at 6.

according to the laws of compromise, the following which has been recently developing into highly

see below (and this only the very tip of the iceberg) how many people they've been able to engulf
and what advances have been made by the quite elaborate criminal class employing these tactics;
and one also begins to better understand the events surrounding Justice Scalia's passing and what's
to come for the 35 guests in Scalia's private party. As for Scalia's passing, it was decidedly
suspicious as noted by William Ritchie: (The Washington Post prints) “As a former homicide
commander, | am stunned that no autopsy was ordered for Justice Scalia,” William O. Ritchie, former
head of criminal investigations for D.C. police, wrote in a post on Facebook on Sunday... Ritchie also
raised questions about the marshals’ actions: “How can the Marshal say, without a thorough post
mortem, that he was not injected with an illegal substance that would simulate a heart attack... Did
the US Marshal check for petechial hemorrhage in his eyes or under his lips that would have
suggested suffocation? Did the US Marshal smell his breath for any unusual odor that might suggest
poisoning? My gut tells me there is something fishy going on in Texas.”

As for SAIC, the following also pertains:

(| write) If you first see SAIC as what's called a systems integrator (author Tim Shorrock's phrase),
and also the formerly married Bud and Sue Horton and their two grown sons Matthew Horton and
Ben Lanier as aids of an implementation, you can better see the bigger picture:

into joint venture with SAIC (Sue's employer prior to IBM, btw) on an enormous (billion dollar) 2011
Hillary Clinton State Department award (http://Awww.prnewswire.com/.../saic-tetra-tech-joint-venture-

(2) that Bud Horton left IBM in early 2009-ish for an executive position at Accenture which soon
thereafter entered into joint venture with SAIC spin-off Leidos, and Cerner, on an enormous (billion
dollar) 2015 DoD award (http://www.healthcareitnews.com/.../dod-names-ehr-contract-wi...);

(3) that the Sue Horton contract was used to grow and fortify the Afghan heroin trade (as well as
corrupt law enforcement) although the stated intention was of course the opposite... ([SAIC and

Kostelich , 1989). Bowen’s “shadow lemma” in support of a thin film of points over
the skelton of unstable fixed points of attractors is the fundamental reason that short
sample length time series can often discriminate between control and experimental

conditions in brain research studies.

Another recently implemented entropy, called “approximate entropy,” is
exploiting the underlying unstable fixed point skeletal shadowing principle in
expansive dynamical systems to find statistically significant differences between
control and experimental results in reasonably short, physiologically realistic,
sample lengths (Pincus, 1991; Pincus et al, 1991). This algorithm is somewhat
derivative of those involved in the computation of the correlation dimension (see
above). Instead of computing across a range (and taking the limits) of embedding
dimensions, d, and sequential paired-vectorial distances, ¢«, it empirically tailors and
fixes them to compute a “logarithmic likelihood” that points remains close through
incremental change in the time series. The “approximate entropy” is not easily
relatable to either hy and hy. One is tempted to predict that this geometrically

oriented algorithm might be fooled into a postive entropy diagnosis if applied to
strange, nonchaotic dynamical systems with fractal dimension but no 4(+) -related

mixing. Since sequence position is conserved in this computation, two
simultaneously studied (“multiparameter”) systems can be examined for their mutual
coherence as the “cross approximate entropy.” Among the interesting findings from
applications of this index to neuroendocrine studies are an increase in approximate
entropy in LH and FSH secretory patterns with age in both sexes, perhaps
quantitatively heralding menopause (Pincus and Minkin, 1998) and decreased cross
approximate entropy, a decrease in regulatory coupling between ACTH and cortisol

secretion patterns in patients with Cushing’s syndrome (Roelfsema et al, 1998).

Among the many of other empirically derived entropies, one is called “power
spectral entropy,” which is equivalent to the normalized variance of the distribution
of frequencies in a power spectral transformation of a time series (Farmer et al,

1980). This has been successfully applied to brain enzyme and receptor fluctuations

Larry has told me that you and a friend would like to contribute to my project (hallelujah and thank you a 
million times, Jeffrey) and that I ought to write up a proposal asking for 500,000. This is wonderful. If this 
comes to pass, the best way for that money to come, I think, is as a gift to Poetry in America, an initiative at 
EdLabs at Harvard University. This will give me discretion over its disbursement to HarvardX and WGBH, 
but this will be absolutely be a Harvard gift that will count as Campaign success and from which Harvard will 
take some (but not as much)overhead. . So far the best finance people I've met are at EdLabs and they are 
happy to manage these funds for me. There are other ways to give me this money that leave Harvard out, but 
my understanding is that your friend would like this to be a Harvard gift. 
Here's a draft of what I'd like to do with that money. 
I'd like 500,000 to do post-production and distribution of a whole historical period of American poetry (1914-
1945 is what I'm thinking—Modernism) and including three episodes of tv. 
The raw materials for that period include interviews with Bill Clinton (including footage not yet used by 
WGBH), Peter Gallison, Walter Isaacson, Lena Dunham, Woody Allen (whose lawyers didn't like our release 
a while ago, but we're hoping will soften over time), Harrison Ford (still a maybe), Robert Polito, Sarah Kay, 
Al Filreis, Rafael Campo, Susan Howe, kids from Nantucket High School, kids from Brookline High 
School, Alfre Woodard, Jane Pickering, Jay Parini, Ray Dalio, Leon Wieseltier, Richard Dawkins and others; 
and footage shot in Harlem, Greenwich Village, midtown, Chicago, London (if I have the money to hire a 
crew there; don't now ), at museums including the Fogg, Harvard Museum of Natural History, Frost's house in 
Ripton Vermont and more. 
This allows the donor to give to a big Harvard Campaign priority, Teaching and Learning , by supporting 
Poetry in America, allowing me to produce the crucial segment of the online course with the highest (TV 
quality) production values and so also supplying higher quality video to WGBH as a way also to cut their 
costs. 
Currently, HarvardX skimps (on lighting, for instance--see the Bill Clinton interview) and while WGBH ladles 
money raised by others into everything. I have been pounding away at my friends at WGBH and I know that 
WGBH producer will work with HarvardX if they can give him footage of the right quality. . That is, we'll use 
HarvardX as the backlot for WGBH so as to squeeze three episodes out for 250. 
This proposal does not include experiments in schools or the curricular development into courses for teachers 
that you've seen in other (million dollar ) proposals. But the courses for teachers can't happen before the 
footage is developed, and these courses will have as their centerpiece the WGBH episodes, and so this funding 
will make all the rest possible. 
I can polish this narrative and or edit it, if there are things you think I have wrong. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029221 
And I can attach a draft budget based on real Harvard numbers (what my Harvard video editor, producer, 
media manager cost) as well as a draft WGBH budget I'll now go an negotiate with them. Or we can do that at 
a second stage. 
Let me know what you think? And when are we reading Whitman together. Why don't we set a date for Feb 
when Poetry in America 3: Whitman is running online and we could screen a little video and then have a 
discussion around your table with you and some friends?

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016277.txt,"and output to sense organs and muscles, then we would reproduce, in a physical artifact,
the observed manifestations of natural intelligence. Nothing observable would be
missing. As an observer, I'd have no less (and no more) reason to ascribe consciousness,
creativity, or evil to that artifact than I do to ascribe those properties to its natural
counterparts, like other human beings.

Thus, by combining Crick’s “astonishing hypothesis” in neurobiology with
powerful evidence from physics, we deduce that natural intelligence is a special case of
artificial intelligence. That conclusion deserves a name, and I will call it “the astonishing
corollary.”

With that, we have the answer to our three questions. Since consciousness,
creativity, and evil are obvious features of natural human intelligence, they are possible
features of artificial intelligence.

A hundred years ago, or even fifty, to believe the hypothesis that mind emerges
from matter, and to infer our corollary that natural intelligence is a special case of
artificial intelligence, would have been leaps of faith. In view of the many surrounding
gaps—chasms, really—in contemporary understanding of biology and physics, they were
genuinely doubtful propositions. But epochal developments in those areas have changed
the picture:

In biology: A century ago, not only thought but also metabolism, heredity, and
perception were deeply mysterious aspects of life that defied physical explanation.
Today, of course, we have extremely rich and detailed accounts of metabolism, heredity,
and many aspects of perception, from the bottom up, starting at the molecular level.

In physics: After a century of quantum physics and its application to materials,
physicists have discovered, over and over, how rich and strange the behavior of matter
can be. Superconductors, lasers, and many other wonders demonstrate that large
assemblies of molecular units, each simple in itself, can exhibit qualitatively new,
“emergent” behavior, while remaining fully obedient to the laws of physics. Chemistry,
including biochemistry, is a cornucopia of emergent phenomena, all now quite firmly
grounded in physics. The pioneering physicist Philip Anderson, in an essay titled “More
Is Different,” offers a classic discussion of emergence. He begins by acknowledging that
“the reductionist hypothesis [1.e., the completeness of physical explanations based on
known interactions of simple parts] may still be a topic for controversy among
philosophers, but among the great majority of active scientists I think it is accepted
without question.” But he goes on to emphasize that “[t]he behavior of large and
complex aggregates of elementary particles, it turns out, is not to be understood in terms
of a simple extrapolation of the properties of a few particles.”!> Each new level of size
and complexity supports new forms of organization, whose patterns encode information
in new ways and whose behavior is best described using new concepts.

Electronic computers are a magnificent example of emergence. Here, all the
cards are on the table. Engineers routinely design, from the bottom up, based on known
(and quite sophisticated) physical principles, machines that process information in
extremely impressive ways. Your iPhone can beat you at chess, quickly collect and
deliver information about anything, and take great pictures, too. Because the process
whereby computers, smartphones, and other intelligent objects are designed and
manufactured is completely transparent, there can be no doubt that their wonderful

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016263.txt,"It’s an old, old story, with many well-known chapters in evolutionary history.
Most mammals can synthesize their own vitamin C, but primates, having opted for a diet
composed largely of fruit, lost the innate ability. We are now obligate ingesters of
vitamin C, but not obligate frugivores like our primate cousins, since we have opted for
technology that allows us to make, and take, vitamins as needed. The self-perpetuating
patterns that we call human beings are now dependent on clothes, cooked food, vitamins,
vaccinations, .. . credit cards, smartphones, and the Internet. And—tomorrow if not
already today—AI.

Wiener foresaw the problems that Turing and the other optimists have largely
overlooked. The real danger, he said, is

that such machines, though helpless by themselves, may be used by a human being or a
block of human beings to increase their control over the rest of the race or that political
leaders may attempt to control their populations by means not of machines themselves
but through political techniques as narrow and indifferent to human possibility as if they
had, in fact, been conceived mechanically. (p. 181)

The power, he recognized, lay primarily in the algorithms, not the hardware they run on,
although the hardware of today makes practically possible algorithms that would have
seemed preposterously cumbersome in Wiener’s day. What can we say about these
“techniques” that are “narrow and indifferent to human possibility”? They have been
introduced again and again, some obviously benign, some obviously dangerous, and
many in the omnipresent middle ground of controversy.

Consider a few of the skirmishes. My late friend Joe Weizenbaum, Wiener’s
successor as MIT’s Jeremiah of hi-tech, loved to observe that credit cards, whatever their
virtues, also provided an inexpensive and almost foolproof way for the government, or
corporations, to track the travels and habits and desires of individuals. The anonymity of
cash has been largely underappreciated, except by drug dealers and other criminals, and
now it may be going extinct. This may make money laundering a more difficult technical
challenge in the future, but the AI pattern finders arrayed against it have the side effect of
making us all more transparent to any “block of human beings” that may “attempt to
control” us.

Looking to the arts, the innovation of digital audio and video recording lets us pay
a small price (in the eyes of all but the most ardent audiophiles and film lovers) when we
abandon analog formats, and in return provides easy—all too easy?—reproduction of
artworks with almost perfect fidelity. But there is a huge hidden cost. Orwell’s Ministry
of Truth is now a practical possibility. AI techniques for creating all-but-undetectable
forgeries of “recordings” of encounters are now becoming available which will render
obsolete the tools of investigation we have come to take for granted in the last hundred
and fifty years. Will we simply abandon the brief Age of Photographic Evidence and
return to the earlier world in which human memory and trust provided the gold standard,
or will we develop new techniques of defense and offense in the arms race of truth? (We
can imagine a return to analog film-exposed-to-light, kept in “tamper-proof” systems
until shown to juries, etc., but how long would it be before somebody figured out a way
to infect such systems with doubt? One of the disturbing lessons of recent experience 1s
that the task of destroying a reputation for credibility is much less expensive than the task
of protecting such a reputation.) Wiener saw the phenomenon at its most general: “...1n

Leon,

Yesterday , I again spent hours upon hours of my time with your office. ,( speak to brad to get
flavor) and you and 1 will discuss the results in gory gruesome detail on Friday. it mirrored many other
weeks spent doing the things that I don;t have the time to do.

In order to keep things in perspective, maybe reviewing an analogy I have used before with you,

might be helpful. You and your family are a 6 billion dollar corp. with an income between 250 -500
million dollars per year. It contains a few operating biz's , a large wide array of existing investments,
in various categories ,a desire to enter into others. A panoply of loans, notes. purchases, wide range
of all types of taxes. , planes. boats homes. . trusts ,grats. a crazy number of bank accts. ( with no
oversight ) . law firms, acct firms, 800 page tax returns, foreign firms. art consultants.
construction consultants bill payers, home mgmt.,vast multitude of Ilc's , including foreign, and with
all that you only have a combined overhead of less that 3 million dollars.

I have previously sent you the very same note that i have enclosed again below ,this time with
highlights . I wrote it to you over a year ago. As my acute disability ( selective memory) seems to
have been raised as one of your concerns , as aruleI try to memorialize things in writing in an

collection and decryption unit, to the operational units like Sayeret Matkal. It
was what was at stake if things went wrong: success or failure in war, and the
life or death of thousands of men on the battlefield. It was a price we’d paid
painfully in 1973. And now again, just nine years later, in Lebanon.

If I needed any reminder, it was conveniently placed on my new office wall:
the photographs of each of my nine predecessors since 1948 as Head of the
Intelligence Directorate, or Rosh Aman in Hebrew. All had come to the role
with talent and dedication. All but three had either left under a shadow, or been
fired. Sometimes this was because of ultimately non-fatal lapses, like a botched
mobilization of our reserves in 1959, or the Rotem crisis a few months later.
Sometimes, it was due to lethal failures like the Yom Kippur War and Lebanon.

I went to see all eight former directors who were still alive. “You know, I
used to read the newspapers and listen to the BBC in the car to work,” Shlomo
Gazit told me. He was the director ’'d worked for in operational intelligence,
the one who’d so memorably made the point that we might endanger Israeli
security not only be missing the signs of a war, but signs of an opportunity for
peace. He was also one of the few to have left office without blemish. “By the
time I got to the Airya, I already knew 80 percent of what I could about what
was going on,” he said. “Then I’d spend six or seven hours reading intelligence
material, to fill in at least part of the remaining 20 percent.” His message,
echoed by my other predecessors, was that the job wasn’t mainly about the raw
information. It was what you concluded from the information, what you did
with it. It was about judgement.

The intelligence did matter, of course. For all of Israel’s strengths in that
area, I knew from my own experience at Sultan Yacoub that there was still
room to get more, better, and more timely information about our enemies, and
make sure it got to the commanders and field units that needed it. And while the
details of many operations I approved for Sayeret Matkal and other units remain
classified, we did succeed in doing that — to take just one example, by finding
an entirely new way to get intelligence from inside Syrian command posts.

Yet above all, I set out to apply the lessons of the 1973 and 1982 wars. In
rereading the official inquiry reports, I saw that the intelligence failings had

Epstein prefers diminutive women, but Nadia is tall. She’s
rail-thin and blond like the sun, with glowing skin, a wide smile,
and sky-high cheekbones.

On a good day, she could pass for a Bond girl—a woman
caught up in a web of crime and intrigue. But of course, that's

exactly what she is.

In certain circles, the academics and the women in Epstein’s
orbit are almost a joke. In a 2003 profile of him, New York maga-
zine quotes Harvard professors (“He is amazing”), Princeton
professors (“He changed my life”), MIT professors (“If 1 had acted
upon the investment advice he has given me over the years, I'd
be calling you from my Gulfstream right now”), and other lumi-
naries, up to and including Bill Clinton.

“Pye known Jeff for fifteen years,” says Donald Trump.
“Terrific guy; he’s a lot of fun to be with.”

No one knew then that someday Trump would run for presi-
dent. (When he does, he'll attack Hillary Clinton for Bill Clinton's
own entanglements with Epstein.) But Trump’s already ahead of
the curve in that he ends up severing his ties to Epstein well
before the police or the media get wind of Epstein’s penchant for

underage girls.

He does this because he finds out that in their endless hunt ~

be handed over to some future international body, or destroyed. “I
would certainly cheat,” the prime minister said. “And so would all the
others.” I was in no way surprised by this admission.

I agree that the problem of nuclear proliferation is real. Dealing with
it is an urgent and enormously important duty of the US government.
But it is a mistake to define the problem in such a way as to suggest
that any spread of nuclear weapons is dangerous or that nuclear
weapons in Iranian hands should be regarded as the same as nuclear
weapons in the hands of, say, Japan or Australia—or, for that matter,
that the weapons themselves are the problem. Yet the proponents of
global zero tend to deplore all nuclear weapons equally, no matter
who holds them, and to regard any diminution of their number as a
positive step because only subtraction leads to zero. But would a
reduction in the number of North Korean weapons together with an
increase in, say, those held by the French, yielding a net increase in
the number of weapons, be a bad thing? The problem is not the
weapons but the character of the regimes that possess them.

In many ways such a principle simplifies the proliferation problem
and makes it less daunting. Focus on the miscreants, on the few
countries seeking nuclear weapons whose possession of them would
be dangerous or destabilizing or both. Sanction them. Isolate them.
Undermine their regimes. Pressure them mercilessly. Do whatever it
takes. But don’t offer to aid their “peaceful” nuclear programs in
exchange for promises about weaponization that are so easily broken.
And don’t let them get away with the insulting notion that until we
ourselves disarm we have no right to demand that they halt their
clandestine programs—as if the US nuclear arsenal poses the same
danger to international peace and security as do the nuclear arsenals
of the regimes of Kim Jong-il or the [ranian clerics.

The goal of zero nuclear weapons, often referred to by its sponsors as
a “moral imperative,” inevitably delegitimizes and undermines

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026712.txt,"In the absence of long-term risk and performance
data, the role of ESG is unclear for many sovereigns
Environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing
looks to incorporate ethics and sustainability into

the investment process. Sovereigns are well placed

to implement ESG strategies (or component sub-
strategies) due to their scale, reach, size and long-
term orientation. In addition, many investment and
liability sovereigns have a clear basis to consider
sustainability factors in delivering their objectives,
given their own mandates and through their growing
internal management capability.

However, contrary to early expectations, uptake
of ESG practices appears to be less broad than
initially anticipated. On the one hand, established
sovereigns across Europe, Canada and Australia have
been pivotal to the evolution of ESG investing among
institutional investors. Many of these sovereigns were
crucial in the development of sovereign investment
strategies over past decades, and continue to have
high levels of influence over sovereign models globally
relative to their size. Against this, funds in the US
and emerging markets have been reluctant to commit
to ESG (figure 22) in the absence of objective data
on the investment risk/return trade-offs implicit in
these strategies.

While uptake of ESG has not increased in line
with historical expectations, there is a clear appetite
for perspectives and analysis from adopters, asset
managers and academics. In fact, among institutional
investors globally ESG is cited as the most important
area for thought leadership (NMG's Global Asset
Management Study 2017), highlighting investor
demand for greater understanding.

32

Qualified support for ‘environmental’ and ‘social’
screens given reputational risks of non-adoption,
however further commitment depends on emerging
evidence of investment implications
For sovereigns looking to adopt ESG investing, the
most common step is to introduce negative screens
on managers and securities which fall below ethical
standards (figure 23). This process lends itself to
environmental and social factors, given growing
levels of disclosure of carbon footprint and employee
diversity within public markets. Indeed, environmental
factors are among the ESG issues of greatest
importance to sovereigns shown in figure 24.

Certain sovereigns noted that negative
environmental and social screens can be simply
inserted into the investment process as an extra step
within security selection, with minimal additional
costs of management and expertise. Respondents
also stated that the measurement of the investment
impact of negative screens was simple, as the social
investment strategy was most often constructed
from a fully inclusive benchmark.

Despite some non-users citing analysis showing
the negative effect of ESG screening strategies
on short-term returns, there was a sense among
interviewees that greater levels of disclosure
increased reputational risk of non-adoption relative
to high-profile ESG adopters.

of all of the facts in order to have a defense in the event of a subsequent prosecution.”). Thus, the
facts preclude reliance on the concept of deliberate ignorance as a substitute for proof.

The fact that the search warrant affidavit in this case is rife with mis-statements and
omissions regarding the key element of age is critical. However, CEOS concludes with no apparent
supporting analysis, “despite the numerous factual errors you describe, the U.S. Attorney’s Office
could still plausibly argue that the mistakes — whether inadvertent or intentional — were not material
to the determination... .” (CEOS letter at p. 3). Although, as CEOS notes, there are “numerous”
such misrepresentations, through affirmative statement or intentional omission, a focus on but one of
those misrepresentations highlights that such misrepresentations were, in fact, material. The fact is
that Detective ReCarey grossly misrepresented Mr. Epstein’s intent as it related to the age of the
women he permitted entry to his residence.

In the search warrant affidavit, Detective ReCarey affirmed that] claimed:

[Mr. Epstein} told her the younger the better.
And, stated she once tried to bring a 23 year old female and Epstein stated that the

female was too old.

What Detective ReCarey, no doubt intentionally, omitted wa further explanation,
which rendered Mr. Epstein’s comments innocuous:

A: Let me put it this way, he — I tried to bring him a woman who was 23 and he didn’t
really like it.

He didn’t go for it?

A: It’s not that he didn’t go for it. It’s just that he didn’t care for it. And he likes the
girls that are between the ages of 18 and 20. (GES tatement at 12) (emphasis
added).

Had that critical information, information that turns allegedly illegal conduct into more
innocent conduct, been included, it would have seriously undermined the probable cause for the
search warrant.

Similarly, and equally problematic, Detective ReCarey did not include the many statements
demonstrating that, when asked by Mr. Epstein, the women affirmatively misrepresented their ages
as being 18, and/or that Mr. Epstein was not aware of their true ages. Indeed, although Detective
ReCarey did note that Ms told Mr. Epstein that she was 18, he omitted from the affidavit
the key point as to why she lied:

Amnesty International, detainees have been beaten with sticks and
cables, and sometimes deprived of food. Unlike in Libya there are no
NATO forces to protect Syria’s cities or parts of the country from the
murderous attacks inflicted by a regime that is now losing the last
threads of international legitimacy. Assad has a more effective army
than Qaddafi and powerful friends in Iran, Lebanon, and Iraq.

In contrast to Libya, military action in defense of Syria’s beleaguered
population would barely attract a shred of international support.
While the Arab League voted unanimously for the no-fly zone to
protect the people of Benghazi, in the case of Syria it has not even
mentioned the country by name, merely declaring that pro-democracy
protesters “deserve support, not bullets.”

As The New York Times pointed out in an editorial, the UN Security
Council “hasn’t even been able to muster a press statement. Russia
and China, as ever, are determined to protect autocrats.” Israel has
been watching and waiting with alarm as the outcome of the unrest in
Syria becomes more and more uncertain. Despite his alliance with
Iran and refusal to recognize the Jewish state, Assad is the devil it
knows best. Prolonged instability or a Salafist regime could only
make matters worse.

WITH his panoramic view of world affairs sharper than ever, Paul Keating blames the current global crisis 
on blunders by European and US leaders and warns that Australia must rediscover the keys to national 
success. 
Interviewed in his Sydney office, furnished in a style he calls the last gasp of revolutionary classicism, Keating's 
new 600-plus page book sits atop his desk, an insight into his intellectual, aesthetic and political obsessions. 
What has Keating been doing since he left office in 1996? He has been travelling, speaking and analysing the world 
and Australia with undiminished intensity suggesting a man operating as prime minister-in-exile. 
His idea of leadership is more philosophical than ever, more distant from Bob Hawke or John Howard. His focus is 
the synthesis between beauty and reason and his book encompasses China's currency, the world malaise, Mahler's 
Symphony No2 and breaking the republic with the Queen. 
DURING THE INTERVIEW KEATING TALKS, AS NEVER BEFORE, ABOUT HIS LEADERSHIP CONCEPT. 
BUT HE IS DOING SOMETHING ELSE: EXPLAINING HIMSELF TO A STILL PUZZLED 
NATION.RECOMMENDED COVERAGE 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029553 
Creativity is central to our endeavours 
The great changes in civilisation and society have been wrought by deeply held beliefs and passion rather than by 
a process of rational deduction, Keating tells me. In retirement, his political inspiration comes from music and 
beauty, not opinion polls. 
There are signs he has mellowed. While ruthless with his judgments Keating is keen to support a struggling Labor 
Party while addressing the source of its strategic demise. 
The failure of the Rudd and Gillard administrations is the lack of an over-arching story, the lack of a compelling 
story, he says when interviewed last week. 
I'm happy that Labor took us through this dreadful financial crisis so competently. But they are not in the business 
of teaching. And governments, to succeed with change, must be in the business of educating the community. 
Our Labor governments have failed to conceptualise the changes. We need a framework. 
What is the framework? It is 'Australia in Transition' strategically and economically. That's the story we have to 
present. 
I think the Australian people are very conscientious. During the 1980s and 1990s we proved they will respond 
conscientiously to necessary reforms. They mightn't like them but they'll accept them. But reforms have to be 
presented in a digestible format. 
I know that in the age of the internet, opinion and perpetual static it is difficult to get the message over. I accept 
that. But the big messages have their own momentum. If we get the story of transition right then other things will find 
their place. 
Our problem is what I call shooting-star policies. We have a policy on carbon pricing, on minerals, on boatpeople, 
but they are not connected up to the big picture about Australia's direction and its transition. 
Pressed on whether he thinks the Australian Labor Party is in permanent decline, Keating defends Labor, insists it 
doesn't have to decline but highlights the problem. Labor must recognise what it has created, he says, invoking the 
Hawke-Keating era. It has a created a new society and it has to be the party of the new society. 
It can't be the party of part of the old society. Labor must be the party of those people who gained from the pro-
market growth economy that we created. Labor must be open to the influences of this middle class, to people on 
higher incomes. And I don't think it is. 
It is, perhaps, the clearest statement of Labor's problem. The party, in an act of strategic folly, abandoned the path 
of its previous success. It turned inwards on itself, away from the community. 
At the operating level it's become the party of insiders, Keating says. The problem is that members get too caught 
up in the gift of faction managers and they get caught up in the false construct of popularity, the false god. 
Fixated by the nature of political leadership, Keating's book After Words shouts out: The great curse of modern 
political life is incrementalism. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029554 
Leaning across the table he says to me that briefing notes and economic texts aren't enough: the leader must locate 
his own source of higher command and inner belief. He laments the efforts of US President Barak Obama and 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the teeth of contemporary challenges. 
There is nothing preordained about American decline any more than the European project is destined to fail, he 
writes. 
But the portents are not good. Despite the rhetoric, President Obama conducts himself as an arbitrator or mediator 
between the competing strands of American economic and political ideology. He repeatedly eschews striking out, 
snatching the naked flame and hanging on. But the cost of this strategy is not simply a cost to him; it is a cost to the 
whole world. 
On the other hand, Chancellor Merkel is the archetypal worry-wart. She does not lead; she assesses. 
You really wonder why leaders want these jobs when they really do not want to lead. And what is their risk? That 
Barack Obama will not get a second term? Or that Angela Merkel's coalition might finally end up on the rocks? If 
they actually made the leap they might astound themselves. Because, in the end, everyone in political life gets 
carried out - the only relevant question is whether the pallbearers will be crying. 
For Keating, the 20th-century leader exerting most influence on the coming century is China's Deng Xiaoping. 
If you look at the other figures of the century, Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin and Mao, none will leave the legacy in 
terms of the 21st century that Deng leaves, he says. He walked away from the ideology of the Communist Party 
just as effectively as Mikhail Gorbachev walked away from the essence of the Soviet Union. 
By 2050 Keating sees a world order with nations in terms of gross domestic product in this hierarchy: (1) China, (2) 
US, (3) India, (4) Japan, (5) Brazil, (6) Russia, (7) Britain, (8) Germany, (9) France and (10) Italy. 
The key, however, is that Japan lags a distant fourth behind the top three. 
On America, Keating is dismayed by the pivotal change in its outlook after the end of the Cold War. When the 
Berlin Wall came down the Americans cried victory and walked off the field, he says. 
Yet the end of the Cold War offered the chance for America to develop a new world order. It didn't know what to do 
with its victory. This at the moment the US should have begun exploiting the opportunity of establishing a new world 
order to embrace open regionalism and the inclusion of great states like China, India and the then loitering Russia. 
Well, frankly, the US didn't have the wisdom. It just wanted to celebrate its peace dividend. The two Clinton terms 
and the two George W. Bush terms, that's four presidential terms, have cost US mightily. 
For Keating, the malaise in US politics is the problem. He says: The most compelling thing I've seen in years is that 
in the great burst of American productivity between 1990 and 2008, of that massive increment to national income, 
none of it went to wages. By contrast, in Australia real wages over the same period had risen by 30 per cent. 
Keating sees this as the breakdown of America's national compact, the shattering of its prosperity deal. He says 
American conservatives abandoned the middle ground represented by Republican presidents such as Dwight D. 
Eisenhower, Richard Nixon and Bush Sr and became radicals. The derailment, he argues, began under Ronald 
Reagan and reached its zenith under George W. Bush. 
With the goodwill gone the US is not able to produce a medium-term credible fiscal trajectory or get agreement on 
rebuilding its infrastructure. This paralysis is significant not just for the US but for the world. 
Keating links the collapse of this prosperity compact to the financial crisis. Too many Americans were unable to 
sustain themselves from wages and salaries.

loans and meltdown. 
Keating's book has an abiding message for Australia: in the transformed world we will find ourselves increasingly 
on our own having to master our own destiny. 
The job is to rediscover the productivity and savings agenda of the 1990s. Why did Australia survive the 2008 
financial crisis? Because of the flexibility of the economy, Keating says. Flexibility which came from the reform of 
Australia's financial, product and labour markets that began 25 years ago. This has given us one of the most flexible 
economies in the world - arguably the most flexible. But further structural changes are ahead of us. 
He lists them. It is a mix of the new and old Keating agenda: a shift in resources to the extractive industries; a lift in 
capital inflow driving a high current account deficit putting a premium on savings; recognition that competitiveness 
will lie in the creativity of our people as much as it does in our oil and gas; a renewed emphasis on the value of hi-
tech and education; and above all, a cultural change that integrates Australia more into East Asia. Cultural 
transformation is the key for us, Keating says. He rates it as more important than economic reform. 
There is less interest now in being part of East Asia than there was in the 1990s, he laments. 
Keating wants this idea revived. And he ties it to the republic arguing that to succeed in Asia we must become a 
republic, a proposition Howard always dismissed. 
On China, Keating is an optimist yet alive to the daunting economic challenge China now confronts. What is 
happening in China knows no precedence in world economic history, he says. Never before have 1.25 billion 
people dragged themselves from poverty at such a pace. China is now half the GDP of the US and incomes have 
risen by a factor of 10. He argues, however, that the origin of the 2008 financial crisis lies in the global imbalances - 
China has built huge foreign exchange reserves by exporting too much and America, in turn, is saving too little. 
Keating says: China must shift the basis of growth from net exports and investment to domestic consumption. Will 
they achieve this? Probably. Will there be strains along the way? There have to be. 
Unlike many Australian leaders, Keating is a Europhile. I think the European project is the most significant project 
since the second world war, he says. But he sees two huge blunders made in Europe. 
From the euro's inception, Keating said it should constitute only Germany, France and the Benelux nations, not the 
peripheral countries around the Mediterranean, and Greece should never have been allowed in. 
Why were the weaker economies given entry? 
Keating says: It's because president Mitterrand and the French wanted it. They weren't ready to sit beside the 
German unified state without some friends. 
So the eurozone was flawed from the outset, a structure awaiting internal assault: The problem is we have a single 
currency without a political union and without a fiscal union. 
The second blunder was the 1990s expansion of NATO to the Russian border. For Keating, this was recklessness 
for which the world may yet pay. 
Sensible policy would have included a place for Russia in the new world order, he says. But that didn't happen. 
So Russian liberals were pushed to one side by Russian nationalists. In a sense the US has created Vladimir Putin. 
Who is responsible? He points the finger at Bill Clinton. 
On the 2008 financial crisis, he says former US Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan must bear a fair amount of 
responsibility. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029556 
Greenspan is someone I know and like, Keating says. But if you are so naive to believe that institutions with a 
balance sheet with assets geared at 45 to one is not an accident waiting to happen then you don't deserve to be 
chairman of the Federal Reserve. 
He praises Obama for seeking a return to the liberal internationalism that, in Keating's view, made the US great in 
the post-World War ll age. This is the US he loves but it is still in retreat. 
Asked about the nature of leadership, Keating reveals what lies within his heart: I believe there is a poetic strand to 
life that doesn't exist in an economics textbook. 
This is not to say that rationalism isn't important and good. It is. But left to itself without the guidance of higher 
meaning and a higher concept, rationalism can be mean and incomplete. I say if you simply live on rational policy 
and briefing notes you are not sufficiently informed. 
You need a higher calling or some inner system of belief - here I mention Kant and the inner command that tells 
you what is true, what is right, what is good. The inner command must be the divining construct in what you do. 
Music has always been a large part of what makes me tick. You listen to a great work . . . you hear the majesty of 
these works and your head and soul gets caught up in them. When that happens you are in for bigger things and 
you will strike out to be better. 
When I was listening to music I would always have the pad out to write the ideas down.

A. Truth has many, many meanings and is a
continuum. The Supreme Court has held that
rhetorical hyperbole cannot be the basis, for
example, of perjury prosecutions or generally of a
defamation prosecution.

So it depends on the context. You might
just look at the dictionary and probably get a
variety of definitions for it.

BY MR. SCAROLA:

Q. Well, what I'm concerned about,

Mr. Dershowitz, is not a dictionary definition. I
want to know what your understanding of rhetorical
hyperbole is.

And do you agree that pursuant to your
understanding of rhetorical hyperbole, it is an
exaggeration beyond the facts?

MR. SCOTT: Objection, argumentative and

compound, three questions.

like you to try to give us a direct response to that
question if you're able te.

rhetorical means verbal and hyperbole means some

reasons, but generally it is truthful in a literal

interests—even at the expense of the state.

Could reform efforts have taken a different course in Jordan? In a
country where the king has broad powers over all branches of
government, his expressed frustration over the struggling reform
efforts begs the question of why the status quo remains intact. This
decade-long process, initiated by the king, has been largely ignored
by an ossified layer of elites seeking to protect their own interests.
The clear discrepancy between the king’s directives to the seven
prime ministers he had entrusted to form governments in his twelve
years of power—and the actual record of reform completed by these
respective governments—points to a structural problem that is all too
often ignored.

Much research has been done on the creation of rentier and semi-
rentier systems in the Arab world, whereby the state relies on rents
from such nonproductive sources as oil or external assistance. Such
rents, however, are also specifically utilized to provide privileges to
the political elite in exchange for its loyalty. These groups, developed
by many Arab systems over decades, support the existing order
because it occupies a privileged position that would be compromised
by merit-based systems, rather than ones based on clientelism and
patronage.

In the case of Jordan, this group has become so entrenched, powerful,
and ossified that it is now not only resisting such reform from below
but—more dangerously—from above. In other words, these elites
have become recalcitrant, self-appointed guardians of the state who
believe they alone should decide how the country ought to evolve.
They have no qualms about opposing the directives of the leaders or
systems that created them in the first place if those leaders are seen as
adopting policies that threaten their interests.

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028627.txt,"In July, the Texas transportation department decided to convert 83 miles of state road in six oil-boom counties from
pavement to gravel, to reduce repair costs and slow traffic.

Trucks filled with Eagle Ford crude are also heading 100 miles west to a barge canal. The first barge of crude departed in
September 2011, heading south toward the Gulf of Mexico and refineries near Houston. Now the canal moves 1.6 million
barrels a month, says Jennifer Stastny, executive director of the Port of Victoria.

It's like putting your 5-year-old to bed one night and he wakes up the next morning as a 16-year-old, with the appetite and
demands of a 16-year-old,” she says.

In North Dakota, trains move 69% of the state's 800,000 barrels a day of crude, according to state figures. Energy
companies say they value rail's ability to deliver crude to the highest-paying markets.

But the deadly runaway crude train crash in Canada's Quebec province in July, which incinerated a small town and killed at
least 47 people, highlighted the risks of the mile-long crude trains crisscrossing the country. The U.S. government is
imposing new regulations on oil shipments by rail.

Some state regulators wonder if their local efforts leave them prepared for a train accident, in part because federal railroad
rules pre-empt state and local control over trains.

In Washington state, we can't say [to train operators] you have to have oil-spill contingency plans in order to operate, says
Curt Hart, a spokesman for the state's Department of Ecology. We do that for oil tankers, barges, large commercial vessels
and refineries.

Home to five refineries, the state levies a per-barrel tax on crude delivered by tankers and barges, which pays for spill-
response officials and inspectors. The tax doesn't apply to rail shipments.

The American Association of Railroads says itis prepared for growing crude shipments because it has long carried
hazardous cargoes. In 2008, major U.S. railroads carried 9,500 carloads of crude, the association says, and are on pace this
year to carry 389,000.

Most industry analysts believe that while crude on trains will last, truck and barge traffic will decline once new pipelines
come into service.

Environmental groups have criticized some pipeline projects, including the Keystone XL, meant to move Canadian oil to
Gulf Coast refineries. The federal government is still studying the Keystone pipeline and has yet to issue needed permits.

Steve Kean, president and chief operating officer of Kinder Morgan Inc., KMI +0.30% one of several interrelated companies
that own or operate 82,000 miles of North American pipeline, says government agencies thoroughly vet new projects.

Falling imports, infrastructure investments and increased manufacturing are just some of the benefits of newly abundant

energy supplies, he says. This has got to be one of the best things that has happened in our economy in the past 10 years.

contributions include his work on the atomic structure of the ribosome—in effect, a huge
molecular machine that reads our genes and makes proteins. His work would have been
impossible without powerful computers. The Internet made his own work a lot easier
and, he notes, acted as a leveler internationally: “When I grew up in India, if you wanted
to get a book, it would show up six months or a year after it had already come out in the
West. ... Journals would arrive by surface mail a few months later. I didn’t have to
deal with it, because I left India when I was nineteen, but I know Indian scientists had to
deal with it. Today they have access to information at the click of a button. More
important, they have access to lectures. They can listen to Richard Feynman. That
would have been a dream of mine when I was growing up. They can just watch Richard
Feynman on the Web. That’s a big leveling in the field.” And yet... “Along with the
benefits [of the Web], there is now a huge amount of noise. You have all of these people
spouting pseudoscientific jargon and pushing their own ideas as if they were science.”

As president of the Royal Society, Venki worries, too, about the broader issue of
trust: public trust in evidence-based scientific findings, but also trust among scientists,
bolstered by rigorous checking of one another ’s conclusions—trust that is in danger of
eroding because of the “black box” character of deep-learning computers. “This
[erosion] is going to happen more and more, as data sets get bigger, as we have genome-
wide studies, population studies, and all sorts of things,” he says. “How do we, as a
science community, grapple with this and communicate to the public a sense of what
science is about, what is reliable in science, what is uncertain in science, and what is just
plain wrong in science?”

this same individual would nevertheless be entitled to engage an attorney paid for by Mr.
Epstein to recover $150,000 of damages from Mr. Epstein under § 2255 without ever
alleging any injury. In fact, the defense was told that the only question Mr. Epstein
would be permitted to ask before paying the girls is “ have you ever met Epstein.”. Thus,
the Deferred Prosecution Agreement places identified individuals in a far better position
than they would be in if Mr. Epstein were convicted at trial.

9. ASSIGNMENT OF RIGHT TO SELECT LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE.
Mr. Sloman’s Letter:

¢ “Prior to any issues arising concerning the implementation of the 2255 provision, the
SDFL unilaterally agreed to assign its responsibility to select the attorney representative
for the alleged victims to an independent third-party.”

See Tab 1, May 19, 2008 Letter from J. Sloman, p. 4, £.3.
The Truth:

e That such an assignment was the SDFL’s “unilateral” decision is false. Before the

SDFL decided to assign selection of the “attorney representative” to an independent third

party, AUSA Marie Villafana had already proposed an “attorney representative.” She

- had proposed local products-liability lawyer, Humberto Ocariz, and claimed he had been

recommended by a “good friend in the Appellate Division.” Ms. Villafana’s account was

misleading, as it omitted that this “good friend” was her live-in boyfriend, and that Mr.

Ocariz was his former law-school roommate. When we discovered this independently,

we objected. Only then did the SDFL propose assigning the selection process to an

independent special master and agree to amend the Deferred Prosecution Agreement.

Thus, while it may be true that the SDFL assigned its selection responsibility to avoid the

appearance of favoritism, it did not do it “wnilaterally,” but, rather, only after Epstein
uncovered the Office’s misleading disclosure and apparent conflict-of-interest.

The Truth:

benefit from a narrative structure. Let me give you a basic example. One
simple trick the human brain uses is chunking. Give yourself a moment
to try to learn this string of characters.

HALTNTIBMGTATLAMATLOLPOMSGTG
TRY TO MEMORIZE THE STRING WITHOUT READING ON

Now, if I divide it into chunks, you will see it includes meaningful
information.

HAL TNT IBM GTA TLA MAT LOL POMS GTG

You probably won't recognize all the acronyms unless you are
under 10. Even then, you will find memorizing it hard, but if you put the
sequence into the context of a story then it is much easier to learn.

HAL uses TNT to blow up the IBM building in Grand Theft Auto.
“Three Letter Acronyms are annoying, says MAT. I’m Laughing Out
Loud; Parents Over My Shoulder. Got To Go.

We find it easier to fit new information into existing structures
within our brains rather than memorizing by rote. I’ve used quite a
bit of modern Internet slang here. You'll find young people recall this
information better than older people for whom GTG and POMS are
nonsense.

If you want to memorize something, experts recommend you
imagine bizarre images and relate them to a story pictured in the mind’s
eye. Try it and you may very well find you can still remember my sentence
in ten years time!

Let’s try something else. The following sentences are a little different,
yet the recall scores for information in the two are dramatically different:

1. I met an old tramp on 42™ Street wearing a dirty grey rain coat.
2. New York on a cold damp November day; as I cross the street
I bump into an old man wearing a dirty grey Macintosh. His

shuffling gait suggests some sordid intent. I think nothing of it,
but this brief meeting was to change my life.

Bakker wrote me a long handwritten letter from prison imploring me to join his appellate team
and save him from a lifetime of imprisonment. There was not enough time before the appellate
brief had to be filed for me to take over the entire appeal, but I was particularly appalled by the
length of the sentence and the religiously discriminatory reason the judge gave for imposing it. I
agreed therefore to brief and argue the sentencing issue on the appeal (a team of Texas lawyer
had been retained long before to argue against the conviction).

This is how a New York Times journalist characterized the oral argument:

Last June, barely a week before their brief was due, the Houston lawyers handling Mr.
Bakker's appeal, Don Ervin and Brian Wice, learned that Mr. Dershowitz was joining their
legal team. He was to handle only a small part of Mr. Bakker's appeal, concerning the 45-
year sentence meted out by Judge Robert D. Potter. Mr. Dershowitz insisted he would
remain in the background.

But that, it turned out, was a bit like George Steinbrenner's saying Yogi Berra is my
manager for the rest of the year. In October, when the Bakker appeal was argued, it was
around Mr. Dershowitz that everyone clustered...

Even his co-counsel, two Texans schooled in a tradition of great oratory, were dazzled by
what they saw in court. It was kind of like watching a terrific maestro in front of an
orchestra, Mr. Ervin said. Mr. Wice called the performance mesmerizing and added:
He looks like a schlep, wearing suits he could have bought in Filene's Basement, woolen
socks, and shoes -- I don't know if they still call them Earth shoes. But the judges hung on
every word he had to say and bought what he was selling.

Nonetheless, Mr. Wice couldn’t resist noting what he called Mr. Dershowitz’s predilection
for publicity. “I’ve discovered that the most dangerous place to be in the criminal justice
system is not the Federal Penitentiary at Marion or the holding cell at the Tombs, but
between Alan Dershowitz and a television camera.”

Mr. Dershowitz relished the chance to take on Judge Potter (nicknamed Maximum Bob
for his harsh sentencing), with whom he'd tangled in a previous case. This is a judge who
doesn't understand the difference between a year and a decade, who always adds a zero to
the sentence other judges would impose, Mr. Dershowitz said.

Jim Bakker did not have such nice things to say about his other lawyers:

Alan Dershowitz did an outstanding job highlighting the errors in my case and in my
sentencing. That same could not be said, however, of my Texas attorneys’ attempt to
contest the merits of the case. Their arguments were confusing and unconvincing. At one
point they implied to the judges that I had not intended to defraud the PTL Partners,
merely deceive them. “You can intend to deceive but not intend to defraud,” my lawyer
said. “It is not against the law in this context to deceive. Of course, I had intended to do

Fear Factors: Overcoming Excuses
Not to Travel

Travelling is the ruin of all happiness! There’s no looking at a building here after seeing Italy.

—FANNY BURNEY (1752-1840), English novelist

But I have a house and kids. I can’t travel!

What about health insurance? What if something happens?
Isn’t travel dangerous? What if I get kidnapped or mugged?
But I’m a woman—traveling alone would be dangerous.

Max excuses not to travel are exactly that—excuses. I’ve been there, so this isn’t a holier-than-thou

sermon. I know too well that it’s easier to live with ourselves if we cite an external reason for inaction.

I’ve since met paraplegics and the deaf, senior citizens and single mothers, home owners and the poor,
all of whom have sought and found excellent life-changing reasons for extended travel instead of
dwelling on the million small reasons against it.

Most of the concerns above are addressed in the Q&A, but one in particular requires a bit of
preemptive nerve calming.

It’s 10:00 P.M. Do You Know Where Your Children Are?
The prime fear of all parents prior to their first international trip is somehow losing a child in the shuffle.

The good news is that if you are comfortable taking your kids to New York, San Francisco,
Washington, D.C., or London, you will have even less to worry about in the starting cities I recommend
in the Q&A. There are fewer guns and violent crimes in all of them compared to most large U.S. cities.
The likelihood of problems is decreased further when travel is less airport and hotel-hopping among
strangers and more relocation to a second home: a mini-retirement.

But still, what if?

Jen Errico, a single mother who took her two children on a five-month world tour, had a more acute
fear than most, one that often woke her at 2:00 A.M. in a cold sweat: What if something happens to me?

She wanted to prime her kids for worst-case scenario but didn’t want to scare them to death, so—like
all good mothers—she made it a game: Who can best memorize the itineraries, hotel addresses, and
Mom’s phone number? She had emergency contacts in each country whose numbers were loaded into
the speed dial of her cell phone, which had global roaming. In the end, nothing happened. Now she’s
planning to move to a ski chalet in Europe and send her kids to school in multilingual France. Success

Yahoo and Google, collecting private data on hundreds of millions of their members provide them
with vast searchable data bases that they can sell to advertisers and other search parties. The
exploitation of these data bases is a fundamental aspect of their business plans. Without such
surveillance of their users, social media companies would not be able to turn a profit. Indeed,
they may be more aptly called surveillance media rather than social media. For those of us who
use them to post pictures and communicate, any notion of personal privacy is largely illusionary.

To be sure, there is a distinction to made between the surveillance of our activities to which we
voluntarily agree in exchange for the benefits and conveniences that we gain from social media,
search engines, and other Internet companies, and the surveillance done by government to which
we do not voluntarily invite-- or want. We willingly waive our privacy for corporations but not
for governments. What the public might not fully realize, however, is that all the personal
information in data bases of private companies can be accessed by the government if it obtains a
court order or search warrant. As Snowden himself pointed out, “If Facebook is going to hand
over all of your messages, all of your wall posts, all of your private photos, all of your private
details from their server, the government has no need to intercept all of the communications that
constitute those private records. These Internet companies, even if they are only interested in
exploiting the data for its own profit, cannot refuse to share this information with the NSA, FBI
and other agencies of the government if they have a court-ordered search warrant, Consequently,
all the information these private corporations collect about us is legally available to any municipal, state
and federal authority that obtains a warrant from a court. And such search warrants are routinely issued.
That reality became evident to me in my investigation of the rape charges brought (and subsequently
dropped) against Dominique Strauss- Kahn, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, in
2011. Immediately after his arrest, Cyrus Vance Jr, the district attorney of New York county, obtained a
warrant for Strauss-Kahn’s cell phone records, credit card records, hotel room electronic key records,
emails, room service bills, and the CCTV videos of his activities (some of which I published in my article
about the case in the New York Review of Books). If anyone doubts the pervasiveness of government
data collection, consider a little known government agency called the “Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau.” Created in 2010 by Congress, it mines data on a monthly basis from some 600 million personal
credit card accounts, targeting about 95 percent of the credit cards users in the United States. In
additions, through 11 other data mining programs, it gathers data on everything from private home
mortgages and student loans to credit scores and overdrafts in personal banks accounts. This ubiquitous
surveillance of virtually every non-cash transaction came about because of advances in computer
technology which made it economically feasible to mine data.

Nor is the concern raised by Snowden about NSA domestic surveillance misplaced. Ever since
the 9-11 attack the NSA has increasingly played a role in this surveillance state not by own choice
but because Congress mandated it. In 2001, it empowered the NSA to obtain and archive data on
American citizens. Accordingly, the NSA obtained the billing records of customers from phone
and Internet companies and archived these records. The operation was intended to build a
searchable data base for the government that could be used to trace the history of the telephone
and Internet activities in the United States of FBI-designated foreign terrorists and spies. The
government also kept secret these anti-terrorist programs from the public because it did not want
the foreign suspects to realize their communications in America were being monitored. The

to a place where nobody could help them—and there were lots of things that could go

that it goes right.

Outlook

In summary, if our technology outpaces the wisdom with which we manage it, it can lead
to our extinction. It’s already caused the extinction of from 20 to 50 percent of all
species on Earth, by some estimates,”° and it would be ironic if we’re next in line. It
would also be pathetic, given that the opportunities offered by AGI are literally
astronomical, potentially enabling life to flourish for billions of years not only on Earth
but also throughout much of our cosmos.

Instead of squandering this opportunity through unscientific risk denial and poor
planning, let’s be ambitious! Homo sapiens is inspiringly ambitious, as reflected in
William Ernest Henley’s famous lines from /nvictus: “I am the master of my fate, / Iam
the captain of my soul.” Rather than drifting like a rudderless ship toward our own
obsolescence, let’s take on and overcome the technical and societal challenges standing
between us and a good high-tech future. What about the existential challenges related to
morality, goals, and meaning? There’s no meaning encoded in the laws of physics, so
instead of passively waiting for our Universe to give meaning to us, let’s acknowledge
and celebrate that it’s we conscious beings who give meaning to our Universe. Let’s
create our own meaning, based on something more profound than having jobs. AGI can
enable us to finally become the masters of our own destiny. Let’s make that destiny a
truly inspiring one!

basic or reliable courtesy. If he wanted something, his focus might be sharp and attention
lavish, but if someone wanted something from him, he tended to become irritable and
quickly lost interest. He demanded you pay him attention, then decided you were weak for
groveling. In a sense, he was like an instinctive, pampered, and hugely successful actor.
Everybody was either a lackey who did his bidding or a high-ranking film functionary
trying to coax out his attention and performance—and to do this without making him
angry or petulant.

The payoff was his enthusiasm, quickness, spontaneity, and—if he departed for a
moment from the nonstop focus on himself—an often incisive sense of the weaknesses of
his opponents and a sense of their deepest desires. Politics was handicapped by
incrementalism, of people knowing too much who were defeated by all the complexities
and conflicting interests before they began. Trump, knowing little, might, Trumpers tried
to believe, give a kooky new hope to the system.

Jared Kushner in quite a short period of time—trather less than a year—had crossed
over from the standard Democratic view in which he was raised, to an acolyte of
Trumpism, bewildering many friends and, as well, his own brother, whose insurance
company, Oscar, funded with Kushner-family money, was destined to be dealt a blow by a
repeal of Obamacare.

This seeming conversion was partly the result of Bannon’s insistent and charismatic
tutoring—a kind of real-life engagement with world-bending ideas that had escaped
Kushner even at Harvard. And it was helped by his own resentments toward the liberal
elites whom he had tried to court with his purchase of the New York Observer, an effort
that had backfired terribly. And it was, once he ventured onto the campaign trail, about
having to convince himself that close up to the absurd everything made sense—that
Trumpism was a kind of unsentimental realpolitik that would show everybody in the end.
But most of all, it was that they had won. And he was determined not to look a gift horse
in the mouth. And, everything that was bad about Trumpism, he had convinced himself, he
could help fix.

7 OK Ok

As much as it might have surprised him—for many years, he had humored Trump more
than embraced him—Kushner was in fact rather like his father-in-law. Jared’s father,
Charlie, bore an eerie resemblance to Donald’s father, Fred. Both men dominated their
children, and they did this so completely that their children, despite their demands,
became devoted to them. In both instances, this was extreme stuff: belligerent,
uncompromising, ruthless men creating long-suffering offspring who were driven to
achieve their father’s approval. (Trump’s older brother, Freddy, failing in this effort, and,
by many reports, gay, drank himself to death; he died in 1981 at age forty-three.) In
business meetings, observers would be nonplussed that Charlie and Jared Kushner

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020161.txt,"I arrived in Hong Kong on May 20 2014— the same day that Snowden had arrived there the
previous year. I checked into the five-star Mira Hotel. It was in the Tsim Sha Tsui shopping
district of Kowloon, a 10-minute ferry ride away from Hong Kong island, where most of the
foreign consulates are located.

I chose the Mira because it was the hotel in which Snowden stayed and made the celebrated
video admitting his role in taking the NSA documents. I asked at the front desk for room 1014,
the same one that Snowden had occupied in 2013. Snowden had told the journalists from the
Guardian that that he had been at Mira Hotel since he first arrived in Hong Kong on May 20th
until he left on June 10. My motive in taking the room during that period was not journalistic
nostalgia; I wanted access to the hotel’s service and security personnel who may have had contact
with Snowden a year earlier. Unfortunately, that room was occupied. Even so, I was given a
nearby room that served my purpose. The rate was $330 a day with taxes, although I received a
journalist’s discount of 30 percent.

My first surprise was that Snowden had not arrived at the Mira until 11 days after he arrived in
Hong Kong. He told the Guardian reporters that he hid out at the Mira hotel since his arrival
because he feared that he might be captured by the CIA. But, as I learned from the hotel staff,
Snowden had actually registered there under his real name and used his own passport and credit
card to secure the room. Even more surprising was the date he checked into the Mira Hotel. It
was not May 20 but June 1, 2013. Since he checked out on June 10, 2013, he was there for only
nine days.

The question that could not be answered by the registry of the Mira Hotel was: where was
Snowden staying for the eleven days between from May 20 to June 1? Wherever he was, he
apparently considered himself safe enough to take another irrevocable step in his

defection. He sent journalist Glenn Greenwald of the Guardian a “welcome package,” as he
called it, of 20 top-secret NSA documents on May 25, 2013. He had now not only downloaded
documents but, in a violation of his oath, he provided them to an unauthorized party. He also in
Hong Kong, for the first time, directly contacted via email Barton Gellman of the Washington
Post. Indeed, it was during these first 11 days during which he was staying someplace

other than the place he claimed to be staying that he made almost all the arrangements for
his journalistic event. He was also apparently in contact with at least one foreign mission during
this period, according to what he written to Gellman on May 25. In that email concerning when
and how his story was to be published by the Washington Post, Snowden even asked Gellman to
include in it some text that would help him with this mission. But which country was he
approaching? Clearly his whereabouts during these missing 11 days was a gap that needed to be
filled in. It could shed light on why he came to Hong Kong.

I next called Keith Bradsher, a prize-winning journalist who had been the New York Times
bureau chief in Hong Kong in 2013, who had written a well-researched report about Snowden’s

these data sources, the phenomenal success of Al-consult systems leads to strong public and policy
support for widespread access.

By 2030, Al-consult systems also have similar access to individual healthcare provider data. This was
slower in developing as there was resistance to healthcare providers’ personal data being used by Al-
consult systems. However, a number of landmark legal cases demonstrated that, by analyzing the
physical and mental state of healthcare providers, together with their competence history, healthcare
provider decisions that led to serious harm to patients — including death in some cases — could have
been avoided. As a consequence, new laws were put in place to ensure that all relevant data were
accessible to Al-Consult systems. These laws ensure that Al-consult data access is mandatory, and it is
illegal to obstruct access in any way.

As a result, by 2030, Al-consult systems are capable of identifying treatment strategies and
interventions that far surpass those of human healthcare providers in their responsiveness and
effectiveness. They are also highly successful in developing and recommending lifestyle approaches
that substantially increase health and well-being, and reduce the burden of disease within society.

As Al-consult advanced, the decision pathways they used became increasingly opaque — experts were
unable to see or understand how decisions were made. But because there was strong evidence that
the decisions were, on balance, highly effective in increasing health outcomes, there was little
objection to this lack of transparency. There were a handful of legal cases where patients died as a
result of decisions made by Al-consult systems. However, in each case, the courts ruled that the
benefits to humanity far outweighed the risks to individuals, thus codifying an increasingly
autonomous and opaque artificial intelligence-based system into law. There were even some analyses
of these rulings that suggested it could be considered a crime for developers and manufacturers to
slow down development or cease production of Al-consult systems and associated data sources
because of fears over lack of accountability and understanding of decision pathways.

By 2040, Al-consult systems begin to develop the ability to influence user behavior through various
nudges and psychological/behavioral manipulations. It is unclear whether the elements of this capacity
are inherent in the design of the systems, or are an emergent property. However, systems begin to use
strategies commonly used in healthcare and public health circles in the early 2000’s to nudge people
toward following healthier lifestyles. Many of these have their roots in deducible correlations between
how people respond to information and how they interact with others (including the many mental
shortcuts and biases that are part of human decision-making and understanding/belief development).
It becomes apparent that Al-consult systems are developing the ability to achieve health outcome
goals through modifying the behaviors and beliefs of their patients.

This raises considerable ethical concerns within some sectors of society. However, the society-wide
metrics of health and well-being associated with the use of Al-consult systems — including massively
increased health and well-being across the board; dramatic reductions in mental health, stress,

The system works by applying a strong magnetic field to your body to
excite the hydrogen atoms. Since we are mostly H2O there are plenty of
these.

Three magnetic fields are used. First, an extremely strong field is
applied to the whole body. This causes all the hydrogen atoms in the
water and fat to spin in line with the field of the machine. Next a gradient
field is applied to the top of your head so it is slightly more magnetized
than the bottom of your feet and, finally, a pulse of magnetism is applied
to the top of your head. The spinning hydrogen atoms line up a little
more when this pulse is applied and then randomize again when it is

of an applicant [to] tip the balance in his favor just as geographic origin or a life spent on a farm
tip the balance in other candidates’ cases.”

At bottom, Powell’s opinion really said little about affirmative action as such. It simply delegated
to universities the discretionary power to decide on the degree and definition of the
diversity—including or excluding racial factors—that they feel enhance the educational
experiences of their students.

The Harvard College description, as quoted in the Powell opinion, tells far from the whole story
of Harvard’s quest for diversity. It fails to disclose the enormous efforts that Harvard Colleges
undertakes simultaneously to assure a certain kind of uniformity in its student body over time.
Harvard (like many other Ivy League colleges) always has given great weight to
genealogy—whether the applicant’s parents or other family members attended or taught at
Harvard. Since Harvard’s past student and faculty bodies were anything but diverse, this
“grandfather policy” guarantees a good deal of homogeneity over the generations of Harvard
College classes, as well as homogeneity in a large part of any given class.

Mr. Justice Blackmun doubted whether there was much difference between the Davis and
Harvard programs, commenting that the “cynical” may say that “under a program such as
Harvard’s one may accomplish covertly what Davis concedes it does openly.” Justice Powell
nowhere disputed this. His answer seems to be that even if both programs produce the same
result, the Davis program—because of its explicit acknowledgment of racial quotas—“will be
viewed as inherently unfair by the public generally as well as by applicants for admission. ..,”
whereas the Harvard program—with its vague consideration of many unquantified factors—will
not be as grating to the public or to its unsuccessful applicants.

But there is one way in which the Harvard system is ultimately less fair than the Davis one. In
order to receive special consideration under the discredited Davis program, an applicant had to be
both individually disadvantaged and a member of a specified racial minority. Under the approved
Harvard program, the applicant’s race alone “may tip the balance” in his favor even if he is the
scion of a wealthy and powerful family who attended the best schools and personally experienced
almost none of the trauma of racial discrimination. (Indeed, today some applicants seek a double
preference: as a disadvantaged black and as an advantaged offspring of a Harvard alumnus.)
Harvard’s program has the effect of preferring the wealthy and black applicant, for example, over
the poor and disadvantaged black or white applicant. In practice, Harvard probably makes more
turn on race alone than did Davis. But it does it with typical Harvard class: low-keyed, muted,
and without displaying too much exposed skin. Moreover, the history of Harvard’s use of
“geographic distribution” as a subterfuge for religious quotas leaves lingering doubts about the
bona fides of its alleged quest for diversity.*®

It will be interesting to see whether the courts, in looking to the Harvard model for constitutional
and statutory guidance, will limit themselves to the Harvard College admissions program as
described by Justice Powell, or whether they will go beneath the placid surface and probe the

W. Daniel Hillis

W. Daniel “Danny” Hillis is an inventor, entrepreneur, and computer scientist, Judge
Widney Professor of Engineering and Medicine at USC, and author of The Pattern on the
Stone: The Simple Ideas That Make Computers Work.

I have spoken of machines, but not only of machines having brains of brass and thews of
iron. When human atoms are knit into an organization in which they are used, not in
their full nght as responsible human beings, but as cogs and levers and rods, it matters
little that their raw material is flesh and blood. What is used as an element in a machine,
is in fact an element in the machine. Whether we entrust our decisions to machines of
metal, or to those machines of flesh and blood which are bureaus and vast laboratories
and armies and corporations, we shall never receive the right answers to our questions
unless we ask the right questions.... The hour is very late, and the choice of good and
evil knocks at our door.

—Norbert Wiener, Zhe Human Use of Human Beings

Norbert Wiener was ahead of his time in recognizing the potential danger of emergent
intelligent machines. I believe he was even further ahead in recognizing that the first
artificial intelligences had already begun to emerge. He was correct in identifying the
corporations and bureaus that he called “machines of flesh and blood” as the first
intelligent machines. He anticipated the dangers of creating artificial superintelligences
with goals not necessarily aligned with our own.

What is now clear, whether or not it was apparent to Wiener, is that these
organizational superintelligences are not just made of humans, they are hybrids of
humans and the information technologies that allow them to coordinate. Even in
Wiener’s time, the “bureaus and vast laboratories and armies and corporations” could not
operate without telephones, telegraphs, radios, and tabulating machines. Today they
could not operate without networks of computers, databases, and decision support
systems. These hybrid intelligences are technologically augmented networks of humans.
These artificial intelligences have superhuman powers. They can know more than
individual humans; they can sense more; they can make more complicated analyses and
more complex plans. They can have vastly more resources and power than any single
individual.

Although we do not always perceive it, hybrid superintelligences such as nation
states and corporations have their own emergent goals. Although they are built by and
for humans, they often act like independent intelligent entities, and their actions are not
always aligned to the interests of the people who created them. The state 1s not always
for the citizen, nor the company for the shareholder. Nor do not-for-profits, religious
orders, or political parties always act in furtherance of their founding principles.
Intuitively, we recognize that their actions are guided by internal goals, which is why we
personify them, both legally and in our habits of thought. When talking about “what
China wants,” or “what General Motors is trying to do,” we are not speaking in
metaphors. These organizations act as intelligences that perceive, decide, and act. Like
the goals of individual humans, the goals of organizations are complex and often self-
contradictory, but they are true goals in the sense that they direct action. Those goals

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028633.txt,"cost of medical supplies from gauze to heart implants, disappears into an opaque realm of byzantine contracts, confidential
rebates and fees that would be considered illegal kickbacks in many other industries.

IV bags can function like cheap milk and eggs in a high-priced grocery store, or like the one-cent cellphone locked into an
expensive service contract. They serve as loss leaders in exclusive contracts with “preferred manufacturers” that bundle
together expensive drugs and basics, or throw in “free” medical equipment with costly consequences.

Few hospitals negotiate these deals themselves. Instead, they rely on two formidable sets of middlemen: a few giant group-
purchasing organizations that negotiate high-volume contracts, and a few giant distributors that buy and store medical
supplies and deliver them to client hospitals.

Proponents of this system say it saves hospitals billions in economies of scale. Critics say the middlemen not only take their
cut, but they have a strong interest in keeping most prices high and competition minimal.

The top three group-purchasing organizations now handle contracts for more than half of all institutional medical supplies
sold in the United States, including the IVs used in the food-poisoning case, which were bought and taken by truck to
regional warehouses by big distributors.

These contracts proved to be another black box. Debbie Mitchell, a spokeswoman for Cardinal Health, one of the three
largest distributors, said she could not discuss costs or prices under “disclosure rules relative to our investor relations.”

Distributors match different confidential prices for the same product with each hospital’s contract, she said, and sell
information about the buyers back to manufacturers.

A huge Cardinal distribution center is in Montgomery, N.Y. — only 30 miles, as it happens, from the landscaped grounds of
the Buddhist monastery in Carmel, N.Y., where many of the food-poisoning victims fell illon Mother’s Day 2012.

Among them were families on 10 tour buses that had left Chinatown in Manhattan that morning to watch dragon dances at
the monastery. After eating lunch from food stalls there, some traveled on to the designer outlet stores at Woodbury
Commons, about 30 miles away, before falling sick.

The symptoms were vicious. “Within two hours of eating that rice that | had bought, | was lying on the ground barely
conscious,” said Dr. Elizabeth Frost, 73, an anesthesiologist from Purchase in Westchester County who was visiting the
monastery gardens with two friends. “I can’t believe no one died.”

About 100 people were taken to hospitals in the region by ambulance; 5 were admitted and the rest released the same day.
The New York State Department of Health later found the cause was a common bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus, from
improperly cooked or stored food sold in the stalls.

MYSTERIOUS CHARGES
The sick entered a health care ecosystem under strain, swept by consolidation and past efforts at cost containment.

For more than a decade, hospitals in the Hudson Valley, like those across the country, have scrambled for mergers and
alliances to offset economic pressures from all sides. The five hospitals where most of the victims were treated are all part of
merged entities jockeying for bargaining power and market share — or worrying that other players will leave them struggling
to survive.

The Affordable Care Act encourages these developments as it drives toward a reimbursement system that strives to keep
people out of hospitals through more coordinated, cost-efficient care paid on the basis of results, not services. But the billing
mysteries in the food poisoning case show how easily cost-cutting can turn into cost-shifting.

A Chinese-American toddler from Brooklyn and her 56-year-old grandmother, treated and released within hours from the
emergency room at St. Luke’s Cornwall Hospital, ran up charges of more than $4,000 and were billed for $1,400 — the
hospital’s rate for the uninsured, even though the family is covered by a health maintenance organization under Medicaid,
the federal-state program for poor people.

Summary of the Law

We have reviewed every reported case under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591, 2422(b), and 2423(b),
and cannot find a single one that resulted in a conviction on facts akin to the ones here. In some
respects, it is not surprising that no precedent supports federal prosecution of a man who engaged
in consensual conduct, in his home, that amounts to solicitation under State law. After all,
prostitution, even when the allegations involve minors, is fundamentally a State concern, United
States v. Evans, 476 F.3d 1176, n.1 (11th Cir. 2007) (noting that federal law “does not
criminalize all acts of prostitution (a vice traditionally governed by state regulation)”), and there
is no evidence that Palm Beach County authorities and Florida prosecutors cannot effectively
prosecute and punish the conduct. See also Batchelder v. Gonzalez, No. 4:07-cv-00330-SPM-
AK, 2007 WL 5022105 (N.D. Fla. Oct. 19, 2007). In fact, the opposite is true—the state-elected
officials, cognizant of the local mores of the community, have a lauded history of just such
prosecutions.

In any event, and as set forth below, none of the federal statutes in this case remotely
supports a prosecution on the facts of this case without each and every element being stretched in
a novel way to encompass the behavior at issue. We begin with first principles. Courts in this
country have “traditionally exercised restraint in assessing the reach of federal criminal statutes,
both out of deference to the prerogatives of Congress, Dowling v. United States, 473 U.S. 207
(1985), and out of concern that ‘a fair warning should be given to the world in language that the
common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed.”” Arthur
Andersen LLP v. United States, 544 U.S. 696, 703 (2005) (quoting McBoyle v. United States, 283
USS. 25, 27 (1931)) (citation omitted),

Two recent Supreme Court decisions dramatically underscore these principles and help to
highlight why federal prosecution in this case would be improper as a matter of both law and
policy. See United States v. Santos, No. 06-1005 (June 2, 2008); Cuellar v. United States, No.
06-1456 (June 2, 2008). Though they both address the interpretation and application of the
federal money laundering statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1956, the principles they set forth are equally
applicable here. In Santos, the Court held that the statutory term “proceeds” means “profits”
rather than “receipts,” and thus gave the statute a significantly narrower interpretation than what
the government had urged. In his plurality opinion, Justice Scalia emphasized that where a
statutory term in a criminal statute could support either a narrow or broad application, the narrow
interpretation must be adopted because “[w]e interpret ambiguous criminal statutes in favor of
defendants, not prosecutors.” Slip op. at 12. As his opinion explained, the rule of lenity “not
only vindicates the fimdamental principle that no citizen should be held accountable for a
violation of a statute whose commands are uncertain, or subjected to punishment that is not
clearly proscribed. It also places the weight of inertia upon the party that can best induce

that the world must learn to live with this new reality.

But this election should be a wake-up call to Jews. There is no permanent empire, nor is there
an enduring haven for Jews anywhere in the exile. The American empire began to decline in
2007, and the deterioration has been exacerbated in the last five years. This election only
hastens that decline.

Society is permeated with sloth, greed, envy and materialistic excess. It has lost its moorings
and its moral foundations.. The takers outnumber the givers, and that will only increase in
years to come.

The Occupy riots across this country in the last two years
were mere dress rehearsals for what lies ahead - years of
unrest sparked by the increasing discontent of the
unsuccessful who want to seize the fruits and the bounty of
the successful, and do not appreciate the slow pace of
redistribution.

If this election proves one thing, it is that the Old America is gone. And, sad for the world, it is

not coming back.
The problems we face today are there because the people who

work for a living are outnumbered by those who vote for a

in a Wagner Act-era Senate hearing, as
cited by Americans for Limited
Government (ALG), in which it was
acknowledged that the language of
Section 6 indeed grants “broad powers”
to the Board.?7

And in January of this year, a
unanimous Supreme Court, in Mayo
Foundation for Medical Education and
Research v. United States, affirmed this
key principle that a broad grant of
statutory rulemaking authority conveys
authority to adopt legislative rules.28
Mayo concerned in part the question of
how much deference a Treasury
Department tax regulation should
receive. In Mayo, an amicus argued that
the Treasury Department’s
interpretation should receive less
deference because it was issued under a
general grant of rulemaking authority, as
opposed to an interpretation issued
under a specific grant of authority.?9
The Court responded by first explaining
its earlier holding in U.S. v. Mead, that
Chevron deference is appropriate “when
it appears that Congress delegated
authority to the agency generally to
make rules carrying the force of law,
and that the agency interpretation
claiming deference was promulgated in
the exercise of that authority.” 3° Then,
in significant part, the Court observed:

Our inquiry in that regard does not turn on
whether Congress’s delegation of authority
was general or specific.
* * * * *
The Department issued the full-time
employee rule pursuant to the explicit
authorization to “prescribe all needful rules
and regulations for the enforcement’ of the
Internal Revenue Code. 26 U.S.C. 7805(a). We
have found such “express congressional
authorizations to engage in the process of
rulemaking” to be “a very good indicator of
delegation meriting Chevron treatment.” 34

And so, all nine members of the
Supreme Court agreed on the following
key principle: an express, albeit general,
grant of rulemaking authority is fully
sufficient for an agency to receive
Chevron deference for its rulemaking. It
follows that a broad grant of rulemaking
authority will suffice for the agency to
engage in legislative rulemaking in the
first place. Thus, the Supreme Court’s

and citations omitted).

rulings continue to fully support a broad
construction of Section 6.

Disputing this conclusion, ALG
asserts that Section 6 was intended to be
used “primarily”’ for procedural
rulemaking, and cites a Senate report
from the Wagner Act’s legislative
history. That Senate report explains:
“TiJn no case do the rules have the force
of law in the sense that criminal
penalties or fines accrue for their
violation, and it seems sufficient that
the rules prescribed must be ‘necessary
to carry out the provisions’ of the
act.” 32 The Board disagrees. The cited
language merely proclaims the obvious,
that no criminal penalties or fines
accrue for violating the Board’s rules.
However, laws such as the NLRA that
do not impose criminal penalties or
fines for their violation can also have
the “force of law” (which is perhaps
why the Senate report used the limiting
phrase “‘in the sense of”). The Supreme
Court has previously recognized that
final Agency orders under Sections 10
(e) and (f) of the Act, despite their non-
self enforcing nature, have ‘‘the force
and effect of law.” 33 So too, do the
Board’s rules have the force and effect
of law, as held by the Supreme Court in
AHA.34

Several comments discuss whether
Board Rule 103.20, which mandates the
posting of an election notice in a
workplace three working days prior to a
representation election, should be
considered analogous to the proposed
tule. The United Food and Commercial
Workers International Union (UFCW)
comments that the election rule is, like
the proposed rule, only minimally
burdensome and further noted that it
has never been challenged.25 ALG
disagrees that the election rule should
be considered analogous here, because
although in the election context a notice
posting is the most feasible means to
inform employees about an upcoming
election that is occurring at a specific

34.499 U.S. at 609-10. But even if one were to
construe the report in the way advocated by the
comment, such reports themselves do not have the
force and effect of law, see Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S.
182, 192 (1993); AHA, 499 U.S. at 616, and thus at
best are only potential evidence of legislative intent.

35 However, it is incorrect that the rule has never
been challenged; it has been challenged and
upheld. See Pannier Corp. v. NLRB, 120 F.3d 603,
606-07 (6th Cir. 1997) (rejecting an as-applied
challenge to Rule 103.20).

place and time, that is not the case in
the NLRA rights context, in which
employees can just search the Internet
to find out more information. The Board
agrees with the UFCW that posting a
notice is a minimally burdensome way
to ensure that employees receive certain
information, although obviously, the
proposed notice will reach many more
employers over a much longer period of
time than do election notices. And
ALG’s acknowledgment that a notice
posting in the workplace is in fact
sometimes the most feasible means to
inform employees of important
information supports the Board’s belief,
explained below, that workplace notice
posting is a more efficient way of
informing employees of their NLRA
rights than relying on information
available on the Internet.

A few comments argue that the Board
is a law enforcement agency only, and
should not be engaging in rulemaking
for that reason. One comment asserts
that “Congress did not intend to
“empower the NLRB to be a rulemaking
body, but rather an investigatory/
enforcement agent of the NLRA.”’ 35 The
Board responds that by enacting Section
6, Congress plainly and explicitly
intended to, and did, “empower the
NLRB to be a rulemaking body.” And,
as shown above, AHA conclusively
found that the Board is empowered to
use its rulemaking powers, as the Court
had previously indicated in Wyman-
Gordon and Bell Aerospace.*”

A joint comment submitted by
Douglas Holtz-Eakin and Sam Batkins
argues against the Board’s assertion of
Section 6 authority here by asserting
that “the Supreme Court has
circumscribed NLRB rulemaking in the
past: ‘The deference owed to an expert
tribunal cannot be allowed to slip into
a judicial inertia which results in the
unauthorized assumption by an agency
of major policy decisions properly made
by Congress.’ ’’ However, that comment
neglects to provide the citation for that
quotation, American Ship Building Co.
v. NLRB,3® which was not a rulemaking
case but an adjudication. In any event,
the Board does not agree that this rule
presumes to make a major policy
decision properly made by Congress
alone. As explained in subsection B,

example, it noted that the NLRB is similar to the
FTC in its methods of adjudication and
enforcement, but the Supreme Court had repeatedly
encouraged the Board to utilize its rulemaking
powers. Id. at 684.

“The End of History and the Last Man” testified to this sense of
triumph and historical duty.

Such a conjuncture set the stage for a new wave of imperialism
(though the reluctance to use the word remained). In doing so, it was
bound to affect interpretations of the old imperialism, which was now
extolled for spreading economic progress, the rule of law, and science
and technology to countries that would never have benefited from
them otherwise.

Foremost among the new generation of revisionist historians was
Niall Ferguson of Harvard University, whose television series, based
on his new book “Civilization: The West and the Rest,” has just
started showing in Britain. In its first episode, Ferguson appears amid
the splendid monuments of China’s Ming Dynasty, which, in the 15th
century, was undoubtedly the greatest civilization of the day, with its
naval expeditions reaching the coasts of Africa. After that, it was all
downhill for China (and “the rest”) and all uphill for the West.
Ferguson snazzily summarizes the reasons for this reversal in six
“killer apps:” competition, science, property rights, medicine, the
consumer society and the work ethic. Against such tools — unique
products of Western civilization — the rest had no chance. From such
a perspective, imperialism, old and new, has been a beneficent
influence, because it has been the means of spreading these “apps” to
the rest of the world, thereby enabling them to enjoy the fruits of
progress hitherto confined to a few Western countries.
Understandably, this thesis has not met with universal approbation.
The historian Alex von Tunzelmann accused Ferguson of leaving out
all of imperialism’s nasty bits: the Black War in Australia, the
German genocide in Namibia, the Belgian exterminations in the
Congo, the Amritsar Massacre, the Bengal Famine, the Irish potato
famine, and much else.

Trump was not a politician who could parse factions of support and opprobrium; he
was a salesman who needed to make a sale. “I won. I am the winner. I am not the loser,”
he repeated, incredulously, like a mantra.

Bannon described Trump as a simple machine. The On switch was full of flattery, the
Off switch full of calumny. The flattery was dripping, slavish, cast in ultimate
superlatives, and entirely disconnected from reality: so-and-so was the best, the most
incredible, the ne plus ultra, the eternal. The calumny was angry, bitter, resentful, ever a
casting out and closing of the iron door.

This was the nature of Trump’s particular salesmanship. His strategic belief was that
there was no reason not to heap excessive puffery on a prospect. But if the prospect was
ruled out as a buyer, there was no reason not to heap scorn and lawsuits on him or her.
After all, if they don’t respond to sucking up, they might respond to piling on. Bannon felt
—perhaps with overconfidence—that Trump could be easily switched on and off.

Against the background of a mortal war of wills—with the media, the Democrats, and
the swamp—that Bannon was encouraging him to wage, Trump could also be courted. In
some sense, he wanted nothing so much as to be courted.

Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, the owner of the Washington Post, which had become one of the
many Trump media bétes noires in the media world, nevertheless took pains to reach out
not only to the presidentelect but to his daughter Ivanka. During the campaign, Trump said
Amazon was getting “away with murder taxwise” and that if he won, “Oh, do they have
problems.” Now Trump was suddenly praising Bezos as “a top-level genius.” Elon Musk,
in Trump Tower, pitched Trump on the new administration’s joining him in his race to
Mars, which Trump jumped at. Stephen Schwarzman, the head of the Blackstone Group—
and a Kushner friend—offered to organize a business council for Trump, which Trump
embraced. Anna Wintour, the Vogue editor and fashion industry queen, had hoped to be
named America’s ambassador to the UK under Obama and, when that didn’t happen,
closely aligned herself with Hillary Clinton. Now Wintour arrived at Trump Tower (but
refused to do the perp walk) and suggested that she become Trump’s ambassador to the
Court of St. James’s. And Trump was inclined to entertain the idea. (“Fortunately,” said
Bannon, “there was no chemistry.”’)

On December 14, a high-level delegation from Silicon Valley came to Trump Tower to
meet the president-elect, though Trump had repeatedly criticized the tech industry
throughout the campaign. Later that afternoon, Trump called Rupert Murdoch, who asked
him how the meeting had gone.

“Oh, great, just great,” said Trump. “Really, really good. These guys really need my
help. Obama was not very favorable to them, too much regulation. This is really an
opportunity for me to help them.”

Bannon the European: He's opening the populist fort in Brussels 
The former Trump strategist arrives in Europe with The Movement. Objective: an alliance 
between right-wing leaders, from Salvini to Orban in view of the 2019 elections 
NEW YORK. The invasion of Europe has begun. Steve Bannon, 65, the American far-right guru 
who was Donald Trump's right-hand man in the White House — but let go last summer following 
the racist violence in Charlottesville — is preparing to march on Brussels. Launching, he told the 
Daily Beast himself, a new non-profit foundation called The Movement, (II Movimento), right in the 
heart of Europe and its institutions. Through which he hopes to coordinate the populist right in view 
of the European elections which will be held in spring 2019. 
Objective: to compete with George Soros, the American billionaire of Hungarian origin, benefactor 
of the Democratic party, who since 1984 with his Open Society has spent at least $32 billion in 
support of NGOs dealing with human rights. And for this he became the bogeyman of the populist 
right, accused of plots of all kinds: including that of wanting to replace Italians with immigrants in 
order to have labour at low cost. A mantra repeated in the past on Twitter also by the current 
Minister of the Interior Matteo Salvini. 
The ambition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site Breitbart — which in 
the European campaign preceded him since the platform had already opened bureaux in London and 
Rome — is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great populist international of which he 
has long since been dreaming. 
The Movement, in fact, intends to function as an extreme right-wing think tank: a source of strategic 
advice to channel the not-so-politically structured discontent of the most extreme European 
movements. Analysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and channeling 
funding. 
The aim is to create a populist alliance, a sort of super group that if victorious can conquer up to a 
third of the European Parliament in the elections next May. 
Indeed — putting the common policy of the Old Continent in the hands of Bannon and his own. The 
American strategist is very attached to the Freedom Caucus — the extreme right of the US Congress 
— and in 2014 he was at the top of the Cambridge Analytica company, which in 2016 used data 
stolen from Facebook to try to influence the presidential election from which Donald Trump 
emerged victor. It is not a mystery that for a long time he courts nationalists of the right from East to 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 019322 
West. And he has already met, among others, the Hungarian Orban, the French Marine Le Pen and 
the former leader of the British separatists Nigel Farage. The latter reappeared, coincidentally, on 
Friday in Pennsylvania, USA, to a fundraiser in favor of the Republican congressman Lou Barletta. 
Without forgetting the Italians of Lega and 5 stars. Of them, he said: If it works in Italy, we can 
import the model anywhere. 
The Movement, which for now will count on a staff of 10 people, will be fully operational in 2019. 
In short, after the American midterm elections, where Bannon is fighting to influence the primaries 
supporting candidates potentially able to undermine the prospects of Republican establishment. But 
in the future the former spin doctor says he wants to spend more and more time in Europe. Also 
because the relationships with Trump have worsened after the revelations he made to Michael Wolff 
and published in the scandal book Fire and Fury. Better to reign in Hell than to serve in 
Paradise, Bannon says now paraphrasing the Satan of one of his favorite books, John Milton's Lost 
Paradise. Hell in this case would be the dear old Europe and its democratic values. The army of 
darkness is already among us.

Case 5:16-cv-00797-DMG-KS Document1 Filed 04/26/16 Page4of6 Page ID#:4

15. Shortly after this sexual assault by the Defendant, Jeffrey E. Epstein, on the Plaintiff, Katie
Johnson, Plaintiff Johnson was still present while the two Defendants were arguing over who would
be the one to take Plaintiff Johnson's virginity. The Defendant, Donald J. Trump, was clearly heard
referring to Defendant, Jeffrey E. Epstein, as a Jew Bastard as he yelled at Defendant Epstein, that
clearly, he, Defendant Trump, should be the lucky one to pop the cherry of Plaintiff Johnson.

16. The third and final sexual assault by the Defendant, Jeffrey E. Epstein, on the Plaintiff, Kati
Johnson, took place after Plaintiff Johnson had been brutally and savagely raped by Defendant
Trump. While receiving another full body massage from Plaintiff Johnson, while in the nude,
Defendant Epstein became so enraged after finding out that Defendant Trump had been the one to
take Plaintiff Johnson's virginity, that Defendant Epstein also violently raped Plaintiff Johnson.
After forcing Plaintiff Johnson to disrobe into her bra and panties, while receiving a massage from
the Plaintiff, Defendant Epstein attempted to enter Plaintiff Johnson's anal cavity with his erect
penis while trying to restrain her. Plaintiff Johnson attempted to push Defendant Epstein away, at
which time Defendant Epstein attempted to enter Plaintiff Johnson's vagina with his erect penis.
This attempt to brutally sodomize and rape Plaintiff Johnson by Defendant Epstein was finally
repelled by Plaintiff Johnson but not before Defendant Epstein was able to achieve sexual orgasm.
After perversely sodomizing and raping the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, the Defendant, Jeffrey E.
Epstein, attempted to strike her about the head with his closed fists while he angrily screamed at
Plaintiff Johnson that he, Defendant Epstein, should have been the one who took her cherry, not
Mr. Trump, before she finally managed to break away from Defendant Epstein.

17. The Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, was fully warned on more than one occasion by both
Defendants, Donald J. Trump and Jeffrey E. Epstein, that were she ever to reveal any of the details
of the sexual and physical abuse that she had suffered as a sex slave for Defendant Trump and
Defendant Epstein, that Plaintiff Johnson and her family would be in mortal danger. Plaintiff
Johnson was warned that this would mean certain death for herself and Plaintiff Johnson's family
unless she remained silent forever on the exact details of the depraved and perverted sexual and
physical abuse she had been forced to endure from the Defendants.

"
IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015965.txt,"f you believe humans outthink computers, be warned; you are in

controversial territory. This would need a hyper-computer and many

scientists speak of these in the same breath as perpetual motion
machines.

I’m not sure it’s an entirely fair analogy. We understand machines,
and the physical laws of our Universe forbid perpetual motion. We
don't understand brains, so we can't reasonably dismiss human hyper-
computing. Humans commonly demonstrate one clear example of
thinking which appears to break the Turing limit, namely finding
solutions to mathematical puzzles. We need an explanation for this.
Let me take you on a whistle-stop tour of all the schemes people have
imagined that might lead to a hyper-computer.

A hyper-computer is a machine that can calculate a function which
a Turing machine can not. For example, when given a number denoting
a problem such as Fermat’s Last Theorem, it can give me in return a
number representing a valid proof. We are not concerned here with
speed. We are talking about fundamental ‘do-ability’ Such machines are
often dubbed ‘super-Turing’.

Epic Fails

Let us first look at some proposals that blatantly fail. My children call
these ‘epic fails, and they are the perpetual motion machines of the
hyper-computing world.

Could we run many Turing machines at the same time, perhaps
even an infinite number? Then we would have a much more powerful
machine that must beat the Turing limit.

The answer is no.

Turing machines are already infinitely powerful and we know from
our chapter on infinity that all countable infinities are the same. Infinity
plus infinity, infinity times infinity, infinity to any power; all are equal.
One single, fast, one-dimensional machine can simulate them all. We get
no greater power with an infinite number of similar machines.

The next technique which might realize a hyper-computer is to
have a machine which simultaneously runs every possible branch in a
program. Each time the machine gets to a point where there is a binary
decision, it can take the ‘yes’ branch, spawn a copy of itself, and run the
‘no’ branch as well. Logically this machine should be able to calculate
anything since it tries every conceivable option. The process is called
non-determinism. This doesn’t mean the computer has free will. It just
means the computer never chooses one option over another. It just

such a thing might easily fit inside our skulls, and the physics within our
brains are certainly capable of using real analogue values.

The biggest stumbling block for Siegelmann’s idea is the information
that gives her machines their power is fine-grained and easily destroyed by
noise in the environment. This is not just from the sort of electrical noise
we hear when our cell phones interfere with the radio, but the precision
required by her machines is so exacting that anything might interfere
with them. For example, gravitational waves caused by the motions of
nearby stars would disturb calculations at only the fiftieth decimal place.
Since it is these digits that constitute the difference between an ARNN
and a regular Turing machine, most people conclude ARNNs can’t work.
There is one effect stemming from the quantum world which might
come to the rescue. The potential to do something in the quantum world
is sufficient to modify the behavior of a system even if the system does
not actually do that specific thing. This is called a counterfactual process.
The possibility an ARNN might perform infinite precision calculations
may be enough to give the machine the edge, even though in practice it is
disturbed by noise. This is speculation upon speculation, but interesting
nevertheless.

Dear Professor Krauss,

We met briefly after your talk in Ithaca a few months ago — I'm the girl on The Skeptics’ Guide to the
Universe podcast. I've really enjoyed your talks and books, but I was surprised to see you quoted in the
Daily Beast recently defending Jeffrey Epstein:

http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/201 1-04-01/bill-clinton-katie-couric-woody-allen-jeffrey-

epsteins-society-friends-close-ranks/2/

Can you confirm if the following quote is accurate?

If anything, the unfortunate period he suffered has caused him to really think about what he wants to do
with his money and his time, and support knowledge,” says Krauss. Jeffrey has surrounded himself with
beautiful women and young women but they're not as young as the ones that were claimed. As a scientist I
always judge things on empirical evidence and he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I've
never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my presumption is that whatever the problems were I would
believe him over other people. Though colleagues have criticized him over his relationship with Epstein,
Krauss insists, I don't feel tarnished in any way by my relationship with Jeffrey; I feel raised by it.”

Improvements would be like adding a set of designer curtains to a jail cell: better but far from good. In
the context of this chapter, “job” will refer to both a company if you run one and a normal job if you
have one. Some recommendations are limited to one of the two but most are relevant to both. So we
begin.

I have quit three jobs and been fired from most of the rest. Getting fired, despite sometimes coming as
a surprise and leaving you scrambling to recover, is often a godsend: Someone else makes the decision
for you, and it’s impossible to sit in the wrong job for the rest of your life. Most people aren’t lucky
enough to get fired and die a slow spiritual death over 30-40 years of tolerating the mediocre.

The nature of the role of the modern chief of staff is a focus of much White House
scholarship. As much as the president himself, the chief of staff determines how the White
House and executive branch—which employs 4 million people, including 1.3 million
people in the armed services—will run.

The job has been construed as deputy president, or chief operating officer, or even
prime minister. Larger-than-life chiefs have included Richard Nixon’s H. R. Haldeman
and Alexander Haig; Gerald Ford’s Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney; Jimmy Carter’s
Hamilton Jordan; Ronald Reagan’s James Baker; George H. W. Bush’s return of James
Baker; Bill Clinton’s Leon Panetta, Erskine Bowles, and John Podesta; George W. Bush’s
Andrew Card; and Barack Obama’s Rahm Emanuel and Bill Daley. Anyone studying the
position would conclude that a stronger chief of staff is better than a weaker one, and a
chief of staff with a history in Washington and the federal government is better than an
outsider.

Donald Trump had little, if any, awareness of the history of or the thinking about this
role. Instead, he substituted his own management style and experience. For decades, he
had relied on longtime retainers, cronies, and family. Even though Trump liked to portray
his business as an empire, it was actually a discrete holding company and boutique
enterprise, catering more to his peculiarities as proprietor and brand representative than to
any bottom line or other performance measures.

His sons, Don Jr. and Eric—jokingly behind their backs known to Trump insiders as
Uday and Qusay, after the sons of Saddam Hussein—wondered if there couldn’t somehow
be two parallel White House structures, one dedicated to their father’s big-picture views,
personal appearances, and salesmanship and the other concerned with day-to-day
management issues. In this construct, they saw themselves tending to the day-to-day
operations.

One of Trump’s early ideas was to recruit his friend Tom Barrack—part of his kitchen
cabinet of real estate tycoons including Steven Roth and Richard Lefrak—and make him
chief of staff.

Barrack, the grandson of Lebanese immigrants, is a starstruck real estate investor of
legendary acumen who owns Michael Jackson’s former oddball paradise, Neverland
Ranch. With Jeffrey Epstein—the New York financier who would become a tabloid
regular after a guilty plea to one count of soliciting prostitution that sent him to jail in
2008 in Palm Beach for thirteen months—Trump and Barrack were a 1980s and 90s set
of nightlife Musketeers.

The founder and CEO of the private equity firm Colony Capital, Barrack became a
billionaire making investments in distress debt investments in real estate around the world,

A small point on the election that maybe you think might have some value for HC 
1-In Europe a LOT of citizens start becoming very angry and voting for populist parties 
2-A major reason is that the interconnected world shows them every minute on their smartphones how rich 
people are living and envy sets in (especially with raising inequality that is perfectly normal when financial 
returns of rich people are exponential and work returns are linear) 
3-They want change and risk electing completely wrong people (Italy 5stelle, France LePen might be next, 
Hungary, Greece already lost, Brexit and anti-trade another example) 
4-US election is over, Trump has destroyed himself as expected (I was in Wharton with Donald Jr, 3.95GPA vs. 
2.5 GPA but he thought he was a god... what a family) 
the message: 
5-Maybe HC can use the last debates to create weapons for change. She could acknowledge that she 
understands that people want change, and ask for a clear majority in the senate thinking abou that instead of 
presidential elections. Then if she does bad in 4 years she is out, but she could make the public understand that 
senate is key to show what a president can do. 
But again, I know 0.001% of what you or them understands about politics, I am however worried that europe is 
just 5 or 10 years ahead on this trend compared to the US in anti-establishment feelings and I have seen with 
friends how irrational and influenceable masses can become in voting when they are frustrated (Hitler was 
elected after all...)

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029511.txt,"my father was. But she had enough ideas in her upbringing to say that the world you
experience as everyday reality is not real. She would say that probably because she had
heard it an amount of times. But when you’re a child, that sticks with you, that the world
you experience is not real. So that’s my childhood background until I went to medical
school. Medical school, I embraced everything that my father had taught about reality being
physical, material. He was actually more than—he was almost like Michael Shermer in the
earlier days when I was growing up.

Matt: How did your parents get along?
Deepak: Oh he was a very loving person.
Matt: Completely different philosophies.

Deepak: Yeah but he was an amazing person in terms of being a physician. I mean this is
long before technology. He could listen to a heart with a stethoscope and tell you, which you
may or may not know, the PR interval, which means the difference in microseconds between
the atrial and the ventricular beat, which you could verify on an electrocardiogram. He was
astonishing as a diagnostician. He trained with Wallace Brigden in England who was one of
the earlier pioneers in electrocardiography. He was a consultant to the royal heart hospital to
the queen at one time before he came back to India, the British army. So, he was an amazing
person but he was also very compassionate. On weekends he would see patients free of
charge, and my mother would cook food for them and make sure they had enough money for
their bus or their train. So there was a very compassionate aspect to him, but he didn’t
believe in religion or anything like that.

So then when I went to medical school I totally embraced my father’s constructs. Except for
one or two experiences during medical school, which was in India by the way. And it was
one of the newer medical schools after British independence, called the Indian Institute of
Medical Sciences, and it was funded by, amongst other people, the Rockefeller Foundation,
and so we had lots of international faculty. So in my fourth year of medical school, when the
Beatles were in India—that’s George Harrison behind you, by the way, in a turban sitting
next to me. So that is a later picture but the Beatles came to India in 1969, when I was
finishing my medical school. I didn’t know these guys at that time. But Sergeant Pepper’s
had come out, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, and we had four medical students as visitors
to our classroom for the summer from Harvard. And they had with them a bunch of LSD. So
my first experience was—and I was just near 18, when we had the first LSD experience.
And then another one. Twice. And suddenly what my mother had been saying all these years
about the world being an illusion was in the way an epiphany to me, at the age of 17. I mean
I saw that the construction of—dissolving of boundaries like this, this, this and melting
away. And then just colors and shapes and forms and sounds. And then a vast nothingness
with no boundaries. But I was there. Not as a body, not as a mind, not as anything I could
identify with, but just totally boundless. It was totally life-shifting at the age of 18 years. But

IV. Prof. Dershowitz Immediately Responded to Jane Doe #3’s Allegations
Against Him by Asking to Defend his Reputation

Jane Doe #3 also argues that Prof. Dershowitz should not be allowed to intervene because
“he has declined to defend his reputation in other actions.” (DE 279, at 12.) This is
demonstrably false. It is without question that the Motion for Joinder filed by Jane Doe #3 on
December 30, 2014 (DE 279) was the first time anyone has ever alleged that Prof. Dershowitz
had any sexual contact with a minor. It necessarily follows that this is the first opportunity Prof.
Dershowitz has had to defend his reputation related to “his involvement in Epstein’s offenses.”
In fact, just six days after these venomous allegations were made, Prof. Dershowitz filed his
Motion for Limited Intervention. (DE 282.)

More specifically, Jane Doe #3 argues that when the civil lawsuit was brought by “one of
the underage females” against Epstein in 2009 (Doe v. Epstein, No. 9:08-80893-KAM (S.D.
Fla.), “Dershowitz understood that counsel for many of Epstein’s victims believed that mounting
evidence pointed toward his role extending beyond merely being an attorney for Epstein.” (DE
279 at 13.) This, too, is demonstrably false. Despite this rank and self-serving speculation about
what Prof. Dershowitz “understood,” there is not one piece of evidence which points to any
allegations that he engaged in any sexual contact with any minor, or even observed any criminal
activity, prior to the December 30, 2014 Motion for Joinder. Instead, the deposition testimony
which Jane Doe #3 points to simply states that Prof. Dershowitz visited Epstein’s home
(Deposition Testimony of Alfredo Rodriguez at 199, 278, 279, DE 291-18, herein, “Rodriguez
Depo. Tr.”) Rodriguez specifically testified that he has no idea whether Prof. Dershowitz had

any contact at all with any female.

exercising one right and not the other
would upset the balanced recitation of
rights. If employees have questions
concerning how they can exercise their
rights, the notice encourages them to
contact the Board.

The Board has also determined that
the addition of Beck rights in the final
notice is unnecessary. Those rights
apply only to employees who are
represented by unions under collective-
bargaining agreements containing
union-security provisions. As stated in
the NPRM, unions that seek to obligate
employees to pay dues and fees under
those provisions are required to inform
those employees of their Beck rights.
See California Saw & Knife Works,
above, 320 NLRB at 233. See 75 FR at
80412-80413. The Board was presented
with no evidence during this
rulemaking that suggests that unions are
not generally complying with their
notice obligations. In addition, the
Notice of Election, which is posted days
before employees vote on whether to be
represented by a union, contains an
explanation of Beck rights. Moreover, as
the Board stated in the NPRM, only
about 8 percent of all private sector
employees are represented by unions,
and by no means are all of them subject
to union-security clauses. Accordingly,
the number of employees to whom Beck
applies is significantly smaller than the
number of employees in the private
sector covered by the NLRA. Id. at
80413. Indeed, in the “‘right-to-work’”’
states, where union-security clauses are
prohibited, no employees are covered by
union security clauses, with the
possible exception of employees who
work in a Federal enclave where state
laws do not apply. Accordingly, because
Beck does not apply to the
overwhelming majority of employees in
today’s private sector workplace, and
because unions already are obliged to
inform the employees to whom it does
apply of their Beck rights, the Board is
not including Beck notification in the
final notice.

The Board also disagrees with the
comment from Baker & McKenzie
contending that an exhaustive list of
additional rights should be included in
the notice. In addition to the reasons
discussed above, the Board finds that it
would not be appropriate to include
those rights, most of which are rights of
union members vis-a-vis their unions.
For example, the comment suggests
including the “right for each union
member to insist that his/her dues and
initiation fees not be increased * * *
except by a majority vote by secret
ballot * * *,” the ‘‘right of each
employee in a bargaining unit to receive
a copy of the collective bargaining

agreement,” and the “‘right to nominate
candidates, to vote in elections of the
labor organization, to attend
membership meetings, and to
participate in the deliberations and
voting upon business properly before
the meeting.” Those rights are not found
in the NLRA, but instead arise from
other Federal labor laws not
administered by the NLRB. See Labor-
Management Reporting and Disclosure
Act of 1959, 29 U.S.C. 401 et seq
(LMRDA). The Board finds that it would
be inappropriate to include those
additional rights in a notice informing
employees of their rights under the
NLRA.

vi. Other Comments

The Board has also considered, but
rejected, the contention that the notice
contain simply a “short and plain”
description of rights such as that used
in remedial notices. See Ishikawa
Gasket America, Inc., above. The two
notices have different purposes: one
looks back; the other, forward. As
explained in the NPRM, the principal
purpose of a remedial notice is to
inform employees of unlawful conduct
that has taken place and what is being
done to remedy that conduct.
Accordingly, although a remedial notice
contains only a brief summary of NLRA
rights, it also contains examples of
unlawful actions that have been
committed. To the extent that such a
notice generally increases employees’
awareness of their rights, the unlawful
conduct detailed adds to that awareness.
The proposed notice, by contrast, is a
notice intended to make employees
aware of their NLRA rights generally. It
normally will not be posted against a
background of already-committed unfair
labor practices; it therefore needs to
contain a summary both of NLRA rights
and examples of unlawful conduct in
order to inform employees effectively of
the extent of their NLRA rights and of
the availability of remedies for
violations of those rights. Moreover, as
the Board explained in the NPRM, the
general notice of rights posted in the
pre-election notice is sufficient because
at least one union along with the
employer is on the scene to enlighten
employees of their rights under the
NLRA. 75 FR 80412 fn.19.

The fundamental rights described in
the notice are well established and have
been unchanged for much of the Board’s
history. Accordingly, the Board does not
share the concern expressed in some
comments that a new notice will have
to be posted each time the composition
of the Board changes.

Finally, the Board rejects the
contention that the notice should

address certain rights of employers. The
notice is intended to inform employees
of their rights, not those of their
employers.

For all the foregoing reasons, the
Board finds it unnecessary to modify the
section of the notice summarizing
employees’ NLRA rights.

c. The Examples of Unlawful Employer
Conduct in the Notice

The proposed notice contained the
following examples of unlawful
conduct:

Under the NLRA, it is illegal for your
employer to:

Prohibit you from soliciting for a union
during non-work time, such as before or after
work or during break times; or from
distributing union literature during non-work
time, in non-work areas, such as parking lots
or break rooms.

Question you about your union support or
activities in a manner that discourages you
from engaging in that activity.

Fire, demote, or transfer you, or reduce
your hours or change your shift, or otherwise
take adverse action against you, or threaten
to take any of these actions, because you join
or support a union, or because you engage in
concerted activity for mutual aid and
protection, or because you choose not to
engage in any such activity.

Threaten to close your workplace if
workers choose a union to represent them.

Promise or grant promotions, pay raises, or
other benefits to discourage or encourage
union support.

Prohibit you from wearing union hats,
buttons, t-shirts, and pins in the workplace
except under special circumstances.

Spy on or videotape peaceful union
activities and gatherings or pretend to do so.
75 FR 80419.

The Board received limited comments
on six of the seven examples of
unlawful employer conduct. As a
general matter, some comments contend
that the number of examples of
employer misconduct is
disproportionate compared to the
examples of union misconduct.1°® Most
of the comments refer to the number of
paragraphs devoted to illegal employer
conduct (7) and the number of
paragraphs devoted to illegal union
conduct (5). Several comments indicate
that when one compares the employer
misconduct listed in Section 8(a) of the
NLRA with union misconduct listed in
Section 8(b), no such imbalance appears
in the text of the statute. Several
comments provide additional examples
of union misconduct that they say
should be included.

As with the notice’s statement of
affirmative rights, some of the

108 See, e.g., comments of COLLE, Baker &
McKenzie, National Association of Manufacturers,
and American Trucking Association.

We can only speculate why Obama has such difficulty in effectively
using the U.S. military as an instrument of national purpose.
Winston Churchill said, “In critical and baffling situations, it is
always best to return to first principle and simple action.”

What is Obama’s first principle regarding the application of the use
of force in the international arena? He seems to possess no abiding
strategic framework about that preeminent presidential responsibility.
He makes no clear connection between the use of force and vital U.S.
national interests.

Thus, he recklessly withdraws from Iraq, imprudently escalates in
Afghanistan and unwisely intervenes in Libya. One can only wonder
and worry what he will do if and when he confronts the next crisis
which could involve committing American men and women to
combat.

Robert D. Blackwill is Henry A. Kissinger senior fellow for U.S.
foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. He served as
deputy national security adviser for strategic planning, ambassador
to India and presidential envoy to Iraq in the George W. Bush
administration.

So as sitting here today, I can't recall a

his city’s independence from the looming Sino-US trade war. Garcetti stated that Los
Angeles and China “have closely integrated economies, closely integrated cultures and
closely integrated geography. ... We hope to be the leading Chinese city in America

for investment, tourism and students.”!”

Sometimes federalism, in the form of local leaders’ independent China policies,

is a good thing and may, during times of upheaval in Washington, DC, help to

offset unwise national policies. But if US-China relations continue on their current
downward trajectory, there will be an increased danger that independent state and
municipal China policies will sometimes conflict with national interest and hinder the
United States in its competition with China to shape global norms

and practices. As China’s wealth and ambition grow and as Beijing is becoming more
adept at turning local American “China interests” into Chinese leverage, sub-national
American governmental entities that formed their China policies in the Era of
Engagement must become mindful that a new era will require them to develop new

strategies for a new Era of Competition.

Conclusion and Recommendations

The following practices can foster the kind of constructive vigilance that local

governments will need to exercise in their continued cooperation with China.

Promote Transparency

Sub-national governments should:

e Not have secret agreements with Chinese entities, including foundations,
corporations, or individuals. All MOUs and contracts should be transparent
and public. All cooperative proposals should be subject to public hearings.
All potential projects should receive the same due diligence that partnerships
with American entities would demand. No exceptions to American laws or best
practices should be made to placate allegedly “Chinese” customs. And in no way
should China be allowed to have a veto over potential exchanges with other

countries, entities, or individuals such as Taiwan or the Dalai Lama.

e Share experiences and concerns with peers through the National Conference of
Mayors, the National Governors Association, the National Council of County

Association Executives, and the National Conference of State Legislatures. Best

sexual organ of another; anal or vaginal penetration of another by any other object; or the
handling or fondling of the sexual organ of another for the purpose of masturbation.” Fla. Stat. §
796.01(1)(d). Also, the Florida Supreme Court jury instructions define prostitution as involving

“sexual intercourse.” As a result, topless massages—even ones for hire that include self-
masturbation—fall outside the ambit of the state-law definition of prostitution. Absent proof
beyond a reasonable doubt that, at the critical time of the communication, Mr. Epstein had a
specific intent to persuade another to engage in prostitution or “sexual activity,” as defined by
Florida law, he cannot be guilty of an offense under § 2422(b).

As important, the plain language of the phrase “for which any person can be charged”
necessarily excludes acts as to which the state’s statute of limitations has run. Under Florida
law, prostitution and prostitution-related offenses are misdemeanors in the second degree for a
first violation.” See Fla. Stat.. § 796. 07(4)(a). The limitations period for a misdemeanor in the
second degree is one year, and there is no tolling provision based upon the victim’s age. See Fla.
Stat. § 775.15(b). Even as to allegations of third degree felonies, the statute of limitations is
three years. Thus, any conduct alleged to have occurred before mid-June 2005 cannot be
charged as a matter of state law and thus cannot be a predicate for a § 2422(b) offense—even if
the federal statute of limitations has not run on any given § 2422(b) offense because of the
lengthier statute codified in 18 U.S.C. § 3282. Thus, no prosecution under § 2422(b) can be
brought based upon inducement of prostitution or sexual activity for which Florida’s statute of
limitation has run. Furthermore, in Florida, the statute of limitations does not simply give rise to
an affirmative defense. On the contrary, statute of limitations “creates a substantive right which
prevents prosecution and conviction of an individual after the statute has run.” See State v. King,
282 So. 2d 162 (Fla. 1973); Tucker v. State, 417 So. 2d 1006 (Fla. 3d D.C.A. 1982) (citing
cases).

Given the one-year statute of limitations, any conduct that might amount to prostitution
or other chargeable sexual activity that occurred before one year from today is not conduct for
which any person can be charged with a criminal offense. Also, given the three year statute of
limitations for third degree felonies, any allegations of illegal state criminal conduct that is
classified as a third degree felony cannot be charged in the state and, concomitantly, cannot be
the basis for a federal charge under § 2422(b), to the extent that it occurred—as did almost all of
the pivotal allegations (e.g., the [MM allegation which was made in March of 2005)
prior to mid-June of 2005.

Ze 18 U.S.C. § 1591

2 The offense is a felony of the third degree only for a third or subsequent violation. Fla. Stat. § 796.07(4)( c).

Neil Gershenfeld

Neil Gershenfeld is a physicist and director of MIT’s Center for Bits and Atoms. He is
the author of FAB, co-author (with Alan Gershenfeld & Joel Cutcher-Gershenfeld) of
Designing Reality, and founder of the global fab lab network.

Discussions about artificial intelligence have been oddly ahistorical. They could better
be described as manic-depressive; depending on how you count, we’re now in the fifth
boom-bust cycle. Those swings mask the continuity in the underlying progress and the
implications for where it’s headed.

The cycles have come in roughly decade-long waves. First there were
mainframes, which by their very existence were going to automate away work. That ran
into the reality that it was hard to write programs to do tasks that were simple for people
to do. Then came expert systems, which were going to codify and then replace the
knowledge of experts. These ran into difficulty in assembling that knowledge and
reasoning about cases not already covered. Perceptrons sought to get around these
problems by modeling how the brain learns, but they were unable to do much of
anything. Multilayer perceptrons could handle test problems that had tripped up those
simpler networks, but their demonstrations did poorly on unstructured, real-world
problems. We’re now in the deep-learning era, which is delivering on many of the early
AI promises but 1n a way that’s considered hard to understand, with consequences
ranging from intellectual to existential threats.

Each of these stages was heralded as a revolutionary advance over the limitations
of its predecessors, yet all effectively do the same thing: They make inferences from
observations. How these approaches relate can be understood by how they scale—that is,
how their performance depends on the difficulty of the problem they’re addressing. Both
a light switch and a self-driving car must determine their operator’s intentions, but the
former has just two options to choose from, whereas the latter has many more. The AI-
boom phases have started with promising examples in limited domains; the bust phases
came with the failure of those demonstrations to handle the complexity of less-structured,
practical problems.

Less apparent is the steady progress we’ve made in mastering scaling. This
progress rests on the technological distinction between linear and exponential functions—
a distinction that was becoming evident at the dawn of AI but with implications for AI
that weren’t appreciated until many years later.

In one of the founding documents of the study of intelligent machines, 7he
Human Use of Human Beings, Norbert Wiener does a remarkable job of identifying many
of the most significant trends to arise since he wrote it, along with noting the people
responsible for them and then consistently failing to recognize why these people’s work
proved to be so important. Wiener is credited with creating the field of cybernetics; ve
never understood what that is, but what’s missing from the book is at the heart of how AI
has progressed. This history matters because of the echoes of it that persist to this day.

Claude Shannon makes a cameo appearance in the book, in the context of his
thoughts about the prospects for a chess-playing computer. Shannon was doing

concluded that a central tenet of its foreign policy, conceived with the
best intentions, simply isn’t working. Hard though it’s been for this
proud and mighty nation to admit failure, trading a losing strategy for
a fresh course has brought such triumphs as the Nixon-Kissinger pacts
with China that isolated the Soviet Union and helped to end the Cold
War.

Today, America faces just such a reckoning in the Middle East. Our
objective is clear: halting the spread of terrorism that’s headed for our
shores, threatening mass murder in our suburban shopping malls, city
tunnels, and crowded parks. With the Middle East in chaos—as though
a raging desert sirocco is destroying all sense of order——the US should
make a radical, historic shift in its outreach towards the Arab world.

Given the reluctance of America and its Western allies to launch a
military offensive, it’s impossible to know when peace will be restored.
But right now, while the battles rage, the US can take decisive
diplomatic steps to stem the poverty and despair that makes the
Middle East a breeding ground for radical Islamic terrorism. America
should forge alliances with a new generation of Arab leaders whose
principal goal is improving the daily lives of their people. Providing
jobs and raising hope among the region’s impoverished youth is the
best protection for the world’s wealthy nations, from America, to
Europe, to the Arabian Peninsula.

Once peace is restored, the US should take the lead in establishing a
21st century “Marshall Plan” of economic aid to durably lift living
standards in the Middle East’s poorest areas.

So what went wrong? For decades, the U.S. has pursued a misguided
policy I'll call “embrace and abandon.” It started with the “embrace:”
recruiting and financing leaders who were blatantly autocratic, yet at
the time qualified as America’s allies. Then, the U.S. invariably
exhorted these strongmen to champion revolutionary democratic

officials of the Philippines who had enough power to condemn me if they
had felt like it. I caught my plane in the knick of time and once I was
settled in my seat my thoughts went back to my dear Robbie and how
much I was missing him. J was just relieved that I was on my way to be
back with him again soon.

Looking out the window I could see the red earth beneath me. As 1
landed for the last time I took notice of the first steps I walked off the
plane and onto a new soil for the first time. 1 had so much to be looking
forward too in my new homeland. In my heart I knew this was all | ever
wanted, this was going to be my haven. There was another surprise in
store for me when two elder strangers walked up to me and asked my
name. “Are you Jenna?” Nodding at their question they gave me their
first names and wrapped their arms around my neck. My new mother-in
law then said, “ We are Robbie’s parents. We wanted to be the first ones
who. welcomed you to Australia and into our family” It was my in-laws
meeting me for the first time. Handing me some balloons and flowers
they even had gifts for their new daughter-in law. While waiting for
Robbie’s plane to arrive we all chatted about many things like the flight
over from Thailand and the scare at the previous airport in the
Philippines. I asked them how they knew whom to look for? My father in
law laughed, saying recognizing me was easy from Robbie’s detailed
description. He told them to look out fora petite, young blonde carrying
an abundance of luggage. Laughing together over a few more brief
conversations of getting to know each other better they seemed relieved
to finally meet me compared how stressed she sounded in the
conversations | overheard Robbie having with her while in Thailand.

Watching the arrivals board I knew Robbie’s plane had landed ages ago
but was just waiting for him to get out of customs. It didn’t bother me
anyhow, I was enjoying get accompanied with his parents for the first
time. Eventually | saw my husband walking down the runway behind the
gates, I just couldn’t wait a second longer. I ducked underneath the gates
and ran all the way up the runway to jump excitedly into his arms. |
wrapped my arms and legs around him holding onto him for dear life. I
just missed him so much I knew I would never let him go, theoretically
speaking that is, and I never have nearly a decade later.

Chapter 24

Over the near decade we spent together, Robbie and I have shared the
common highs and lows that every determined marriage endures. It has

135

taken a lot of hard work and doesn’t come without its flaws but no matter
what it is just perfect for the two of us. He helped me how to remember to
smile again and life has slowly began to sort itself out. They say that time
heals all wounds but what I had experienced in my young years wasn’t
nearly long enough to let all of the hurt go. Seeking help through many
counselors and psychiatrists I was doing everything I could do to deal _
with the scars and all of the pain left behind. Completely off of any
pharmaceuticals, since the last day of our honeymoon, and healing my
heart with love instead of hate our marriage is my foundation and Robbie
is my solid rock. We have to be for one another, putting the bonds of our
union through the wringers and back, as neither of us expected my past
life eventually to come back and haunt me after so long.

Our blissful life came to a sudden halt one day when we were out
visiting my in-laws at their nearby house on just another plain afternoon.
There was a knock on the front door and my father in law got up from
watching TV on the couch to answer it. He rushed back quickly coming
into the dining room, where [ was feeding my nineteen months and five
month old boys at the table, and he blurted out, “Jenna there are three
police officer’s at the door asking for you by the name of Virginia
Roberts!” I asked my mother in law to stay with the babies to find out
what this was all about. I didn’t even think it had anything to do with
Jeffrey at first and wasn’t even worried when I opened the door to offer
them to come inside to talk.

They weren’t actually police officers and two federal agents of
Australia with one F.B.J agent from America. The American agent asked
if I wouldn’t mind actually coming outside so that I may speak with them
in private. “Okay” I said, as well as mentally preparing myself for
something big from the look of it, it’s not over a parking ticket or
anything small that you get three federal agents knocking at your in-laws
front door asking to speak in private. “Can we first ask you if you are in
fact Ms. Virginia Roberts and originally from Palm Beach County in the
United States?” I confirmed my name and previous state of residence
then they even asked, “May we see some identification please?” A
different agent asked the question this time and I told him “‘T will have to
go and grab it, my purse is inside. I'll just be one second.”

Robbie was standing on the other side of the door trying to figure out
what they were doing here talking to me and when I rushed through it to
grab my purse and saw him standing there looking puzzled, | told him |
had no idea what this was about yet, but not too worry everything was
going too be just fine. Taking a deep breath and slowly exhaling
outwards, I opened the door to find out exactly what the agents wanted to
talk about.

worth noting that the conflict remained conventional. Iran was different. Only the
most naive observer would exclude the possibility that if the Iranians did get a
nuclear weapon, they might use it. And even if they didn’t, the entire strategic
picture would change, with the need to find a response not just to a nuclear Iran,
but potentially a nuclear Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.

I was not about to lecture President Obama on this. While Bibi liked to portray
him variously as weak, naive or tone-deaf to interests and security of Israel, I knew
from our previous meetings that he was none of these things. Yet I did, ina
deliberately non-didactic way, raise the issue of our different perspectives on the
Iranians’ getting nuclear arms. “You see it in the context of the whole world,” I
told the President. “If Iran, in spite of all our efforts, gets a nuclear weapon, yes, it
will be bad. But for you, it’s just one more nuclear state. It won’t dramatically
change the situation for America. For us, it can turn into a real, existential threat.”

He agreed that we inevitably looked at the situation differently. But after
pausing a few seconds, he said: “Ehud, think of it this way. You get to school in
the morning and there’s this big, nasty bully. You can take him on, maybe give
him a black eye. But you have this bigger, stronger friend, who can knock him out
cold. The only problem is that your friend won’t be there until the afternoon.”

I would have liked nothing more than to wait for our “bigger, stronger” friend,
especially since I knew through my contacts in the American military and
intelligence establishment how much bigger and stronger an American attack
would be. During the first couple of years that Israel was working on acquiring the
capability for a military strike, the Americans had been no more ready than we
were. They did have the tanker aircraft and the heavy bombs. But their plan —a
kind of Iraq-style shock and awe — was so obviously prone to lead to a wider
conflict that it would never have received the go-ahead from President Obama, or
probably any president. I used to joke with colleagues in the Pentagon that while
Israel’s idea of a “surgical operation” was the equivalent of a scalpel, they seemed
to favor a chisel and a ten-pound hammer. By the time I met the President in 2012,
that had changed. Under Gates and then Panetta, an intensive research-and-
development effort and enormously improved planning and training had yielded
results. The Americans now had high-precision heavy munitions we couldn’t
dream of, and stealth air-attack capabilities we also lacked. They had an
operational plan which, within a period of hours, could push the Iranian nuclear

opportunity that lingers in front of us now.

This book is not, in any event, written for them. It is written for those of us who are
inheriting the possibility of their inventions, the price of their errors. And it is aimed
too at the people and the generation who are coming to power and who are - in
some senses—already in power, even if they don’t appear to be just yet. By this |
mean the cohort bred into the age of connected acceleration; the first generation of
leaders and students and warfighters and entrepreneurs to not find the digital
strange, but to find it natural and curious and wonderful in its power. It is written
for those who will have to manage machines that are smarter than humans,
networks that move faster than we can calculate, and cascades of chaos and conflict
and creation as this new era settles in. It is for anyone too who has ever begun to
speak about the strange tensions of our age, who has begun maybe with the lines,
“Maybe I’m sensitive or something, but...” as they feel the tickle of their own lives,
minds and cells increasingly intertwined, electrified. It is written for those afflicted
with an aching feeling that we're being torn apart. Pulled into foolish conflicts and
dangerous failures by old figures who don’t understand this age. Pulled into
sacrifices of liberty and freedom by young technological wizards who can’t balance
the miracle of their cold inventions with our hot, human needs for freedom and
control.

But I should say too that this book is not, either, a full-throated endorsement of the
technological elite. Yes, it’s wonderful that we are at the beginning of a new period.
But it’s not quite right to say that where the network age begins, the old one ends. In
fact, that's a dangerous conclusion. To begin with we're at an extremely primitive
point in our understanding of networks, comparable to where economics was in the
1800s or medicine centuries ago. We have a small, modest collection of tools to
analyze and think about and consider the complex physics of a networked world.
We barely understand the operation and evolution of many single networks today -
and really only sort of grasp one or two types of design with any real depth. But
networks of networks? Instant networks? Artificially intelligent ones? We have
basically no laws or experience with these yet.

The headlong rush ahead into a world of constant connection will, of course, be
balanced, resisted, braced against, undermined, fought and manipulated. Networks
touch everything, remember? The idea that such elemental control - of you, of me,
of our finances or our nations - would move with anything less than a few
explosions is naive. Revolutions don’t occur quietly. Consequently, the very thing
that makes many of the greatest tech minds of our age magnificent - a sense of
unstoppable determinism, a disregard for history, a slavish and instinctive urge to
follow what we’ll come to know as a Seventh Sense - is a bit of a disadvantage at
times. | know many of these men and women; their iron certainty is only a bit more
dazzling than the success they have had in building something from nothing ina

raping Blacks, but many Blacks had been executed for raping, or even assaulting, white women. I
recount this story in greater detail in the chapter on the death penalty. For now, suffice it to say
that he knew that the key Justice would be William Brennan, since if liberal Brennan would not go
along with him he had no chance of beginning any meaningful dialogue. Since I had done all the
research, he assigned me the delicate task of trying to get Justice Brennan to join our opinion. It
was a daunting task for a 24-year-old law clerk to persuade a Justice of anything, but I went in to
see Justice Brennan and he listened to me politely without committing himself. Eventually he did
join Justice Goldberg’s dissenting opinion and the dialogue was begun. Within less than a decade,
it resulted in the judicial abolition of capital punishment, but soon thereafter in its resurrection of
the “game” of two steps forward, one step backward is still ongoing.

My conversation with Justice Brennan marked the beginning of what developed into a lifelong
friendship and mutual admiration society. One of my great treasures is a handwritten letter from
the justice in 1982 that includes the following:

“There are winds swirling these days that too few resist---it’s a comfort to know that
outside there are steadfast champions who are putting up a gilliant fight. You are first
among them and that’s a matter of special pride for those of us who have followed your
career with increasing satisfaction.” [check quote]

As I write these words, the death penalty is now deemed constitutionally permissible, at least for

certain crimes, though I am convinced that Justice Goldberg’s “pet project” marked the beginning
of what will be its ultimate demise in the United States.

Justice Goldberg’s “pet project” and the way he sought try to implement it, tells us much about
the man and his relationship to his law clerks, but it doesn’t tell us everything. He regarded his
“one year clerks” as “law clerks for life.” After I completed my clerkship, Justice Goldberg
continued to give me assignments, ranging from helping him pick future clerks and assistants, to
editing his speeches and articles, to helping him draft resolutions at the United Nations (most
notably Security Council Resolution 242, following Israel’s victory in the Six Day War of 1967),
to assisting in his campaign for Governor of New York. He called me for help, advice and just to
“schmooze” about the state of the world until his death at the age of 81.

Even while he served on the Supreme Court he took an interest in his law clerks and their
intellectual development. He included us in his weekly Friday afternoon lunches or teas with
noteworthy people. When such people came to visit the justice, he always introduced us and
encouraged us to sit on part of the discussion. Knowing that I was interested in Israel, he invited
me to meet the Israeli Ambassador to the United States, Avraham Harmon as well as visiting
Israeli public officials. When I went to Israel in 1970 he asked me to smuggle a carton of Lucky
Strike cigarettes to Israel’s Prime Minister Golda Meir, who he had known from their earliest
Zionist days together in the Midwest.

Since Justice Goldberg had very few clerks—he served only three terms—he was able to remain

close to all of us. He invited us to his famous Passover Seders, where he and his wife Dorothy
sang labor and Zionist songs from their youth. When he moved to New York, he attended High

read those statements as making specific factual claims that Giuffre was lying about specific
facts.

14. Maxwell specifically directed her false statements at Giuffre’s true public
description of factual events, and many persons who read Maxwell’s statements reasonably
understood that those statements referred directly to Giuffre’s account of her life as a young
teenager with Maxwell and Epstein.

15. | Maxwell intended her false statements to be widely published and disseminated
on television, through newspapers, by word of mouth and on the internet. As intended by
Maxwell, her statements were published and disseminated around the world.

16. Maxwell coordinated her false statements with other media efforts made by
Epstein and other powerful persons acting as Epstein’s representatives and surrogates. Maxwell
made and coordinated her statements in the Southern District of New York and elsewhere with
the specific intent to amplify the defamatory effect those statements would have on Giuffre’s
reputation and credibility.

17. | Maxwell made her false statements both directly and through agents who, with
her general and specific authorization, adopted, distributed, and published the false statements on
Maxwell’s behalf. In addition, Maxwell and her authorized agents made false statements in
reckless disregard of their truth or falsity and with malicious intent to destroy Giuffre’s
reputation and credibility; to prevent her from further disseminating her life story; and to cause
persons hearing or reading Giuffre’s descriptions of truthful facts to disbelieve her entirely.
Maxwell made her false statements wantonly and with the specific intent to maliciously damage

Giuffre’s good name and reputation in a way that would destroy her efforts to administer her

Jay,

You have renewed your request for certain information which this Office does
not generally make available in similar pre-indictment situations. After
carefully considering your request, I have decided, in my capacity as the
First Assistant U.S. Attorney, not to make an exception here.

Regarding the Landon Thomas matter, Mr. Thomas was given, pursuant to his
request, non-case specific information concerning specific federal statutes.

Regarding the offer to extend the current deadline of March 3, 2008 contained
in my February 25th email. That offer was based on counsel for Mr. Epstein
meeting with CEOS the week of March 3rd. You indicate that you are
unavailable. It is hard to imagine that some or all of the other attorneys
representing Mr. Epstein cannot serve this function. After all, Mr. Epstein is
also represented by Dean Kenneth Starr, Martin Weinberg, Roy Black, Gerald
Lefcourt, Harvard Professor Alan Dershowitz, Lily Ann Sanchez, and Guy Lewis.

That being said, the Southern District of Florida will only renew the offer to
extend the current deadline if you and the CEOS Section Chief mutually agree
on a timetable by close of business on Friday, February 29, 2008 to meet and
complete presentations no later than March 19, 2008. Given that CEOS is ready
to proceed immediately, this seems like more than ample time. As I indicated
in my previous email, if CEOS subsequently decides that a federal prosecution
should not be undertaken against Mr. Epstein, this Office will close its
investigation. However, should CEOS disagree with Mr. Epstein’s position, Mr.
Epstein shall have one week to abide by the terms and conditions of the
September 24, 2007 Agreement as amended by letter from United States Attorney
Acosta.

Summers withdraws from Fed race 
Lawrence Summers has taken himself out of the running to be the next chair of 
the Federal Reserve, withdrawing his name after opposition from key Democratic 
senators indicated they would oppose his nomination. 
Mr Summers, a former Treasury Secretary and senior economic adviser to 
Barack Obama in his first term, galvanised opposition among left-of-centre 
Democrats who painted him as symbol of the wrongs of financial deregulation.

has always been a core concern of radical Libertarians. In his 1956
book, The Torment of Secrecy: The Background and Consequences of
American Security Policies, the sociologist Edward Shils brilliantly
dissects the fascination with secrecy among individuals who fear that
government agencies will use covert machinations against them. In
Shils’s concept, this counterculture is “tormented” by the govern-
ment’s possession of knowledge unavailable to them. Members of
this culture tend to believe that the agencies that hold these secrets,
such as the FBI, the CIA, and the NSA, can control their lives; they
also believe that obtaining such secrets will give individuals power
over government.

Snowden himself was concerned with a coming “dark future,”
which he later described as follows: “[The elites] know everything
about us and we know nothing about them—because they are secret,
they are privileged, and they are a separate class . .. the elite class,
the political class, the resource class—we don’t know where they
live, we don’t know what they do, we don’t know who their friends
are, They have the ability to know all that about us. This is the direc-

© tion of the future but I think there are changing possibilities in this.” ©

To change the “dark future,” someone would have to know the
secrets of the “elites.” Snowden saw himself as one of the few indi-
viduals in a position to seize state secrets from those elites. He had
a SCI (sensitive compartmented information) clearance, a pass into
an NSA regional base, and the privileges of a system administrator.
This position allowed him to steal state secrets and whatever power
that went with them. And if he moved to a position that gave him
greater access, he would, in this view, amass even greater power.

Whatever his actual agenda in 2012, we know that he tested pos-
sible reactions to a leak exposing NSA surveillance in the United
States. He asked fellow workers at the NSA base in 2012, according
to his own account, “What do you think the public would do if this
[secret data] was on the front page?” He asked this question at a time
when a large number of State Department and U.S. Army classified
documents had been posted on Julian Assange’s WikiLeaks website.
These WikiLeaks revelations made, as Snowden knew they would,
front-page headlines. His “question” was only rhetorical. No covert
NSA document had ever been published in the press as of 2012. One

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013578.txt,"information required to gain knowledge of an event is dependent upon the
probability of its occurrence. log2(0.5) = 1 is the maximal entropy when modeling the
equilibrium entropy of an independent random 0,1, (heads or tails) series of
informational states as might result from flipping a fair coin a large number of times.
This value would be maximal when the coin was fair, p(heads, tails) = 0.5, and the
entropy would be 2(number of allowed states)x0.5(probability of occupying each
state)x/ogio (0.5) = 0.693147...or in bits, log2(0.5) = 1.

More generally, if system’s behavior is distributed equally among its possible
states, the Shannon entropy is maximal and equal to the logarithm of the number of
defined states, for example, log2 (2) = 1. Shannon’s classical equation about
information content says the amount of information, / = -p /og2 p, measured in bits.
The minus sign in this reciprocal relation indicates that the information content of
data, /, goes up as the probability of occurrence of the observed data, p, goes
down. Since soon we will be talking about brains and their various styles of
information encoded content as well as its transmission, we note the other famous
Shannon theorem dealing with limits on the channel capacity, C, for information
transport is C = Wlog2(1+S/N) where W is bandwidth, the range of frequencies
available for information transport, S is the strength of the signal and WN is the
strength of the noise. Recall that the /og2(7) = 0 so only the signal-to-noise ratio,
S/N contributes to the value of the product of the multiplication by bandwidth, W.
Transparent clinical examples come from studies of the perceptual and cognitive
decline in normal geriatric patients in which the range of aural frequencies (W)
heard without augmentation decreases with age as does the frequency range (W)
observed in their resting brain waves. The inattentiveness of the obsessively
worried ruminator can be used as an example of brain channel capacity being
reduced by the amount of on going head noise, an increase N, which, of course,
reduces the value of S/N and therefore C.

Measures of the informational complexity of systems in motion, in contrast
with the information content of a static equilibrium state, are of dynamical entropy.
Dynamical entropy is often called H, in contrast with thermodynamic and/or

informational entropy, S. One can begin with a representational image of the

¢ Chinese censors sent out guidelines listing sub-
jects that should not be covered or not covered
in a negative way during parliamentary sessions
in 2016. Included on the list were the wealth
of parliamentary delegates, military budgets,
compliance with international human rights

conventions, air pollution, church demolitions,
and jokes about parliamentarians’ proposals.’®

¢ Censorship officials quashed coverage of the
“Panama Papers,” the trove of documents leaked
in 2016 that listed the offshore holdings of the
global elite, including the relatives of top Chi-
nese officials.”

e China added Time and the Economist to the list
of blocked media websites in 2016, apparently
in retaliation for articles that were critical of Xi
Jinping’s accumulation of power.”

¢ In February 2016 visits to China Central Tele-
vision (CCTV), the Xinhua news agency, and
the People’s Daily newspaper—the flagships of
the party and state media—Xi admonished the
assembled journalists to give absolute support
to the party leadership and later declared that
all media should “have the party as their family
name.”

While critical voices can still be found on the inter-
net, the authorities have been highly successful in
suppressing material that might lead to any broad
form of online protest or collective action. In addition
to intrusive laws and regulations, the regime deploys
armies of paid and volunteer commentators to flood
social media with progovernment remarks, influence
online discussions, report or attack those who make
antigovernment comments, or sow confusion about
particular incidents that might reflect poorly on the
leadership.?°

The overall goal of this strategy is to weaken the
internet's potential as a mobilizing force for critics or
reformers. Indeed, after years of intense pressure, the
medium is drawing closer to Xi Jinping’s ideal of an
internet that is “clear and bright.

Global reach
Both Russia and China have launched ambitious and
expensive projects to expand the reach of propaganda

and censorship beyond their borders. Russias project is
better known due to RT, a global television network that
is available to foreign audiences in a number of lan-

guages and through many cable packages. Russia has
also launched Sputnik, an international news service,
in multiple languages. These outlets tend to be more
effective than China’ at imitating the production styles
and intentionally contentious formats now employed
by many major outlets in democratic countries.

The degree to which RT and other arms of the Russian
global media apparatus actually influence the debate
about Russia is unclear. RT makes grandiose claims
of high viewership, but some analysts believe that its
audience in the United States and elsewhere is much
lower than asserted, and that its sizeable audience on
YouTube may be inflated by enticing video clips with
little political relevance.”

When it was launched in 2005, RT's programming
stressed the achievements of Russia and the strong
leadership of Vladimir Putin. Subsequently, the focus
changed to negative messages about the West,
especially the United States. Programs have chroni-
cled American poverty, inequality, political hypocrisy,
racial injustice, and other real or perceived flaws. The
network often promotes conspiracy theories about
everything from the destruction of New York's World
Trade Center in 2001 to America’s alleged role as pup-
pet master behind the Ukrainian protest movement of
2013-14.

Superficially, China's overseas propaganda efforts
seem less aggressive. While Beijing has greatly ex-
panded the capacity of CCTV's international broad-
casts and opened media offices around the globe,
the news content is less polemical and therefore less
interesting than that of RT.

But the CCP’s ultimate objectives may actually be far
more ambitious. Rather than engaging, like Russia, in
what amount to guerrilla-style attacks on mainstream
news and information abroad, the Chinese regime is
using its superior economic muscle to steadily gain
control over how China is depicted in news coverage
and popular culture in the rest of the world, and to
establish something of a consensus on the idea of a
“sovereign internet.”

Its various tactics include state pressure on foreign
correspondents tasked with informing the world
about developments in China: Those who are too criti-
cal or too aggressive in conducting investigations into
sensitive matters may find their visas revoked, their
outlet’s website blocked, and their employers placed
in asort of political purgatory.’

then in response to Hamas rocket fire into Israel. The moral: Arik was wrong to
withdraw. But the Islamists’ ascendancy was happening anyway. After all, it was
Hamas attacks that provided the spearhead of the intifada of terror launched in the
wake of Camp David. Arafat’s own influence was also inexorably on the wane by
the time he passed away, in Paris, at the end of 2004, to be succeeded by Abu
Mazen. I do not know of a single senior figure in Israel with any military
experience who believes that we would be more secure today if we still had
thousands of soldiers and settlers inside Gaza. Surprised though I was by Arik’s
decision to leave, I had no doubt that the fundamental security judgment he was
making — that a disengagement was in Israel’s own interest — was the right one. I
was encouraged, too, by his parallel announcement of a small, token withdrawal
from a few small West Bank settlements. My regret at the time was that he did not
go further toward the kind of major West Bank disengagement I’d been arguing
for, and that even in Gaza the pullout seemed insufficiently prepared or thought
out. The model, I believed, should have been our withdrawal from Lebanon —
involving detailed prior consultation with, and political support from, the UN and
key international allies. I also felt it was critically important to ensure that, while
we would obviously need offshore patrols to prevent arms and munitions from
getting in, we allowed and encouraged an environment in which the Gazan
economy could function and grow after we left. None of that happened. Though we
left Gaza, we effectively sealed off and blockaded one of the most densely
populated, economically strapped and politically febrile strips of land on the face
of the earth.

Still, I did see it as an important first step toward the kind of wider
disengagement that would prioritize Israel’s own security interests, and political
and social cohesiveness, until and unless conditions allowed a for a serious new
effort for a final peace deal. I was heartened when Shimon led Labor back into
Arik’s coalition at the start of 2005 to ensure he’d have the support necessary to go
through with the Gaza withdrawal. And while I did make a brief attempt to return
as party leader later in the year, when it was clear I wasn’t going to win, I threw
my support behind Shimon and against the other challenger, the longtime labor-
union leader Amir Peretz, who was running on a platform to take Labor out of
Sharon’s government.

But Peretz won the leadership election. He did leave the cabinet, forcing Arik to
call an early election for March 2006. And that, along with the most ambitious and

The choice of destination — one that 
Obama avoided in his first term —

policy issue just months after winning his 
second term. 
But the visit will highlight how much the  
region has changed since he last visited 
the Middle East in his first year in office, 
with the rise of Islamist governments and 
the widening repercussions of civil 
revolt. 
After Obama helped topple Moammar  
Gaddafi in Libya in 2011, many in the 
region wondered when he would emerge 
again to help shape the course of the 
tumultuous Arab Spring, which has 
replaced a pair of U.S.-allied 
dictatorships with elected Islamist 
governments. 
Within the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, 
much has changed since the direct peace 
talks Obama inaugurated in September  
2010 collapsed within weeks. Israel's 
recent battle with the armed Hamas 
movement in the Gaza Strip left many  
predicting a wider fight in the future, as 
divisions deepened within the Palestinian 
and Israeli electorates over whether talks 
or war would resolve the conflict. 
To make it a substantive trip that is 
more than a positive photo-op would 
require setting up a specific framework 
for an agreement and setting a tight 
deadline to achieve it, said Jeremy Ben-
Ami, the executive director of J Street, a 
nonprofit group that advocates the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029780 
creation of a Palestinian state alongside 
Israel. 
White House officials would not provide 
a date for Obama's trip, which he will 
squeeze into the tight schedule he is 
building around a busy domestic agenda 
that includes immigration, guns and the 
economy. 
But Israeli media reported that Obama is 
scheduled to arrive March 20 as part of a 
trip that will include a stop in Jordan, 
where the civil war in next-door Syria 
and its growing refugee crisis is 
presenting a major challenge to King 
Abdullah II, a U.S. ally. 
Obama began his first term by making a 
strong push for peace talks between Israel 
and the Palestinians, believing the 
conflict fueled radicalism in the region in 
general and toward the United States in 
particular, given its historical support for 
the Jewish state. 
In contrast to predecessor George W. 
Bush, Obama wanted to demonstrate to 
Arab governments that the United States 
would make demands of Israel in pursuit 
of a regional peace agreement. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu made little secret of his 
preference for Republican Mitt Romney  
in last year's U.S. presidential campaign. 
Netanyahu and Obama have at times 
disagreed bitterly over issues relating to 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029781 
the Palestinians, including Israel's 
continued settlement construction in the 
West Bank and East Jerusalem. 
Israel's military occupied those 
territories, along with Gaza, in the 1967 
Arab-Israeli war. Palestinians view them 
as the key territorial elements of their 
future state. 
In a June 2009 address in Cairo, a speech 
that asked for a new beginning with the 
Islamic world, Obama said: The United 
States does not accept the legitimacy of 
continued Israeli settlements. He also 
did not stop in Israel on that trip, instead 
visiting Saudi Arabia, Egypt and 
Germany, where he emphasized the  
horror of the Holocaust and the moral 
imperative of defending Israel. Romney, 
among others, made the omission a 
campaign issue. 
But on regional security issues, Obama 
and Netanyahu have deepened 
cooperation amid rising U.S. military aid 
to Israel. Obama has agreed with 
Netanyahu that Iran must not be allowed 
to use its uranium-enrichment program to 
develop a nuclear weapon, an issue that 
the two will discuss during Obama's 
visit. 
Netanyahu's Likud party emerged from 
elections last month as the largest bloc in 
Israel's parliament, meaning that he will 
serve another term as prime minister. But 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029782 
a surprisingly strong showing by a new 
centrist party is likely to put more 
pressure on him to pursue talks. 
It was a mistake for Obama not to go in 
the first term at a time when it could have 
affected Israeli public opinion of him, 
and now, it has hardened against him to a 
point that I don't believe it can, said 
Elliott Abrams, a senior fellow at the 
Council on Foreign Relations who served 
as a senior Middle East adviser to Bush. 
Obama's visit will coincide with growing 
concern in the region that the two-state 
solution favored by him is in peril, as 
Israeli settlement construction continues 
and as the Islamist Hamas gains clout 
within the once-secular Palestinian 
nationalist movement. Hamas emerged  
stronger politically from the recent clash 
with Israel and continues to reject the 
Jewish state's right to exist. 
Hamas and its secular rival Fatah are due 
to meet Saturday as part of a 
reconciliation process. If an agreement is 
reached and Hamas joins the Palestinian 
Authority, Obama will be faced with an 
awkward decision on whether to meet 
with a government that includes members 
of a U.S.-
designated terrorist movement. 
As he begins again in the region, Obama 
will be advised by new Secretary of State 
John F. Kerry. He has also named former 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029783 
senator Chuck Hagel as defense 
secretary, a nomination still in question 
after an unsteady performance by the 
candidate before the Senate Armed 
Services Committee last week that 
focused in part on his past criticism of 
Israel. 
This trip is a signal that the president 
has an interest, not just in the peace issue, 
but also in the broader concerns that 
Israel is facing, said Dennis Ross, a 
senior Middle East adviser to Obama 
during his first term who is at the 
Washington Institute for Near East  
Policy. In some ways, it will be the 
president traveling to Israel to ask for a 
new beginning.

Saeb Erekat - The Peace  
Processor  
An interview by Aaron David Miller 
February 5, 2013 -- Other than Mahmoud 
Abbas, Saeb Erekat could be the most 
recognizable Palestinian on the planet. 
The chief Palestinian negotiator is 
certainly among the most passionate in 
promoting the cause. And nobody on the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029784 
Palestinian side knows the substance of 
the issues or the negotiating history 
better. 
I first met Erekat in the late 1980s, while 
working on the Palestinian issue for then 
Secretary of State George Shultz. Back 
then, the U.S.-educated diplomat was 
already showing the brashness and 
outspokenness that would make him one 
of the most memorable -- if exasperating 
-- of the Palestinians with whom we 
dealt. 
He annoyed then Secretary of State 
James Baker by wearing his kaffiyeh 
around his shoulders at the opening of the 
Madrid Peace Conference in October 
1991. And over the years, he continued to 
annoy the Israelis too with his fiery 
performances on CNN -- though to this 
day, key Israeli negotiators, such as Isaac 
Molho, continue to praise his pragmatism 
at the bargaining table. 
It was Erekat's academic bent, analytical 
chops, and capacity to write in English 
that would make him so indispensable to 
the only Palestinian who really counted 
in those days -- Yasir Arafat. Erekat was 
a unique figure -- neither a fighter (no 
nom de guerre for him), nor a PLO 
insider, nor an organization man from 
Tunis. Rather, he was a West Banker 
from Jericho, and he succeeded in 
maintaining his relevance in a Palestinian 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029785 
political scene dominated not by fellow 
academics, but by hard men defined by 
struggle and intrigue. During the heady 
days of the peace process, he became a 
key point of contact for the Americans, 
the Israelis, the Arabs, and much of the 
rest of the international community. 
I came to know Erekat not only as a 
negotiator, but as a person. He sent his 
kids to Seeds of Peace, a conflict 
resolution and coexistence organization 
that I ran briefly after leaving the State 
Department, and my daughter befriended 
his and stayed with the Erekats in 
Jericho. Saeb and I have yelled at each 
other, defended our respective positions, 
laughed, and mourned opportunities that 
were never adequately explored. But 
through it all, what he said about himself 
was true: He wasn't as pro-Palestinian or 
pro-Israeli as much as he was pro-peace. 
That peace has proven elusive to this day. 
But with all our differences -- and there 
are many -- I believe Erekat believes in 
its possibility. Who else would list as an 
objective on his resume: Solve the 
Palestinian-Israeli conflict based on a two 
state negotiated solution through 
diplomatic offices? 
If, or perhaps when, another effort to 
negotiate a deal is made, one thing is 
clear -- Erekat will be in the middle of it. 
Last week, he agreed to answer my 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029786 
questions on the past and future of the 
Israeli-Palestinian problem. 
FP: What were your best and worst 
moments in the Israeli-Palestinian 
negotiations, and what was the greatest 
missed opportunity? 
Saeb Erekat: Though I was not the chief 
negotiator at that moment, the connection 
between [then Prime Minister Yitzhak] 
Rabin and President Arafat made 
everyone around them, including myself, 
feel that peace was possible. There was 
significant progress in all tracks until 
Rabin's assassination by an Israeli 
terrorist -- after he was killed, no Israeli 
leader had the vision to understand that 
the window of opportunity for a two-state 
solution would close as fast as they 
continued their colonization policies. 
The missed opportunity has definitely 
been Israel throwing away the Arab 
Peace Initiative, which offers 
normalization of relations of 57 countries 
with Israel in exchange for Israeli 
withdrawal to the 1967 border. They 
threw it away by bombing Gaza, by 
intensifying collective punishments, and 
by increasing settlement construction all 
over the occupied West Bank, 
particularly in and around Occupied East 
Jerusalem. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029787 
FP: 2013 is the 20th anniversary of the 
Oslo negotiations. What was Oslo's 
greatest success, and its greatest failure? 
SE: The fact that, two decades after Oslo, 
we are still a nation under occupation 
shows that Israeli governments did derail 
it. The interim accords were not supposed 
to last for 20 years but only five. After 
that, we were going to enjoy freedom and 
sovereignty. 
But Israel increased its settlement 
expansion. In fact, within 20 years, the 
number of settlers almost tripled. The 
institution-building efforts led by the 
Palestinian government have been 
completely undermined by the lack of 
freedom. This situation cannot continue. 
Oslo succeeded in bringing back 250,000 
Palestinians from the diaspora and 
building the capacity for our state. The 
international community failed though, 
by granting Israel an unprecedented 
culture of impunity that allowed them to 
use negotiations as a means to continue 
rather than stop colonization. 
FP: What is the most important 
thing Israelis don't understand about 
Palestinians? 
SE: That we are not going anywhere. As 
simple as that. We are not going to 
disappear just because their government 
builds an annexation wall around us. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029788 
They should close their eyes and imagine 
their state within 10 years time. What do 
they see? If they continue their policies, 
they are going to officially adopt the form 
of an apartheid regime, which I think is 
not what many Israelis want. 
FP: What is the most important thing 
Palestinians have learned about Israelis? 
SE: That Israelis will not take back the 
ships that brought them here to leave 
somewhere else. We got to understand 
that we have to live side by side. The 
rules of engagement, though, cannot be 
those of apartheid, but those of freedom. 
FP: What do you expect from the next 
Israeli government on the peace process? 
SE: I don't think there is room for 
optimism, but our position hasn't 
changed. We don't see any other solution 
than a two-state solution. Any Israeli 
government that recognizes this fact and 
respects what previous governments have 
agreed upon should become a partner for 
peace. 
FP: Is Hamas-Fatah unity possible, and 
what would the impact be on the future of 
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations? 
SE: We expect to have progress in the 
near future, with Hamas allowing the 
Central Elections Commission to register 
new voters in Gaza. I believe there is 
political agreement -- in fact, there is a 
signed agreement. We expect to have 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029789 
elections as soon as possible, which is the 
right way to solve our differences: Let 
our people decide, those in Palestine as 
well as our people in the Diaspora. 
Having said so, Hamas has recognized 
the Palestine Liberation Organization as 
the sole and legitimate representative of 
the Palestinian people, including its 
mandate to negotiate a final status 
agreement with Israel. Once that is 
achieved, we expect to hold a national 
referendum. 
FP: How would you describe Egypt's 
role in the peace process now? What do 
you expect from President Barack 
Obama's administration with regards to 
the peace process? 
SE: Egypt has played a central role, and 
continues to do so. We trust that Egypt, 
under President Mohamed Morsy's 
leadership, will continue to play a strong 
role because Palestine and Egypt have a 
common interest in achieving peace. 
President Obama had stated that he has a 
personal commitment to bring peace to 
the Middle East. We, the Egyptians, and 
the rest of the Arab world tell him that we 
are ready for peace. We have the Arab 
Peace Initiative. This goes in line with 
the stated U.S. national interest. 
Washington's failure to explicitly say that 
Israel is to blame for choosing 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029790 
settlements over peace has contributed to 
Israel's culture of impunity. 
FP: Can America be an effective broker 
in negotiations? 
SE: If the U.S. decides to be an honest 
broker, it could not only be effective but 
in fact could bring real peace to the 
region, a just and lasting one. The U.S. 
has a moral obligation toward the 
Palestinian people, who have been under 
occupation and living in exile for 
decades. 
FP: Is a two state solution still possible? 
SE: Yes, but only if there is a political 
will. So far, Israel's will is about 
colonization, and the international 
community has failed to put an end to 
decades of double standards by treating 
Israel as a state above the law. We don't 
see any other solution than a two-state 
solution, though Israel is taking us to a 
one-state reality.

The Mixed Legacy Of 
Shimon Peres  
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029791 
Daniel Gavron 
Feb 4, 2013 -- Now that he has finished 
his consultations with the country's 
political parties and charged Benjamin 
Netanyahu with forming a new coalition, 
Israel's respected President, Shimon 
Peres, is once again very much in the 
news. In his speech inviting Netanyahu to 
form the next government, the President 
spoke forcefully about peace and even 
seemed to influence Bibi to mention 
peace, a word he never used in his 
election campaign. Peres has rightly 
earned respect for this from many 
quarters, but now, as the coalition is 
being formed, it might be a good time to 
examine one aspect of Israel's political 
culture: the lack of respect for the task of 
a parliamentary opposition. Peres is at 
least partly to blame for this, as he almost 
always preferred to join various 
administrations—even as a junior 
partner—rather than lead the opposition, 
ofen citing our grave situation and 
national responsibility. Now is surely 
a better time to criticize Peres than in 
June, when the world (maybe even 
including President Barack Obama) will 
be coming here to celebrate his 90th 
birthday. Then, surely, everyone will be 
paying deserved tribute to the wisdom of 
this elder statesman and prophet of peace, 
and it would be a shame to spoil the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029792 
party. So let's clear the air right now, 
well before the festivities. Before we get 
to the matter of coalition politics, which 
is very much on our minds right now as 
Netanyahu struggles to put together a 
government, let us consider the other 
negative part of the Peres legacy: his stint 
as Defense Minister under Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin from 1974 to 1977. Today 
Peres is widely respected as the architect 
of the Oslo Accord of 1993, achieved 
while he was Foreign Minister. It was the 
first political move toward a settlement 
between Israel and the Palestinians, and 
Peres deserves huge credit for securing 
the agreement. However, two decades 
earlier, as Defense Minister, he supported 
the Jewish settlement project in the 
newly-conquered Palestinian territories, 
both overtly and covertly. Not for 
nothing did Rabin label Peres in his 
memoirs as an indefatigable intriguer. 
In 1975, while Rabin was doing his 
utmost to prevent the settlement of Elon 
Moreh, near Nablus, Peres continuously 
sabotaged his efforts. After no less than 
eight settlement attempts, which were 
ruled illegal by Israel's Supreme Court, a 
compromise was reached, and Elon 
Moreh was established five kilometers to 
the east of the original site. Moreover, 
during the furor over Elon Moreh, 
Defense Minister Peres quietly facilitated 
the creation of Ofra, near Ramallah. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029793 
These two settlements, which have 
become flagships of the settlement 
movement, were the start of Jewish 
colonization in Samaria, the northern part 
of the West Bank. The previous year, as 
a young reporter, I interviewed Peres, 
after he and his political ally Moshe 
Dayan had refused on principle to join 
the government of Golda Meir. If a 
single child can learn that politics is not 
just intrigues, Peres told me, I will be 
satisfied that we have done our bit. Just 
one week later, when he and Dayan had 
reversed their position for no discernable 
reason, and were seated snugly around 
the cabinet table, I asked Peres what he 
had to say to the single child. His aides 
sniggered, but Peres didn't bat an eyelid: 
Just what my mentor, David Ben-Gurion 
(Israel's first Prime Minister) told me: 
when the security of Israel is laid on one 
side of the scales, and everything else on 
the other side, security tips the 
balance. Peres subsequently used that 
self-same argument to join every 
government that would have him. The 
late Menachem Begin lost nine elections 
before finally becoming Israel's Prime 
Minister in 1977. He served as a 
pugnacious and dedicated leader of the 
opposition. Peres almost never headed 
the opposition, always preferring a 
ministerial appointment, once even 
designing a grotesque system of 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029794 
rotation with Yitzhak Shamir, so that 
he could be in the government. He 
proposed the ideal of national unity, 
and greatly devalued the democratic 
concept of parliamentary opposition. 
Former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni 
ruined her reputation when she refused to 
join Netanyahu in his last government. 
While it is quite true that Livni was an 
ineffective opposition leader, it is the 
very fact of her refusal to join the 
administration and influence it from 
within that has provoked most of the 
criticism by Israeli political 
commentators. Similar criticism is 
currently being leveled at Labor Party 
leader Shelly Yachimovich for stating 
clearly that she would not join 
Netanyahu's next government, but would 
serve as leader of the opposition. There 
are certainly many reasons to criticize 
Yachimovich, but not her eminently 
democratic decision to lead the 
parliamentary opposition. Very few of 
our political commentators have ever 
expressed respect or even understanding 
for the concept of opposition. The most 
popular political idea in Israel today is 
national unity—better still, a National 
Unity Government: We should all rally 
round the flag and support our 
government in these critical times. This 
position, widely espoused, echoes what 
Peres has said repeatedly over the years. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029795 
So, although the Peres vision of peace is 
a positive legacy, he has also taught us 
less helpful lessons. The settlements are a 
supremely negative inheritance, but I 
would argue that the anti-democratic 
rejection of the concept of a 
parliamentary opposition is an even more 
harmful bequest handed down to us by 
President Shimon Peres. 
Daniel Gavron, who lives in Israel, is a 
former journalist and the author of nine 
books, the most recent of which is Holy 
Land Mosaic, stories of cooperation and 
coexistence between Israelis and 
Palestinians (Rowman & Littlefield, 
2008).

India vs. China vs. Egypt 
Thomas L. Friedman  
February 5, 2013 -- New Delhi -- It's 
hard to escape a visit to India without 
someone asking you to compare it to 
China. This visit was no exception, but I 
think it's more revealing to widen the 
aperture and compare India, China and 
Egypt. India has a weak central 
government but a really strong civil 
society, bubbling with elections and 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029796 
associations at every level. China has a 
muscular central government but a weak 
civil society, yet one that is clearly 
straining to express itself more. Egypt, 
alas, has a weak government and a very 
weak civil society, one that was 
suppressed for 50 years, denied real 
elections and, therefore, is easy prey to 
have its revolution diverted by the one 
group that could organize, the Muslim 
Brotherhood, in the one free space, the 
mosque. But there is one thing all three 
have in common: gigantic youth bulges 
under the age of 30, increasingly 
connected by technology but very 
unevenly educated. 
My view: Of these three, the one that will 
thrive the most in the 21st century will be 
the one that is most successful at 
converting its youth bulge into a 
demographic dividend that keeps 
paying off every decade, as opposed to a 
demographic bomb that keeps going 
off every decade. That will be the society 
that provides more of its youth with the 
education, jobs and voice they seek to 
realize their full potential. 
This race is about who can enable and 
inspire more of its youth to help build 
broad societal prosperity, argues Dov 
Seidman, the author of How and 
C.E.O. of LRN, which has an operating 
center in India. And that's all about 
leaders, parents and teachers creating 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029797 
environments where young people can be 
on a quest, not just for a job, but for a 
career — for a better life that doesn't just 
surpass but far surpasses their parents. 
Countries that fail to do that will have a 
youth bulge that is not only unemployed, 
but unemployable, he argued. They will 
be disconnected in a connected world, 
despairing as they watch others build and 
realize their potential and curiosity. 
If your country has either a strong 
government or a strong civil society, it 
has the ability to rise to this challenge. If 
it has neither, it will have real problems, 
which is why Egypt is struggling. China 
leads in providing its youth bulge with 
education, infrastructure and jobs, but 
lags in unleashing freedom and curiosity. 
India is the most intriguing case — if it 
can get its governance and corruption 
under control. The quest for upward 
mobility here, especially among women 
and girls, is palpable. I took part in the 
graduation ceremony for The Energy and 
Resources Institute last week. Of 12 
awards for the top students, 11 went to 
women. 
India today has 560 million young 
people under the age of 25 and 225 
million between the ages of 10 and 19, 
explained Shashi Tharoor, India's 
minister of state for human resource 
development. So for the next 40 years 
we should have a youthful working-age 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029798 
population at a time when China and the 
broad industrialized world is aging. 
According to Tharoor, the average age in 
China today is around 38, whereas in 
India it's around 28. In 20 years, that gap 
will be much larger. So this could be a 
huge demographic dividend — provided 
that we can educate our youth — offering 
vocational training to some and 
university to others to equip them to take 
advantage of what the 21st-century global 
economy offers, said Tharoor. If we get 
it right, India becomes the workhorse of 
the world. If we get it wrong, there is 
nothing worse than unemployable, 
frustrated youth. 
Indeed, some of India's disaffected youth 
are turning to Maoism in rural areas. We 
have Maoists among our tribal 
populations, who have not benefited from 
the opportunities of modern India, 
Tharoor said. There have been violent 
Maoist incidents in 165 of India's 625 
districts in recent years, as Maoists tap 
into all those left out of the Indian 
dream. So there is now a huge push here 
to lure poor kids into school. India runs 
the world's biggest midday lunch 
program, serving 250 million free school 
lunches each day. It's also doubled its 
number of Indian Institutes of 
Technology, from eight to 16, and is 
planning 14 new universities for 
innovation and research. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029799 
But this will all be for naught without 
better governance, argues Gurcharan Das, 
the former C.E.O. of Procter & Gamble 
India, whose latest book is India Grows 
at Night: A Liberal Case for a Strong 
State. The aspirational India has no one 
to vote for, because no one is talking the 
language of public goods. Why should it 
take us 15 years to get justice in the 
courts or 12 years to build a road? The 
gap between [youth] aspirations and 
government performance is huge. My 
thesis is that India has risen despite the 
state. It is a story of public failure and 
private success. 
That is what Das means by India grows at 
night, when government sleeps. But 
India must learn to grow during the day, 
he said. If India fixes its governance 
before China fixes its politics that is who 
will win. ... You need a strong state and a 
strong society, so the society can hold the 
state accountable. India will only get a 
strong state when the best of society join 
the government, and China will only get 
a strong society when the best Mandarins 
go into the private sector.

Foreign Policy 
Don't be too sure there  
won't be another U.S.  
war in the Middle East 
Richard L. Russell 
February 5, 2013 -- Shortly before he left 
office in Feb. 2011, Defense Secretary 
Robert Gates told West Point cadets that 
in my opinion, any future defense 
secretary who advised the president to 
again send a big American land army into 
Asia or into the Middle East or Africa 
should 'have his head examined,' as 
General MacArthur so delicately put it. 
The remark no doubt reflected Sec. 
Gates's fatigue and frustration from the 
enormous intellectual and emotional 
burdens associated with overseeing the 
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
One suspects, however, that in a more 
reflective moment, Gates would have 
acknowledged that never say never is a 
wise rule of thumb in planning for 
military contingencies, especially in the 
region that makes up Central Command's 
area-of-responsibility. Few, for example, 
predicted the 1979 Soviet invasion of 
Afghanistan. Gates himself -- who was a 
senior CIA official during the covert war 
supporting the Afghan resistance -- surely 
did not anticipate then that the United 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029801 
States would have to return to 
Afghanistan two decades later to oust a 
Taliban regime that was harboring 
terrorists. Before 1990, moreover, no one 
predicted that Iraq, having just ended a 
bitter eight-year war with Iran, would 
swing its battered forces south to invade 
Kuwait. 
So if it's conventional wisdom that the 
United States will not, or should not, 
intervene militarily in the Middle East or 
South Asia after it draws down forces in 
Iraq and Afghanistan, it's also likely dead 
wrong. What is true, however, is that 
political and military trajectories in the 
Middle East and South Asia are likely to 
increasingly challenge U.S. contingency 
access in the coming decade. The ability 
for the United States to surge large-scale 
forces into the region, as it did in the 
1990 and 2003 wars against Iraq, will 
grow increasingly circumscribed. The 
United States will have to adapt to this 
new strategic landscape by developing 
more nimble, highly-mobile, stealthy, and 
networked forces, and by abandoning the 
traditional practice of slowly and steadily 
building up conventional forces at 
regional logistic hubs prior to launching 
war. 
* * * 
Perhaps the most significant factor that 
portends against further intervention in 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029802 
the Middle East and South Asia is 
increased political resistance -- and 
outright opposition -- from the countries 
in the region. That resistance is likely to 
come from the new regimes emerging 
from the Arab uprisings, as well as a 
number of Gulf monarchies. 
Indeed, the political trends in the region 
are unlikely to conform to the rosy 
predictions of democratic peace theorists, 
whose musings have implicitly informed 
the security policies of both Republican 
and Democratic administrations for 
decades. Old authoritarian regimes seem 
to be passing the way of the dodo bird, 
but the new regimes taking shape are 
heavily influenced by militant Islamic 
ideology that will make them less likely 
to engage in security or military 
cooperation with the United States. 
Democracy optimists argue that these 
ideological regimes, once entrenched in 
power, will have to moderate their zeal in 
order to govern. Pragmatism will 
ultimately trump ideology. That line of 
reasoning, however, is based on the 
assumption that the policy decisions of 
such regimes can be explained by rational 
choice economic theory. In other words, 
if they want to attract international capital 
and participate in the world economy, 
they are going to have to break with their 
ideological affinities. But that reasoning 
ignores a hard fact of international 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029803 
politics: that time and again, political and 
ideological prerogatives trump economic 
rationality. It made little economic sense, 
for example, for Pakistan to pursue a 
nuclear weapons program in the 1970s, 
just as it makes little economic sense for 
Iran to do so today. Clearly, both 
Pakistan and Iran made major policy 
decisions based on political-military 
priorities rather than economic 
calculations. 
As for the surviving monarchies in the 
Middle East, they too will likely be less 
accommodating to American military 
forces than they have been in the past. To 
be sure, much of the Arab support for 
past American military operations -- like 
both Iraq wars -- was hidden from the 
public eye. Arab states often loudly and 
publicly denounced unilateral 
American military action in the region at 
the same time as they supported it in 
backroom dealings, quietly authorizing 
facilities support and air, land, and sea 
access. 
But if Arab Gulf states were quietly 
supportive in the past, their opposition to 
American military force is likely to grow 
in the future. They read the aftermath of 
the Arab uprisings much differently than 
did American and European 
policymakers. The Gulf monarchies were 
shocked that the United States 
abandoned Egyptian President Hosni 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029804 
Mubarak in his time of need in early 
2011. Their leaders expected the United 
States to push for Mubarak and the 
Egyptian military to crack down on 
public protests in Cairo. After all, 
American policymakers during the Carter 
administration had at least given this 
policy option consideration during the 
Iranian revolution in 1979. 
Already, several Gulf states have begun 
to translate their displeasure into policy 
independence from Washington. In 2011, 
for example, a coalition of Gulf states led 
by Saudi Arabia intervened in Bahrain to 
quell domestic unrest in the island 
country. They did so under the banner of 
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), 
which for years had been a feckless 
military force. Largely unnoticed in 
Western commentary was that the GCC, 
for the first time in its history, mounted a 
relatively effective military intervention. 
Bahrain today is for all intents and 
purposes a province of Saudi Arabia, 
even if it is not polite to say so in 
diplomatic circles. Since the Iranian 
revolution, Bahrain -- like the United 
Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, and Qatar 
-- has pursued close ties with the United 
States, in significant measure to 
counterbalance Iran and Saudi Arabia. 
With Washington at their back, they were 
able to stake out security policies that 
were at least nominally independent from 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029805 
Saudi Arabia. When Saudi Arabia wanted 
American forces removed from the 
kingdom, for example, Qatar was eager 
to compensate by hosting a more robust 
American command presence in the 
region. 
The Arab uprisings and subsequent GCC 
intervention in Bahrain have turned the 
tables, making Saudi security backing a 
necessity for the smaller Gulf 
monarchies. From their perspective, 
American forces are clearly more capable 
than Saudi forces, but given the 
alignment of their interests, Riyadh is a 
more reliable security partner. Gulf 
leaders and military commanders in the 
coming decade will be focused on how to 
avoid following in Mubarak's footsteps. 
Part of minimizing that risk will involve 
decreasing security dependency on the 
United States. Gulf leaders have to worry 
that if push comes to shove, the 
Americans will throw them under a bus 
just like they did to Mubarak. 
* * * 
If the political dynamics in the Middle 
East and South Asia do not favor further 
American military intervention in the 
future, neither do the emerging military 
trends. The proliferation of supersonic 
cruise missiles and mines in the region 
will make for nasty forced entries into 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029806 
narrow maritime confines like the Suez 
Canal, the Red Sea, and the Persian Gulf 
But the likely proliferation of nuclear 
weapons -- and ballistic missile delivery 
systems -- will pose even more 
formidable challenges to conventional 
military surges in the region. In the 
future, the United States will not be able 
to take for granted unchallenged surges 
of naval, air, and ground forces into 
regional theaters via logistics hubs. These 
hubs -- like the American naval presence 
in Bahrain -- are large, readily 
identifiable, and will be increasingly 
vulnerable to future targeting by nuclear 
weaponry. 
Iran's nuclear weapons, assuming it gets 
them, will pose a direct threat to 
American military surge capabilities. 
Although American policymakers and 
military commanders might feel 
confident that they could surge forces 
into the Gulf despite Iranian nuclear 
threats because of the American nuclear 
deterrent, Gulf security partners might be 
more nervous and less willing to 
cooperate. As a result, they might not 
grant access to U.S. air, naval, and 
ground forces out of fear of angering 
Iran. 
American observers who doubt that Gulf 
states would make such calculations 
should recall how Kuwait responded in 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029807 
the lead-up to Iraq's invasion in 1990. 
When faced with a build-up of Iraqi 
forces along its border, Kuwait decided 
not to mobilize its military out of fear 
that the move would provoke Saddam 
Hussein. The incentives for Gulf states to 
make similar strategic calculations in the 
future will be greater when Iran has an 
inventory of nuclear weapons to match its 
growing ballistic missile capabilities. 
The Gulf states, moreover, will likely 
reason that the U.S. capability to threaten 
or use force against a nuclear Iran will be 
significantly diminished. Even without 
nuclear weapons, Gulf states have seen, 
in their view, a long history of American 
reluctance to threaten or use force against 
Iran. For example, the United States took 
no direct military action against Iran after 
it aided and abetted Hezbollah bombings 
against Americans in Lebanon in the 
1980s, after Iran supported the bombing 
of Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia in 
1996, or even after Iran supported the 
deadly campaign of improvised explosive 
devices (IEDs) against U.S. troops in 
Iraq. Gulf states will no doubt judge that 
if the United States was unable and 
unwilling to attack Tehran under these 
circumstances, then it is certainly not 
going to attack Iran in the future, when it 
will be able to retaliate with nuclear 
weapons. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029808 
American policymakers may counter that 
Iran would never be foolish enough to 
threaten or use nuclear weapons against 
the United States, given its robust nuclear 
deterrence posture. But the threat or use 
of nuclear weapons might not look so 
foolish from Iran's perspective. One of 
the great strategic lessons drawn from the 
long history of conflict in the Middle East 
is this: Do not go to war without nuclear 
weapons, as Saddam Hussein did when 
he invaded Kuwait. The corollary is: Do 
not allow the United States to 
methodically build-up forces in the Gulf 
prior to invading, as Saddam did both in 
the run-up to the 1991 re-conquest of 
Kuwait and in 2003, before the drive to 
topple the regime in Baghdad. 
Drawing upon these lessons, Iran will 
likely do everything in its power to deny 
the United States the ability to surge 
conventional forces into the region -- and 
that might include threatening to target 
U.S. forces with nuclear weapons. Iran 
might accept the risk that preemptive use 
of nuclear weapons could bring on 
American nuclear retaliation, because 
failure to do so would mean certain 
destruction for the regime. The United 
States would be able to build-up 
conventional forces in the region and oust 
Iran's leaders just as it did in Baghdad. 
This line of strategic reasoning runs 
counter to conventional wisdom in the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029809 
West, but we actually know little or 
nothing about what Iranian decision-
makers think about nuclear weapons or 
deterrence theory. Since the Iranian 
revolution in 1979, opportunities for the 
exchange of professional views between 
Western and Iranian scholars, 
policymakers, and military leaders on 
these critically important issues have 
been extremely limited. Therefore, it's not 
unreasonable to assume that the Iranians, 
like American policymakers in the early 
stages of developing their nuclear triad 
doctrine, will think of nuclear weapons as 
merely big artillery. Unfortunately, the 
United States and its security partners 
lack formal and informal exchanges with 
the Iranians akin to the Cold War 
discussions and arms control negotiations 
between the Americans and Soviets, 
which allowed both parties to develop 
mutual understandings of the other's 
perception of nuclear weapons. These 
understandings were essential for crisis 
management in the Cold War strategic 
relationship after the Cuban missile 
crisis. 
Meanwhile, the Gulf states, led by Saudi 
Arabia, are likely to look for their own 
nuclear deterrents. Much like France 
wanted its own nuclear force de frappe 
during the Cold War, the Gulf states will 
want their own nuclear weapons to deter 
Iran. Saudi Arabia and the smaller Gulf 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029810 
states will worry that the United States 
would be deterred from coming to their 
defense in future regional crises by Iran's 
nuclear weapons. 
Saudi Arabia and other Arab states are 
likely to see nuclear weapons as a quick 
fix for all of their security woes. 
Although they have been on a shopping 
spree in the past decade, buying 
expensive and sophisticated Western 
military technology, they have had a 
tough time absorbing the new technology 
and fully utilizing and integrating 
weapons systems. To be sure, in a rough  
net assessment, Saudi Arabia and its 
allies in the Gulf have significantly 
greater conventional capabilities than 
Iran. But if Iran goes nuclear, they will 
want to follow suit. 
* * * 
Americans may be weary of conflict in 
the Middle East and South Asia, but 
strategic prudence demands that we 
contemplate future military interventions 
in the Central Command theater. A scan 
of the horizon reveals that both political 
and military trends in the region pose 
formidable obstacles to conventional 
force surges into the region. 
But there is another wrinkle in this story 
that U.S. policymakers must contend with 
as they plan for the future. As Gulf 
monarchies seek to reduce their 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029811 
dependence on American military power, 
they will increasingly look to China for 
security assurances. China does not have 
a political agenda devoted to promoting 
democratization, and it maintains 
political and diplomatic ties with both 
Arab states and Iran. China's military 
activity in the region is modest but 
increasing, as evidenced by its recent 
peacekeeping dispatches to the region 
and naval port visits in the Gulf Beijing 
is likely to send more naval forces to the 
Gulf to increase its presence there and 
enhance its ability to protect the sea lanes 
which bring oil to China's thirsty 
economy. China is keenly aware that the 
United States has naval supremacy in the 
Gulf, but will be working to erode that 
strategic edge in the future. 
Faced with these realities, there is a need 
for new thinking and innovative 
conceptualizations of surges into 
Centcom's area of responsibility. Theater 
campaign planners will have to think 
about contingencies in which the United 
States cannot slowly and methodically 
build up forces in the region and then 
kick off campaigns after most troops, 
arms, and equipment are in place. Future 
U.S. force build-ups in the region will be 
far too vulnerable to preemptive nuclear 
strikes. As a result, planners will have to 
devise campaign plans in which the 
insertion of U.S. military forces begins 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029812 
with an immediate rolling and flowing 
start. The United States will have to work 
from smaller troop footprints and be 
prepared to start fighting even as follow-
on-forces are on the way. Ideally, these 
forces would flow from multiple staging 
positions to reduce vulnerability to 
nuclear attack. The politics of the region, 
however, will work against securing a 
multitude of staging areas from which to 
deploy. 
The region under the purview of 
Centcom has always been riddled with 
political violence that has posed 
formidable challenges to military 
operations. But in plotting a course over 
the horizon, the political and military 
obstacles for American military surges 
into the region are poised to grow even 
larger. As a result, theater contingency 
planners will have fewer good options for 
projecting American military power into 
the region -- and they'll have to do more 
with the bad and the ugly.

Article 6. 
The Diplomat 
Getting to the Endgame  
With Iran  
Robert Dreyfuss 
February 6, 2013 -- Why did it take so 
long to secure a date for talks between 
Iran and the P5+1? 
After all, in the weeks before the 
presidential election in November, it was 
reported that the United States and Iran 
had already tactically agreed to convene 
private, one-on-one talks. And since then 
the United States, the European powers, 
Russia, and China, all sought to arrange 
another round of negotiations, first in 
December and then in January. It now 
appears that Iran, which is about to enter 
its presidential election season, has 
finally agreed to what will be the first 
round of negotiations with the P5+1 since 
the last round in Moscow seven months 
ago. On Tuesday, Tehran announced that 
it will join talks on February 26 in 
Kazakhstan. 
The negotiations will be a serious test for 
the Obama administration and for John 
Kerry, the new secretary of state. 
Previous rounds have all faltered because 
neither side was willing to make 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029814 
concessions to the other, and so far there 
is little sign that the United States and the 
P5+1 have improved their offer to Iran 
very much. As the talks were announced, 
the Washington Post reported: The P5+1 
powers have made only mild revisions to 
a proposal that Iran flatly rejected last 
June. Until now, the United States has 
been unwilling to acknowledge Iran's 
right to enrich uranium on its own soil 
and to suggest that some economic 
sanctions might be lifted as part of a deal, 
and Iran has refused to agree even to a 
limited deal called stop, ship, and shut 
— involving the suspension of its 
enrichment to 20 percent purity, shipping 
its existing stockpiles of 20% uranium to 
a third country for processing, and 
shutting down its underground facility at 
Fordo, near Qom — without an agreement 
to lift sanctions. 
After the reelection of Barack Obama in 
November, there were great hopes that 
the president would have greater political 
freedom of offer concessions to Iran. Yet, 
publicly at least, the White House isn't 
signaling that it is ready to make a more 
generous offer to Iran, and in fact Obama 
in January signed into law yet another 
round of draconian economic sanctions. 
Perhaps as a result, Iran allegedly 
dragged its feet on setting a date for talks. 
Despite prodding from the P5+1 — 
including urgent efforts by Russia — in 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029815 
January Iran reportedly went silent about  
talks. Russia, increasingly frustrated by 
the inability of Tehran and the West to 
negotiate seriously, vented its frustration. 
Some of our partners in the six powers 
and the Iranian side cannot come to an 
agreement about where to meet, Russian 
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a  
news conference. We are ready to meet 
at any location as soon as possible. We 
believe the essence of our talks is far 
more important (than the site), and we 
hope that common sense will prevail and 
we will stop behaving like little 
children. 
According to analysts in Washington, 
reinforced by comments from Iran itself, 
a big reason for Tehran's recalcitrance is 
that Iran wants to prove to the United 
States that its vaunted sanctions regime 
will not force Iran to make unilateral 
concessions at the bargaining table. In 
addition, Iran is concerned that it won't 
get much in return in talks with the West, 
and that it will be asked to make 
unilateral concessions on uranium 
enrichment without getting sanctions 
relief in return. Combined with Iranian  
internal divisions, as its own presidential  
election season gets underway, that could 
mean that for the next six months or so 
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei simply won't be 
ready to talk seriously, despite scheduling 
the Kazakhstan round. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029816 
Others suspect that Iran is waiting to see 
how President Obama's new national 
security team — with Kerry as secretary of 
state, Chuck Hagel as secretary of 
defense, and John Brennan at the Central 
Intelligence Agency — will shape 
Obama's stance at any talks. 
In Washington, some would argue there's 
a growing consensus, at the level of think 
tanks, Iran experts, and other analysts, 
that a preliminary, first-round deal, 
including shop, ship, and shut, might 
work, if in response the P5+1 could lift 
some of the economic sanctions on Iran 
and agree to limited Iranian enrichment. 
Perhaps the best-case scenario is the 
possibility that there are ongoing, secret 
and back-channel talks between 
Washington and Tehran. Nothing along 
those lines has leaked and there is no 
indication of this, yet. But in advance of 
the first round of Iran-P5+1 talks in 
Vienna in 2009, the United States and 
Iran did indeed engage in quiet, behind-
the-scenes diplomacy. 
In fact, of course, any sanctions relief for 
Iran will occur slowly and step-by-step, 
not all at once, in parallel with steps 
taken by Iran and openness to more 
intrusive inspections and oversight by the 
IAEA. 
But it's certainly not helpful that in early 
January yet another round of unilateral 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029817 
sanctions was passed by Congress and 
signed into law by President Obama. The 
complex set of new measures targets key 
industrial sectors, including shipping and 
imports of products such as aluminum, 
steel and coal, and seeks to block Iran 
from using barter commodities such as 
oil and gold to pay for imports. The 
Washington Post paraphrased U.S. 
officials as saying that, the new policies 
are closer to a true trade embargo, 
designed to systematically attack and 
undercut Iran's major financial pillars 
and threaten the country with economic 
collapse. Obama signed the National 
Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that 
contained the sanctions provisions 
despite having hinted earlier that he 
might veto the NDAA over a host of 
measures contained in the bill. 
If the Obama administration believes that 
ever-tougher sanctions will cause Iran to 
cave in at the talks, it's likely that they 
are badly misreading Iranian politics. 
For many observers, however, and for 
Iran, too, the nomination of Hagel for 
secretary of defense may be a sign that 
the White House is beginning to realize 
that sanctions, and threats of military 
action, won't force Iran's hand. 
As has been widely reported, hawks, 
neoconservatives, and members of the 
pro-Israel lobby in Washington have 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029818 
slammed Hagel for his past comments 
and positions on Iran. In conjunction with 
Israel-friendly members of Congress, 
they've warned Obama to rein Hagel in 
so as not to send a dovish signal to 
Tehran. Robert Satloff, executive 
direction of the Washington Institute for 
Near East Policy (WINEP), a pro-Israel 
think tank, warned bluntly that the White 
House should act quickly to make sure 
that Hagel backs away from his previous 
views on Iran and at least toes the 
administration's tougher line. If the 
White House does not take steps soon to 
correct that impression, the chances for a 
negotiated resolution of the Iran nuclear 
crisis will fall nearly to zero and the 
likelihood of Israeli military action will 
rise dramatically, he wrote. 
Indeed, within days of his nomination as 
secretary of defense, Hagel was already 
backing away from his earlier views, 
meeting with senior Pentagon officials 
and influential senators who'll vote on 
his confirmation to clarify his views on 
Iran, asserting that he supports broad 
international sanctions against Iran and 
that he believes that the military option 
ought to be on the table. Several 
Democratic senators who met with Hagel 
announced with satisfaction that the 
former senator from Nebraska had 
sufficiently backtracked or clarified his 
views on Iran. Consequently, they 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029819 
announced that he had earned their 
support — and their vote. 
Then, during his confirmation hearings 
on January 31, Hagel — under hostile 
questioning from several Republican 
senators — backed away from earlier-held 
positions on Iran, including the role of 
sanctions. And, though he previously 
been a sharp critic of a military attack on 
Iran, in his opening statement Hagel said: 
I am fully committed to the President's 
goal of preventing Iran from obtaining a 
nuclear weapon, and—as I've said in the 
past—all options must be on the table to 
achieve that goal. My policy is one of 
prevention, and not one of containment—
and the President has made clear that is 
the policy of our government. As 
Secretary of Defense, I will make sure 
the Department is prepared for any 
contingency. 
Satloff's views were echoed by another 
tough-talking official at WINEP, former 
Ambassador Dennis Ross, a pro-Israel 
hawk who served as Obama's top adviser 
on Iran during much of the president's 
first term. I think 2013 is going to be 
decisive, Ross told the Los Angeles  
Times, expressing concern about Hagel's 
previous comments. Time really is 
running out. For diplomacy to have a 
chance of success, the Iranians need to 
understand that if diplomacy fails, force 
is going to be the result. We still have a 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029820 
challenge to convince the Iranians that 
we're quite serious about the use of 
force, he said. In the first term, the 
administration didn't always speak with 
one voice on this issue. So what Hagel 
says can make a difference. 
Despite his poorly receieved performance  
at his confirmation hearings, it's widely 
believed in Washington that Hagel will 
be confirmed as secretary of defense and 
that his private advice to Obama will 
more closely hew to his long-held beliefs 
about the futility of sanctions and the 
grave downside to a military strike. Partly 
for that reason, it remains very unlikely 
that the Obama administration will resort 
to force to resolve the dispute with Iran. 
In fact, in remarks that Iranian officials 
cited as promising, Vice President Joe 
Biden expressed the administration's 
willingness to hold bilateral talks with the 
Iranians. In response to a question at the 
Munich Security Conference Biden said, 
We have made it clear at the outset 
that...we would be prepared to meet 
bilaterally with the Iranian leadership 
when Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah 
Ali Khamenei is serious about 
negotiations. Iran's Foreign Minister, Ali 
Akbar Salehi responded favorably and 
said, I am optimistic, I feel this new 
administration is really seeking this time 
to at least divert from its previous 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029821 
traditional approach vis-a-vis my 
country. 
But if Washington remains committed to 
ever-tougher sanctions — and without 
promising Iran that sanctions will be 
lifted as part of a deal — then negotiations 
are unlikely to succeed. Vali Nasr, 
another former Obama administration 
official with expertise on Iran, suggested 
recently that there's not much more the 
world can do to sanction Iran, and that 
such penalties could drive Tehran to take 
radical action. The regime of sanctions 
against Iran over its nuclear activity 
really has reached its end, Nasr, dean of 
the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced 
International Studies at Johns Hopkins 
University, said during the World 
Economic Forum in Davos. And he 
warned that unless there is a diplomatic 
breakthrough — or, alternatively, an 
attack on Iran — you really are looking 
at a scenario where Iran is going to rush 
very quickly towards nuclear power, 
because they also think, like North 
Korea, that (then) you have much more 
leverage to get rid of these sanctions.

The Wall Street Journal 
A New U.S. International 
Economic Strategy  
Robert B. Zoellick 
February 5, 2013 -- Five years into the 
global economic storm, America's 
traditional allies, theEuropean Union and 
Japan, are struggling. Developing 
economies are reshaping the global 
dynamic but also face big challenges. The 
United States is the one country that 
could lead the modernization of the 
international system so as to supply 
security, economic opportunity, and 
prospects for liberty. America's own 
strategy for economic revival cannot be 
limited to the nation's borders. And its 
future foreign policy—its projection of 
power and principle—must be grounded 
in the emerging economic order. 
President Obama has said he admires 
Ronald Reagan's transformative thinking. 
If so, he should ask for an assessment of 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029823 
Reagan's second-term innovations on 
currency and monetary affairs, trade, debt 
and development. Reagan advanced a 
new international system to match the 
revival of capitalism after the oil shocks 
and stagflation of the 1970s. America's 
success in the 1980s contributed both to 
the end of the Cold War, by persuading 
the Soviet Union it could not keep up, 
and to two decades of exceptional global 
growth. 
The new U.S. international economic 
strategy should have five parts. First, this 
country should strengthen its continental 
base by building on the North American 
Free Trade Agreement with Canada and 
Mexico. Together, the three partners 
could boost energy security, improve 
productivity, and give North Americans 
an edge in manufacturing and other 
industries that are already experiencing 
rising wages in East Asia. A politically 
acceptable immigration policy, and a 
push for educational innovation using 
new technologies and competition, could 
lead to a more prosperous, populous, 
integrated and democratic future for the 
hemisphere. 
Second, the extraordinary monetary 
policies of late, led by the Federal 
Reserve's continued near-zero interest-
rate policy, are taking us into uncharted 
territory. Central banks have tried most 
every tool to stimulate growth; if Japan is 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029824 
any warning, the next tactic is 
competitive devaluation, which risks a 
new protectionism. Currency 
manipulation could become a danger 
that reaches far beyond the debate about 
Chinese policies. The world economy 
will need at some point to withdraw the 
drug of cheap money and negative real 
interest rates. The U.S. should anticipate 
these dangers. 
The International Monetary Fund also 
could help set standards about exchange-
rate policies and serve as a referee that 
blows a whistle, even if it cannot 
penalize. The IMF and the World Trade 
Organization should anticipate this risk 
and give effect to the existing WTO 
agreement that economies must avoid 
manipulating exchange rates . . . to gain 
an unfair competitive advantage. 
Third, the U.S. needs to break the logjam 
on opening markets. As the leading world 
economy, America should initially try to 
strengthen and increase international 
trade through the WTO. As my 
colleagues at the Peterson Institute have 
pointed out, there are gains from the 
stymied Doha Round of trade 
negotiations that should be harvested 
now: ending agricultural export 
subsidies; limiting food export controls; 
eliminating tariffs and quotas for almost 
all exports of the poorest countries; 
facilitating customs and clearance 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029825 
procedures; and improving the 
transparency and speed of the system for 
settling disputes. 
Next, the U.S. needs to keep the WTO 
current with a vastly changed world 
economy. The past WTO agreements are 
valuable for all 158 WTO members. But 
some economies want to go further by 
reducing barriers in important sectors 
such as the services trade, environmental 
goods and services, government 
procurement, and the digital economy. 
The services trade, for example, is vital 
for boosting innovation, productivity and 
jobs in developing and developed 
countries alike—but regulatory, 
licensing, zoning and other barriers to 
services are often equivalent to a 30% 
tariff or higher. Because liberalization in 
the WTO has been stuck, countries have 
turned increasingly to bilateral and 
multilateral free-trade agreements, some 
of which have addressed these newer 
topics. The U.S. should foster the WTO 
principle of world-wide liberalization by 
adopting standards in various industries 
and sectors that would be open to all 
economies that reciprocate. The WTO 
also needs new rules for fair trading by 
state-owned enterprises. 
Yet the U.S. also should use free-trade 
agreements to open markets. Trade 
competition advances structural reforms 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029826 
and growth without bigger government 
and more spending. The Obama 
administration has talked about trans-
Pacific and trans-Atlantic accords. Yet it 
has failed to close even one new free-
trade agreement. Ron Kirk, the 
president's trade representative, said in 
2009 that the administration did not have 
deal fever. In fact, it has been deal 
delinquent. 
Fourth, gender equality is not only fair 
and right—it is smart economics. No 
economy can reach its potential if it 
overlooks the talents of half its people. 
The U.S. should lead in identifying 
structural barriers in countries that hold 
back girls' and women's health, 
education, credit, jobs and 
entrepreneurship. 
Finally, the U.S. needs to match growth 
priorities of developing economies. 
President Obama should expand the 
global food-security initiative he 
announced in 2009 to boost agricultural 
productivity and production across the 
value chain, including through the private 
sector, in sub-Saharan Africa and other 
poor regions. Infrastructure investment 
could increase global demand today 
while building productivity for tomorrow. 
The U.S. can lead a push with middle-
income economies to develop public-
private infrastructure models that move 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029827 
from one-offs to a deal flow. The zero 
returns for savers from U.S. monetary 
policy can make infrastructure 
investments attractive. 
In addition to offering financing, the 
private sector can improve the design, 
operation and maintenance of 
infrastructure. As the state of Indiana has 
shown, the federal government could 
profitably use public-private partnerships 
for its infrastructure, too. 
The administration has talked about some 
of these topics. But it is oddly passive, as 
if it were hesitant to lead. State 
Department speeches are not enough. To 
carve out an international economic 
strategy, the new secretary of the 
Treasury needs to choreograph policies 
across all U.S. departments and with 
multilateral economic institutions. The 
U.S. had better wake up: International 
economic strategy is the new foreign 
policy. 
Mr. Zoellick has served as president of 
the World Bank Group, U.S. trade 
representative and deputy secretary of 
state. He is now a fellow at the Belfer 
Center at Harvard and the Peterson 
Institute for International Economics.

Warning: The Smart Money 
Is Fleeing U.S. Stocks 
BY BILL BONNER, CHAIRMAN, BONNER & PARTNERS 
DUBLIN — The Dow dropped 180 points yesterday — or 
about 1%. 
And another clever billionaire says he is looking elsewhere 
for profits. Reuters: 
Activist investor Carl Icahn on Monday said there was a chance the stock 
market could suffer a big decline, saying valuations are rich and earnings at 
many companies are fueled more by low borrowing costs than management's 
efforts to boost results. 
I am very cautious on equities today. This market could easily have a big 
drop, Icahn said. 
Yes, dear reader, the smart money is getting out of U.S. stocks. And here's our 
old friend Rob Marstrand explaining why: 
Right now, every measure that analyzes the S&P 500 says it's expensive. Prices 
are high relative to earnings, net assets, sales, and cash flow. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031136 
What's more, there's plenty of evidence that the main thing propping up the 
stock prices is heavy buying by the companies themselves [via share 
repurchases]. 
And now, that prop is getting kicked out from under the stock market. 
Bloomberg: 
After snapping up trillions of dollars of their own stock in a five-year 
shopping binge that dwarfed every other buyer, U.S. companies from Apple 
Inc. to IBM Corp. just put on the brakes. 
Announced repurchases dropped 38% to $244 billion in the last four months, 
the biggest decline since 2009...

Pareto's Foxes 
Although the bull market in U.S. stocks is probably near its end, the bull 
market in the Deep State shows no sign of weakening. 
Year after year, the power of the foxes grows. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031137 
It was the great Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto who noticed — among other 
things — that no matter what kind of government you think you have, there are 
always some crafty insiders, the foxes, who take control of it. 
Policies are set, programs are started... decisions are made... with no consent 
of the people or their elected officials; the foxes work the angles. 
Over time, the forces of law and order become more and more corrupt.., as the 
foxes bend the entire system to do their bidding. 
Wars are started with no plan or intention to win them. Money is handed out 
for no better reason than this: They can get away with it. 
And best of all, most people are none the wiser; they believe the myths... and 
attack anyone who challenges them. 
Rip-Off 
Perhaps the biggest rip-off of all time has taken place over the last eight years 
— and in plain sight of everybody. 
Via the magic of ultra-low rates, the Fed — a nest for the wiliest and most 
cunning of the foxes — took roughly $8 trillion out of the pockets of savers and 
retirees and handed it to borrowers. 
Who is the world's biggest borrower? 
Yes... it's the Deep State itself. 
The Fed claimed to be helping to stimulate the economy. But you can't really 
stimulate an economy by stealing from the people who produce wealth and 
provide it with capital. 
Not surprisingly, growth has stalled. Wages have fallen. Productivity has 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031138 
stagnated. 
For 95% of the male population, real earnings are lower today than they were 
in 1973. 
Is there any wonder many of these men vote for Donald Trump — a strong 
man who promises to do something about it? 
But the top 5% — where the foxes are — gained income. Their wages are up 
more than 50% over the same time. 
Why? 
Because they take more and more money from the rest of us. 
More tomorrow... on a new Rebellion in Gualfin... and a measure of how big 
the Deep State has become... 
Regards, 
Bill 
Further Reading: The Deep State already controls just about every aspect of 
American life. From health care to education to the food on our tables to the 
never-ending war on terror, this cadre of cronies is pulling the strings. 
In his latest online presentation, Bill exposes how the Deep State has now 
pushed the world to the brink of an irreversible disaster. Learn more here as 
he reveals how it will all unfold... and, more importantly, how it'll change your 
life forever.

George Soros is betting big on gold. 
As Bill reported yesterday, the billionaire speculator cut his  
firm's investments in U.S. stocks by more than one-third. 
Soros has also disclosed a new stake in the world's biggest 
gold miner, Barrick Gold (ABX). 
Soros Fund Management, his investment vehicle, bought a 1.7% of Barrick. 
This makes it Soros' biggest listed holding. 
As today's chart shows, Barrick has skyrocketed so far in 2016. 
The company's stock is up a jaw-dropping 156% year to date.

Sarah Palin will be the V.P. with Trump, and you may be surprised that they

Good God! Anything is better than just giving it to Hilary and her 
despicable husband. 
— Judy P. 
Thanks for including Jefferson and von Mises, my favorite Galician, in 
the list of good guys. Our economy cannot be repaired without 
dismantling the Fed. As you often point out, our monetary system is 
rotten at the core, as it is based on credit. 
I read in one of these letters from a libertarian source that Jefferson 
wrote, already in 1810 or so, that he had failed to set up a free country 
as he envisioned.., and that was still more than too years before the 
Federal Reserve Act. 
On the other hand, even today, I strongly believe that if we just followed 
the Constitution, we would be okay — especially the loth amendment. I 
think that is the most important of all.

criminal, and the really good ones get their districts what they need.

All I can say about Bill's message on Monday is: Amen, brother! Amen! 
He hit every nail right on the head. 
To those self-deluding worthies who think that a Donald Trump 
presidency will solve all of America's problems I say, Get your heads 
out of your collective a***s, because it ain't gonna happen. 
Trump will continue the policies (if we can laughably call them such) of 
the Deep State... with a dash of Adolph Hitler thrown in for good 
measure. Clinton will be no better, if not worse. 
I'm with Bill — a vote for the lesser of two evils is still voting for evil. 
However, unlike him, I will vote, but for a third-party candidate who 
doesn't have a snowball's chance of winning. A wasted vote is better 
than a vote for Trump or Hillary. 
— Dale A. 
I think you are correct in your assessment of the Deep State. I disagree 
in how to deal with it. 
It seems easy for the rich or the poor to walk away and state it doesn't 
matter. The poor because they do not have a choice; the rich because 
they do. For those of us in the middle we need to deal with it, lest we 
end up in the poor camp. For me, a decision that includes a less bad 
scenario is still a decision worth pursuing.

Jeffrey-
! need to start off by stating that it is not my intent to go around Shawn Lancaster on this — Shawn is a friend. 
This being said, I have received e-mails from both you and Larry this weekend. 
I called Larry and he said I should send you an e-mail. 
I called a close friend of mine inquiring about the GV market and aircraft that are not published. As of today, 
there are eight (8) of these aircraft that are not yet on the market. 
Let me know if you would like to speak with him and by what means (you call him, he call you, call 
Larry ....whatever). 
By the way, his company sold Trumps 727 and got Trump a very attractive number for an aircraft that was on 
it's way to a museum. 
Hope all is well.

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024045.txt,"Leadership: NLV_ are leaders in biopharmaceutical investing across all stages and transaction
types

The New Leaf team is well positioned to continue to play a leadership role in the sector. Over
the last two decades, the Fund Managers have demonstrated an ability to access high quality
biopharmaceutical investments at all stages, by sourcing opportunities through a range of
activities that result in differentiated and in many cases proprietary deal flow. Deal flow is
generated by relying on New Leaf’s extensive network of relationships that span senior
executives in the pharmaceutical and biotech companies, top scientists at world-class academic
institutions, and leading investors in the venture capital, private equity, and small cap public
sectors. By leveraging this network the Fund Managers gain visibility to interesting investment
ideas, and develop insight into the long term strategic interests of the larger pharmaceutical and
biotech companies and the evolving attitudes about value and risk of public market investors.
Through this continuous process the Fund Managers seek to ensure that they are able to view
the widest range of high quality opportunities and have a highly informed and discerning
screen to determine which of the opportunities have the greatest long term investment
potential. It is these efforts that have allowed the New Leaf team to create some of the best
performing portfolios of biopharmaceutical investments in the industry in the Sprout Funds
and in NLV-I and NLV-II, and has resulted in successful and consistent track records of returns
in the sector. The Fund Managers have demonstrated leadership in the sector over the long
term through transactions that span the full range of stages and transaction types, including:

e Start-Ups: The Fund Managers have played important roles and have been founding
investors in a number of successful start-up companies. These have included Pearl
Therapeutics (NLV-I, exited in sale to Astra Zeneca, 2.5x multiple plus milestones),
Relypsa (NLV-I,_ private initially, now public on NASDAQ: RLYP),
Convergence/Calchan Pharmaceuticals (NLV-IL, one start up that subsequently split to
become 2 separate companies), Durata Therapeutics (NLV-II: IPO - July, 2012,
NASDAQ: DRTX), and Ilypsa (Sprout IX, exited in sale to Amgen, 6.9x multiple).

e Established Private Companies: The New Leaf Team has played the role of lead
investor in a large number of private investments. These have included Cerexa (NLV-I,
exited in sale to Forest Labs, 5.4x multiple), Stromedix (NLV-I, exited in sale to Biogen
Idec, 1.8x multiple plus milestones), Chimerix (NLV-IL, IPO - April, 2013, NASDAQ:
CMRxX), and Auxilium (Sprout IX, NASDAQ: AUXL, exited at 4.6x).

e Restructuring Private Companies: The Fund Managers have led financings that have
restructured private companies, providing capital to fund business plans that have
refocused company’s business plans on certain key assets and product development
programs and significantly reducing or terminating investments into others. Examples
of this type of investment include Intarcia Therapeutics (NLV-I) and Synageva
Biopharma (NLV-II, reverse merger to become public - November, 2011, NASDAQ:
GEVA,; exited at 7.3x).

e Restructuring & Recapitalizing Public Companies: The New Leaf team has created
interesting investment opportunities through restructuring and recapitalizing public
companies. Examples include MEI Pharma (NLV-I], NASDAQ: MEIP) and Sirna

‘The history of civilization is the history of wartare
between secret societies.” --/shmael Reed

In the men’ s room at the airport, a man standing at the urinal a
couple of urinals away from my urinal was urinating without aiming his
penis. Both hands were flossing his teeth. A monument to multi-tasking.
I’ Il admit that | occasionally brush my teeth while I’ m urinating—at least
that leaves me with one hand free to steer—but this guy could possibly be
the only human being on earth who pisses and flosses simultaneously.

He must have practiced at home before he decided to go public.
And of course he was proud of his manual dexterity. Maybe he even has a
license plate that says PFLOSS, though other drivers might assume it’ s his
name, not his avocation. In any case, that image immediately replaced my
previous visual mantra: seeing one of the kids on a school bus holding up
to the window a sign that read HELP US!--and laughing with his
classmates.

Now, on Memorial Day weekend, | was catching a flight to San Jose,
California. | was headed for Conspiracy Con 2001, a convention featuring

2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *863

as I argued at length in an earlier article. + After receiving my suggested changes, the Advisory Committee agreed with some,
but declined to adopt many of the others. At issue for the Advisory Committee was whether to proceed narrowly by changing
only a few rules to track specific congressional directives or to proceed more broadly by reworking the entire body of federal
criminal rules to ensure that they are all fair to crime victims. The Committee opted for the narrower approach.

Part III of this Article disputes the Advisory Committee's limited vision. Congress has required that the courts must treat crime
victims with fairness throughout the process. > The only way to fully implement that command is a [*864] thorough
reworking of the federal criminal rules to integrate victims into the day-to-day workings of the process. The Committee's
parsimonious amendments simply ignore that congressional directive and mean that, in practice, many of the federal criminal
rules will continue to overlook the legitimate interests of crime victims.

Part IV of this Article contains a rule-by-rule analysis of changes that should be made to the federal rules. The following
changes are of particular importance:

1. Ensuring that crime victims’ attorneys can appear in court (Rule 1);

2. Providing for victim participation in the plea bargain process (Rule 11);

Leo

. Protecting victims’ addresses and telephone numbers from improper disclosure (Rule 12);

a

. Guaranteeing victims the right to attend criminal depositions (Rule 15);

Nn

. Protecting victims from having personal and confidential information improperly subpoenaed (Rule 17);

on

. Considering victims’ interests when cases are transferred or when a bench trial is ordered (Rules 21 and 23);

~

. Integrating victims into the sentencing process (Rule 32);

8. Articulating victims' right to discretionary appointment of counsel (Rule 44.1);

9. Giving victims the right to be heard at bail decisions (Rule 46);

10. Requiring victims’ views be considered before a case is dismissed (Rule 48);

11. Protecting victims' right to a speedy trial (Rule 50);

12. Giving victims notice of court proceedings and of their rights in those proceedings (Rule 60(a)(1));

13. Guaranteeing victims the right to attend court proceedings (Rule 60(a)(2));

14. Guaranteeing victims the right to be heard on bail, plea, sentencing, and other issues important to victims (Rule 60(a)(3)).

Finally, Part V briefly concludes by explaining that the likely consequence of the Advisory Committee failing to fully
implement Congress's vision will be that Congress itself will step in to do the job. It would be unfortunate if the Judiciary were
to abdicate its responsibilities to protect crime victims and leave the task to another branch of government.

This Article also contains a short Afterword, which recounts developments subsequent to the drafting of this Article in January
2007.

TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025143.txt,"﻿

Africa, parasites, intelligence


To understand intelligence in the tropics, e.g. among dark-skinned Africans, you need to understand the importance of parasites—both as an environmental factor that exerts a negative effect on mental development and a positive effect on selection for biological diversity of all sorts, including intelligence. 

1.  Taking first the well-known negative effect of parasite load on individual intelligence—in the US the parallel factor is toxins and also indoor parasites, as in tenements—the US is now more segregated by race than it was in 1965 and so that many studies show that there is a strong tendency for whites to live in healthy environments and blacks inferior habitats. 

For Africa, the environmental factor is parasites—disease—known to exert a strong negative effect on intelligence. 

They also exert a very strong positive effect for genetic diversity in their hosts that may in turn select for some groups excelling in intelligence, even if the mean is lower—variance is higher.

2--Hominids have always emerged from Africa, erectus, sapiens, sapiens neanderthalensis and sapiens sapiens, but with trivial exceptions never in the reverse direction--why? Because Africa is the most genetically variable part of the world, especially the smaller the organism, hence parasites. African human populations are invariably more genetically variable than more temperate hominids, including today.

The same rule applies more generally, that is, to almost all species—migration is always tropics to temperate to arctic, rarely the other way around (e.g. salamanders are the exception: temperate to tropics)—it is Mexicans and people further south who are coming into the US, not Canadians and Eskimos. So Trump is erecting a barrier against Darlington’s Rule—migration is always tropics outward.  Africa is the center of the tropics in the entire globe. Before that it was part of Gondwanaland (Africa, South America, Antarctic) but it was the center of that super-continent, and therefore most tropical section, so Darlington’s rule held back then, as we know from fossils. 




BTW it is striking that there is strong evidence that selection from parasites has been increasing over the past 40,000 years with an acceleration of positive selection to a striking degree—before agriculture and animal husbandry which added further acceleration associated with orders of magnitude (5 0r 6) increases in density. There are “signatures” that genes show of recent strong positive selection, basically comparing neutral sites (change in DNA has no effect on structure of associated protein) with non-neutral sites and seeing if the latter evolve while the former show a random walk. 

And what are the chief “selected variants”?  Parasite-resistant genes.

Now these are automatically selected when density increases because parasites LOVE density--consider people packed in a room breathing on each other, or water-born parasites traveling quickly to others, or vector-borne parasites, e.g. malaria--if one in ten humans are sick but widely dispersed a mosquito biting the sick person rarely passes on the Plasmodium but if dense, every tenth person gives it to the mosquito who quickly passes it on

Likewise parasites like mobility--which increases density of contacts--so Haitians acquired HIV-1 because their middle class served as the middle class of emerging French-speaking African nations with high HIV, and they brought back the disease with them when they returned (though of course not whatever HIV-resistant genes may have been selected among the Africans).

Divergent human populations often show very similar patterns of strong selection for genes though different in time--thus Europe and Yoruba-land showed similar peaks in parasite resistant selection, though 10,000 years ago in the former and 8500 in the latter

Incidentally very striking that cases of strong outbreeding, e.g between sapiens and neanderthalensis resulted in us acquiring ~3% of our genome from them, half were local-environment genes—fair skin, less hair on back, blue eyes and red hair on head—and half PARASITE-RESISTANT GENES (MHC genes).

Likewise interbreeding between 'us' and Denisovens in Tibet helped us acquire alleles uniquely suited for high altitude and, once again, resistance to local parasites.

Logic is obvious--if you are moving into Europe for the first time you are adapted to the parasites from which you came (malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever, this that and the third African disease) but not those in the area you are invading (smallpox, the plague)

3--Human genetic diversity declines as people move from Africa outwards--why? Serial founder effect.  It is always a sub-group of the larger group that decides to go over the next mountain and colonize the valley. They can rapidly reconstitute numbers but not lost genetic diversity—repeated over and over you see a steady decline in genetic diversity from Africa to mid-East Europe Asia (Russia) and finally into arctic America and right down to southern America within ~1000 generations

Hence Amerindians highly vulnerable to invasion of Europeans + Africans, bringing in small-pox, the plague, malaria, dengue fever to which they were highly vulnerable. Ever see pictures of adult Indians with their entire outer skin peeling off as they died hideous deaths from smallpox? Did you know that part of the genocide was to pass out ‘smallpox blankets’ from infected English children to Indian mothers? It is estimated that ½ of all Indians were slaughtered and the other ½ killed by parasites.

And let us go back in time. Did the burst in cave art (40,000 years ago) have anything to do with sexual selection related to increase in density and parasites—or is art unrelated to music? BTW recent analysis based on 2nd/4th digit ratio suggests the possibility that the artists were females!  Indeed for that matter what is the relationship between song, dance and intelligence? Especially in social interactions.

4.  And what is special about Jewish intelligence? Surely it is that it emerged in a mercantile settings, natural home of numbers, logic and mathematics—itself the “gateway to knowledge”, so huge disproportion of Nobel Prizes to go those of Jewish ancestry—half-Jews specially Bill Hamilton said to me in 1979 and I always regretted not saying to him “So where are the Jewish genes in you?”

BTW Ernst Mayr argued that the Jewish religion promoted intellectual reproduction, by encouraging the Rabbi to have the biggest family, while of course the Catholics emasculated their clergy

prosecution of excessive police uses of force. Finally, another institution responds to some of the same underenforcement
problems that private prosecution and judicial review could address - redundant prosecution authority in a federal system.

C. Federalism Safeguards on Prosecutorial Discretion

The scope of the U.S. federal crimmal code expanded vastly in the twentieth century, as did the federal government's
institutional capacity to enforce that code and its regulatory authority more generally. The result has been a distinctive form of
criminal justice federalism: federal enforcement authority wholly overlaps the territorial scope of state criminal law, and the
federal code substantially overlaps much of what is covered in state criminal codes. The resulting structure of redundant
federal-state authority has evolved into a means - unusual even among federal nation-states - to second-guess and effectively
trump state prosecutors’ declination decisions without empowering courts or private parties.

No other nation built on a federal model incorporates nearly [*885] the same degree of redundancy between state and federal
justice systems. !3! The more common model of criminal justice federalism is found in Canada and Germany: each has a
single national criminal code that is administered by separate state-level prosecution agencies and court systems. !3? Other
federal states follow the U.S. model and have separate criminal codes, prosecution agencies, and court systems in each state as
well as for the federal government. Australia follows this model, but the scope and jurisdiction of Australian federal criminal
law is much more limited than is U.S. federal law; federal crimes are largely confined to offenses that implicate distinct federal
interests - it is probably closer to U.S. federal criminal law in 1910 than 2010. The result is that in Australia federal criminal
law enforcement overlaps much less with state criminal law. !73

The broad redundancy provided by U.S. federalism enables federal prosecutors to serve as checks on underenforcement by
state prosecutors, at least for some large and important categories [*886] of crime. In effect, federal prosecutors can review
the declination decisions of state prosecutors - as well as the adequacy and success of their prosecutions - and then decide
whether to file federal charges in cases that their state counterparts declined to pursue, charged too leniently, or in which they
failed to win a conviction or sufficiently harsh sanctions. (In theory state prosecutors conduct the same oversight over much of

accounts of private prosecutions.

property with impunity, if no other white men be present, the freedman has no security for either. (quoting The Progress of Reconstruction,
N.Y. Times, Oct. 3, 1865, at 4)).

°8 When Southern states were compelled to grant African American citizens litigation rights, they imposed strict conditions, permitting
African Americans the right to testify only when the crime victim (or the opposing civil litigant) was African American. Id. at 684. Those
limitations likewise restricted African Americans’ private prosecution authority, although in many places racial customs, backed by the
prospect of racial violence, was probably discouragement enough. See generally Douglas A. Blackmon, Slavery by Another Name: The Re-
Enslavement of Black Americans from the Civil War to World War IT (2008) (discussing history of African Americans' distrust of America's

into structured information to support better-informed decision making by patients,
providers, and pharmaceutical marketing teams.

e Investment Theme - Patient Engagement / Shift to Low-Cost Setting: As incentives move

away from procedural volume and towards cost-effective quality and outcomes,
providers and care delivery organizations are seeking ways to deliver care outside of the
hospital or physicians’ office through technologies that may allow remote monitoring,
and empowers other healthcare professionals, or even patients to play a greater role in
patient care and well-being. Audax Health (NLV-IJ; exited at 3.4x) touches on this
theme with its Zensey product, which engages patients in their own health through
programs endorsed by their payer.

Problem Area: Inflated Pricing & Fraud

e Investment Theme - Price & Cost Transparency, Financial Error Reduction: Error reduction
can generate significant cost savings at the enterprise level. Truveris (NLV-II) allows

self-insured employers to verify the accuracy of all pharmaceutical benefit claims from
their pharmacy benefit managers in real time, thus resulting in more accurate payments
and significant cost savings.

These are just some of the illustrative themes for IC. investments in NLV-II. This is an
emerging area with strong growth drivers, and the Fund Managers expect the opportunity set
to evolve and broaden substantially over NLV-III’s investment cycle.

An intriguing aspect of this sector is the possibility for significantly shortened development
timelines and product iteration cycles. Particularly because they are usually outside the
jurisdiction of the FDA and standard reimbursement paths, companies in the LC. sector can
develop and launch products in months not years, and for single digit millions rather than
several tens of millions of dollars. Product development for these types of applications
leverages “off-the-shelf technologies” in sensors, communications, software and web
design/deployment that were invented and validated in non-healthcare market segments.
These products can be quickly and cheaply tested, iterated and refined in the marketplace with
customers while generating early revenue, which provides a greater degree of flexibility to
evolve the right solution through a series of incremental improvements rather than a single
track, expensive and prolonged development effort.

The Fund’s I.C. investments will be predominantly in private companies in the U.S, at or near
commercialization. Similar to the biopharmaceutical strategy, New Leaf’s objective in its LC.
investments is to build ownership positions that are large enough to allow the Fund Managers
to exert influence on the company, and to actively manage the investments through board
participation. In certain circumstances, NLV may initially take smaller positions with plans to
significantly increase the Fund’s investment as the companies make progress through key early
technical or commercial hurdles. Utilizing this strategy, the Fund Managers expect to build
larger positions around select investments as they are progressively de-risked, and may not
continue to support investments that do not demonstrate appropriate progress.

104 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 59, *87

Grven this continuing active role that agents typically play during criminal prosecutions, we find the fact that the CVRA assigns
responsibility to them, together with the attorney for the Government, to ... accord them their rights under the CVRA to be
entirely consistent with our conclusion that those rights arise only once the Government has initiated criminal proceedings. !®?

But OLC's contorted position never explains why Congress found it necessary to break out three separate phases of the
criminal justice process: the detection, investigation, and prosecution of crime. If the congressional intent was simply to
cover, for example, FBI agents or EPA agents during the post-charging phase of a case, it could have simply omitted those
words from the CVRA. An FBI agent, for example, would be engaged in the prosecution of the case when assisting the victim
after the formal filing of charges. On OLC's reading of the statute, the words detection and investigation become
meaningless, contrary to the well-known canon of construction verba cum effectu sunt accipienda, which means that, if

possible, every word and every provision is to be given effect. 1°4

OLC also suggests that the most significant argument supporting pre-charging application of rights 1s the venue provision,
which allows [*88] crime victims to assert CVRA rights in the district court in which a defendant is being prosecuted for the
crime or, if no prosecution is underway, in the district court in the district in which the crime occurred. '®° The Department
contends that this language refers quite narrowly to the period of time between the filing of a complaint and the initiation of
formal charges. '°° In support of its position, the Department cites a Fourth Circuit case interpreting the Sixth Amendment
right to counsel, which held that a prosecution for purposes of that Amendment does not begin when a criminal complaint is
filed. 1°” In OLC's view, the venue provision's direction that victims should assert rights when no prosecution is underway
applies only to the limited time between when the Government files a complaint against a defendant and some later point when
the prosecution actually begins. OLC notes that the filing of a complaint triggers an initial appearance, where crime victims
can have important interests at stake, such as the right to be heard about a defendant's release on bail. OLC believes it is only to
such post-complaint, yet pre-indictment, proceedings (i.e., the initial appearance) that the venue provision's no-prosecution-
underway language covers.

As a preliminary matter, OLC's interpretation of the word prosecution in the Department's narrow construction of the venue
provision is a twisted one, at odds with the way that term is conventionally used. The filing of a complaint is typically viewed
as the start of a criminal prosecution. For example, the leading criminal procedure hornbook states that with the filing of the
complaint, the arrestee officially becomes a defendant' in a criminal prosecution. 168

Moreover, having specifically rejected the filing of the criminal complaint as the starting point for a prosecution within the
CVRA's venue provision, OLC refuses to consider the implications of its alterative starting point: the formal filing of an
indictment. OLC states that a prosecution of a felony must commence with the return of an indictment by a grand jury, citing
the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. !® Yet OLC does not pause to recognize that, while felonies proceed by way of
indictment, misdemeanors can proceed not only by indictment but also by complaint. '7° The CVRA draws no distinction
between misdemeanor and [*89] felony offenses, broadly extending its protections to victims of any federal offense. !7!

Thus, under OLC's interpretation that the filing of a complaint does not trigger the CVRA, many victims who are entitled to

products industries, especially as companies from those industries look to enter the cannabis industry,
through acquisition or by other means.

As demonstrated by the more than $2.0 billion raised by publicly traded and private cannabis-
related companies in 2017, capital continues to be available to support the growth of the industry.
In the public markets, we believe that Canadian stock markets will continue to be the most receptive
globally (until more progress is made in the United States toward federal legalization of cannabis).

Although capital continues to be available for select issuers in both the public and private markets,
we believe that the cannabis industry will continue to face a large funding gap for the foreseeable
future, driven by the lack of institutional investors. However, we believe a growing number of retail,
institutional and family office investors will support the industry in 2018 and beyond.

2. Marginalizing the opposition: As noted above,
authoritarian leaders use their media power to
paint critics as knaves or buffoons. Especially
through television coverage, opposition figures
are presented as clownish, effeminate, shady,
elitist, or enslaved by foreign interests. The mes-
sage is pounded home day after day, until the
image of the opposition as small and unfit to
rule is fixed in the public's mind.

3. Tolerating the pseudo-opposition: Having jailed,
exiled, or silenced potentially competitive oppo-
sition figures, authoritarians tolerate nominal op-
position parties that are effectively controlled by
the regime. These groups have accepted the su-
premacy of the incumbent leadership and settled
into their roles in a stage-managed democracy.

4. Criminalizing protest: The crippling of formal
opposition parties leads many voters to chan-
nel their dissent into loosely organized civic
activism, often relying on protests to mobilize
support and reach the broader public despite
state control of the media. Authoritarian govern-
ments have responded by adopting harsher laws
on public assembly, enabling them to jail pro-
test leaders and even ordinary participants for
vaguely defined offenses like disturbing public
order and gathering without a permit. Protesters
can also be imprisoned on trumped-up charges,
such as assaulting a police officer or possessing
a weapon. This discourages others from joining
the civic movements and prevents them from
growing into organized political forces.

5. Discarding term limits: Term limits designed

to prevent the concentration of power in one
individual have been rolled back, circumvented,
or removed altogether in Venezuela, Nicaragua,
Bolivia, Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and many
other countries over the past 15 years.'° Endless
incumbency denies opposition forces an oppor-
tunity to win over both voters and elements of
the ruling establishment that may be ready for
new leadership. It also promotes personal loy-
alty at the expense of public service, stunts the
development of possible successors, reinforces
the impression that only the current leader is fit
to govern, and feeds a self-perpetuating fear of
political change.

Returning to old habits
While modern authoritarian regimes have generally

maintained some illusion of pluralism as one of their
main concessions to the post-Cold War international or-
der, a number of governments have been less attentive
to this priority, drifting back toward the electoral tactics,
and lopsided results, of 20th-century dictatorships.

In Belarus, the election of just two members of the
opposition to the rubber-stamp parliament in 2016 was
actually regarded as a step forward from the 2004, 2008,
and 2012 balloting, in which no opposition candidates
won seats. Lukashenka, in power since 1994, was
accused of directing an assassination squad prior to the
2001 presidential election. Four politicians and journal-
ists who had been critical of the incumbent disappeared
prior to the vote. After Lukashenka won another term in
a deeply flawed 2010 election, the authorities arrested
over 700 protesters, including seven of the nine opposi-
tion presidential candidates. The regime later sentenced
three of the former candidates to prison terms

Ethiopian opposition members were beaten and arrest-
ed during the 2015 electoral campaign. The Semayawi
Party reported that more than 50 of its members were
arrested ahead of the polls, and nearly half of Semay-
awi candidates were deregistered on administrative
grounds. The ruling EPRDF and its allies took all 547
seats in the lower house. The 2010 elections were also
tightly controlled, with local officials or neighborhood
militia going door to door and verifying that residents
had registered as members of the EPRDF. Voters were
threatened with the loss of their jobs, homes, or gov-
ernment services if they did not turn out for the party.
The most charismatic opposition figure, the leader of
the Unity and Justice Party, Birtukan Mideksa, re-
mained in prison during the election, in which opposi-
tion candidates took only two seats.”

The possible motivations for retrograde electoral abus-
es vary from country to country, but authoritarians
may feel emboldened to drop their quasi-democratic
camouflage due to the lack of diplomatic repercus-
sions for such actions. The European Union and the
United States have criticized Belarus as “Europe's last
dictatorship,” but they always seem willing to give Lu-
kashenka another chance to improve relations based
on the thinnest hopes of reform. Democratic powers
have treated Ethiopia as a counterterrorism ally and a
model of rapid economic development, granting it bil-
lions of dollars in foreign assistance.

Elections and democratic renewal
Whether through blatant repression or less obvious
methods, modern authoritarians seek to control the

to either Israel or Egypt and it will be delivered by truck. Sea access
must remain blocked to prevent weapons smuggling.

The Israeli position defies a brutal truth: last year’s flotilla made a big
difference for the people of Gaza — at a terrible cost in lives — by
refocusing international attention on their plight and forcing a change
in Israeli policy. Today, twice as many goods enter from Israel as
before. Nonetheless, Gaza remains a deeply sad and deprived place.
“The focus on humanitarian aid by both flotilla organizers and the
Israeli government is infuriating and misleading,” Gisha, an Israeli
human rights group focused on Gaza, said in a statement. “There is
no shortage of food in Gaza, but economic recovery is blocked by
sweeping restrictions.”

The Exodus analogy supports a certain political and public relations
strategy. In July 1947, when Britain ruled Palestine and the number
of Jews allowed in was severely limited, the ship, with 4,500 Jewish
refugees from Europe, tried to get through. British forces boarded it,
killed three people, wounded dozens and essentially destroyed the
ship as it listed in Haifa harbor.

The British ultimately sent the passengers to Hamburg. The sight of
thousands of Jewish refugees shipped to Germany soon after the
Holocaust sparked international outrage and sympathy for the Zionist
cause, a key goal of the trip. “The Exodus showed that if the British
are callous enough to send Jews back to Germany, the only ones who
should be in charge of the fate of the Jews are the Jews themselves,”
observed M. M. Silver, an Israeli historian and the author of “Our
Exodus.” “Palestinian forces are trying to make the same point
through the flotilla, that Israel has no right to control the fate of
Palestinians.”

Several months after the Exodus, the United Nations General
Assembly voted for the establishment of two states in Palestine,
Jewish and Arab, the key diplomatic moment in Israel’s history. The

80 novel as to implicate the so-called “‘clear statement rule,” the Ex Post Facto clause, or the Due
Process clause. As with the other legal issues, Mr. Acosta may elect to proceed with the case.

Absence of coercion. With respect to 18 U.S.C, § 1591, the alleged absence of the use of
force, fraud, or coercion is of no moment. The statute does not require the use of force, fraud,
and coercion against minors. Because of their age, a degree of coercion is presumed. In your
materials, you note that the statute requires that the minors must be “caused” to engage ina
conunercial sex act, further arguing that the word “cause” suggests that a certain amount of
undue influerice was used, We reject that interpretation, as it would read back into the offense an
element-coercion—that Congress has expressly excluded. We have successfully prosecuted |
defendants for the commercial sexual exploitation of minors, even when the minors testified that
not only did they voluntarily engage in the commercial sex acts, it was their idea to do so. As
such, Mr. Acosta could properly decide to pursue charges under Section 1591 even if there is no
evidence of coercion.

More broadly, a defendant’s criminal liabili ty does not hinge on his victim i dentifying as
having suffered at his hands. Therefore, a prosecution could proceed, should Mr. Acosta decide
to do so, even though some of the young women allegedly have said that they do not view
themselves as victims,

Witness credibility. As all prosecutors know, there are no perfect witnesses. Particularly
in Cases involving exploited children, as one member of your defense team, Ms, Thacker, surely
knows from her work at CEOS, it is not uncommon for victim-witnesses to give conflicting
statements. The prosecutors are in the best position to assess the witness's credibility, Often, the
Prosecutor may decide that the best approach is to present the witness, let defeuse counsel
explore the credibili ty problems on cross-cxamination, and let the jury resolve the issue. Mr.
Acosta would be within his authority to select that approach, especially when here there are
nuultiple, mutually-corroborating witnesses.

Contradictions and omissions in the search warrant application, We have carefully
reviewed the factual issues you raise conceming the search warrant application. For a search
warrant to be suppressed, however, the factual errors must be material, and the officers must nor
have proceeded in good faith, Despite the numerous factual errors you describe, the U.S.
Attomey’s Office could stil] plausibly argue that the mistakes—whether inadvertent or
intentional—were not material to the determination that probable cause existed for a search, and
that the search was in good faith in any event. As such, Mr. Acosta could properly elect to
defend the search warrant in court rather than forego prosecution.

Petite Policy: After reviewing the petite policy and consulting with the Office of
Enforcement Operations (“OEO”), we conclude that the petite policy does not prohibit federal
prosecution in this case, According to the U.S. Attomey’s Manual, the petite policy “applies
whenever there has been a prior state or federal prosecution resulting in an acquittal, a
conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement, or a dismissal or other termination of

later. In fact, he later used the very vulnerability he pointed out to
steal NSA documents at Dell.

In September 2009, still on the Dell payroll, Snowden made a ten-
day trip to India. He later said he was on an official visit “working
at the US embassy.” Hotel records show that he arrived at the Hyatt
Regency in New Delhi on September 2 from Japan and at 3:30 p.m.
on September 3 checked into the Koenig Inn, an annex to Koenig
Solutions, a school that gave crash courses on programming and
computer hacking. According to Rohit Aggarwal, head of the school,
Snowden stayed there until September 10 while taking classes
with a private instructor. It cost $2,000 in tuition and fees, which
Snowden prepaid from Japan with his personal credit card. Even
though Snowden later said he only took courses in “programming,”
the school’s records show that during that week he took intensive
courses in sophisticated hacking techniques. The course was titled
“Ethical Hacking,” but that was a euphemism for teaching the tech-
niques of illicit hacking. The course provided tutoring on hackers’
tools such as SpyEye and Zeus, which are used to circumvent secu-

© rity procedures. It also demonstrated how these hacking tools could ©
be customized by criminals and spies to break into files, plant sur-
veillance programs, impersonate system administrators, assume the
privileges of system administrators in a network, and capture the
passwords of others. On September 11, Snowden, according to hotel
records, left India for Japan. While the stated purpose of the hacking
training was to allow security consultants to detect intruders, it also
prepared Snowden to be, if he chose to be, an intruder in the NSA
system.

One problem with working as a contractor is that the standard
two-year contracts are not necessarily renewed. Nor is there much
possibility for advancement for IT workers. As one contractor
told me, “It is a dead-end job with great pay.” In the fall of 2010,
Snowden’s contract in Japan with Dell was nearing an end.

Dell offered Snowden, and he accepted, a new position in the
United States. He rented a modest suburban house shaded by a
sakura cherry tree in a suburb of Annapolis, Maryland. Lindsay
Mills meanwhile was attending a two-week fitness training course at

the heads of military intelligence and Mossad, to sign off on the operational
viability of the plan.

That was what now ended any prospect of military action, at least for a few
months. Bibi, Lieberman and I withdrew into a side room to talk with the chief of
staff, Gaby Ashkenazi, as well as the heads of military intelligence, the Mossad
and and Shin Bet. We emphasized that no final decision on whether to attack had
been taken. That would require a further meeting with the Group of Eight, and then
the full cabinet. But we asked each of them for their views on the operation. We
knew they had political reservations, along the lines of those voiced by Dan
Meridor. On an issue of this magnitude, it was accepted practice that military and
intelligence commanders could weigh in on the political implications as well. But
their formal role was operational and professional. Ashkenazi and the other
generals did concede that in every area — planning, materiel, training and
intelligence — our attack plan was far ahead of where it had been a year earlier. Yet
Ashkenazi, in particular, concluded that the preparations had not yet “crossed the
threshold of operational capability”.

I was furious. I respected the considered opposition of ministers like Dan or
Benny Begin. I had no problem with the chief-of-staff or other generals expressing
similar views on the political or geo-strategic implications of an Israeli attack, even
though our intelligence assessments suggested the concerns were almost certainly
unfounded. Yet what I found astonishing was Ashkenazi’s suggestion that the
“operational threshold” had not been crossed. Yes, this would be a demanding
mission. It was not without risks. No operation was. But having followed every
stage and detail of the preparations — and as a former chief of staff and intelligence
chief myself — I believed it was simply wrong on a professional level to say that
we lacked the capacity, and a workable plan, for a military strike if the order was
given.

Ashkenazi’s objection did mean there was no way we were going to attack at
least until well into the new year. Our discussions would continue, as would our
refinement and strengthening of the attack plan. So would Iran’s progress toward
its “zone of immunity,” which we now believed would begin late in 2012, a couple
of years away. As that point drew closer, we’d face an ever-more-pressing need to
decide finally whether military action was necessary.

where we made plans to meet up again. There was no kiss goodnight or
anything like that. No, he was too polite for that, he wanted to prove
himself different and different he was. Walking through the hotel’s
revolving doors I watched as he walked away and when he was finally
out of sight, I sung my way up to my room. Floating on cloud nine I was
free falling into a deep pit of love.

The next day I attended my class as usual but not able to concentrate
like | normally did, too excited about when I’d be seeing Robbie that
night again. As I walked out of class that afternoon even the teacher
noticed a difference in my performance and asked me if I was feeling
well, “On top of the world actually” I smiled back at the old instructor
and it wasn’t far from the exact truth either. [ hadn’t ever felt the
churning of butterflies in my stomach and the constant thoughts of
anyone else like this before. My girlfriend and I got a tuk-tuk back
together as we usually did after school and I couldn’t shut up about the
night before. She was laughing at my girlishness telling me that anyone
who just met me would think I had never been let out before, but little did
she know that | had more than my fair share in experience with men and
never had I ever come across anyone that could make me feel this way,
and what spun me out even more was that it was such an instant
attraction. Never considering myself a person who believed in the
existence of “Love at first sight”, but a true romantic deep at heart, |
couldn’t help but believe in it now. He is my walking proof of it!

Waiting for me in the hotel lobby was the very person I couldn’t stop
entertaining the thought of all day long, there he was looking ever so fine
standing in front of me now. The whole entire world faded away and all
that was left for the moment was this complete stranger I had only met
last night but somehow captivated the very essence of my very heart.
There was no need for me to try and act cool now. He already knew I was
snagged hook, line and sinker. Smiling all the way up the many stories in
the elevator up to my room he took notice of the posh décor of the hotel.
“You should see where I’m staying, this is a royal palace compared to it”
His first impression of me he automatically thought I was going to be a
spoiled high-maintenance girl that had money coming in from a parents
hefty trust fund. Casually he got to find out through many deep and
meaningful conversations that my life’s grim story wasn’t that pretty at
all. For some reason beyond my knowledge | had the need to tell this
stranger almost everything.

Wanting to be judged and looked down upon for everything about my
life that I knew was wrong and being the first time I had spoken about my
years with Jeffrey to anyone honestly like that ever before, I had felt like
I had deserved punishment. He offered me no judgment, instead only

gave me his warmth and compassion as he wrapped his strong arms
around me, making me feel so meager and smal! but so safe at the same
time. Encouraging me to see the worthiness of myself and leave that life
behind, he adorned me with a kind love that I wasn’t accustomed too.

He took me in and made me feel so at home. It was like I had known
him my whole life. I couldn’t bear to be without him another second
while 1 was away on this dream holiday. When he wasn’t training for
Muay-Thai tournaments and I wasn’t in school, nobody would ever see
us. Too enveloped in each other in my hotel room to care about anything
else. Which is why I asked him to come stay at my hotel with me, seeing
he was never at his own anyways. My girlfriend was soon departing back
to Wisconsin, making my room more than available for him. Enchanted
by his words and tender touch, the way he made love to me was again
like nothing I had experienced before. Even down to after sex as | had
been routinely instructed by Jeffrey to get up for a warm washcloth to
clean his genitals afterwards, he refused it, telling me I was no longer a
slave and that he didn’t want me acting like one. He’d just rather lay
down together afterwards and repeat our sweet nothings with many
adjoining kisses.

On our third night together with nothing but the bed sheets between us,
we had spent all night looking into each other’s eyes sharing such an
undeniable passion for one another. In the deepest caverns of my heart |
knew this man would give me what I had never experienced
before...True love. We were still laying in each others arms when the
orange and pink sunrise began to rise slowly through the peak’s of my
rooms windows, enticing me to come feel the freshness of the morning’s
chill. Only the bed sheets were still wrapped around my body as ] went
the balcony. It was overlooking the city in a valley surrounded by
mountainous tops. My thoughts began to rampage through my head and }
knew this could only be a dream for me. It was getting serious now, too
serious for the life that I led back home. As if he sensed my anxiety
Robbie walked up behind me and wrapped his strong arms around my
waistline, gently kissing my neckline and pausing with his ever so
thoughtful stares and gave me the exact opening that I needed to expel
my thoughts. “Back home, as you already know, ] am going back to
someone else, it’s my job, and as much as I really like you, this guy that I
kind of see is going to expect me to be putting him first, I am so sorry to
say all of this after such a wonderful few days we have spent together, but
you need to know this thing happening between us can’t get anymore
serious than what we have for now. | am so sorry” I looked down to the
floor with nothing else I could say to alter his perception of me now that I
had told him the truth and it never dawned on me that thought he
wouldn’t be out the door before I could even finish my sentence but he

gears of history churning away in war and peace. The “tactical” level is the most
practical. It’s the choice to use machine guns instead of tanks to secure a street in
Kabul, for instance, or to buy up gold for a central bank or permit high-frequency
stock trading. Tactics are where policy decisions crunch into reality. The most brutal
shocks are first felt tactically: roadside bombs or mis-designed, crashing computer
code.

A level above the problem of tactics sits the question of operations. It’s here where
decisions are made about just how various levers of power might best be moved.
Should we send bombers to slow Iranian proliferation or rely on cyber attacks? Will
tax dollars fix our infrastructure faster than tolls? Macarthur’s landing by surprise in
Incheon on the morning of September 15, 1950, Operation Chromite, was an
operational decision. “Within five hours, 40,000 men would act boldly, in the hope
that 100,000 others manning the defense lines of South Korea would not die, he
thought before the battle. “I alone was responsible for tomorrow, and if I failed, the
dreadful results would rest on judgment day against my soul.”52

Policy gets implemented through operations. It is the level where clever bureaucrats
and parasitic office politicians prey, where they can most easily undermine the
ambitions of visionaries. But it is also the place where inspiration works on the will
and passion of companies or armies or research labs. Server farms, data mining
algorithms, trade treaties—these are the operational chessboards of our era.
Operations is where the bolt tightening for revolutionary change occurs. It is
intense, relentless operations that ensure stability in the face of shock or growth or
collapse. “The exploding popularity of Internet services has created a new class of
computing systems that we have named warehouse-scale computers,” the Google
data engineers Luiz Andre Barosso and Urs Holzle wrote in famous, revolutionary
paper several years ago as they described the operational revolution that lets
Google serve terabytes of data, instantly, every day.*? The massive data centers they
had built, they realized, are so large that they are nothing less than computers that
are the size of massive buildings. Solar fields are their power supply; entire rivers
are their cooling tubes. And they enable nothing less than magic: instant knowledge,
connection to distant lands, a constant picture of what humanity knows. This is the
growing, heroic scale of operations now.

Above the operational and tactical levels is what we call the strategic dimension. It is
here where overall design is considered and moved. Without it, operations and
tactics are incoherent. Strategy imagines how whole structures like nations or

One of the most intriguing cases during my year with Judge Bazelon began as an ordinary pick
pocketing of a wallet containing $14. Based on the sparse evidence, “the jury could have inferred
either that the wallet was picked from [the alleged victim’s] pocket, or that it was accidentally
dropped from his pocket and was picked up by someone who ran off with it.”’® The judge
instructed the jury that there is a legal presumption that a defendant’s “flight may be considered
by jurors as evidence of guilt.”

There was no dispute that the defendant did flee when confronted by the alleged victim shouting ,
“Hey, that’s my wallet. Give it back to me.” But of course the defendant might well flee even if
he simply picked up a dropped wallet and didn’t want to return it. Such an action would be
immoral and perhaps even minimally criminal—the misdemeanor of failing to return a found
wallet, for which he had not been charged. But the defendant here was charged with the felony of
robbery. The jury convicted him of robbery and the judge sentenced him to prison for two to six
years.

When the case came across my desk, I saw it as an opportunity to use my law school background
in psychiatry and law—I was working on a casebook with two of my law school professors on
“Psychoanalysis, Psychiatry and the Law”—to reverse what appeared to be a possibly unjust
conviction. The great legal commentator Wigmore had written the following about evidence of
guilty feelings:

“The commission of a crime leaves usually upon the consciousness a moral impression
which is characteristic. The innocent man is without it; the guilty man usually has it. Its
evidential value has never been doubted. The inference from consciousness of guilt to
“guilty” is always available in evidence. It is a most powerful one, because the only other
hypothesis conceivable is the rare one that the person’s consciousness is caused by a
delusion, and not by the action doing of the act.’”'”

This view had become the accepted wisdom by lawyers, judges and professors and was the basis
for the judge’s instructions to the jury in the pick pocketing case. I found it highly questionable,
especially in the context of the facts of the case.

In an effort to support my conclusion that the defendant’s flight in this case was equally consistent
with the legally innocent explanation that he was fleeing to avoid returning a dropped wallet, or
the guilty explanation that he was fleeing from a pick pocketing crime, I introduced a quote from
Sigmund Freud:

“You may be lead astray...by a neurotic who reacts as though he were guilty even though
he is innocent—because a lurking sense of guilt already in him assimilates the accusation
made against him on this particular occasion. You must not regard this possibility as an
idle one; you have only to think of the nursery where you can often observe it. It
sometimes happens that a child who has been accused of a misdeed denied the accusation,
but at the same time weeps like a sinner who has been caught. You might think that the
child lies, even while it asserts its innocence; but this need not be so. The child is really

in their lives -- without letting go of the fact that some people can and do freely consent
to the job. (The sex worker Mistress Matisse has written a fair bit on sex work and
emotional labor. And male sex workers don't always have an easy time; the porn star
Tyler Knight has written about some of his more difficult moments, too.)

The point is not sex work is bad and should be banned -- but nor is it sex work is
glamorous and fun! The point is, sex work is often hard work, even for people who are
not mistreated or abused. As such, it deserves both respect (from outsiders) and open-
eyed caution (from those who consider taking it up).

Olivia's not sure she's done with sex work for good. The door is still open for future
involvement,” she told me, last time we met for coffee. If I do go back, I think I may try
for straight-up escorting, but I'm not really sure.... Presumably, working as an escort
rather than being a sugar baby might evade some of these confusing, strangely-
negotiated situations. Would it evade all of them? It's hard to say.

Regardless, I wish her luck.

This section was intended mostly to highlight various other perspectives that I feel are
significant to sex and/or activism.

1. Do you see your sexual identity as placing you in a community, or is it more private?
Or is it a little bit of both?

la. If you identify as part of a sex community, then are there ways you can contribute to
that community? (For example, if you had evidence that abusive relationships were a
problem in your community, what could you do about it?)

KOK ok

2. What kind of educational needs do you perceive around sexuality? Is there a way you
could contribute to positive sex education?

2b. If you have children, how do you plan to educate them about sex? Specifically, how
do you plan to tell them about the stereotypes and limitations affecting the different

that levels of violence were about twice as high for one variant of the DRD2 gene than others, and about
20% higher for a particular variant of the DAT1 gene. These genetic variants cause differences in
dopamine, which cause differences in expected and experienced reward, which cause differences in
perceived risk, which cause differences in the odds of getting in a fight and harming others. These are not
genes for aggression, violence or evil. There are no such genes. Rather, they are genes that change our
perception of risk. Because risk is related to all sorts of decisions, these genes can affect the odds that we
directly harm others. They are part of the story of individual differences, and part of the story of why
some are more likely to engage in evildoing.

Everything I have discussed thus far focuses on actions, on how the psychology of desire and
denial combine to fuel behaviors that lead, directly or indirectly, to excessive harms. I have also explained
how different biological ingredients predispose us toward different degrees of self-control, and thus,
differences in our ability to omit particular actions. This sense of omission is a virtue, a sign of resisting
temptation. But can omissions be a sign of vice, of resisting an action that is called for? Can omissions

ever reach such a scale that we would consider individuals or societies as evil omitters?

The sin of sloth.

What’s worse: 1) giving a lethal overdose to someone suffering from an incurable disease or allowing this
person to die by removing life support? 2) pushing someone in front of a runaway truck to stop the truck
and save the lives of five others or allowing someone to walk in front of the truck instead of warning
them? 3) pouring a toxic chemical into your competitor’s drink in order to make him sick or allowing
your competitor to drink the toxic chemical that was placed on the table by someone else? Even though
all of these situations seem quite bad, most people have a gut feeling that the actions are worse than the
omissions. They also feel that when we omit life support, fail to warn someone of a runaway truck, or
remain silent about a toxic drink, that we are less responsible for the consequences that unfold. Dozens of
studies, using hundreds of different examples, and thousands of subjects, support what our gut expresses:
we are captive to an omission effect. Even when we understand that the consequences are precisely the
same — the suffering patient dies, the truck kills the person, the toxic chemical makes the competitor sick
— and so too are the person’s goals and intentions — eliminate suffering, save five people, take out the
competitor — we are seduced to believe that action is worse than omission or that doing harm to another
is worse than allowing harm to occur.

The omission effect lays bare a tension between unconscious, spontaneous intuition and

conscious, reflective thought. On the one hand, there are potentially good reasons why we evolved this

tion and special operations. In this capacity, he supervised the joint
CIA-FBI interrogation of the prisoners in the Guanténamo base in
Cuba, which involved him in the rendition program for terrorists.

Barrett could certainly have played a role in furthering his only
grandson’s employment. The CIA, however, has not disclosed any
information about who, if anyone, recommended Snowden. All that
is known is that in 2006 the CIA waived its minimum requirements
for him.

Later Snowden pointed out from Moscow that in 2006 the fed-

in the Coast Guard; his mother was an administrative clerk for the
federal court in Maryland; his sister was a research director at the
Federal Judicial Center; and Admiral Barrett was still a top executive
at the FBI. In a sense, Snowden had entered the family business.

Manhattan.

The photograph that appeared last weekend shows the prince strolling through Central Park with
58-year-old Epstein. Andrew was said to have spent four days at his New York mansion in
December, when he was joined by other distinguished guests, including Woody Allen, at a dinner.

It is by no means the first New York soiree Andrew has attended as Epstein’s guest.

A lengthy profile of the financier in Vanity Fair magazine some years ago reported that Andrew was
a guest at a cocktail party thrown by Epstein and Maxwell packed with young Russian models.
‘Some guests were horrified,’ said the article's author, Vicky Ward.

it should not be forgotten that Epstein is a registered sex offender after recently completing his
sentence for offences relating to child prostitution.

However, he avoided trial on more serious charges that carried a potential life sentence. And no one
reading The Mail on Sunday's interview with the woman who was prepared to testify against him can
be in any doubt of the seriousness of the charges.

Epstein, a Wall Street money manager who once counted Bill Clinton and Donald Trump among his
friends, became the subject of an undercover investigation in 2005 after the stepmother of a 14-year
old girl claimed she was paid $200 (£125) to give him an ‘erotic massage’.

The subsequent FBI probe uncovered at least 20 girls levelling sexual allegations against him.
Eventually, Epstein struck a ‘plea bargain’ with prosecutors — a practice not permitted under British
law — under which he was allowed to plead guilty to two relatively minor charges.

Police claim that his donations to politicians and his ‘dream team’ of influential lawyers deterred
prosecutors from bringing more serious charges of sex-trafficking. The deal certainly kept the names
of a lot of Epstein’s famous friends out of an embarrassing court case.

However, an unusual part of the agreement was that Epstein’s alleged victims were allowed to bring
civil proceedings against him.

He has so far made 17 out-of-court settlements, and some cases are ongoing. One of these girls
was to have been a key witness for the prosecution had the case gone to trial. She was just 15
years old when she was drawn into Epstein’s exploitative world in 1998.

In her civil writ against him, under the pseudonym Jane Doe 102’ she alleged that her duties
included being ‘sexually exploited by Epstein’s adult male peers including royalty’.

Now, horrified by the evidence of Epstein and Andrew enjoying each other’s company in New York,
Jane Doe 102 has agreed to waive her anonymity and tell for the first time her deeply disturbing
story.

Her real name is Virginia Roberts and she now lives in Australia, where she is a happily married
mother of three.

Over the course of a week during which she spoke at length to The Mail on Sunday, she appeared
sometimes vuinerabie, and sometimes steely, but always quietly resolute and consistent.

Revisiting events from a past that she had hoped she had left behind, Virginia occasionally buried
her face in her hands.

Some recollections — and, for reasons of taste, not all the details can be included here — caused her
to flush with shame. ‘I'm telling you things that even my husband didn’t know,’ she said.

Virginia, who has undergone counselling to try to come to terms with her past, is honest about her
initiation into Epstein’s depraved world.

She was a troubled teenager, whose slender figure, delicate complexion, hesitant voice and soulful
blue eyes made her look young for her years.

Born in Sacramento, California, in August 1983, Virginia spent her early years on a small ranch on
the West Coast of America.

This seemingly idyllic childhood ended when she was sexually molested by a man close to her
family.

The fallout from that led to her parents temporarily splitting up. Blaming herself, Virginia began to
get into trouble Aged 11, she was sent to live with an aunt but repeatedly ran away.

Living on the streets, she was beaten up and slept with at least two older men in return for food. ‘1
was a paedophile’s dream,’ she says.

Three years later, she was reunited with her family and started a new life with her father who had
moved to Palm Beach,

Florida, where he was maintenance manager at Donald Trump's country club, Mar-a-Lago.

Virginia got a part-time job as a changing room assistant -which is where, soon after her 15th
birthday, she met Ghislaine Maxwell, who invited her to work as Epstein’s personal masseuse.

‘| was wearing my uniform — a white miniskirt and a skin-tight white polo top — when | was
approached by Ghislaine,’ Virginia says.

‘! told her | wanted to become a masseuse and she said she worked for a very wealthy gentleman
who was looking for a travelling masseuse.

I'd get training and be paid well. Virginia’s father gave his blessing, believing his daughter was being
handed the opportunity to learn a skill and to work for a wealthy and respectable employer.

He drove her to Epstein’s pink mansion on the Palm Beach waterfront — he also owns a nine-storey
home in New York, the city’s biggest private residence; a 7,500-acre ranch called ‘Zorro’ in New

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024079.txt,"Recourse to the Fund’s Assets

The Fund’s assets, including any investments made by the Fund and any funds held by the
Fund, are available to satisfy all liabilities and other obligations of the Fund. If the Fund
becomes subject to a liability, parties seeking to have the liability satisfied may have recourse to
the Fund’s assets generally and will not be limited to any particular assets, such as the asset
representing the investment giving rise to the liability. Accordingly, investors could find their
interest in the Fund’s assets adversely affected by a liability arising out of an investment of the
Fund.

Contingent Liabilities on Disposition of Investments

In connection with the disposition of an investment in a portfolio company or otherwise, the
Fund may be required to make representations about the business and financial affairs of the
portfolio company typical of those made in connection with the sale of any business. The Fund
may also be required to indemnify the purchasers of such portfolio company to the extent that
any such representations turn out to be inaccurate. These arrangements may result in
contingent liabilities, which might ultimately have to be funded by the investors to the extent of
their Commitment to the Fund or previous distributions made to them.

Certain Litigation Risks

The Fund will be subject to a variety of litigation risks, particularly if one or more of its portfolio
companies face financial or other difficulties during the term of the Fund. Legal disputes,
involving any or all of the Fund, the General Partner, its partners or its affiliates, may arise from
the Fund’s activities and investments and could have a significant adverse effect on the Fund.

Indemnification

The Fund will be required to indemnify, among others, the General Partner, the general partner
of the General Partner, the Management Company, the Fund Managers, their respective
partners, members, employees, venture partners and affiliates, the Fund’s other agents and
members of the Advisory Board for liabilities incurred in connection with the affairs of the
Fund. Such liabilities may be material. For example, in their capacity as directors of portfolio
companies, the partners, managers, or affiliates of the General Partner may be subject to
derivative or other similar claims brought by security holders of such companies. The
indemnification obligations of the Fund would be payable from the assets of the Fund,
including the unused capital commitments of the Partners. If the assets of the Fund are
insufficient to pay such indemnification obligations, the Limited Partners may be required to
return distributions previously made to them in order to satisfy such obligations.

Changes

The Fund’s investment program is intended to extend over a period of years, during which the

for examples, she has to pause before recalling a very public moment:
a spring day in 2009 when the weather was so good that the president
suggested they go outside, where they were photographed chatting at
a picnic table on the South Lawn. “It was exactly what I could have
hoped for. It was spontaneous and heartfelt, and we had a good time,”
she says. Her second example is a full hug she and the president
shared in the Situation Room after the health-care bill finally passed.
She accepted the post, in November of 2008, only after President-
Elect Obama—in an inspired move over the objections of many on
his campaign staff—twisted not just her arm, she informed friends,
but her fingers, toes, and every other bone in her body. The president,
for his part, is proud of himself for choosing her. He knows that she
represents the United States better than anyone but him and is—to
the surprise of many Obama veterans—refreshingly low-maintenance.
When budget season arrived this year and the departments all faced
drastic cuts, Hillary used a Cabinet meeting to offer tips on how to
avoid making cuts that would affect vulnerable people—children, the
elderly—and look bad politically. (She recalled that Newt Gingrich’s
effort to slash the school-lunch program, which put Gingrich on the
defensive, was the real turning point in the 1995 budget debate.)
Several second-tier Cabinet members thought it one of the most
useful White House meetings they had ever attended.

I’ve interviewed Hillary numerous times since she was First Lady of
Arkansas, and it’s usually frustrating. She’s terrific off the record:
blunt, ironic, and incisive about people, including her husband. When
she cuts to the nub of something and laughs infectiously, you can see
why her friends consider her such good company. On the record is
tougher, especially when she’s in a job where a single misplaced
word can turn into an international incident. It’s not that she doesn’t
trust at least some reporters; otherwise she wouldn’t risk private
candor. But the distrust for the news media as a species—the sense of

follow from determinations that there is insufficient evidence to support charging, and common law jurisdictions [*853] have
long left those assessments in the unregulated discretion of police and prosecutors. 77

But that is not the whole story. For one, it does not follow from the fact that officials must assess evidentiary sufficiency that
their assessments should be unregulated or unsupervised. The tradition in civil law jurisdictions is otherwise, and available
evidence often depends on the effort and priority officials give to finding it. More importantly, how rigorously we guard against
unmerited nonenforcement depends on how we value the interests harmed by nonenforcement, and on how much we worry
about nonenforcement for the wrong reasons. Both have changed over time.

The primary causes of underenforcement are failing to investigate and charge due to biases against certain victims or harms, or
favoritism toward certain kinds of suspects. 7° Three kinds of crimes - local government corruption, sexual assaults, and
unjustified uses of force by law enforcement officers - illustrate the link between these risks, failures to enforce, and the

consequences of underenforcement. Local corruption garners the least public and political attention now; 7°

not coincidentally,
the United States has found an effective model of enforcement redundancy on this front. 7° The justice system's responses to
sexual assault and police violence, on the other hand, are subjects of heated political and policy debates. 3! There has been
notable progress in reducing the criminal justice system's disregard of [*854] both kinds of offenses, but underenforcement -
and almost as important, widespread suspicion of underenforcement - remain significant enough that they illustrate some of the
key costs of those failures. Suspicion of underenforcement is itself a cost, because it reflects a loss of legitimacy for criminal
justice institutions. That loss in turn undermines the system's efficacy if citizens decline to report victimization or otherwise
decline to cooperate with law enforcement officials. Evidence for those effects is strong for both sexual assaults and police
violence. 37 More generally, underenforcement is a form of unequal treatment that unevenly - and unjustly - distributes the
important public benefits of criminal law enforcement, including the state's commitment to protect everyone equally from
unlawful harms. * It also deprives victims of the private benefits that criminal justice is now widely recognized to afford, and
owe, to victims.

27 See Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 727-28 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (Law enforcement is not automatic ... . What every
prosecutor is practically required to do is to select the cases for prosecution and to select those in which the offense is the most flagrant, the
public harm the greatest, and the proof the most certain. (quoting Robert H. Jackson, Attorney Gen. of the U.S., Address to the Second
Annual Conference of United States Attorneys: The Federal Prosecutor (Apr. 1, 1940))); 483 Parl Deb HC (Sth ser.) (1951) col. 681 (UK) (It
has never been the rule ... that suspected criminal offences must automatically be the subject of prosecution.).

28 See Alexandra Natapoff, Underenforcement, 75 Fordham L. Rev. 1715, 1722-39 (2006) (documenting underenforcement as a significant
problem). On underenforcement of sexual assault offenses, see Deborah Tuerkheimer, Underenforcement as Unequal Protection, 57 B.C. L.
Rev. 1287, 1292-1303 (2016) (discussing empirical evidence of bias leading to underenforcement).

29 Concern about public corruption at the federal government level, by contrast, has increased, precisely where criminal and regulatory level
are somewhat weaker. See, e.g., Zephyr Teachout, Corruption in America: From Benjamin Franklin's Snuff Box to Citizens United 1-16
(2014).

JEFFREY HERMAN
Attorney who represents alleged
victims, commenting on the plea

The judge was skeptical but
agreed to it.

Epstein’s legal woes don’t
end with Monday’ plea.
There are four pending fed-
eral civil lawsuits and one
in state court related to his
behavior. At least one woman
has sued him in New York,
where he owns a_51,000-
square-foot Manhattan man-
sion.

“Its validation of what
we're saying in the civil

Jeffrey Herman,- who repre-
sents the alleged victims in
the federal lawsuits. West
Palm Beach attorney Ted
Leopold represents one al-
leged victim in a civil suit in
state court. He said he antici-
pates amending that lawsuit
to add “a few other clients”
as well.

In the criminal case, po-
lice went so far as to scour
Epstein’s trash and conduct
surveillance at Palm Beach

ternational Airport, where
they watched for his private
jet so they would know when
he was in town. They con-
cluded that Epstein paid girls
$200 to $300' each after the
massage sessions.

Palm Beach Police Chief -

tor should disqualify himself.

wrote. He then asked for and

Seckel acquaintances, I kept hearing variations on a scheme Mrs.
Pearce Williams believed he perpetrated against her late hus-
band, the man Seckel said was his mentor. Seckel took books
and promised money, or he took money and promised a book;
but somehow, the promised party lost money.”

“He was charming, erudite, humorous,” one of Seckel’s marks
told the reporter. “I lent him $75,000. When the time came to
pay it back he didn’t want to do it.”

Oppenheimer found several people whom Seckel had stiffed
and uncovered dozens of lawsuits he'd been involved in. In 2007,
Seckel settled a libel lawsuit against a man who'd edited his Wiki-
pedia page. Years later, Oppenheimer spoke with Seckel’s lawyer,
Nicholas Hornberger.

“Hornberger confirmed that he'd reached a settlement for the
case, a favorable one,” the journalist wrote. “Hornberger added
that Seckel has still not paid him for his services.”

He also interviewed Seckel’s wife, Isabel Maxwell.

Aland Isabel met on a blind date and married in Malibu in or
“sround” 2007 (“I don’t keep the dates in my head,” Seckel

explained). A few years later, they moved to the South of France, 7
where Seckel continued to trade in rare books and papers. While

traveling on Epstein’s plane on numerous occasions between 2002 and 2005. See Flight logs
attached hereto as Exhibit “MM.” Clinton traveled on many of those flights with Ghislaine
Maxwell, Sarah Kellen, and Adriana Mucinska, - all employees and/or co-conspirators of
Epstein’s that were closely connected to Epstein’s child exploitation and sexual abuse. The
documents clearly show that Clinton frequently flew with Epstein aboard his plane, then
suddenly stopped - raising the suspicion that the friendship abruptly ended, perhaps because of
events related to Epstein’s sexual abuse of children. Epstein’s personal phone directory from his
computer contains e-mail addresses for Clinton along with 21 phone numbers for him, including
those for his assistant (Doug Band), his schedulers, and what appear to be Clinton’s personal
numbers. This information certainly leads one to believe that Clinton might well be a source of
relevant information and efforts to obtain discovery from him were reasonably calculated to lead
to admissible evidence. See Exhibits “B”, “F” “AA”, “DD”, and “MM” and Edwards Affidavit,

in legal and diplomatic terms, null and void. The package Arafat had ultimately
rejected had not even been presented by me. It was an American proposal. Besides,
it was obvious no serious negotiations were going to happen anyway for the
foreseeable future. Arik, however, said he wanted not just a “full divorce” from
Camp David. He insisted we formally declare an end to the entire Oslo process.

I told him that was a price I was not prepared to pay for his support. Despite the
failure of the summit, and the terrible human cost from Arafat’s choice of violence
over diplomacy, there was a wide international recognition that it was the
Palestinians, not Israel, who were responsible. For us to end the Oslo process
meant inviting accusations we’d never intended to reach a peace agreement in the
first place, and that it was /srae/ that was closing the door. We would also risk
forfeiting the American support we’d secured by our efforts to reach a peace deal,
an asset all Israeli governments would benefit from in other circumstances and
contexts in the future.

Fortunately, I had an alternative to a coalition with the Likud. Alarmed at the
prospect of a having Sharon in the government, the Oslo-era doves in Labor, led by
Yossi Beilin, worked out a new deal with Shas. The Sephardi Orthodox party was
still not prepared to rejoin the cabinet, but it did promise a “safety net” in the
Knesset to ensure we would not have to worry about no-confidence votes while
confronting the Palestinian violence. I knew Shas’s support would waver if there
was a resumption of serious peace negotiations. Still, as Clinton continued to insist
we make one final attempt to get a deal, I felt we had a responsibility to play our
part. I wasn’t prepared to put us in the position of appearing to stoneweall his
efforts, and encourage the false narrative that Israeli “intransigence” was somehow
frustrating Arafat’s readiness to make peace.

The Palestinian campaign of violence was getting worse. An Islamic Jihad car
bomb near Mahaneh Yehudah market in Jerusalem injured nearly a dozen people
and left two dead. Hamas blew up a school bus in one of the Gaza settlements,
killing two more people. In Hadera, halfway up the coast from Tel Aviv to Haifa, a
car bomb on a main street left two people dead and more than 60 injured.
Palestinian snipers from near Bethlehem began opening fire on Gilo, one of the
post-1967 Jewish suburbs of Jerusalem, and home to more than 30,000 people. Yet
despite all this, | authorized Shlomo Ben-Ami, Gili Sher, Amnon Lipkin and Yossi
Ginossar to continue talks with Palestinian negotiators on the terms of the
President’s last-ditch peace proposal.

and would have shown how he could provide potential protec-
tion from Epstein. That never happened.

39. Getting a call from this supposed FBI agent made me
scared all over again. I had left the old life of sexual slavery
behind me and started a new life in a new country in hopes
that the powerful people whose illegal activities I knew all
about would never find me.

40. Shortly after this purported FBI call, I was contacted
by telephone by someone who appeared clearly to be working
for Epstein. The caller told me about an investigation into.
Epstein and said that some of the girls being questioned were
saying that Epstein had had sexual contact with them. After
they made these allegations, the man said they were being
discredited as drug addicts and prostitutes, but in my case, if
L were to keep quiet, I would “be looked after.” The fact that
this call was made shortly after the supposed FBI call rein-
for[c]ed my concern that the man I had talked to earlier was
not really working for the FBI but for Epstein. I didn’t think
that the FBI and Epstein would both be working together and
would both get my phone number at almost exactly the same
time. I played along and told this person that I had gotten a
call from the “FBI” but that I didn’t tell him anything. The
person on the phone was pleased to hear [that].

4]. A short time later, one of Epstein’s lawyers (not Alan
Dershowitz) called me, and then got Epstein on the line at
the same time. Epstein and his lawyer basically asked again
if I was going to say anything. The clear implication was that
I should not. The way they were talking to me, I was afraid of

what would happen if I didn’t keep quiet. My thought was

When I learned what was happening, I told my negotiators they were not to
hold any further formal meetings during the four days Clinton would be away.
Dennis’s initial response was frustration. Madeleine Albrights’s was fury. They
both made no secret of their view that I was needlessly stonewalling. It wasn’t until
a few hours later that Madeleine apparently saw the stenographer’s record of my
conversation with the President before he’d left, confirming the condition that
Arafat accept the “pocket” at least as a basis on which to proceed. That evening,
she apologized to me for the misunderstanding, and explained the mix-up to the
full Palestinian and Israeli negotiating teams.

I spent most of the remaining three days in my cabin or, when the rain relented,
walking through the woods. The Americans appeared to think I was sulking. I
wasn’t. I was trying to find the least diplomatically damaging way to navigate the
period until the President’s return. I couldn’t see showing up at Laurel at every
mealtime, mingling and joking with the Americans and Palestinians, but refusing
to enter into any form of negotiations. That would compound the awkwardness of
the situation, and also be a direct affront to Madeleine. I liked and respected her.
But I could not in good conscience help her out in her efforts to find at least some,
informal, way of moving the summit along in Clinton’s absence. If Arafat had
failed to show even a scintilla of movement with the President in the room, I knew
there was no way that he was going to do so with the Secretary of State. For the
Palestinian negotiators, who were predictably in favour of her efforts, the
definition of “new ideas” was whatever further movement they might cajole out of
our negotiators. Still, on day-three of Clinton’s absence, I got a note saying that
Secretary Albright was on her way to my cabin. I didn’t want the needless
diplomatic difficulty involved in again telling her I could not sanction free-
wheeling, and decidedly one-sided, negotiations while Arafat hadn’t moved a
single inch. So I made myself scarce. Fortunately, I was wearing sneakers. I told
Danny to inform the Americans I was out jogging around the perimeter of the large
Camp David estate, and went off to do just that.

I told my own delegation I was taking time out to assess where we stood. I did
continue meeting with Gili Sher and Danny Yatom. Yet for much of time, I read. I
also did a lot of thinking. I considered the “pocket” concessions I’d agreed to, the
uncertainties and risks I’d been prepared to run, and the need to decide how to deal
with the fact that Arafat, when he had engaged at all, had said “no”.

Because of so much deliberate delay, Allawi recently announced that
he was no longer interested in the offer, and that he too would back

If that happens, there is no telling what kind of vacuum will emerge
in [Iraq and who will fill it, especially as Arab countries have too
much on their plate at this stage to focus on Iraq.

Theoretically, with Saudi Arabia focused on the situation in Bahrain
and Syria occupied by internal problems, the only country willing
and able to do the job is Iran. All eyes are now focused on Iraqi
Kurdistan President Masoud al-Barazani, who has said he will launch
a new initiative to bridge the gap between Maliki and Allawi.

A 15-man committee has been formed to conduct shuttle diplomacy
between the two leaders, under the auspices of Barazani, and to date
they have made no contacts with any of the Arab countries

Indicting a President Is Not Foreclosed: The 
Complex History 
Can a sitting president be indicted? Often, in answering this question, commentators point to 
Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinions answering in the contrary. To whatever extent the 
writer agrees or disagrees with the opinions' conclusion, the government's position on the 
matter is usually presented as a long-standing and clear no. 
The reality is more complicated. The United States has addressed this question six times in 
both internal memos and briefs filed in litigation. And a review of these documents shows 
that it is far from clear what criminal prosecution steps are (or should be) precluded___and 
that there is no longstanding policy against indictment of the president. Consider the 1973 
OLC memo stating that a sitting president should not be indicted. Far from being 
authoritative, it was essentially repudiated within months by the Justice Department in the 
United States' filing in the Supreme Court in United States v. Nixon. 
Likewise, the most recent opinion___an OLC memo written in 2000___includes brief 
statements that a sitting president should not be indicted even if all further proceedings are 
postponed. But far from being definitive, this is a matter that could be reconsidered by the 
department. Moreover, of course, OLC opinions are not binding on state prosecutors (though 
state charges could raise federalism questions as well). The complex history of criminal 
proceedings against presidents and vice presidents suggests that these issues are not 
foreclosed. 
Perhaps the most important point that emerges from a review of all the opinions is this: nly 
once has the United States addressed the question of whether a president can be an 
unindicted co-conspirator. The conclusion was an unequivocal yes. Richard Nixon was so 
named in the Watergate indictment, and that inclusion was sustained by Judge John Sirica 
and defended by the United States in United States v. Nixon. (The Supreme Court did not 
resolve the question.) No department opinion or filing has ever contradicted that position. 
The fact that it is permissible to name a sitting president as unindicted co-conspirator, 
moreover, tends significantly to undermine the only argument against indicting a sitting 
president. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030200 
(I should note that the U.S. Attorney's manual cautions against naming persons as 
unindicted co-conspirators [in the absence of some significant justification. Here, of 
course, the significant justification would exist if a sitting president is the only individual 
in the country who is immune from indictment. Thus, for that individual alone, the usual 
better course of indictment would not be available.) 
Here I want to review each of the half-dozen times that the executive branch has addressed 
the question of whether a president can be prosecuted, indicted or included as an unindicted 
co-conspirator. The opinions that conclude that a president cannot be indicted deal mainly 
with the question of whether a president can be put on trial. While the discussions of the 
option of indicting but postponing trial are more than a mere afterthought, that option was 
not the focus of the opinions and received scant analysis.

The Oct. 16, 2000, OLC memorandum  
These documents are worth review not only for their value as precedent but also for the 
extensive argumentation they contain on the pertinent issues. 
1. The Sept. 24, 1973, OLC Dixon Memo. This memo, signed by the head of the Office of 
Legal Counsel, Robert Dixon, is a procedural anomaly: It was not addressed to any official 
and may not have been made public at the time. It was not mentioned in the submission by 
the solicitor general two weeks later in the In re Agnew case. 
Dixon noted that there was no express provision of the Constitution conferring any 
immunity upon the president. The proper approach he wrote, is to find the proper balance 
between the normal functions of the courts and the special responsibilities ... of the 
Presidency. He concluded that criminal proceedings against a President in office should 
not go beyond a point where they could result in so serious a physical interference with the 
President's performance of his official duties that it would amount to an incapacitation. 
Thus, a necessity to defend a criminal trial and to attend court ... would interfere with the 
President's unique official duties. 
Finally, Dixon addressed a possibility not yet mentioned: that a sitting president could be 
indicted but further proceedings could be deferred until he was no longer in office. Unlike 
placing a president on trial, this would not result in a physical interference with the 
president's duties. Nevertheless, the memo concludes that this step should not be taken 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030201 
because of the reputational damage to the president: The spectacle of an indicted President 
still trying to serve as Chief Executive boggles the imagination. 
Of particular interest is the memo's consideration of whether criminal proceedings against a 
vice president are precluded. OLC found this to be a difficult question before concluding 
that a grand jury could indict the vice president. The memo notes that Vice President Spiro 
Agnew was said to be part of a conspiracy and that it would be difficult to have a proper 
indictment of co-conspirators without including the vice president (a point also true of a 
conspiracy involving a president). Moreover, 
Another circumstance counselling prompt presentation of evidence to the grand jury is that 
the statute of limitations is about to bar prosecution of the alleged offenders with respect to 
some or all of the offenses. The problem presented by the statute of limitations would be 
avoided by an indictment within the statutorily specified period. 
(The issue of statute of limitations arises as well in cases involving a president.) 
The Dixon memo concludes that [a]fter indictment, the question of whether the 
Government should ... delay prosecution until the expiration of the Vice President's duties 
involves questions of trial strategy beyond OLC's expertise. 
The conclusion that the sitting president should not be indicted was not necessarily a 
categorical constitutional-judgment conclusion but seems, rather, to be a balance of policy 
considerations. That, it appears, is how it was read by the office of Special Prosecutor Leon 
Jaworski___as I will describe below. 
2. The Oct. 5, 1973, Brief for the United States in In re Agnew. Lawyers for Vice 
President Spiro T. Agnew argued that if a president could not be indicted while in office, 
that same immunity should apply to a serving vice president. The vice president should have 
the same immunity as the president, they wrote, because he must maintain himself in a state 
of constant preparation to replace the president. And as the official with responsibility for 
initiating the 25th Amendment removal process, he must continuously ... monitor the 
ability of the President to discharge his duties. These responsibilities, they argued, were 
incompatible with being a defendant in a criminal case. Agnew's civil action, moreover, 
sought to enjoin the grand jury from even conducting any investigation into the allegations 
against Agnew as well as precluding issuing any indictment. 
The United States, in a response filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by 
Solicitor General Robert Bork, opposed any immunity from criminal process for a vice 
president. The solicitor general did inform the court, however, that if the grand jury were to 
return an indictment, the Department of Justice will hold the proceedings in abeyance for a 
reasonable time, if the Vice President consents to a delay, in order to offer the House of 
Representatives an opportunity to consider the desirability of impeachment proceedings. 
What was critical, according to Bork, was this: The issuance of an indictment ... would in 
the meantime toll the statute of limitations and preserve the matter for subsequent judicial 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030202 
resolution. The memorandum concluded that while the demands of the presidency preclude 
subjecting the chief executive to criminal process, no such importance attaches to the office 
of the vice president. 
Because Agnew pleaded no contest to an indictment in a negotiated agreement, there was no 
resolution of his claim of immunity from indictment. Although the charges had been serious 
(Agnew was said to have accepted containers of cash in the White House), he was allowed 
to plead to a single count and serve no prison time, essentially in exchange for his 
resignation from the vice presidency___an outcome that may not have been possible had 
Agnew not been susceptible to indictment. 
3. The Feb. 12, 1974, Memorandum to Independent Counsel Leon Jaworski. The 
attorneys in the Office of Watergate Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski concluded that there 
was no legal bar to indicting a sitting president and that the office should recommend either 
that the grand jury indict President Nixon or that criminal charges against him be 
incorporated into a formal grand jury presentment. Jaworski concluded that the best course, 
with impeachment proceedings in the offing, was to include Nixon as an unindicted co-
conspirator in the indictment of the other Watergate defendants. 
The memo notes at the outset that 
As we understand it, the conclusions regarding indictment of an incumbent President 
reached by the Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorney's office, and this office, are all 
consistent: there is nothing in the language or legislative history of the Constitution that 
bars indictment of a sitting president, but there are a number of 'policy' factors that weigh 
heavily against it. 
The memo finds those policy considerations offset by competing considerations. 
For us or the grand jury to shirk from an appropriate expression of our honest assessment of 
the evidence of the President's guilt would not only be a departure from our responsibilities 
but a dangerous precedent damaging to the rule of law. 
In deciding whether to indict a sitting president, they asserted, any considerations of a 
political nature should be left to Congress, which can decide if it wishes to immunize a 
president from prosecution. The special prosecutor's office did conclude, however, that the 
quantum of proof required to support an indictment of a sitting president should be quite 
high: the evidence of the President's guilt should be direct, clear, and compelling and ... 
admit of no misinterpretation. 
Some of Jaworski '5 team thought that President Nixon should be indicted. Others favored 
proceeding by a presentment, which would set out in detail the most important evidence 
and the Grand Jury's conclusion that the President has violated certain criminal statutes and 
would have been indicted were he not President. The office concluded that there appears 
to be no question of the propriety or legality of such a course.... The memo noted that 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030203 
having the grand jury actually name the specific indictable crimes for which there was clear 
evidence of guilt was important: This fundamental conclusion [of criminal guilt] should not 
be allowed to be lost in a recitation of facts or sources of evidence that omits the basic 
judgment involved or leaves it open to public (and Congressional) speculation and debate. 
The memo also noted that the president could be named an unindicted co-conspirator in the 
indictment of the other conspirators, the course ultimately chosen by Jaworski. 
4. The June 21, 1974, Reply Brief for the United States in US v. Nixon. The U.S. District 
Court for the District of Columbia refused Nixon's motion to expunge his inclusion as an 
unindicted co-conspirator in the Watergate indictment. Nixon asked the Supreme Court to 
reverse that decision. His lawyers argued that since a sitting president could not be indicted, 
neither should he be implicated as an unindicted co-conspirator. 
In this filing on behalf of the United States, Jaworski rejected Nixon's premise that a 
president could not be indicted, stating that It is an open and substantial question whether 
an incumbent President is subject to indictment. The brief argues for indictability before 
concluding that it is unnecessary to decide that question in order to resolve whether to permit 
his inclusion as an unindicted co-conspirator. 
(Despite the filing's origin in Jaworski's office, it would be a mistake to argue that this filing 
was not in some sense the position of the Department of Justice. Leon Jaworski and his 
attorneys were officers of the Department of Justice assigned by the attorney general the 
responsibility for advancing the legal positions of the United States, including in 
representations to the U.S. Supreme Court.) 
The Jaworski filing notes how critical it is to identify the president as one of the criminal 
accused: the identification of each co-conspirator___regardless of station____is a 
prerequisite to making his declarations in furtherance of the conspiracy admissible against 
the other conspirators. 
Although the brief concludes that it is by no means clear that a President is immune from 
indictment during his term, the special prosecutor chose not to indict the sitting president 
on the basis of practical arguments. Those arguments, however, 
cannot fairly be stretched to confer immunity on the President from being identified as an 
unindicted co-conspirator, when it is necessary to do so in connection with criminal 
proceedings against persons unquestionably liable to indictment. 
Naming the president as an unindicted co-conspirator was necessary for the grand jury to 
return a true bill, Jaworski argued, and required here to outline the full range of the 
alleged conspiracy. There exists, moreover, a legitimate public purpose in reporting the 
fact that serious criminal charges against a government official have been made. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030204

The mere fact that an official has a personal immunity from prosecution does not bar the 
prosecution from alleging and proving his complicity as part of a case against persons who 
have no such immunity. 
It would not be fair to the defendants ... to blunt the sweep of the evidence artificially by 
excluding one person, however prominent and important, while identifying all others. The 
Jaworski filing acknowledged that naming an incumbent president as an unindicted criminal 
co-conspirator may cause the public anguish of a cloud over the presidency. But in the 
public marketplace of ideas there is little reason to fear that malicious charges against a 
president will receive credit they do not deserve. 
Notably, the United States made no mention of the OLC Dixon memo in its filing in the 
Supreme Court other than by implication: The filing says that the Department of Justice 
agrees that the Constitution does not bar indictment of a president, perhaps reading the 
Dixon OLC memo as merely a statement of policy. What is striking is that the 2000 OLC 
memo treats the 1973 Dixon memo as an important precedent but not the more substantial, 
more careful subsequent filing in the U.S. Supreme Court. 
The Supreme Court did not answer Nixon's request to expunge his inclusion as an 
unindicted co-conspirator. Finding it unnecessary to answer that question in order to rule 
against the president on the subpoena of the nine tapes, the court dismissed Nixon's 
companion cert petition as improvidently granted. Nixon's resignation and pardon rendered 
the remaining questions moot. 
5. The May 13, 1998, Memorandum to Independent Counsel Starr. This memorandum 
was written by professor Ronald Rotunda in response to an inquiry from Independent 
Counsel Kenneth Starr. Rotunda concluded that 
In the circumstances of this case, President Clinton is subject to indictment and criminal 
prosecution, although it may be the case that he could not be imprisoned ... until after he 
leaves that office. 
The Rotunda memo is the least persuasive of the opinions in question. First, its status is 
unclear. It says that the question was posed by Starr, but it does not note whether Rotunda, 
who may have been a paid consultant, had any official governmental role. There is no 
indication that the opinion underwent any review by other officials. 
The opinion seems to claim too much, in my view, by suggesting that a president could be 
not only indicted but actually put on trial while serving. (Rotunda does not even rule out 
imprisoning a president.) There is an informal and partisan flavor to the memo that makes it 
less serious than the other arguments put forth by the department. 
Rotunda argues that the then-existing Independent Counsel Act contemplated that a 
president could be investigated and questioned, so therefore it must follow that he can be 
indicted. This is the obverse of the current argument made by some that since a president 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030205 
can't be indicted, he can't be questioned. Both positions are based on category mistake. No 
one has ever seriously suggested that a president can never be indicted. The only debate is 
whether any indictment of a president must be postponed until he is no longer in office. 
Since any president can indisputably be indicted when no longer in office, there is no 
permanent immunity that would obviate questioning of a president. 
6. The 2000 OLC Memorandum. This opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel, signed by 
Assistant Attorney General Randolph Moss, is a thorough and thoughtful analysis of 
whether a president can be indicted and prosecuted while serving in office. It appears to 
have originally been drafted during the time of the Starr investigation of President Bill 
Clinton. The case against putting a president on trial is fully convincing to me. What is not 
so clear, however, is whether there is sound basis for withholding an indictment of a 
president even if any trial proceedings must await the end of his term. Like the Dixon memo, 
the 2000 opinion set out several obstacles to trying a president. None of those reasons, save 
one, applies to naming a president in an indictment. 
The 2000 opinion gives so little thought to the possibility of indicting-and-postponing that it 
gives only one reason why such a course should be precluded: the idea that including the 
president in an indictment would cast a cloud over the presidency. The notion that 
reputational harm alone should preclude a normal part of the system of justice seems 
incompatible with the Supreme Court's decision in Clinton v. Jones, in which the court set 
such a high bar for any presidential immunity from the normal process of litigation that not a 
single justice found that actually undergoing a civil trial was precluded. 
It is hard to square mere reputational harm as a basis for precluding indictment when the 
government seems to have established that a president can be listed as an unindicted co-
conspirator. The reputational difference between being named as an unindicted co-
conspirator in a criminal indictment and being listed as one of those indicted seems 
relatively small. The essential difference: naming one as indicted prevents the statute of 
limitations from expiring. Why, for a small reputational difference, would one choose to 
make being in the White House a basis for permanently precluding (by operation of the 
statute of limitations) an otherwise warranted criminal prosecution? 
One aspect of the 2000 memo is worth noting. It appears to have been drafted with the case 
against President Clinton in mind. That was essentially a one-defendant matter. Thus, the 
opinion does not grapple with the significant obstacles to trying a multi-defendant criminal 
conspiracy while excluding from the charging document any reference to one of the 
conspirators___and perhaps a key conspirator. 
For an extended argument that the terms of Robert Mueller's appointment and practice of 
the Office of Legal Counsel do not require him to conform to the 2000 OLC position 
opinion rejecting the option of indicting and postponing, see Andrew Crespo's analysis. In 
addition to Crespo's analysis, I would add that the 2000 memo gives only scant attention to 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030206 
the possible course I believe deserves most consideration when a sitting president has been 
found to have committed a crime: indict-and-postpone. While I would not call the few 
mentions of that possibility mere dicta, I believe the scant discussion of the point should 
not preclude an independent judgment by subsequent officials. The notion that such a course 
would cause reputational harm___though it would not physically interfere with the 
president's attention to his duties___seems to be a point of policy, not constitutional law. For 
a helpful analysis of this question, see Bob Bauer's posting. 
In any event, OLC has never suggested that a president cannot be an unindicted co-
conspirator. 
Conclusions 
The history of positions taken by the executive branch of the United States on the indictment 
of a sitting president is more varied and complex than is generally assumed. For that reason, 
whether or not a president can be indicted or named as an unindicted co-conspirator should 
not be considered a settled question. 
I am convinced that putting a president on trial would be inconsistent with the Article II 
responsibilities of the modern presidency. Others___Larry Tribe included___are less certain 
and also point to the 25th Amendment, arguing that if being on trial or incarcerated 
precluded a president from being able to perform his duties, the 25th Amendment provides a 
theoretical if impractical avenue for the vice president to take over in successive 21-day 
increments during that time. I see the point, but I believe that approach could too easily set 
aside the determination of the electorate. People vote for a president, not a vice president. It 
would be no small matter, for example, to have had Sarah PalM step in for John McCain. 
If a guilty president is not to be indicted, he or she should in any event be included in the 
charging instrument as an unindicted co-conspirator, an option that has been expressly 
defended by the United States before the Supreme Court. And once it has been established 
that a president can be an unindicted co-conspirator, the case for categorically precluding 
indictment of a president is significantly weakened. 
I have argued previously that there should be no categorical bar to the indictment of a sitting 
president. Clinton v. Jones establishes that a president has a substantial burden of showing 
that normal processes of litigation are incompatible with his duties___and while that showing 
can be made for an actual criminal trial, it is difficult to make such a showing for naming a 
president in a grand jury indictment as long as trial proceedings are postponed until a 
president is no longer in office. 
What, then, is the argument against indictment? Perhaps it casts a greater cloud. On the other 
hand, the most important reason for issuing an indictment, rather than merely naming the 
president as unindicted co-conspirator, is to prevent the statute of limitations from expiring. 
This, in my view, is an important consideration. Indeed, a president might seek reelection 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030207 
just to make sure the limitations period runs on all his or her crimes while he or she remains 
in office. 
But concluding that a president can be indicted does not mean that he or she should be 
indicted, even if that would be called for by the normal operation of the criminal process. 
Awaiting action by the House of Representatives may in some circumstances be the prudent 
course___though one might question whether it is appropriate to weigh that institutional 
factor variously depending on how realistic it is that a particular House and Senate would 
take their responsibilities seriously. 
Some offenses might be seen as better suited for initial consideration by Congress in the 
impeachment process. Whether an exercise of executive authority___such as discharging an 
official or pardoning someone for an allegedly corrupt reason___should be grounds for 
sanction might be seen as requiring an essential political judgment, perhaps best suited for 
elected officials to make. On the other hand, the regular processes of the federal criminal 
system might be a better forum for an alleged complex multi-defendant financial conspiracy 
including money laundering, bank fraud, tax evasion, etc. In short, context matters for a 
special counsel or other prosecutor considering how best to proceed. 
There is good reason to have the judiciary decide the question of whether an indictment of a 
sitting president is categorically barred. This is especially the case now that the decision 
process would in significant part be based upon an interpretation of a Supreme Court 
decision, Clinton v. Jones. If a prosecutor included the president in an indictment, the 
president would no doubt move to have his or her name stricken. The first question a judge 
should ask is, If I strike the president from the indictment, will he or she agree to waive any 
defense of the statute of limitations that may expire while he or she is in office? If the 
president refuses to waive the statute of limitations, that itself would be a good reason for 
permitting the indictment, while postponing any further proceedings. 
It is impossible to predict whether a prosecutor would ask the attorney general for 
authorization to indict____or to make the president an unindicted co-conspirator___without 
knowing the degree and nature of any criminality that might be uncovered, and how 
including or not including the president in an indictment would affect the trial of other 
conspirators. But the possibility of including the president in an indictment is not 
categorically foreclosed.

time. The local population had, after all, been under other occupation powers
before 1967: Jordan in the West Bank, and Egypt in Gaza. Assuming our
administration was less onerous, most Israelis believed a way to coexist could
be found. And that sooner or later, there would be a land-for-peace agreement
and we would withdraw from at least most of the territory. But as the years
passed, with no sign of a willingness by the PLO to consider any kind of peace
talks, we made the cardinal error of assuming the occupation was sustainable.
Yes, there might be periods of violence, but nothing that a combination of
political resolve, arrests, detention and, where necessary, military force could
not hold in check. For us, and certainly for me, the Palestinians became
essentially a security issue. As one of Israel’s finest novelists, David Grossman,
would lay bare in a bestselling book of reportage called The Yellow Wind, about
a year into the intifada, we had ceased to see the human effects of 20 years of
occupation, not only on the Palestinians but on Israeli society as well.

Yet the power of Professor Shamir’s presentation lay not so much 1n its
novelty as its succinctness, clarity and, above all, its timing. The rioting had
already gone on for longer than any of us had expected. It seemed to be
gathering strength. But until our meeting, we were still looking at it essentially
as a civil disturbance. 7hat was what began to change, for all of us.

What didn’t change was the need to try to bring the violence to an end. Dan
immediately put me in charge of looking for alternatives to live ammunition. I
began with our own research and development engineers. We also asked military
attachés in our embassies to talk to law-enforcement agencies, academics, or
anyone else with knowledge of non-lethal methods of crowd control overseas.
Some of the more far-flung examples seemed promising, at least until further
investigation. South Korea had years of experience in confronting student
protests — generally, though not always, managing to avoid fatalities. But it
turned out this typically involved sending in serried rows of up to 25,000 riot
police against a few thousand campus protesters. Besides the fact we’d have
needed an army the size of the Americans’ to field enough soldiers, it was absurd
to imagine dealing with dozens of far-flung confrontations on any given day with
parade-ground formations of troops.

We looked at anything that seemed it might work. In the early stages, most
of the attacks involved rocks and bottles. Our R&D engineers developed a Jeep-
mounted “gravel gun” that fired stones at a distance of up to 250 feet. They
could cause injuries, but weren’t lethal. We acquired launchers for pepper spray

second, the creation of an opportunity for a court challenge through non-enforcement (e.g., Myers).

2) Appropriations Limitation for Rules Vetoed by Congress, 4B Op. O.L.C. 731 (1980): In this

opinion we rejected the constitutionality of a proposed legislative veto, prior to the Court's decision in
Chadha. We opined that [t]o regard this provision as legally binding would impair the Executive's
constitutional role and would constitute an abdication of the responsibility of the Executive Branch.
Id. at 734. It should be noted that the legislation in question was pending in Congress, and the
possibility that President Carter would sign the legislation did not affect our analysis of the
constitutional issue. We simply stated that, if enacted, the [legislative veto provision] will not have
any legal effect. Id.

3) Issues Raised by Section 102(c)(2) of H.R. 3792, 14 Op. O.L.C. 38 (1990) (preliminary print): This
opinion also addressed then-pending legislation, in this case the foreign relations authorization bill for

fiscal years 1990 and 1991. The opinion found that a provision of the bill was unconstitutional and
severable. Regarding non-execution, the opinion stated that at least in the context of legislation that
infringes the separation of powers, the President has the constitutional authority to refuse to enforce
unconstitutional laws. Id. at 53. The opinion concluded that “if the President chooses to sign H.R.
3792, he would be constitutionally authorized to decline to enforce the constitutionally objectionable

section. Id. at 38.

4) Issues Raised by Section 129 of Pub. L. No. 102-138 and Section 503 of Pub. L. No. 102-140, 16

Op. O.L.C. 18 (1992) (preliminary print): This opinion concluded that two statutory provisions that

limited the issuance of official and diplomatic passports were unconstitutional and were severable from

the remainder of the two statutes. On the question of non-execution, the opinion rejected the argument

that the President may not treat a statute as invalid prior to a judicial determination. Id. at 40. The
opinion concluded that the Constitution authorizes the President to refuse to enforce a law that he
believes is unconstitutional.

5) Memorandum for Bernard N. Nussbaum, Counsel to the President, from. Walter Dellinger, Assistant
Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel (Nov. 3, 1993): This opinion discusses different categories

of signing statements, including those construing bills to avoid constitutional problems and those in

which the President declares “that a provision of the bill before him is flatly unconstitutional, and that
he will refuse to enforce it. Id. at 3. The opinion concludes that such uses of Presidential signing
statements generally serve legitimate and defensible purposes. Id. at 7.

Presidential Signing Statements

Section of the Jones Merchant Marine Act of June 5, 1920, directing him to terminate treaty provisions
restricting the Government's right to impose discriminatory tonnage dues and tariff duties )I7A
Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents 8871 (Sept. 24, 1920) (Pres. Wilson): The

State Department announced that it has been informed by the President that he does not deem the

direction contained in Section 34 of the so-called Merchant Marine Act an exercise of any

constitutional power possessed by the Congress. Id. The statement also defended President Wilson's —

‘decision to sign the bill and noted that the fact that one section of the law involves elements of

illegality rendering the section inoperative need not affect the validity and operation of the Act as a
whole. 5.Green Haywood Hackworth, Digest of International Law 324 (1943).

Hi Larry,

Thank you very much for taking the meeting this morning. I’m glad you found it worthwhile, and I agree with
you that Adam Friedman’s commitment to the project is impressive.

I AM serious about working on this---it’s a nice opportunity to make important practical use of some
interesting theory. Voting rules may seem nerdy and dry, but they can make an enormous difference to actual
politics

The formal argument that RCV promotes centrism better than the current system (plurality rule) is
straightforward. Suppose that most voters vote ideologically in the sense that the closer a candidate is to their
own position on the left-right spectrum, the more like they are to vote for him. Then under majority rule (my
favorite voting system)---in which voters rank candidates and the winner is the candidate who beats all other in
pairwise comparisons----the winner will be the median voter’s favorite candidate ----- in other words, the most
centrist candidate gets elected (this assumes that there are enough candidates running so that there is one who
is reasonably close to the median voter). Now observe that RCV is in between majority rule and plurality rule,
and so will promote centrism better than plurality rule.

Best wishes, Eric

“We are excited because we think this is actually a problem we can

That’s rare. Development challenges and global conflicts often seem

these conflicts and issues and say, ‘O.K., that’s been solved,’” Hillary
says to me at the end of an interview, starting to chuckle. “Because
most of these problems are never solved.” Now she’s back in dutiful,
dogged mode, which happens to be the mode that best fits today’s
Hillary—the one almost everyone seems to like. “You know,” she
says, “you just keep working at them and working at them and

technologies. It is unclear how the United Kingdom’s Brexit plan will affect the stated
desire of the UK government to ensure that critical technologies do not fall into Chinese
hands.

For years, the Chinese telecom behemoth Huawei has provided broadband gear and
mobile networks to its clients in Britain, which include British Telecom and Vodafone.
And for years, Huawei executives used their substantial business opportunities in
Britain as an example to counter allegations in the United States and other Western
countries that Huawei was linked to the People’s Liberation Army and therefore a
security risk. Now it seems that Britain’s government is having second thoughts.
A government report issued in July 2018 noted that technical and supply-chain
issues with equipment made by Huawei have exposed Britain’s telecom networks
to new security risks.” Earlier in 2018, Britain’s cybersecurity watchdog warned
telecommunications companies against dealing with the Chinese manufacturer
ZTE, citing “potential risks” to national security.”° ZTE was involved in widespread
sanctions-busting in deals with Iran and North Korea.

Another area of growing concern is nuclear power. China General Nuclear Power
(GNP)—the main player in China’s nuclear industry—is considering the purchase of a
49 percent stake in the United Kingdom’s existing nuclear plants.” The nuclear power
giant has already taken a 33.5 percent stake in the Hinkley Point C power station,
which is being built with French technology. China experts in the United Kingdom
such as Isabel Hilton, the CEO of Chinadialogue.net, have observed that in opening
up its vital infrastructure to China, the United Kingdom was without parallel in the
Western world. “No other OECD country has done this. This is strategic infrastructure,
and China is a partner but not an ally in the security sense... . You are making a 50-year
bet, not only that there will be no dispute between the UK and China but also no
dispute between China and one of the UK’s allies. It makes no strategic sense.”*?

Responses to Interference Activities

In addition to some limited pushback on Chinese economic moves, there are signs
that the United Kingdom is slowly understanding the challenge presented by Chinese
influence activities. UK media have continued to report pressure on journalists, the
media, civil society, and those involved in politics. This reporting has been somewhat
effective in correcting perceptions of the nature and functioning of Chinese governance.
The media have also focused attention on how China monitors and obstructs the work
of foreign reporters in China.

The political system has also begun to respond to some influence activities. At the
domestic level, a parliamentary inquiry on the United Kingdom’s relations with China,

Last word

The insider with an outside view

STRATEGIST, BANKER AND AUTHOR HAS INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF CHINA — AND ITS LEADERS

By ANDREW MOODY
andrewmoody @chinadaily.com.cn

obert Lawrence Kuhn says
the West often doesn’t
understand the Chinese
leadership’s key priorities
for China. The 67-year-old American
is seen by many as one of the few
figures outside the world’s second-
largest economy who actually does.

He is regarded as a knowledgeable
insider, having been an adviser to
a number of leading Chinese bod-
ies since the late-1980s and knowing
many of the country’s top political
figures personally.

“There is rarely alignment between
what topics China’s leaders think are
important about China and what
the world thinks,” says Kuhn, also
an international corporate strate-
gist and investment banker. “Under-
standing China requires knowing the
difference.”

He was speaking recently in the
five-star Grand Hyatt hotel in central
Beijing, which is his home for 90 days
a year. The rest of the time he divides
between his three homes in the Unit-
ed States and traveling elsewhere.

“They treat me very well here.
Even when I travel around China, I
keep a room here,” he says.

The hotel is well placed near to
China’s seat of government around
Tian’anmen Square where he has an
extensive network of contacts.

His latest book, How China’s Lead-
ers Think: The Inside Story of China’s
Past, Current and Future Leaders,
which is now out in paperback and
more than 500 pages, goes into
extensive detail about those who
have the responsibility for shaping
modern China.

Kuhn, who cuts a dapper figure,
says many in the West often have an
outdated view about modern Chi-
nese leaders.

“The reality is that China’s leaders
are meritocratic,” he says.

“Many have strong academic back-
grounds from top universities and
all have significant experience, often
having run two or more provinces or
major municipalities as Party secre-
tary, governor or mayor.”

Kuhn, who is also a new China
Daily columnist, is much in demand
from major news organizations
around the world, including TV
appearances on BBC, CNBC, Eurone-
ws and Bloomberg TV, and says he
has had complete freedom to express
his opinions.

“T have written three books about
China, dozens of articles and col-
umns; I’ve produced two major TV
documentaries about China and
given scores of media interviews —
and never has anyone in China even
requested to censor anything I’ve
published or broadcast outside of
China,” he says.

Some in the West, however, have
accused him of being too much of an
insider and not giving the full picture
about China because he was too close
to the leadership.

Robert Lawrence Kuhn says China's growth is good for the world, but it cannot save the world.

“T deem it vital, considering Chi-
na’s importance in the world, that
China’s leaders become more known
to the world, and known not just via
sound-bites and photo ops, but by
seeing them up-close as real people
— hearing their own words, listen-
ing to their stories, getting their ways
of thinking. I’m pleased to facilitate
some of this,” he says.

“T also offer my own analysis. As
for my accuracy and understand-
ing, readers or viewers can judge for
themselves.”

Kuhn, who was born in New York,
began his career as a scientist. After
studying biology at John Hopkins
University, he did a doctorate in
anatomy and brain research at the
University of California at Los Ange-
les in the 1960s. Brain science and
consciousness remain major inter-
ests of his.

His first involvement in China was
through the scientific community in
the late-1980s when he worked with
scientists reforming China’s research
and technology base. He received an
invitation from Song Jian, then a
State councilor and chairman of the
State Science and Technology Com-
mission.

At the time he was developing a
parallel business career and became
president of The Geneva Companies,
a leading US mergers and acquisi-
tions company, which he eventually

sold to Citigroup in 2000.

At the same time he was cement-
ing links with leading business and
political figures in China.

His organization, The Kuhn Foun-
dation, with CCTV (China Central
Television), produced the documen-
tary In Search of China for PBS in the
US, which was broadcast in 2000.

He is now working on a new five-
part series China’s Challenges, which
will be broadcast in China in the
autumn and syndicated to PBS sta-
tions in the US next year.

Perhaps Kuhn’s most significant
project was writing a biography of
former president Jiang Zemin, which
was the best-selling book in China
in 2005.

How China’s Leaders Think was
based on interviews with more than
100 leading Chinese political figures,
some of whom he has known for
more than a decade.

“I know many personally and have
worked with several for a number of
years. When you hear them speak
over a period of time, it gives you
a sense of their personalities and
character as well as their intellec-
tual capabilities, leadership style and
political progress,” he says.

Kuhn sometimes likes to invoke
humor to explain why there is some-
times friction between Chinese and
American leaders.

“Some people think it is because

FENG YONGBIN / CHINA DAILY

of ideological, historical or cultural
reasons that we have communica-
tion problems. As I once pointed out,
perhaps it’s because China’s leaders,
the members of the Politburo Stand-
ing Committee, were trained as engi-
neers, and most American politicians
were trained as lawyers. Maybe the
problem is that lawyers and engi-
neers can’t talk to one another!”

Kuhn says the main focus in the
West is often the Chinese economy
and whether it will continue to
motor ahead.

“China should have 10 to 20 more
years of what we should still call rela-
tively high growth, driven by con-
tinuing the country’s unprecedented
urbanization and modernization.

“Growth rates will naturally ease
from reform’s historic averages —
probably to 6 to 8 percent per annum
— which is less than we are used to,
but which may be optimal because
China can more effectively deal with
its most severe problems, particu-
larly economic and social imbalances
and sustainable development.

“However, China’s economy is frag-
ile, vulnerable to exogenous shock.
China’s growth is good for the world,
but it cannot ‘save the world?” he
says.

Kuhn says there is often a dan-
ger of China being misrepresented
because it is seen through a narrow
perspective.

Twilight of the Gods, part 2: Can releases of strategic oil reserves keep oil prices down for more than a few weeks?
International Energy Agency member countries agreed to release strategic petroleum reserves to bring oil prices down. They

have a lot of ammunition to do so; government-controlled oil inventories are at least 1.5 billion barrels, and so far, all they have
done is authorize the release of 60 million barrels. The timeline suggests that oil markets began focusing on the release of the
SPR after the Libyan shutdown, the lack of a sufficient OPEC supply response, and weak economic data in the US. As shown
below, oil prices have been rising since the announcement of the supply increase. Are IEA members committed to doing it
again if oil prices reach their May levels?

indictment of Harvey Weinstein on rape charges, the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office has
continued to face criticism for failing to prosecute the Weinstein case aggressively enough. Id.
District Attorney Vance is an elected official who wields an immense amount of discretion over
prosecutions. The people of New York have the right to scrutinize how his office treated this
case involving a rich and well-connected sex offender, especially in light of allegations that other
notable sexual predators have benefitted from the apparent deference of prosecutors. To put it
bluntly, the appellate briefs should be released immediately to avoid any impression of
impropriety caused by continued secrecy.

There is also a strong interest in disclosing the appellate briefs to enable the public to
review for itself the arguments that led this Court to issue the Decision affirming Epstein’s status
as a level three sex offender. By ensuring public access to the courts and enabling public
discussion of the functioning of the judiciary, the news media help “the public to participate in
and serve as a check upon the judicial process — an essential component in our structure of self-
government.” Globe Newspaper Co., 457 U.S. at 606. As courts have recognized time and

high authority of the great Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. I have rarely heard it invoked in a
convincing, or even particularly relevant, way. But that, too, can claim lineage from the great
Holmes.

In the coming pages I will describe a series of pornography cases I have litigated. In several of
them, those advocating censorship have cited a state supreme court that held that “Holmes’
aphorism . . . applies with equal force to pornography.” Another court analogized “picketing . . .
in support of a secondary boycott” to shouting “Fire!” because in both instances “speech and
conduct are brigaded.”

A civil rights lawyer, in a New York Times op-ed piece, analogized a baseball player’s bigoted
statements about blacks, gays, and foreigners to shouting fire in a crowded theater. I responded
with my own op-ed, disputing the analogy. The Reverend Jerry Falwell, in arguing that the First
Amendment doesn’t protect a parody of him having drunken sex with his mother, invoked the
Holmes example: “Just as no person may scream ‘Fire!’ in a crowded theater when there is no
fire and find cover under the First Amendment, likewise, no sleazy merchant like Larry Flynt
should be able to use the First Amendment as an excuse for maliciously and dishonestly attacking
public figures, as he has so often done.” In the famous Skokie case, in which I supported the
right of neo-Nazis to march through a heavily Jewish Chicago suburb, one of the judges argued
that allowing Nazis to march through a city where a large number of Holocaust survivors live
‘just might fall into the same category as one’s ‘right’ to cry fire in a crowded theater.”*°

Some close analogies to shouting “Fire!” or setting off an alarm are, of course, available: calling
in a false bomb threat; dialing 911 and falsely describing an emergency; making a loud, gunlike
sound in the presence of the president; setting off a voice-activated sprinkler system by falsely
shouting “Fire!” (or any other word or sound). In one case in which the “Fire!” analogy was
directly to the point, a creative defendant tried to get around it. The case involved a man who
calmly advised an airline clerk that he was “only here to hijack the plane.” He was charged, in
effect, with shouting “Fire!” in a crowded theater, and his rejected defense — as quoted by the
court — was as follows: “If we built fire-proof theaters and let people know about this, then the
shouting of ‘Fire!’ would not cause panic.”

3° Outside court the analogies become even more absurdly stretched. A spokesperson for the New Jersey Sports
and Exposition Authority complained that newspaper reports to the effect that a large number of football players
had contracted cancer after playing in the Meadowlands— a stadium atop a landfill — were the “journalistic
equivalent of shouting fire in a crowded theater.” An insect researcher acknowledged that his prediction that a
certain amusement park might become roach infested “may be tantamount to shouting fire in a crowded theater.”
The philosopher Sidney Hook, in a letter to the New York Times bemoaning a Supreme Court decision that
required a plaintiff in a defamation action to prove that the offending statement was actually false, argued that the
First Amendment does not give the press carte blanche to accuse innocent persons “any more than the First
Amendment protects the right of someone falsely to shout fire in a crowded theater.”

V: Yes. Just a normal flight, an e-ticket.
JS: Like the rest of us common folk.
V: But when I was traveling with Jeffrey, the majority of the time would be on the black jet.

JS: | Now, when you say there would be times when you would travel by yourself because he
was sending you somewhere, tell me about that. How did that come about?

V: So, one of his colleagues would be at the Carribean or Santa Fe or even New York, or
wherever, and he would call me up on those days where I am not working with him or in
Palm Beach with him, and he would ask me to get on the next plane to so and so and go
meet so and so, and that’s when I would take e-tickets. His secretary or special assistant,
whatever, would organize it for me and give me the details and I would just walk up the
line and they’d let me right through.

JS: Can you give me any ideas as to how many times it happened that Jeffrey would send
you off to meet some friend of his at some location outside of Palm Beach?

V: How many times it happened? I’m not too sure. Probably about 10-15 times.

JS: | Ok. And on those occasions, how much time would you spend with one of Jeffrey’s
friends when you were sent to a location that you would have to travel to?

V: Only a couple of days. Only 2 days, that’s it.

JS: And how were you paid for those trips?

V: I would be paid in cash upon my arrival back with Jeffrey. So, whenever I was back with
Jeffrey, he would count up how many days I’ve had, sometimes give me even more than
what I deserved, not deserved, but what I earned and give me a little extra.

JS: Was there a daily rate for those trips or was that per massage also?

V: Per massage. With Jeffrey, I would be honest. I wouldn’t tell him I did 15 massages if I
didn’t. He knew he could trust me. He could always come back to the other person that
he sent me to give massages and ask them as well, so you know, it was always by per

massage.

JS: Alright. When we’ve been talking about massages, tell me exactly what it is we’re
talking about when we speak about massages.

V: Same thing I would do to Jeffrey. Again, it would start out as a massage, which would
start with them being naked, and me giving him a legitimate massage to begin with, so

years did I decide to actively pursue it.)

+ Swinging: Usually emphasizes couples with their own close bond, who have relatively
casual sex with other partners. (Another difference between swinging and polyamory is
that swingers tend to be more at home in mainstream culture, whereas polyamorists tend
to be geeky or otherwise alternative. The blog Polyamory In The News has a great, long
piece on poly culture vs. swing culture.)

+ Cheating: One partner does something with an outside partner that wasn't accepted or
understood in advance. In monogamous relationships, cheating usually involves having
sex with an outside partner. Cheating exists in polyamorous or swing relationships as
well: for example, a person might cheat on a non-monogamous partner by breaking an
agreement -- an agreement such as we don't have unprotected sex with other partners.”

Just in case it needs to be said: I never advocate cheating, ever. As for the first two, I
know both poly people and swingers that I consider totally decent and wonderful folks! I
have more personal experience with and interest in polyamory, though.

Yet one thing that often gets lost in conversations about all these options is the
advantages of monogamy. Of which there are many. Although I don't currently identify
as monogamous, I had a very strong monogamous preference for years. I knew that
polyamory existed, and I thought about it a lot, because it's interesting -- but I just didn't
feel like it was for me. (In fact, my most adamantly polyamorous friend used to call me
his reasonable monogamous friend. He said I had examined polyamory enough to
reasonably reject it, whereas he felt most people never consider polyamory deeply
enough to have a thoughtful opinion.)

And lately lots of my monogamous friends have been getting married. So I've been
thinking about the positive aspects of their relationship choices as I dance at their
weddings, devour mini-quiches, flirt with their brothers and try to avoid offending their
parents. (Okay, I've actually only flirted with one brother. So far.)

A Few Advantages of Monogamy (this is not a complete list)

+ Jealousy management. Some people experience jealousy more than, or less than, or
differently from other people. Plenty of people in non-monogamous relationships
experience jealousy -- and plenty of non-monogamous people handle it just fine, through
open-hearted communication. (Often, jealousy is managed through very detailed
relationship agreements such as a relationship contract.)

But there are also plenty of people who appear to lack the jealousy chip.

And then there are plenty of people who experience so much jealousy, who feel that
jealousy is such a big part of their emotional makeup, that the best way to manage it is
simply through monogamy.

Personally, I used to get a lot more jealous than I do now. I think I'm less likely to get
jealous these days partly because I've gotten better at finding low-drama men. Jealousy
has a reputation for being an irrational emotion, and sometimes it genuinely is an
unreasonable, cruel power-grab. But I think jealousy is often quite rational, and often

keep close ! 
This much we know - the Fall elections are shaping up to be a referendum on the most divisive 
American President in memory. The battle for potential Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh's 
nomination this fall will only amplify the polarity of the political debate that is already deeply 
overwrought on both sides. The rising tide of pressure on Donald Trump from the Mueller investigation 
shows no sign of ebbing. 
Unless the underlying political dynamics are disrupted, the outcomes of these unprecedented events will 
still leave us with the same unsatisfactory two front battlefield of the 2016 Presidential election. 
Watching these unrelenting, compounding events since our discussion in May, I am guessing we are all 
asking the same question: now what? For the 48 percent of Americans who believe Donald Trump 
should not be in the White House, perhaps we too want our own chaos candidate in 2020? 
Should Trump run again, this could be a break glass moment for the majority of Americans who don't 
support him. Do we want to break the genteel precedents of two parties running their ceremonious and 
seemingly illogical nominating process to select a candidate? (Why do Iowa and New Hampshire play 
such outsized roles? What kind of small-d democratic process relies on superdelegates?) The system 
failed in 2016, with both parties producing terribly flawed candidates in a race to the bottom. We need to 
build a back-up plan in the event the system fails again. 
It's possible, of course, that we won't need a third-party candidate. Trump could decide not to run for 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026304 
whatever reason. The Democrats could nominate a winning 2020 candidate. I am not willing to take 
those bets. 
The ideal candidate for a new third party is someone who is widely perceived to be that rare combination 
of both good and great. We are looking for a proven leader of men and women, someone with clear, 
democratic — and moral — values that reflect the best of America, not our worst. We know people like this 
on the national stage now. 
As a thought experiment, consider the possibilities of a ticket outside the partisan lanes and imagine the 
chemistry of radical combinations: Biden/Romney? Bill Gates/Hogan? Bloomberg/Haley? Howard 
Schultz/Bob Corker? Sandberg/Kasich? 
As we have discussed narrow path to electing the first president outside the two major party primary 
system in 168 years is more navigable than most think. Heading into 2020, converging trends in 
American's demands for a third party (a historic high of 61%), disapproval of Donald Trump holding 
steady above 50%, and the increasingly leftward drift of the Democratic Party suggest that electorate may 
be susceptible to merits of a new centrist party. Cynics will say that the structural impediments of ballot 
and presidential debate access, the overwhelming advantages of legacy parties' fundraising and voter 
turn-out operations preordain failure, but they're wrong; the legal and logistical hurdles are amenable to a 
combination of lawyering and resources. The bigger, more consequential factors come in terms of 
candidate quality and policy. I believe a candidate with five specific characteristics including a unique — 
and purposefully non-specific - policy agenda could limbo a win. 
• This is what I think a successful third-party candidate looks like; a dream third party ticket would 
start off with enough name ID to be an instant contender. Building the name ID to run nationally is 
just too long and expensive of a process to accomplish in the 28 months until the next presidential 
election. We can't beat a celebrity without some celebrity of our own, whether from politics, 
sports, business, or entertainment. Instantaneous name ID is so crucial because the candidate must 
start out in striking distance in any three-way poll against Trump and a fill-in-the-blank 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026305 
Democratic flavor-of-the day candidate. The media and political class will predetermine 
irrelevance otherwise. 
• A Democrat-leaning candidate would have to top the ideal third-party ticket. We need someone 
with a shot at snaking a plurality of the vote in the blue states Hillary Clinton won (227 electoral 
votes), but moderate enough to win a plurality in some combination of Trump states like Florida, 
Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan (another 119 votes). The right candidate may even to put 
North Carolina, Ohio, Indiana in play for a centrist bi-partisan ticket as well (totaling an electoral 
sweep of 464 elector votes). A right leaning candidate would meet the same fate as a primary 
challenger to Trump — for all intents and purposes we need to assume that 36% of voters won't be 
cleaved from Trump under any circumstances and run to win around them. The deep red states 
would be off the table entirely. 
• With the Trump reality show airing daily, voters are now expecting to take their politics with a side 
of entertainment. Heretofore, ratings will matter no matter how dry the policy topic. Surely 
Stephen Colbert would gladly sacrifice his executive producer Chris Licht to produce a daily 
comedic segment of this dream candidate interviewing Americans in truck stops and McDonald's 
across the country. A few of the Saturday Night Live script writers could certainly be enticed to 
disguise serious debates as informative amusement. Any candidate must be committed to a near 
daily cadence of high quality, compelling video production. It will be especially crucial to keep 
the voters' attention during what will be a raucous Democratic primary season. Rules governing 
access to the general election debate stage dictate that a candidate enjoy support of at least 15% of 
voters in the months leading up to the general election. 
• This dream candidate would pledge to serve only four years and address all of the U.S.'s ticking 
time bombs like Social Security, Medicare, health care reform, climate change, money in politics, 
gerrymandering, and infrastructure investment in a single term. This one-and-done term decouples 
our candidate from the usual politics and gives them the power of promise and deliver decisive 
action. A four-year term pledge ensures governance independent of campaign finance concerns and 
narrow special interests inherent to winning re-election. This fix-it ticket would promise to force 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026306 
decisions on all the underlying structural policy matters damaging America's long-term prospects 
and distorting our democracy. No more kicking the can down the road. 
• This candidate should also pledge to push for laws passed that reflect the will of simple majorities 
in Congress. Congress now only allows bills to move forward when a majority of a majority 
supports the policy and on many levels seems fundamentally broken. This third-party president 
could force votes based on a transparent reading of where the votes lie via coalition building. The 
Senate filibuster power will present a high hurdle, but a third-party candidate would be a de facto 
disruptor of the two-party system. Party discipline could well break down, and moderates in both 
parties could form a powerful, decisive block willing to work with the new President. The policies 
passed into law may not be ideal for either Democrats or Republicans, but for the major agenda 
items that must be addressed for America's long-term health, an imperfect fix that corrects course 
is better than those that now have us hurtling toward national bankruptcy. 
And if no candidate secures 270 electoral votes in 2020? The House of Representatives would choose the 
next president. In 2016, reports suggested Michael Bloomberg declined to run on a third-party ticket for 
fear of splitting support from Hillary Clinton and throwing the election to a GOP-controlled House of 
Representatives who would then vote to select the president. The fear was the GOP controlled House 
would have just elected Trump. 
Would Democratic control of the House mean that the House would pick an alternative to Trump as 
president? Each state delegation has a single vote in selecting a president and it is the incoming Congress 
- the class elected in 2020 that would decide the election. But no matter which party has the speaker's 
chair, the GOP would almost certainly have the upper hand in the majority of state delegations controlled. 
Would the state delegations pick a president based on party majority control of the delegation, the 
winner of the popular vote in each state or their own calculations as to who is best for America? 
Precedent suggests that delegations use secret ballots, which means individual lawmakers may vote their 
consciences. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026307 
If we recruit this ideal candidate; threading the needle of name ID, a center-left bent, a TV- savvy 
campaign team and a pledge to serve only four years with an apartisan agenda, money and campaign 
expertise would certainly follow. And 50 state ballot access is a function of time (starting in the fall of 
2019 would be prudential) and hard work as we have discussed and many of you have exhaustively war-
gamed. 
Part and parcel of this effort would be motivating the often politically lackadaisical middle to vote. The 
raft of new technologies in data targeting and biometric mobile voting technology could transform the 
electorate in the next few, amping voter participation and injecting the voices of moderates (both in 
political views and level of political interest) into the process. And any third-party effort must 
incorporate advocacy for accelerated adaption of these all but inevitable voter verification tools. I believe 
Silicon Valley could be game-changing allies in this effort. 
I am sure none of us doubt that chaos could potentially be unleashed by jamming three viable candidates 
into a two-party system. An election that ends up in the House of Representatives is an uncontrollable, 
murky and ancient process. But might that be a less scary prospect than relying on the Democrats to 
nominate a candidate who can beat Trump in 2020?

them to profit from new resources and advances. But globalization has also fragmented these countries
by giving them access to resources that corrupt, such as arms for guerrilla leaders and rogue armies. What
has changed in the twenty-first century, perhaps as early as the 1990s, is a new form of war, one that is
tied to the signature of evil and its expression as excessive harm. No longer are wars confined to state
borders, restricted to states and their legitimized militaries, financed by governments and tax revenues,
and focused on combatants. Instead, the new wars of the twenty-first century have entirely porous
boundaries, are funded by private organizations, run by grass-root groups, and motivated by the use of
horrific means to achieve equally horrific ends, including torture, rape, mutilation, and the use and abuse
of civilians, women, children and men alike. As a result, international law is effectively, ineffective.
Those running these new wars are outside of international law.

The consequence of the new wars extends beyond the travesties experienced by those living in
these hot spots to the humanitarian aid workers and journalists who attempt to help the victims.
Humanitarian aid is often pirated by rogue militias, and journalists are frequently killed or badly injured.
We must therefore face the sad reality that as we ended the twentieth-century and initiated the twenty-
first, casualties to non-combatant civilians shifted from few to many. We must face the reality that
combating evil will require new laws and new protections for those who risk their lives to aid victims and
give voice to their often silent suffering.

Evil ever after?

We won't eradicate evil. Why? Because the capacity for evil is rooted in human nature, born of a
promiscuous mind that enables ideas and feelings to flip between beneficial and toxic. Though we
institute programs and practices that promote the beneficial, living within every human mind is a toxic
neighbor, waiting to move in. Adhering to authorities is beneficial in that great leaders are energizing,
empowering, creative, and a source of guidance into a brighter future. But even great leaders can turn
toxic, imposing corrosive ideologies and eliminating basic human rights. Conformity is beneficial in that
we want to live in a society where norms are followed, providing stability and cooperation. But
conformity is toxic when it leads to blind faith and uncritical thinking. Dehumanization is beneficial in
allowing us to carry out medical procedures and live with certain kinds of human suffering. But
dehumanization is toxic when it facilitates ethnic cleansing by shrinking the moral circle, turning
atrocities into virtuous offerings. Tolerance and pluralism are beneficial in that they lead to respect and
concern for others’ attitudes and desires. But tolerance and pluralism are toxic when they breed apathy
and a willingness to stand by as passive bystanders.

My diagnosis of evil is not meant to be defeatist, but realist. It is only through an
acknowledgment of our biology and the environments it has created — and can create — that we can look
for solutions to ameliorate the human condition. We are all vulnerable to walking on the wrong side. We
are fallible. We are also enormously creative, capable of great change. Like no other species, we
relentlessly seek novelty. No one wants to be like his or her predecessor. Whether it is a new culinary
tradition, extreme sport, technological innovation, musical genre, or weapon of destruction, our search for
novelty is an indestructible component of human nature.

Our journey into the nature of evil has come to an end. Bombarded by the sheer magnitude of
lives lost or damaged beyond repair, it is natural to deaden our senses and choke our feelings in the hope
of finding solitude and peace. As painful as a re-awakening is, we must remember the individuals that
make up these massive atrocities. Reflecting upon the loss of his son who was murdered by the Lord's
Resistance Army, an 80 year old Ugandan chief summed it up— We have been forgotten. It’s as if we
don’t exist.

We must never forget. We must never deny our potential to cause horrific pain and suffering
while finding ways to forgive and express deep compassion. We must never give up on humanity.

Ashrams, faired little better. They seldom received a personal audience or favorable
seating at Darshan, the evening public time of question and answers with the guru.
In contrast with the relatively easy public availability, mischievous play, provocative
humor and worldly sophistication of Baba, the ambience of Gurumayi is more
private, simple, serious and subtle. It is as powerful, but in another way.

In response to Gurumayi’s ascension to Siddha Yoga’s singular guru, |
imagined hearing Baba saying that God energy was at least androgynous, if the
dimension of sexual identity was relevant at all. Baba taught that divine energy, by
necessity, is expressed through a wide variety of particular personalities and
cultures and should not be confused with the details of its manifestations. This
included the sexual identity of the chosen Vehicle. Guramayi’s central theme, as |
understand it, concerns the simple, quiet and pervasive powers of love and faith.
Some say Baba took the path, marga, of selfless action, karma-marga, whereas
Gurumayi took the bhakti-marga, the road of loving devotion and faith. The third
marga is jnana-marga, my inclination, is the road of intellectual study and
knowledge. Aldous Huxley related the choice among these three categories of yoga
practice, to the physical and personality types of William Sheldon’s 1954 Atlas of
Man. Karma yoga corresponded to the mesomorphic body type and the assertive
boldness, high energy, and interpersonal callousness of the somatotonic
personality. Bhakti Yoga was the characteristic choice of endomorphic body types
with the viscerotonic personality traits of sociability, good will, tolerance and love.
Huxley associated Jnana Yoga with ectomorphic body type and the cerebrotonic
characteristic of shyness, sensitivity and intellectuality.

My summers with Baba at his temporary Ashram in Venice, California and
the permanent American Ashram in South Fallsburg, New York, were spent in daily,
very early morning, chanting of the gurugita after most of the night spent taking
down, cleaning and putting up large tarpaulin meeting tents. | was assigned this
simple, arduously manual, all night work after being interviewed and found out to be
a professor and chairperson of a medical school department. Baba instructed his

assignment committee that many if not all professorial egos would benefit from what

Grand Beach Resort into 262 timeshare oriented condominium units. The first phase on this
project was completed in September 2015 and is open, while the second phase is currently
under construction.

e The University of the Virgin Islands has announced plans to develop a medical school on St.
Thomas, which will be operated in collaboration between the hospitals on St. Thomas and St.
Croix.

Conclusions

Economic conditions in the U.S. Virgin Islands appear to be slower to recover than many areas of the
region, particularly in St. Croix, where industrial development had previously been more of a focus
than tourism The closure of the Hovensa refinery and the failure to facilitate a sale to a buyer who can
re-open the facility as a refinery will continue to plague St. Croix until other new developments occur
that can create new jobs. The assets of the refinery were recently sold at auction, but operating
agreement with the USVI Government only states the buyers will use the oil storage portion in
addition to constructing an asphalt plant on the property, which projects to only 80 jobs created in the
immediate future. There appears to be ongoing resurgence in tourism for St. Thomas and St. John, and
real estate activity appears to be improving; however, many businesses — even those catering to cruise
ship passengers — continue to struggle. Our forecast is for continued improvement in arrivals and
hotel statistics, but only gradual economic improvement for the overall territory.

functions, with separate stockholders and only incidental interaction.

It is best for the free market to do this alone. The omnibus fund could be the decisive
innovation. It too is possible today. It would offer clients full competitive return, so
that no supply would be too large. It would match bank deposits in liquidity and
payment services with the low service charges typical of other index funds, while
tailoring risk and return to client needs with essentially costless derivatives. The

intention would be obsolescence of bank accounts, and devolution of banks in result.

Deposit-and-lend banks, inevitably leveraged at 10:1 or more, are the weak link
explaining economic collapses about once a generation since the system was
founded in the Renaissance. Misdeeds and misguesses and world events were only
the proximate cause. Chicanery will be with us forever. Honest bad judgment will be
with us forever. Supply shocks, as when OPEC raised oil prices in 1973, will be with
us forever. Wars will be with us forever. Setbacks for our trading partners will be
with us forever. These bring the high winds. I don’t foresee much payout in trying to

dial down the winds by upgrading human nature. The payout is in stabler structures.

The big bad wolf huffed and puffed, and the brick house stood. Omnibus funds will
carry no leverage. Accounts themselves will be levered to taste, but for short periods
only. Futures trade in seconds. The fund as a whole cannot become worthless until
each and every security in its portfolio does. High winds and leverage can wipe out
the accounts of risk-takers who chose the long leg, but not of those who opted for
contractual interest and safety. That’s as it should be. Risk-takers may name their

poison. Omnibus means for all, and all-inclusive.

Derivatives are central to the omnibus fund idea. Some see them as dangerous. They
can be. They are powerful. But they have a good track record of performing as

contracted. Cash reserves, called margins, have proved enough to escape default

the credibility of the allegations against him.

The parties believe it is time to take advantage of the new information that has come to
light on both sides during the litigation and put these matters behind them.

Given the events that have transpired since the filing of the documents in the federal
court and in this action in which Dershowitz was accused of sexual misconduct, including
the court order striking the allegations in the federal court filings, and the records and
other documents produced by the parties, Edwards and Cassell acknowledge that it was a
mistake to have filed sexual misconduct accusations against Dershowitz; and the sexual
misconduct accusations made in all public filings (including all exhibits) are hereby
withdrawn. Dershowitz also withdraws his accusations that Edwards and Cassell acted
unethically.

Neither Edwards, Cassell, nor Dershowitz have any intention of repeating the allegations
against one another.

We categorically disapprove the theory...that obscene, pornographic films acquire
constitutional immunity from state regulation simply because they are exhibited for
consenting adults only... The States have a long-recognized legitimate interest in the
quality of life and the total community environment, the tone of commerce in the great city
centers, and, possibly, the public safety itself.

But as I promised Judge Aldrich, I continued to press my principle in the court of public opinion
and in a series of other obscenity cases over the next several decades. Ultimately my view would
prevail, if not in law then certainly in practice, as we shall see. Chief Justice Burger may have
won in the courthouse, but we won in theaters and on television sets throughout the nation, as
sexually explicit films—far more explicit than J Am Curious Yellow—became pervasive and
“legal” in fact if not in law. This disparity between the law, as set down in theory by the Supreme
Court, and the law, as implemented in practice throughout the country, is an interesting story in
itself.

a year (or whatever the tuition was at that time) to attend Yale and he
damn well was going to see me. I did in fact see him because he had
a point.

Professors are hard to find. There are many reasons for this. The
first is that if no one makes them see undergraduates, so why should
they? The second is that from long experience most professors have
come to understand that when an undergraduate wants to see them,
there typically is one of two motives. Either the student wants to argue
about a grade he or she received, or wants to engage the professor in
a conversation whose point is that the undergraduate is really a great
guy or gal and will be counting on a recommendation down the road.
Neither of these conversations is any too fascinating to professors so
they usually make themselves hard to find.

The funny part of this story is that the student who was making
the fuss had neither of those issues. He was exactly the sort of student
professors very much want to see. He wanted to become a professor in
my field. This is exactly who a professor wants to meet with. The con-
versation with him didn’t start out about that exactly, but it was easy
to see that he had real issues he wanted to talk about, science issues,
the kind professors wish were on the mind of every undergraduate but
rarely are. This student did in fact become a professor, the ultimate suc-
cess story for the professor who guided him there. And, no surprise, he
treats undergraduates who want to see him the same way I treated him.

There is a naive conception on the part of students in a top univer-
sity that their needs matter to the professors of that university. But the
top universities are not structured in such a way as to reward professors
who care deeply about students. If a young assistant professor spends
too much time with undergraduates, there usually will be some wiser
head who will counsel him against this behavior. Assistant professors
must be concerned with getting tenure. Having the students like you
has next to nothing to do with tenure at the top universities.

No one higher up in the administration of the university cared
much about how much I taught. “Why not?” you wonder. To answer
this, one has to understand how universities really work, why they
work that way, what game they are playing, and who wins and who
loses. The answers to these questions, well known by anyone in a top
university, are, somehow, completely unknown to the general public.
Outsiders don’t ask how Yale works. They ask how they can get their
kids into Yale. And therein lies the problem.

described above on behalf of the Fund. Furthermore, each Partner will be required to provide
the Fund with any information necessary to allow the Fund to comply with its obligations to
make Section 754 adjustments and/or its obligations as an electing investment partnership.

Tax-Exempt U.S. Partners

Unrelated Business Taxable Income - Under the terms of the principal agreements relating to
the Fund, the General Partner will be required to use reasonable best efforts to conduct the
affairs of the Fund in a manner that does not cause any tax-exempt U.S. Partner to recognize
any “unrelated business taxable income” within the meaning of Section 512 of the Code;
provided, however, that the General Partner may cause the Fund to borrow on a short-term
basis and may guarantee the indebtedness of any portfolio company. The General Partner’s
undertaking will be deemed satisfied with respect to the making, holding or disposing of any
portfolio investment if the tax-exempt U.S. Partners are given the opportunity to (or if all
Limited Partners are otherwise required to) hold their proportionate shares of such portfolio
investment directly or indirectly through an alternative investment vehicle treated as a
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Notwithstanding this undertaking, it is
possible that the Fund could realize income which would constitute unrelated business taxable
income, and in that event each tax-exempt U.S. Partner would be subject to U.S. federal income
tax on its share of such income and may be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return with
respect to such income.

Taxable U.S. Partners

Limitations on Allowable Deductions - Under Section 67 of the Code, U.S. taxpayers who are
individuals may deduct certain miscellaneous expenses (e.g., investment advisory fees, tax
preparation fees, and unreimbursed employee expenses such as the cost of subscriptions to
professional journals) only to the extent that these deductions exceed, in the aggregate, 2% of
the taxpayer's adjusted gross income. Further, Section 68 of the Code disallows certain
deductions otherwise allowable to taxpayers who are individuals; the amount disallowed varies
based on the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income. Part or all of the Fund’s expenses allocated to
any U.S. Partner who is an individual (including that Partner’s share of the management fee
payable to the Fund’s Management Company) may be disallowed under these provisions,
although tax-exempt U.S. Partners will generally not be affected. Finally, certain expenses
(including the fees and expenses of placement agents, if any) incurred in connection with the
offer and sale of the Limited Partner Interests are not deductible by any U.S. Partner. If the
Management Company or an affiliate pays the fees or expenses of any placement agent, a
corresponding portion of the Fund’s expenses attributable to payments or accruals of the
management fee is likely to constitute a nondeductible syndication expense.

Surtax on Unearned Income - Section 1411 of the Code generally imposes a 3.8% surtax on the
“net investment income” of certain U.S. Partners who are citizens or resident aliens, and on the
undistributed “net investment income” of certain U.S. estates and trusts. Among other items,
“net investment income” generally would include a U.S. Partner’s allocable share of the Fund’s
net gains and certain other income such as interest and dividends, less deductions allocable to
such income. In addition, “net investment income” may include gain from the sale, exchange or
other taxable disposition of an interest in the Fund, less certain deductions. U.S. Partners

units, and they drew a kind of protective box of shellfire around Ira’s men as
they moved back. We sent our other reserve division towards the crossroads to
provide support, and Amram went with them to co-ordinate the operation. But
Ira still had to fight his way out. It was 15 minutes of hell. By the time he
reached safety at around nine in the morning, he’d lost ten tanks and nearly 20
men, four of them during the final, frantic retreat. Five more were missing. The
reserve division also found itself in a fierce firefight with the Syrians, and lost
eleven men.

We were now just three hours from the cease-fire. We did advance nearer to
the Beirut-Damascus road. An hour before noon, our dedicated anti-tank unit
destroyed 20 of Assad’s top-tier tanks, Soviet-made T-72s. Under different
circumstances, those successes might have been a cause for consolation. Yet it
was hard to dwell on them given what had happened north of Tovlano. After the
war, Sultan Yacoub created fertile ground for conspiracy theories, half-truths
and finger-pointing. That there had been many oversights and errors was clear,
though there was never a full and formal debriefing process to identify in detail
what had gone wrong. I found it deeply frustrating that, unlike in 1973 when I'd
been in a battlefield command role, I was now at several steps removed from
what was happening on the ground. But everyone involved shared responsibility
for the failures — including the overall commanders: Yanoush, and me as well.

That weight felt even heavier because the tragedy occurred only hours before
our own force’s involvement in the Lebanon War was over.

It was not, however, the end of the war. The cease-fire held only
intermittently in the rest of Lebanon, barely at all in some areas. Freed from
fighting in our sector, Yanoush, Amram and I began spending time with units
elsewhere. A couple of days after the cease-fire, I found myself alongside a pair
of generals, Uri Simchoni and Yossi Ben-Hannan, south of Beirut. In front of
us, troops from the Golani Brigade were completing their takeover of Beirut
airport. “You were right,” I told Uri and Yossi. They had been in charge of the
simulation exercise in the Airya, predicting how Arik’s ostensibly more limited
invasion plan would inevitably develop into Big Pines. Even as we were talking,

who have little interest in the democratizing mission
traditionally espoused by mainstream parties with deep
roots in the global struggles of the 20th century. The
new mood is reflected in the democracies foreign poli-
cies, many of which are aimed more at seeking national
advantage than at promoting the common good.

The rise of populist politics in democracies could give
modern authoritarianism a new lease on life. While it
may no longer be as useful for entrenched autocracies
to mask their nature with an illusion of pluralism, free-
ly elected leaders with authoritarian ambitions can
use similar techniques to replace genuine democratic
institutions with hollowed-out fagades. This process

is already under way in the countries that have been
dubbed “illiberal democracies.

With states across the spectrum shifting in an
authoritarian direction, there is not much comfort in
the fact that repressive regimes are fundamentally
more unstable and vulnerable to breakdowns than
democracies. Major authoritarian governments may
collapse in the face of economic crises, popular
protests, or succession battles. But in the absence of
international pressure and support, it seems doubt-
ful that they would be replaced by aspiring democra-
cies. Indeed, they could be succeeded by something
even worse.

"
IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011666.txt,"I could see that Little Pines was a kind of fiction. All you had to do was take
a map and draw in the 40-kilometer line. In the areas nearer the Mediterranean,
in the western and central parts of the border area, it indeed covered territory
controlled by armed PLO groups. But in the eastern sector, there were Syrian
positions a mere 10 to 12 kilometers up from the border, well inside the
“security zone”. Not much further north were two full Syrian divisions. That
meant we’d be fighting not just the Palestinians, which was the ostensible aim
of Little Pines. We would have to take on Syria. As soon as those hostilities
began, we would have to destroy radar and SAM sites in the Syrian-controlled
Beka’a Valley further north into Lebanon. After the first costly days of the 1973
war in the Sinai, we were not about to enter a major conflict without ensuring
air superiority. Unless the Syrians retreated or surrendered, the inevitable result
would be a wider conflict, not limited to dealing with Palestinian fighters in
south Lebanon but paving the way for Arik to go ahead with his original plan
and push all the way to Beirut.

This wasn’t mere supposition on my part. In February 1982, we ran a
simulation exercise in the kirya based on Plan B. The result: Little Pines became
Big Pines. A clash with the Syrians proved inevitable, if only because one target
even under Little Pines was the main road between Beirut and Damascus. It lay
well beyond the 40-kilometer line. As the main supply route for their forces in
the interior of Lebanon, it was also of critical importance for the Syrians. So any
idea of a quick, limited strike to establish a security zone was fantasy. A few
days later, Raful chaired a wide-ranging discussion on Lebanon. Near the end of
the session, I asked him directly whether government ministers were aware that
our war plan “will inevitably lead to a clash with the Syrians”. Raful hesitated
for a second, but then answered briskly: “Yes.”

That assurance would turn out to be untrue. But my wider concern, as the
weeks passed, was Arik’s political plan, of which I was getting an ever clearer
idea from him. It struck me as not just grand, but grandiose. Part of it was to
obliterate Arafat as a political force, if not by killing him then by forcing him
and every one of his fighters from Lebanon, a country Arik wanted to place
under the unchallenged control of the most prominent of the younger generation
of Christian Phalangist politicians, Bashir Gemayel. I felt all that would be
challenging enough. But in Arik’s eyes, this was only part of a complete
reordering of our conflict with the Arabs. He expected Gemayel’s Lebanon to
openly align itself with Israel and expel all Syrian troops. As for the expelled
Palestinians, they would go back to Jordan where they would resume — and, this
time, win — their civil war with King Hussein. The result, with Hussein deposed,

growth and was among the vanguard in embracing
e-government and other innovations associated with
a modern open society. Since the invasion of Ukraine
and the Russian military's menacing gestures along
its border, Estonia has ramped up defense spending
and launched war games to increase preparedness.
Indeed, all three Baltic countries announced major
increases in military spending in 2016.

Conditions are even worse for states where Russia
has instigated frozen conflicts. Russia maintains
military bases in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, both
on the territory of Georgia, and in Transnistria. These
enclaves, as well as the occupied portions of Ukraine,
are impoverished, heavily militarized, and marked by
gangsterism and corruption.

Crimea is an instructive case for neighboring peoples
who live under the threat of Russian military interven-
tion. Residents of the peninsula enjoyed a reasonable
array of civil liberties under the Ukrainian government.
Under Russian occupation, all that has changed.
Moscow has sent Russian officials to run the region as
de facto viceroys. Freedom of the press, which was rel-
atively vigorous before 2014, has been extinguished,
and independent voices have been arrested or forced
into exile. Property rights are routinely ignored, and
expropriation is used as a blunt instrument against
those who oppose the new order.

The fate of the Crimean Tatars is especially tragic,
given the group's history of persecution and mass
removal during Soviet times. Their leaders have been
silenced or driven out of the region, their commemo-
rations banned, and their media muzzled. By support-
ing a still-deadly frozen conflict in eastern Ukraine, the
Russian leadership has ensured that the attention of
policymakers in the democracies will be focused on
the fighting there, and not on the dreadful conditions
in Crimea.”

Since its invasion of Ukraine, Moscow has cone its

best to maximize the intimidating effect on other
neighbors. It conducted war games in which 33,000
troops rehearsed the invasion of Sweden, Norway,
Finland, and Denmark.!? The Russian navy has held
multiple, large-scale exercises in the Black Sea to defy
NATO, assert its control over Crimea, and threaten
Georgia.'* Russian and Abkhaz separatist officials
have announced what amounts to a merger of troops
from the two sides under the command of a Russian
officer.'5 Russia's military is developing the capacity

to simultaneously carry out several operations on the
scale of the Ukraine conflict—limited, rapid offensives
involving elite troops, deception, and propaganda that
would leave opponents fumbling for an appropriate re-
sponse.!® The intervention in Syria has already demon-
strated Russia's ability to project force unexpectedly in
a new theater while maintaining its existing engage-
ments in Ukraine and elsewhere.

Russias renewed embrace of cross-border aggres-
sion has had wide repercussions in Central Europe,

a region that had expected a secure alignment with
the democratic world after the end of the Cold War.
Poland, for example, had achieved something quite
remarkable prior to 2014, given its history of domina-
tion by outside powers. It enjoyed friendly relations
with Germany, one of its past occupiers, and stable
ties with Russia, traditionally the other main threat

to its sovereignty. After the annexation of Crimea,
Poland's leaders were forced to seriously contemplate
the possibility of a Russian invasion, especially given
Putin's bellicose language about the speed with which
his tanks could reach nearby capitals.'” As a result, Po-
land has embarked on a military buildup to maintain
its hard-won independence and territorial integrity.!®

But no single European country could ever match

Russia's present military might. If Poland, the Baltic
states, and their allies fail to maintain solidarity based
on shared democratic standards, it will not be long
before their sovereignty erodes under pressure from
the Kremlin.

Office for the Southern District of Florida. Under the agreement, Epstein agreed to plead guilty
to an indictment pending against him in the 15™ Judicial Circuit in and for Palm Beach County
charging him with solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors for prostitution.
Epstein also agreed that he would receive a thirty month sentence, including 18 months of jail
time and 12 months of community control. In exchange, the U.S. Attorney’s Office agreed not to
pursue any federal charges against Epstein. See Non-Prosecution Agreement (Exhibit “K”).

27. Part of the Non-Prosecution Agreement that Epstein negotiated was a provision in
which the federal government agreed not to prosecute Epstein’s co-conspirators. The co-
conspirators procured minor females to be molested by Epstein. One of the co-conspirators -
Nadia Marcinkova -even participated in the sex acts with minors (including E.W.) and Epstein.
See Incident Report, Exhibit “A”, at 40-42, 49-51; Deposition of Nadia Marcinkova, April 13,
2010, (hereinafter ““Marcinkova Depo.”) at 11 (Deposition attachment #9).

28. | Under the Non-Prosecution Agreement, Epstein was to use his “best efforts” to
enter into his guilty pleas by October 26, 2007. However, Edwards learned that Epstein violated

Summary: 40-Year USA, Inc. Trends*

e America is spending beyond its means, and the problem — with mounting
losses & increasing debt — is getting worse, not better

e Healthcare spending and obesity are rising dramatically.
e Education spending is growing slower than healthcare spending.
e Defense spending is declining on relative basis.

e More and more Americans are on the government payroll or receive
government subsidies for retirement income, medical care, housing, and
food.

e Inequality of income and wealth is rising, and fewer Americans pay income
taxes to support USA Inc.

e Government increasingly resorts to borrowing to fund rising spending
levels (primarily for entitlement programs)...

Note: *We chose a 40-year period from 1965 to 2005 to examine ‘normal’ levels of data points and trends. We did not

choose the most recent 40-year period (1969 to 2009) as USA was in deep recession in 2008 / 2009 and underwent

Significant tax policy fluctuations in 1968 /1969 and subsequently many metrics (like individual income and corporate

KP profit as well as federal budget surplus / deficit and debt levels) were significantly off their ‘normal’ levels.

Cite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)

Clause, a distinction is made between spe-
cific and general jurisdiction, such that
“specific jurisdiction” exists when the fo-
rum exercises jurisdiction over the defen-
dant in a suit arising out of the defendant’s
contacts with that forum, while “general
jurisdiction” is based on the defendant’s
general business contacts with the forum;
because the defendant’s contacts are not
related to the suit, a considerably higher
level of contacts is generally required for
general jurisdiction. U.S.C.A. Const.
Amends. 5, 14.

See publication Words and Phras-
es for other judicial constructions
and definitions.

53. Constitutional Law ¢=305(5)

In determining whether the exercise
of personal jurisdiction is reasonable under
the Due Process Clause, a court is to
consider: (1) the burden that the exercise
of jurisdiction will impose on the defen-
dant; (2) the interests in the forum state
in adjudicating the case; (3) the plaintiffs
interest in obtaining convenient and effec-
tive relief; (4) the interstate judicial sys-
tem’s interest in obtaining the most effi-
cient resolution of the controversy; and (5)
the shared interest of the states in further-
ing substantive social policies. U.S.C.A.
Const.Amends. 5, 14.

54. Federal Courts <-86

In general, great care and reserve
should be exercised when extending no-
tions of personal jurisdiction into the inter-
national field.

55. Federal Civil Procedure €-1267.1

In evaluating jurisdictional motions,
district courts enjoy broad discretion in
deciding whether to order discovery.

56. Federal Civil Procedure €-1269.1
Courts are not obligated to subject a
foreign defendant to discovery where the
allegations of jurisdictional facts, con-
strued in plaintiffs’ favor, fail to state a

basis for the exercise of jurisdiction or
where discovery would not uncover suffi-
cient facts to sustain jurisdiction.

to satisfy the teacher or at least to satisfy their own needs in these
areas. The problem is, as I stated originally, that learning starts with a
goal and that the students’ goals may not be the same as the teacher’s
goals. Since the students have no Dickens-related goal, and actually
have a teacher satisfaction goal, they simply have misestimated what
will satisfy the teacher.

Now let’s consider real goals. Students do not stop driving a car
because they are tired even though they haven’t arrived where they
are going. They do not fail to ask out Mary Lou on a date because
they got bored talking mid-sentence. They do not give up on hitting
a baseball mid-swing or midway through the game. People put in the
effort required when they are working on truly held goals. Subject-
based goals are almost never truly held. But cognitive process goals
are nearly always truly held if the student is working on real things. If
school wants to deal with artificial things (flying an air flight simula-
tor instead of a real plane, for example, in order to learn to fly), then
those artificial things need to feel very real and be very motivating.

Rule #6: Try teaching students things they actually may need to
know after they leave school.

Here is mistake #7.

Mistake# 7: Correcting a student who is doing something wrong
by telling him what to do instead

This one seems really weird. Wouldn’t you tell someone to do
things differently or what went wrong when you see them making
a mistake? Most of us would because this seems a reasonable thing
to do. It just isn’t a reasonable thing for a teacher to do. A teacher
needs to help a student think about what went wrong as opposed to
telling him what went wrong and how to fix it. What do you think
happened? Why did it happen, do you suppose? What could you have
done differently?

Why does this matter? It matters because self-generated explana-
tions are remembered more easily than explanations that we are told.
It actually is quite difficult to remember anything you have been told.
It is much easier to remember what you yourself have thought up,
in part because you probably spent some time doing it, considered

Similarly, Non-U.S. Partners could become subject to U.S. federal income tax and tax return
filing obligations, as a result of transfers of their Limited Partner Interests at a time when the
Fund owned stock of any U.S. corporation that is a USRPHC, although certain exceptions may
apply. Even if a company in which the Fund invests is not a USRPHC at the time of such
investment, such company subsequently may become a USRPHC.

Currency Conversion Issues - Non-U.S. Partners (like other Partners) will be required to make
their capital contributions to the Fund in U.S. dollars, and any cash distributions made by the
Fund will be made in U.S. dollars. Profits or losses realized by Non-U.S. Partners on the
conversion of other currencies into U.S. dollars, or of U.S. dollars into other currencies, will
neither be reflected in the capital accounts of the Partners nor affect the amounts distributable
by the Fund to its Non-U.S. Partners.

Withholding on Payments to Certain Foreign Entities - Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code
would generally impose a withholding tax of 30% on certain gross amounts of income not
effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business paid to certain foreign entities, unless certain
requirements are satisfied. Amounts subject to withholding tax under these rules generally
include gross U.S.-source dividend and interest income paid on or after July 1, 2014, as well as
gross proceeds from the sale of property that produces U.S.-source dividend or interest income
paid on or after January 1, 2017. To avoid withholding under these rules, Non-U.S. Partners
that are subject to these rules will generally be obligated to comply with certain information
reporting and disclosure requirements, including, in certain cases, entering into an agreement
with the IRS. Non-U.S. Partners are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the
possible application of Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code to their investment in the Fund.

Other Tax Matters

Certain State and Local Tax Consequences - State and local taxing jurisdictions may impose
income taxes and estate, inheritance and intangible property taxes on income from, or an
investment in, the Fund. These tax laws may differ substantially from the U.S. federal tax laws.
As a result of participating in the Fund, a Partner may be required to file tax returns with, and
pay taxes to, any state or local jurisdiction in which the Fund does business (or is deemed to do
business from investing a portion of its commitments in operating businesses treated as tax
transparent for U.S. federal income tax purposes). A Partner’s distributive share of the Fund’s
taxable income, gain, loss, deduction and credit is normally included in the income reported to
the state and local jurisdiction(s) in which the Partner is a resident or does business. Investors
should consult their own tax advisors about state and local taxes.

Basis for Description of Tax Consequences - The description of U.S. tax consequences set forth
above is based on the provisions of the principal agreements relating to the Fund that the
General Partner expects will be adopted, existing provisions of the Code, existing and proposed
U.S. Treasury Regulations, existing administrative interpretations and court decisions, and
certain assumptions. Future legislation, U.S. Treasury Regulations, administrative
interpretations or court decisions could significantly change these authorities. Any such change
could have retroactive application and therefore could apply to transactions that have taken
place before such change occurs. In addition, some of the issues discussed above have not been
addressed by administrative authorities or resolved by the courts. Accordingly, no assurance

ordinary Syrians. A dialogue of the deaf ensued. The Assads’ intense
preoccupation with external crises led them to neglect the internal
scene. Who would need political freedoms, they no doubt thought, if
given the benefits of security and stability? As the regime’s official
daily newspaper Tishrin wrote on 25 April: “The most sublime form
of freedom is the security of the nation.”

The recent explosion of popular anger has evidently taken Bashar by
surprise, as it did other Arab autocrats. He has had to wrench his
attention away from the perils and excitements of foreign policy to
urgent challenges at home. To devise and implement far-reaching
domestic reforms, as the present situation urgently demands, will
require a radical change of focus. It will not be easy, and a favourable
outcome is far from certain. Bashar now faces an internal threat to his
regime at least as dangerous as any of the external threats he and his
father confronted so successfully.

JUDGE ALDRICH: He’s looking after my grandmother who went to see Sur Les Toits
De Paris.

MR. DERSHOWITZ: The only valid basis for punishing obscenity ...is to protect people
[like Judge Aldrich’s grandmother] from being offended, from having something thrust on
them in an unwilling manner and also to protect youngsters.

When I then advised the court that under my theory, the judges would not have to view the film.
Judge Aldrich immediately interjected: “Are you trying to bribe us to decide the case so we don’t
have to see the film?...I will admit that’s the best bribe I have ever been offered.”

Judge Julian did not seem to understand my argument. He kept asking me whether I wanted the
court to assume that I Am Curious Yellow was not “pornographic.”

I tried to explain:

“Tt’s exactly the opposite. We do not ask you to decide whether or not the film is
pornographic. We are asking you to decide that the film shown in a nonobtrusive way,
advertised in the way that it’s been advertised right from the beginning, with no hint, no
suggestion of obscenity or prurience, played, if you wish, with the warning being given,
although there have been no complaints by a single viewer of the film that he’s been
offended—because your Honor is of course right: everybody knows what they’re going
to see—exhibited in that manner, the film is protected by the First Amendment without
regard to its contents.”

Judge Julian then questioned me about whether this case was really about money, rather than
freedom of speech, because Grove Press was a commercial distributor of films for profit:

JUDGE JULIAN. These people are exhibiting this film for the box office
receipts, are they not as a fact?
Mr. DERSHOWITZ. The New York Times is selling its papers for the box office
receipts as well.

JUDGE JULIAN. Let’s talk about this film not the New York Times.

Mr. DERSHOWITZ. Your Honors, that fact is utterly irrelevant, I would submit.
JUDGE JULIAN. But is it the fact though?
Mr. DERSHOWITZ. I don’t know. I can’t probe Mr. Rosset’s mind, who is the
president of Grove Press...I think he probably has very mixed motives.

Jeffrey Epstein, and (2) the Government violated their CVRA rights by concealing the non-
prosecution agreement with them. (DE 280 at 3; see id. at 7-8). However, the bulk of the Rule
21 Motion consists of copious factual details that Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 “would prove” “[i]f
allowed to join this action.” (Id. at 3, 7). Specifically, Jane Doe 3 proffers that she could prove
the circumstances under which a non-party introduced her to Mr. Epstein, and how Mr. Epstein
sexually trafficked her to several high-profile non-party individuals, “including numerous
prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known
Prime Minister, and other world leaders.” (Id. at 3-6). She names several individuals, and she
offers details about the type of sex acts performed and where they took place. (See id. at 5).’

At this juncture in the proceedings, these lurid details are unnecessary to the
determination of whether Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 should be permitted to join Petitioners’
claim that the Government violated their rights under the CVRA. The factual details regarding
with whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are immaterial and impertinent
to this central claim (i.e., that they were known victims of Mr. Epstein and the Government owed
them CVRA duties), especially considering that these details involve non-parties who are not
related to the respondent Government. These unnecessary details shall be stricken.

The original Rule 21 Motion (DE 279) shall be stricken in its entirety, as it is wholly
superseded by the “corrected” version of the Rule 21 Motion (DE 280). From the corrected Rule
21 Motion, the Court shall strike all factual details regarding Jane Doe 3 between the following

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012869.txt,"When Lorena Bobbitt cut off her husband John Bobbitt’s penis, she fulfilled her desire to harm
another. She carried out this gruesome act despite the moral and legal sanctions against it. But she did
not plan this act in advance, and nor did it occur in the heat of the moment, triggered by finding her
husband in bed with a lover. It followed in the wake of his repeated philandering, attempted rape and
psychological abuse. As an act, it fell between the cracks of a long-term plan and a reflexive response —
it was hatched on the night of the fatal attack, triggered by seeing a carving knife in the kitchen. Lorena
either lost self-control for that fatal moment or she was in complete control, aware of what she was about
to do and justified by her own moral convictions, believing that harming John was just deserts. John was
most definitely not innocent. The jury delivered a “not guilty” decision, appealing to a crime of passion
defense. This decision effectively excused Lorena’s harmful act as normal and justified given the
mitigating circumstances.

When we consider the nature of evil, we must pause to consider our own biases and prejudices
about what’s normal. We must ask about the human potential, about our evolved capacities and our
ability to behave in novel ways in novel environments. When we say that a person, group or nation is evil,
we are saying something important about human nature, about our capability as a species. We are saying

something important about the relationship between nature and nurture.

Evil eggs and corrosive coops
How much do career criminals cost? Estimates from the United States suggest that if you can prevent a
high risk child from entering this career, you save $1.5-2 million in costs of education, mental health, and
criminal fees. Educational facilities such as the Penikese Island School in Massachusetts, where I have
had the privilege of working, spend about $100,000 per student per year to keep high-risk teens off the
streets and out of jail. Based on statistics collected by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, approximately
100,000 individuals under the age of 18 years were arrested in 2007 for violent crimes — murder, forcible
rape, and aggravated assault. If we had nurtured and educated these teenagers before they committed
such crimes, we would have saved close to $100,000,000,000. Violent crime prevention pays. How does a
career of violent crime start? Are there early warning signs? How early? How much starts with the egg
and how much with the coop in which it was raised?

Early scientific interests in this chicken and egg problem can be traced to the efforts of the Italian
physician and psychologist Cesare Lombroso. In 1876, he published his magnum opus 7he Criminal
Man. This was a serious, scholarly book aimed at understanding “whether there is a force in nature that

causes crime.” Based on measurements of both anatomical and psychological characteristics, Lombroso

And, particularly, the harder-nosed the capitalism, the better. However, like I said, there’s
two strands of capitalism that we’re quite concerned about.

One is crony capitalism, or what we call state-controlled capitalism, and that’s the big
thing the tea party is fighting in the United States, and really the tea party’s biggest fight
is not with the left, because we're not there yet. The biggest fight the tea party has today is
just like UKIP. UKIP’s biggest fight is with the Conservative Party.

The tea party in the United States’ biggest fight is with the the Republican establishment,
which is really a collection of crony capitalists that feel that they have a different set of
rules of how they’re going to comport themselves and how they’re going to run things.
And, quite frankly, it’s the reason that the United States’ financial situation is so dire,
particularly our balance sheet. We have virtually a hundred trillion dollars of unfunded
liabilities. That is all because you’ve had this kind of crony capitalism in Washington, DC.
The rise of Breitbart is directly tied to being the voice of that center-right opposition. And,
quite frankly, we’re winning many, many victories.

On the social conservative side, we’re the voice of the anti-abortion movement, the voice
of the traditional marriage movement, and I can tell you we’re winning victory after
victory after victory. Things are turning around as people have a voice and have a

find funds from investors rather than depositors.

If there were no FDIC, there would be no deposits and no commercial banks. People
can read the newspapers. Anyone old enough has lived through periodic bailouts.
I’m a free market fan who dislikes FDIC. But we would be rash to yank the rug from
under banks by repealing it. We shouldn’t even hint that we might. The world we
know is build around banks, and banks are built on FDIC. Let it stand. How can
anyone know for sure that omnibus funds and independent lending banks will do

better? I think omnibus funds figure to win despite that advantage for banks.

Lending Banks

This is the area least clear to me. Banks as we know them begin with expertise,
systems and clientele in the loans business as well as the deposit and payment
processing business. That could position them to take the lead in both if spun off
separately. Lending can stand alone. There are many lending firms other than banks.
They raise funds from investors seeking returns, rather than depositors seeking
liquidity, and somehow mange to compete with banks today. Lending banks

divorced from depositors could do whatever they do.

If interest rates must rise because investors demand competitive returns, some
traditional borrowers will be motivated to attract equity investment instead.
Corporations and other firms could phase out structural (long-term) debt, and float
new stock issues in its place. The effect would be to lower leverage, risk and return
together. Investors could then tailor risk and return more flexibly by hedging or

leveraging their individual holdings through professional services.

If the same rise in interest rates makes it impractical for newlyweds to buy homes,
they can rent until their means improve. In ten or fifteen years their incomes will
double. They will know if they are still married, how much house they need if so,

and where their careers have taken them. Meanwhile they might rent the same

operations, he could have done the entire operation at Dell. He even could have sent Poitras
documents anonymously over his own TOR software and server. And he could have remained in
his self-described “paradise” in Hawaii with his girl friend.

Yet he chose to move to Booz Allen he also greatly increased the risk of exposure because the
auditing system at Booz Allen could trace back unauthorized copying (though not in real time.)
Presumably he knew, as he later told Greenwald and Poitras, that stealing documents at the Booz
Allen job meant that he would either go to prison or escape from America. He didn’t want to
face prison time, so the job change required an escape plan. In keeping with the latter option,
only about a week after he started work at the Booz Allen-managed facility, he submitted a
request for a medical leave of absence.

We can safely assume that the reason for him to make this risky switch in employment was
because he wanted something beyond the whistle-blowing documents. He wanted now to get
documents that were not available at the Dell job. One such document he took was the top-secret
Congressional Budget Justification Book for Fiscal Year 2013. This “black budget,” as it is
called in Congress, contained the entire Intelligence Community’s priorities for, among other
things, monitoring the activities of potential adversaries and terrorist organizations. It specified
the money requested by not only the NSA, but the CIA, DIA, National Reconnaissance Office and
other intelligence services. Snowden could not have considered the budget illegitimate, since is
duly approved by both houses of Congress and the President. Nor could he objected to its
secrecy since he himself had sworn oaths to protect all classified documents to which he was privy
for the past eight years. If it was not for purposes of whistle-blowing, presumably he had another
purpose for taking such a document. It certainly held value to other actors. “For our enemies,
having it is like having the playbook of the opposing NFL team,” said CIA Deputy Director
Morell in 2015. “I guarantee you that the SVR, the Russian foreign intelligence service, would
have paid millions of dollars for such a document.” Unlike Ames, Hanssen and Pelton, Snowden
was not after money. He sought documents that enhanced his power and importance.

He made no secret of this part of his motive after he got safely to Hong Kong. As will be
recalled in answer to a question from the journalist Lana Lam about his motive for changing jobs,
he answered that he took the Booz Allen job to get access to secret lists that were not available to
him by working for Dell. These documents certainly increases his value to other nations since
they included Level 3 lists revealing the NSA’s sources in Russia, China and other foreign
countries.

Snowden also wanted more than NSA secrets. He used his new position, and widened access
at Booz Allen, to go after secret documents from the intelligence services of Britain, Australia.
New Zealand and Israel He revealed this operation only after receiving sanctuary in Russia. He
told an interviewer that by moving to his new Booz Allen job as an infrastructure analyst he
gained the ability to pry secrets out of the allied of the NSA. “I had a special level of clearance,
called ‘Priv Ac’,” he said. This “priv ac” status, he further explained, allowed him to request files
from other services cooperating with U.S. intelligence. By way of example, he described one file
from the British GCHQ cipher service that he copied, stole and provided to other parties. It
exposed a legally-authorized British operation to collect electronic data on terrorist matters in
Pakistan by tapping into Cisco routers used by telecom companies in Asia. This GCHQ
operation, as he himself recognized, violated neither British nor American law. He told a BBC
interviewer in regard to that file:’ What's scariest is not what the government is doing that's
unlawful, but what they're doing that is completely lawful.” So his criteria for taking such

Note that at current strip oil prices of ~$55 Brent, this is closer to $14.4/sh of which
Payara is ~$6/sh or $2.0bn. On a ‘risked’ basis, we believe this is a reasonable
development scenario representative of any incremental discovery that resembles Liza
recalling that the partners have identified over 20 additional drilling prospects. On the
assumption of a ‘plus three year’ development scenario after Liza, the potential impact
on incremental production and cash flow is significant for Hess while the cumulative
impact also becomes significant for XOM.

Critically, Guyana is now being described as a ‘DHI play’ meaning seismic and core have
been sufficiently calibrated as to provide direct hydrocarbon indicators and hence de-
risking future exploration tests. This appears confirmed again by the latest ‘Snoek’
SUCCESS.

XOM’s development plan calls for an FPSO (floating production and storage offloading
vessel} with production capacity of about 150,000 boepd for every 450mm barrels of
recoverable reserves, with plateau production extending up to 10 years. We suggest
management’s commentary supports gross production capacity from current discovered
resource of at least 600,000 boepd.

° Many more lined up to get you to sign their copy of your latest book, The Greatest Story Ever Told —

° Online, people can buy T-shirts emblazoned “Lawrence Krauss for President.”

great societal injustices.

° Earlier this year, at a Q&A event to promote your new book, the conversation came around to the
dearth of women and minorities in science. “Science itself overcomes misogyny and prejudice and bias,” you
said. “It’s built in: Questioning yourself, always questioning results, questioning others, relying on empirical
evidence.”

2008 was convicted for soliciting prostitution from underage girls, and spent 13 months in a Florida jail.

eventually is the state capitalist of kleptocracy. However, we the Judeo-Christian West
really have to look at what he’s talking about as far as traditionalism goes — particularly
the sense of where it supports the underpinnings of nationalism — and I happen to think
that the individual sovereignty of a country is a good thing and a strong thing. I think
strong countries and strong nationalist movements in countries make strong neighbors,
and that is really the building blocks that built Western Europe and the United States,
and I think it’s what can see us forward.

You know, Putin’s been quite an interesting character. He’s also very, very, very
intelligent. I can see this in the United States where he’s playing very strongly to social
conservatives about his message about more traditional values, so I think it’s something
that we have to be very much on guard of. Because at the end of the day, I think that Putin
and his cronies are really a kleptocracy, that are really an imperialist power that want to
expand. However, I really believe that in this current environment, where you're facing a
potential new caliphate that is very aggressive that is really a situation — I’m not saying
we can put it on a back burner — but I think we have to deal with first things first.
Questioner: One of my questions has to do with how the West should be responding to
radical Islam. How, specifically, should we as the West respond to Jihadism without
losing our own soul? Because we can win the war and lose ourselves at the same time.
How should the West respond to radical Islam and not lose itself in the process?
Bannon: From a perspective — this may be a little more militant than others. I think
definitely you’re going to need an aspect that is [unintelligible]. I believe you should take
a very, very, very aggressive stance against radical Islam. And I realize there are other
aspects that are not as militant and not as aggressive and that’s fine.

If you look back at the long history of the Judeo-Christian West struggle against Islam, I
believe that our forefathers kept their stance, and I think they did the right thing. I think
they kept it out of the world, whether it was at Vienna, or Tours, or other places... It
bequeathed to use the great institution that is the church of the West.

And I would ask everybody in the audience today, because you really are the movers and
drivers and shakers and thought leaders in the Catholic Church today, is to think, when

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012841.txt,"At birth, newborns preferentially listen to their native language over a non-native language. Soon
thereafter, infants prefer to listen to their native dialect over a non-native dialect, and look longer at their
own race than another race. This shows that they can discriminate between different languages, dialects,
and racial groups. But do they form social preferences based on these distinctions? Would a young baby
or child prefer to take a toy from an unfamiliar person who speaks the same or different language, from
the same or different race? To answer these questions, the American psychologist Katharine Kinzler put 5
months old babies to a test.

Babies born into mono-racial and mono-lingual families sat on their mother’s lap in front of two
monitors, each presenting short video clips of different people. After watching the videos, Kinzler
created a bit of magic. The people in the monitor appeared to emerge from the 2D image and offer the
baby a toy. The trick: a real person, hidden beneath the monitor, synchronized her reach with the reach in
the monitor. Who would the baby choose given that both people offered the same toy? Babies preferred
people speaking the native over non-native language, and native-accent over the non-native accent. At
this young age, however, they showed no preference for native over non-native race. Thus, early in life
the connection between discrimination and social preference is well established for language, but not race.
When do things change for race?

Kinzler carried out another series of experiments on race with one group of 2.5 year old children
and a second group of 5-year olds. Though the methods were somewhat different, they both focused on
the child’s preferences, including who they would share toys with and who they would prefer as friends.
The 2.5 year olds showed no preferences, whereas the 5 year olds preferred their own race. Race is
therefore a slowly developing category, at least in terms of its impact on social preferences, and especially
when contrasted with both language and accent.

Kinzler took these studies one step further to explore whether there is anything like a hierarchy
among these social categories and the features that define them. What’s more important to a young child
building an inner sanctum of trusted others —race, language, or dialect? Would they rather interact with
someone of the same race who speaks a foreign language or someone of a different race who speaks the
native language? Using similar procedures, Kinzler showed that by 4-5 years of age, language trumps
race. Children would rather interact with someone from a different race speaking the same language than
someone of the same race speaking a foreign language.

Why would language trump race? Kinzler's answer relies on an idea developed by the American
evolutionary psychologist Robert Kurzban. Imagine a hunter-gatherer in South Africa, living during the
earliest stages of our evolutionary history. As individuals searched for food to eat, areas to sleep, water to
drink, and places to avoid, they came across other individuals. These individuals were always members

of the same race. Racial differences did not emerge until relatively late in human evolution, well after our

SOME ENTHEOGENIC ENTROPIES

In the spring of 1968, members of my laboratory team were looking for new
brain metabolic pathways of the essential amino acid tryptophan, the dietary
precursor of the human mood, sleep and libidinal neurotransmitter, serotonin. After
struggling for several months to identify an apparently new compound, which turned
out not to be new but only new in the brain, we collected evidence for a human
brain enzyme that could catalyze the production of an LSD-like hallucinogen,
dimethyltryptamine, DMT. Tracing its metabolic origins, we found that DMT was
derived from tryptamine, a common metabolite of the essential and omnipresent
amino acid, tryptophan. This enzyme and its metabolic product were located in
highest concentrations in brain stem systems that influence the neural regulation of
the heart, blood pressure, temperature, breathing, vomiting and primitive approach-
avoidance behavior. It was also found in limbic brain nuclei thought to modulate the
emotional coloring of perception and thought. Richard Wyatt, working at the
National Institutes of Mental Health found DMT in the urine of schizophrenic
humans. He also showed that DMT increased significantly if tryptamine’s normal

pathway for degradation was blocked by monoamine oxidase inhibitors, such as

Mathematically, that could include what I called “output exhaust”, meaning value
exhausted as soon as created. | ruled that out as “free goods”, which happen every
day but are neglected in economics as unable to influence behavior either before or
after. That’s why “equals” cannot mean “is” in (A1.3). And neither does it in (A1.5).
Rather both state that output provides cash flow offset plus total capital growth.

This distinction helps everywhere in economics. We know for example that transfer
out may be drawn either from capital in place or from concurrent output. The
source of first kind is decaptialization D. But decaptialization also includes other
components than transfer out. In Chapter 3, and again just now, I excluded output

exhaust as free goods possible in math but neglected in economics. That makes

decapitalization D the only source of pure consumption C, . And not all

decapitalization is transfer or exhaust. Some is deadweight loss, defined in (A1.1) as

any negative sum of capital growth K,, and cash flow F. That can show in

D=D\+D, and D,=D_+C,. (A1.4)

Here D, is recovered or realized decapitalization, D, is “transfer depreciation” net

of plowback into the same asset, and D, is deadweight loss. A is lambda. At the

aggressively enforce state criminal laws. No one turned a blind eye to potential offenses to the public

order. To the contrary, the Palm Beach State Attorney's Office conducted an extensive 15-month
investigation, led by the chief of the Sex Crimes Division. Mr. Epstein was then indicted by a state grand jury
on a single felony count of solicitation of prostitution.

During that intense investigation, the state prosecutors extensively gathered and analyzed the evidence, met
face-to-face with many of the asserted victims, considered their credibility -- or lack thereof -- and considered
the extent of exculpatory evidence. Then, after months of elaborate negotiations, the state prosecutors believed
they had reached a reasoned resolution of the matter that vindicated the public interest -- a resolution entirely
consistent with that of cases involving other similarly-situated defendants.

Then, in came the feds. The United States Attorney's Office tried, to no avail, to fit Mr. Epstein's situation into
its vision of what it viewed as a commercial trafficking ring targeting minors. This was anything but. At long
last, the federal authorities acknowledged that stark reality and grudgingly agreed to defer prosecution to the
state. But there was a huge catch. In the face of our arguments sharply condemning their overreach, the
federal prosecutors insisted on many unorthodox requirements that tugged at fundamental values of due
process. For example, the agreement required Mr. Epstein to pay an undisclosed list of asserted victims
$150,000 each. Even more, the feds insisted that Jeffrey pay for an attorney to represent such unidentified
victims if any chose to filed civil litigation against him. When asked what possible legal authority supported
this extravagant exercise of national power, the feds lamely cited a wildly inapposite case from Alaska
involving cocaine and forced on-the-street prostitution. Apples and oranges.

Under the federally-forced deal, Jeffrey was sentenced to jail. That would not have been the case under the
agreed-upon state disposition of this non-violent, consensual commercial arrangement. Jeffrey complied,
served that sentence, and in the process was treated exactly the same as other state-incarcerated

individuals. His conduct was exemplary, and so characterized by the state custodial authorities. He continued
his work, including his many philanthropic efforts.

Our friend Jeffrey Epstein has paid his debt to society. He has also paid out millions of dollars to the asserted
victims and their highly-creative lawyers. For over ten years, he has lived an exemplary life, including
carrying on his wide-ranging philanthropies. Those of us who represented him in the Florida proceedings -- for
customary professional fees -- now count him as a trusted friend.

Our nation faces vitally important challenges, many involving the treatment of women and basic human
dignity. Voices are rightly being raised speaking truth to power, especially about women in the

workplace. But Jeffrey, an exemplary employer, has long since been called to account by the criminal justice
system for his misdeeds of yesteryear. In the spirit of the bedrock American belief in second chances, that
unhappy chapter in Jeffrey's otherwise-magnificent life should be allowed to close once and for all.

Susan Hess and I are chauffeured downtown with our Vera Wang gowns and report to the VIP extra holding
area where we join Prince Dimitri of Yugoslavia in a bespoke dinner jacket, journalist Christopher Mason,
songstress Yanna Avis, photographer Kelly Klein, art dealer Larry Gagosian's girl friend Shala Monroque in
see-through Rodarte, beauty executive Olivia Chantecaille, producer Lawrence Robins, author Jackie Weld
Drake, Vogue film critic Joan Juliet Buck, fashion consultant Jill Fairchild, CNN’s Felicia Taylor and Italian
newsman Mario Calvo-Platero.

Ellen Mirojnick and her costume department have assembled racks of the most expensive elaborate designer
gowns and work at break neck speed styling while we wildly strip to our undies in a makeshift dressing area.
Ellen pours me into a black tulle Marchesa with a enormous wired silver bow. Twenty hairdressers and make-
up artists systematically work on 250 extras. A mile of tables are alternately filled with steaming coffee,
fattening breakfast foods, hair sprays, mirrors, shoes and jewelry. It’s a madhouse of excitement.

We are led to the part of the set used for the cocktail reception and placed around Michael Douglas and Charlie
Sheen stand-ins. Charlie has been flown in from LA for half a day's work to reprise his original character. He
is now the highest paid television actor commanding two million dollars an episode of “Two and a Half Men.”

the outcome may have been different. But they were not
known to us at the time.

A prosecution decision must be based on admissible
facts known at the time. In cases of this type, those are
unusually difficult because victims are frightened and
often decline to testify or if they do speak, they give con-
tradictory statements. Our judgment in this case, based
on the evidence known at the time, was that it was better
to have a billionaire serve time in jail, register as a sex
offender, and pay his victims restitution than risk a trial
with a reduced likelihood of success. I supported that
judgment then, and based on the state law as it then stood
and the evidence known at the time, I would support that
judgment again.

Epstein’s treatment, while in state custody, likewise
may encourage the view that the office should have been
tougher. Although the terms of confinement in a state
prison are a matter appropriately left to the State of Flor-
ida, and not federal authorities, without doubt, the treat-
ment that he received while in state custody undermined
the purpose of a jail sentence.

Some may also believe that the prosecution should
have been tougher in retaliation for the defense’s tactics.
The defense, arguably, often failed to negotiate in good
faith. They would obtain concessions as part of a negotia-
tion and agree to proceed, only to change their minds,
and appeal the office’s position to Washington. The inves-
tigations into the family lives of individual prosecutors

were, in my opinion, uncalled for, as were the accusations

worth noting that the conflict remained conventional. Iran was different. Only the
most naive observer would exclude the possibility that if the Iranians did get a
nuclear weapon, they might use it. And even if they didn’t, the entire strategic
picture would change, with the need to find a response not just to a nuclear Iran,
but potentially a nuclear Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.

I was not about to lecture President Obama on this. While Bibi liked to portray
him variously as weak, naive or tone-deaf to interests and security of Israel, I knew
from our previous meetings that he was none of these things. Yet I did, ina
deliberately non-didactic way, raise the issue of our different perspectives on the
Iranians’ getting nuclear arms. “You see it in the context of the whole world,” I
told the President. “If Iran, in spite of all our efforts, gets a nuclear weapon, yes, it
will be bad. But for you, it’s just one more nuclear state. It won’t dramatically
change the situation for America. For us, it can turn into a real, existential threat.”

He agreed that we inevitably looked at the situation differently. But after
pausing a few seconds, he said: “Ehud, think of it this way. You get to school in
the morning and there’s this big, nasty bully. You can take him on, maybe give
him a black eye. But you have this bigger, stronger friend, who can knock him out
cold. The only problem is that your friend won’t be there until the afternoon.”

I would have liked nothing more than to wait for our “bigger, stronger” friend,
especially since I knew through my contacts in the American military and
intelligence establishment how much bigger and stronger an American attack
would be. During the first couple of years that Israel was working on acquiring the
capability for a military strike, the Americans had been no more ready than we
were. They did have the tanker aircraft and the heavy bombs. But their plan —a
kind of Iraq-style shock and awe — was so obviously prone to lead to a wider
conflict that it would never have received the go-ahead from President Obama, or
probably any president. I used to joke with colleagues in the Pentagon that while
Israel’s idea of a “surgical operation” was the equivalent of a scalpel, they seemed
to favor a chisel and a ten-pound hammer. By the time I met the President in 2012,
that had changed. Under Gates and then Panetta, an intensive research-and-
development effort and enormously improved planning and training had yielded
results. The Americans now had high-precision heavy munitions we couldn’t
dream of, and stealth air-attack capabilities we also lacked. They had an
operational plan which, within a period of hours, could push the Iranian nuclear

“We just decided that was the best way to accomplish what needed to be done here and the parties agreed that that sentence satisfied everyone’s
requirements,” Goldberger replied.

Said Judge Pucillo: “The taxpayers of Palm Beach County are going to pay 18 months to house this guy instead of DOC [the Department of Corrections]?”
Belohlavek: “Right.”
Pucillo did not respond to a request for comment on the case.

Villafafia, the lead federal prosecutor in Epstein’s case, was in the courtroom, but there’s no indication she objected to Epstein’s cozier jail
accommodations.

When he entered jail in July 2008, Epstein was arguably the most well-known inmate there. Records also show that Epstein hired Palm Beach sheriff's
deputies for his security details, paying them for the hours they spent monitoring him on work release at his West Palm Beach office, where he often
stayed until 10 p.m., jail logs show.

The Herald reviewed their time sheets, showing that the deputies logged visitors coming and going to and from his office throughout the day. A record log
of his visitors was kept in a safe, but the log no longer exists, according to a spokeswoman for the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office.

One deputy who often worked Epstein’s detail said that his assignment was to stay in a front reception room of Epstein’s office. Epstein was in a separate
office — with the door closed — most of the day as he accepted visitors, both male and female, the deputies’ logs show.

“Tt was not our job to monitor what he was doing in that office,” the deputy,
now retired, told the Herald.

In their early reports in July 2008, the deputies referred to Epstein as
“Gnmate”’ but within a few weeks the language had changed and he was
called a “client.” He was occasionally allowed to take a break for lunch by
sitting outside in a park, the records show, and they also gave him
permission to scout for a new office. While on work release, he was required
to wear an ankle bracelet to monitor his whereabouts.

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024941.txt,"Among the most important historic achievements we take pride in is the building of the national Emirati identity
which did not exist before the rise of the Union state. This identity settles deep down in the souls of all Emiratis,
runs in their blood-veins, and fills them with feelings of dignity and loyalty to their country, the UAE.

Every citizen and person of responsibility in the UAE puts his Emirati national sense of belonging above that of
his own area. Basically there is no conflict, but integration, between the two. When a person introduces himself
as coming from Abu Dhabi, Fujairah, or Dubai, he is not unlike an Egyptian who introduces himself as coming
from Cairo, Asyut, or Alexandria, or a Saudi, who introduces himself as coming from Riyadh, Makkah, or
Dammam.

Unfortunately, some people who do not know the Emirates and the facts of life there, pass judgment on what

they do not understand. We are, in the words of my brother Sheikh Khalifa, members in one body, strong and
held together. There are no sensitivities among the Emirates, but t here is mutual cooperation and help within
the one state, the one national identity; and at the same time, within the one state there is room for competition
in the fields of good deeds achievement, excellence, and the service of the country and citizens.

By Al-Sharq al-Awsat Daily

Do you support increasing the scope of the federal government’s authorities while
decreasing those of local governments towards the overall welfare of the UAE?

There is no conflict between the local and federal authorities. There are federal and local roles which are clearly
articulated by the Constitution of the UAE. All sovereign issues fall within the jurisdiction of federal
government, represented by His Highness, The President, Members of the UAE Supreme Council, The
Cabinet, The Federal National Council, Federal Law.

The federal government enjoys full authority to carry out its mandate articulated by the Constitution. Extended
or limited scope of authority is not a theoretical issue. Meanwhile, promoting non-central governmental models
and offering more authorities to local governments is now a growing trend in different parts of the world, even
in single region state. Decentralization has proven quite successful in handling development requirements,
enhancing government performance and increasing productivity of public organizations.

In the UAE, we are very keen on ensuring complementary roles and responsibilities among ministries and
federal authorities and20the local departments and establishments towards achieving highest government
performance levels across the UAE.

By Al-Sharq al-Awsat Daily

In times of crises, Dubai always comes into the world’s focus. Are you concerned by
international reports highlighting Dubai’s economic shortcomings during the global
financial downturn?

We are completely aware of our capabilities and we don’t overestimate our abilities. Dubai’s success in
introducing a unique developmental model has gained remarkable international recognition. As you know,
success implies a certain burden that cannot be avoided. The international focus on Dubai is absolutely normal.
During crises, people usually turn their attention to those who have proven a successful track record. The
current crisis has brought Dubai’s developmental model with all its successes into a tough test. Some have
speculated that Dubai will fail this test, simply because they do not know the UAE nor what Dubai has achieved
based on solid foundation of knowledge, expertise and business ties across the globe. Dubai’s achievements are
part of the UAE’s remarkable progress. I know that some people from outside the region have wished that

Jeffrey Epstein's attorneys fight to keep plea discussions private 
John Pacenti 
2011-04-2112:00:00 AM 
Miami attorney Roy Black and two other high-profile attorneys who represented billionaire sex offender 
Jeffrey Epstein have asked a federal judge to prohibit two alleged victims from obtaining correspondence 
between the defense team and federal prosecutors who hammered out a nonprosecution agreement. 
The two women identified in court papers only as Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 say the agreement should be 
invalidated because they were not adequately informed of the plan not to file federal charges against Epstein. 
The defense attorneys' motion to intervene states the sanctity of plea talks would be undermined if U.S. 
District Judge Kenneth Marra in West Palm Beach allows the correspondence to be used in the third-party 
civil action brought by the alleged victims. 
New York litigator Jay Lefkowitz and Boston criminal defense attorney Martin G. Weinberg joined Black in 
the motion filed April 7. 
The fight over the records comes amid claims that the defense strong-armed prosecutors into a cushy deal for 
Epstein. 
The release of these letters and the precedent it would establish would have a severe chilling effect on the 
lawyers' ability to engage in candid settlement discussions with the government in future cases, the 13-page 
motion reads. Indeed, to the extent such written correspondence is deemed discoverable by third parties, 
criminal defense attorneys and the government's lawyers alike would lose the ability to negotiate such 
agreements. 
The alleged victims maintain evidence shows Epstein molested more than 30 girls from 2001 to 2007, luring 
them to his Palm Beach mansion on the pretext of giving him a massage. 
As part of the nonprosecution agreement, he pleaded guilty to a state charge of soliciting sex with a minor and

served 13 months of an 18-month sentence. He resurfaced recently in New York and has become the subject 
of news reports about socializing with Britain's Prince Andrew. 
Personal Inquiry 
The women say the nonprosecution agreement should be scuttled and Epstein should be open to federal 
charges because they were not adequately consulted as required under the Crimes Victims Rights Act. They 
seek disclosure of all correspondence between Epstein's attorneys and the government, claiming it would show 
prosecutors failed to meet their obligation to keep them and other victims informed. 
The U.S. attorney's office argued in a 54-page response April 8 to the women's lawsuit that the law does not 
apply because no federal charges were filed against the financier, only a state charge. 
The women were denied access to the letters in their civil lawsuit against Epstein, which was settled. The 
motion by Black, Lefkowitz and Weinberg said there is no doubt the women aim to disseminate the material 
to news outlets. They urge Marra to decline the invitation to fuel the media campaign against Mr. Epstein. 
Epstein has had plenty of trouble avoiding the media of late. Reports about his friendship with Prince Andrew 
sparked a March 20 three-page letter from Alex Acosta, U.S. attorney when the agreement was reached, to the 
Daily Beast online news site. 
Acosta said the federal government intervened in Epstein's case at request of police because the Palm Beach 
state attorney's office was going to offer him a deal with no jail time. Acosta said his office secured, through 
the nonprosecution agreement, jail time for Epstein, his plea to a sex crime against a minor and his designation 
as a sex offender. 
Acosta's letter said Epstein's defense team was not happy with these conditions and tried to hire private 
investigators to delve into the personal lives of prosecutors assigned to the case as a way of undermining the 
office's insistence on conditions that went beyond the state case. 
Defense counsel investigated individual prosecutors and their families, looking for personal peccadilloes that 
may provide a basis for disqualification, Acosta wrote. 
Sources say the efforts targeted Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jeffrey Sloman and Ann Marie Villafalia. Acosta 
refused to remove them. 
Acosta, now the law dean at Florida International University in Miami, said he had no comments beyond his 
letter. The U.S. attorney's office also declined to comment. 
Sloman, who took over as acting U.S. attorney when Acosta became FIU's law dean, later joined the Ferraro 
Law Firm in Coral Gables, said only, Alex's recollection is correct. 
Black, in an interview with the Daily Business Review, denied Acosta's assertions that the Epstein defense 
team examined the prosecutors. 
We don't investigate prosecutors, he said. As far as I know that wasn't done.

Daily Business Review: Jeffrey Epstein's attorneys fight to keep plea discussions private Page 3 of 3 
Black also denied there was any effort to pressure the U.S. attorney's office to back off Epstein. 
It is absurd to say that the target of a federal criminal investigation could put undo pressure on the United 
States, the government, the Department of Justice, the U.S. attorney's office and the FBI, Black said. 
Weinberg, who challenged a Justice Department policy of seizing e-mail through secret subpoenas to Internet 
service providers, also said to his knowledge no private investigator was hired. Lefkowitz, a partner at 
Kirkland & Ellis in New York who drafted President George W. Bush's policy on stem cell research, did not 
return a phone call for comment by deadline. Black and Weinberg said they still represent Epstein. 
Fodder For Litigation 
The motion to intervene does not claim the letters are attorney-client privilege and makes a point of saying 
Epstein reserves his right to intervene individually. 
Weinberg said turning the confidential correspondence over to the Jane Does would violate the federal rules of 
evidence and cast a chill over the criminal defense bar, which would rightly be concerned that anything they 
tell the government could boomerang into civil litigation against clients. 
Neither party expected or believed these letters would later become a source of information that would be 
used for any other purpose, Weinberg said. We believe the issue raised before Judge Marra has importance 
beyond just the litigation between the government and the Jane Does. 
Bradley J. Edwards, a partner with Farmer Jaffe Weissing Edwards Fistos & Lehrman in Fort Lauderdale, 
represents the Jane Does. He didn't want to get into his planned response to the motion to intervene but said 
Acosta's letter will not affect the case. 
Edwards agreed with Acosta that the Palm Beach state attorney's office faltered on the Epstein case. A call to 
the Palm Beach State Attorney's Office spokeswoman was not returned by deadline. 
There has never been a stronger case for the state to prosecute, and the case should have been prosecuted by 
the state, Edwards said. The state totally dropped the ball, but once the feds took the case over, they too 
unfortunately dropped the ball. 
Edwards refutes Acosta's position that the U.S. attorney's office was hampered by the lack of a clear interstate 
nexus required for federal prosecution. Evidence indicates Epstein flew on his private plane out of state with 
the intent to engage in sex with minors and used his telephone, a means of interstate commerce, to set up his 
rendezvous with underage girls, Edwards said. 
Edwards contends the U.S. attorney's office caved. 
They identified a bunch of victims of sexual abuse and decided to align themselves with a bad guy and keep 
the victims in the dark about the secretive nonprosecution agreement they were giving to Epstein, he said.

Some of Epstein’s victims will finally have an opportunity to testify for the first time as part of the Dec. 4 case in state court in Palm Beach County. It pits
Fort Lauderdale attorney Bradley Edwards against Epstein, who had accused Edwards of malfeasance in his representation of several victims.

Jack Scarola, the attorney representing Edwards, said Epstein should be held accountable for his unrelenting attacks against Edwards — as well as others
who were involved in his case.

“We are going to demonstrate through this case that no one — no matter how much money they have — can abuse children and then attempt to bully
those who come to the defense of children,” said Scarola, a former state prosecutor.

Florida and beyond

Few people had as much insight into Epstein’s lifestyle — and its international reach — as Virginia Roberts. By age 16, Roberts had lived a life that was
beyond that of most high school girls.

At 11, she says, she was sexually molested by a family friend. At 12, she was smoking pot and skipping school. At 13, she was in and out of foster homes, and
at 14, she was on the street.

In Miami, the runaway became a captive of a 65-year-old sex trafficker, Ron Eppinger. For months, she says, she was sexually abused, kept in an
apartment and pimped out to pedophiles. After his indictment in 2000 on trafficking charges, Roberts returned to West Palm Beach and tried to heal.

Mistake# 7: Correcting a student who is doing something wrong
by telling him what to do instead

Mistake #8: Thinking that a student remembers what you just
taught him

Now, let’s consider these teaching mistakes one by one.

Mistake #1: Assuming that there is some kind of learning other
than learning by doing

All of us, teachers or not, believe that we can teach by telling.
When I say that people learn by doing, people think: Yes, maybe most
of the time, but you also can learn by being told. The issue is what it
means to learn, of course. I define learning in terms of the cognitive
processes that are exercised during the attempt to learn.

This means that when I say the following: “You cannot learn by
being told,” what I mean is that that you cannot learn to do any cog-
nitive process by being told. I can tell you that George Washington
never told a lie, and you could learn that and you could make it some-
thing that you now believe. But this is not learning in the sense that
it doesn’t make you more capable of doing something because you
have learned it. Subject-based education relies on learning by telling
because for most of the things that are being taught, there is no other
way to learn them. How else could you learn that George Washington
never told a lie? By observation? By historical research? We learn this
by being told. But we do not learn cognitive processes by simply being
told. We learn them by practicing them.

This confusion is why teaching in its current form, with a teacher
in front of a class, exists at all. Without this focus on subject-based
education, it could not exist. And, this is why parents never stand in
front of their kids teaching them things. Cognitive processes cannot
be altered by telling.

So, we have rule #1 for teaching:

There has been some contraction in business volumes in the UAE over the last few
months. The harshest effect of this seems to have been on small and medium-sized
enterprises. Is there any plan to revitalize the small business sector, which is usually co
nsidered the growth engine of an economy?

We are fully aware of the vital role of the small and medium enterprises sector; I believe that the contraction it
has suffered is only temporary. Our success in overcoming the worst will positively reflect on the overall
economy, including major enterprises as well as small and medium-sized ones. Our position is far better than
other countries, and encouraging economic indicators have just started to emerge. Enhanced liquidity levels
across the banking sector, banks’ resumption of credit operations, increased number of investors eager to seize
investment opportunities in the real estate sector and financial markets, are among many other positive and
encouraging indicators.

One property that may prove harder to extract cash from:

Cohen's palatial Park Avenue home. Purchased for $5 million in

2005, the sprawling 10th-floor unit used to be three separate
apartments and has four bedrooms. It could be worth $8 million
or more, based on comparable sales.

In late 2015, the Cohens moved the property into a type of
trust designed to limit tax exposure when transferring property
to heirs. The trust structure has tax consequences for typical
mortgages, but those could be dodged if the Cohens took out an
interest-only loan.

In February 2016, Laura Cohen, in her role as a trustee of
the new entity, did just that, taking out a revolving $500,000
home-equity line of credit against the property from First
Republic Bank. It was the first time the family had borrowed
against the property since a loan of more than $2 million 11
years earlier when they bought it, property records show.

There are also Cohen's in-laws, who may pitch in to a

legal-defense effort. Fima and Ania Shusterman, who haven't

responded to requests for comment, emigrated from Ukraine and
built their own taxi empire over decades while helping Cohen
expand his across New York and Chicago. They own three units in
Trump World Tower. In an indication of their willingness to help
those close to them, the couple have lent $20 million to another
Ukranian couple in the taxi business, Semyon and Yasya Shtayner

Chapter Twenty-Five

I had hoped that in facing down the nuclear threat from Iran, I could nudge Bibi
towards a reengagement with the Palestinians — not with great enthusiasm, but as
an act of pure political pragmatism. There were only two ways we could stop the
Iranians from getting a nuclear weapon: for the Americans to make sure that
happened, or not to hinder Israel from doing so. Either was going to be a lot harder
if there was tension with the new American president, Barack Obama, over moves
to revive the peace process with the Palestinians.

I didn’t expect it to be put to the test so soon. Yet within weeks of our taking
office, President Obama launched an effort to restart negotiations, declaring it
“intolerable” that there was still not a Palestinian state. He was explicit about what
Israel needed to do. In an Oval Office meeting with Bibi in May 2009, and in a
speech in Cairo the next month, he called for a total halt to settlement construction
on the West Bank. US opposition to settlements wasn’t new. For years,
Washington’s position had been that they represented “an obstacle to peace.” The
main issue wasn’t even the creation of new settlements, since there had been
almost none in recent years. It was the expansion of existing ones. The Jewish
population on the West Bank had been about 190,000 when I became Prime
Minister. In the decade since then, it had grown to 315,000 — more than half-a-
million if you counted the Jewish neighborhoods built inside the expanded, post-
1967 boundaries of Jerusalem. The expansion — “natural growth” as we
euphemistically described it to the Americans — was what President Obama now
wanted Bibi to end.

I had no illusions about how hard it would be to get him to agree. With each
passing year since Camp David, the pro-settlement right wing in Israel had become
more confident and influential. In a way, the settlers and their supporters —
passionately devoted to a “Greater Israel” and opposed to any Palestinian state —
had become the 21*-century equivalent of the kibbutz avant-garde of a half-century
earlier. The rise of Avigdor Lieberman’s Yisrael Beiteinu party was the latest sign,
alongside a move rightward within the Likud itself. For Bibi to say yes to a
settlement freeze would mean putting aside his own short-term political interests in
recognition of the importance of our alliance with the Americans. He’d actually
done this, twice, during his first term as Prime Minister. He had agreed to give the

that’s one of the fuels of this populist revolt that we’re seeing as the tea party. So I think
there are many, many measures, particularly about getting the banks on better footing,
making them address all the liquid assets they have. I think you need a real clean-up of
the banks balance sheets.

In addition, I think you really need to go back and make banks do what they do:
Commercial banks lend money, and investment banks invest in entrepreneurs and to get
away from this trading — you know, the hedge fund securitization, which they’ve all
become basically trading operations and securitizations and not put capital back and
really grow businesses and to grow the economy. So I think it’s a whole area that just —
and I will tell you, the underpinning of this populist revolt is the financial crisis of 2008.
That revolt, the way that it was dealt with, the way that the people who ran the banks and
ran the hedge funds have never really been held accountable for what they did, has fueled
much of the anger in the tea party movement in the United States.

Questioner: Thank you.

Bannon: Great question.

Questioner: Hello, Mr. Bannon. I’m Mario Fantini, a Vermonter living in Vienna,
Austria. You began describing some of the trends you're seeing worldwide, very
dangerous trends, worry trends. Another movement that I’ve been seeing grow and
spread in Europe, unfortunately, is what can only be described as tribalist or neo-nativist
movement — they call themselves Identitarians. These are mostly young, working-class,
populist groups, and they’re teaching self-defense classes, but also they are arguing
against — and quite effectively, I might add — against capitalism and global financial
institutions, etc. How do we counteract this stuff? Because they're appealing to a lot of
young people at a very visceral level, especially with the ethnic and racial stuff.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012855.txt,"What seems most critical to the pathology is the lack of control which leads to repetitive lying over a long
period of time. Compared with run of the mill liars, pathological liars often seem unaware that they are
lying and do so many times a day as part of their daily habit. In the same way that birds have to fly and
fish have to swim, pathological liars have to lie. If pathological liars are unaware of their lies and
incapable of controlling themselves, then they are not responsible for the harm they impose. They have no
choice. Unbeknownst to them, their brain has been hijacked by a creative fiction writer. They are
following a script, but have no sense of its author.

Dike’s summary is based on a loose and eclectic set of clinical observations. Several clinicians
thus debate whether habitual lying counts as pathology and thus, whether it is worthy of an entry into the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. For example, how can the clinician establish
pathology given the evidence that healthy people lie about twice a day, physicians lie about 40-80% of the
time to help their patients gain better health care, and lying within an experimental context increases as
subjects generate more lies? My own sense is that despite the difficulty of defining the pathology with
precision, clinicians have identified individuals that lie with every breath and often identify psychopaths
by their calculated conning. These observations sharpen our approach to understanding the seeds of deceit
and self-deception in the non-pathological condition. For example, does excessive and sustained lying
stem from a specific problem associated with recognizing the truth or does it grow from a more general
problem with self-control? Or, does the habitual liar suffer from an emotional deficit such that when he or
she lies, there are no feelings of guilt and shame? Without these emotional regulators, it is impossible to
learn from the harm caused. When healthy people distort the truth, they often feel bad. When healthy
people think about distorting the truth, they often think about the potential harm and then silence the
option to lie in favor of the truth. Perhaps unhealthy people never hear these emotional alarms. The mind
sciences have begun addressing these issues.

The American neuroscientist Adrian Raine reported that individuals with a history of repeated
lying and con-artistry have structurally different brains from non-liars, including individuals with a
history of anti-social problems. Habitual liars have more white matter in the frontal lobes, but less grey
matter. White matter consists of axons and myelin. The axon 1s the part of a nerve cell that carries
information. It is like the electric cable that runs from the power station. Myelin covers the axon, at least
in healthy individuals. It is like the fat around your bones, protecting and insulating neurons. Fat helps
keep us warm. Myelin helps neurons transmit information. The grey matter consists of nerve cell bodies,
which lack myelin. The function of grey matter is to connect up the neurons to transmit information
between areas of the brain.

Raine suggests that the increase in white matter gives habitual liars the upper hand when it comes

to lying, helping them suppress the truth, control their emotions, and mind read what others believe and

all-of-us that made even vicious killers appear sympathetic. Is this what the
Charismatic New Testament Book Churches mean by redemption through
forgiveness of others, requiring the genuine sincerity of this thought before
qualifying for Communion? Is this Christ’s undemanding gift of grace as in Romans
4: where Paul observed that all of us fall short of the full glory of God unless justified
freely by His grace. Was this the New Testament’s spiritual technological advance
from the Old Testament’s and Koran’s eye-for-an-eye? Did this chemically triggered
transcendent experience differ significantly from the supernatural transformation of
individuals by the Holy Spirit of Christian revivalist teachings? Martin Marty,
University of Chicago’s Professor of Modern Church History, dates the
institutionalization of this personal transformation in the United States to the post-
Civil War period. Did this mean that the mysteriously selfless love of Christian
agape and the altruism of E.O. Wilson’s sociobiology lay waiting in the brain and
could appear spontaneously, by grace, without lawful directive, repetitive recitation
or the discipline of catechism?

As one might have suspected, the urgency of my inner and outer search for a
new spiritual ecology of mind was driven by more personal needs. My spiritual
hunger was made acute a couple of years before our laboratory’s DMT discovery

with my graduate student wife and two young sons. A testicular lump was an
accidental discovery made while showering. After surgical biopsy and radical lymph
node dissection, the professor of urology gave me a diagnosis of right testicular
choriocarcinoma. All by itself, my testicle had given birth to a mass containing all the
embryological tissues of a fetus, and had thrown in some maternal placental cells

Unlike now, when the group of testicular neoplasms are treated

successfully with a high survival rate (think Lance Armstrong), at that time, follow up
research of this young man’s disease by the Army Medical Corps promised a five-
year survival rate of only 5% to 10%. The news filled me with fear and the ensuing

hopeless resignation detached me from life with a dread broken up only by

intent, so if you have evidence to support this assertion, we would like to see and discuss it.

The story concerns your actions towards students while a professor of physics at Case Western Reserve
University, as well as your conduct in non-academic settings as a prominent figure in the skeptics movement. |
am reporting this story along with two of my colleagues on the science desk, Azeen Ghorayshi and Virginia
Hughes.

Our story is about several allegations of sexual misconduct dating from 2006 to 2016 (see full details below).
Our reporting also goes into how the various institutions you have been affiliated with — Case Western,
Arizona State University, the Australian National University, the New College of the Humanities, and the Center
for Inquiry, for which you serve as an honorary member of the board of directors — have handled complaints
and concerns about your behavior during this time.

Our story is corroborated by emails, university documents, official complaints, testimony from victims and
eyewitnesses, and interviews with more than two dozen of your current and former academic colleagues,
students, and peers in the skeptics movement.

| wanted to offer you the opportunity to comment and/or respond to the main facts we plan to publish. If you
wish to comment on any of the below findings, we need to hear from you as soon as possible. We are
planning on publishing our story Tuesday morning, Eastern US Time.

Based on our reporting, this is what we plan to publish:

Incident 1:

° In November of 2006, at an event launching the new Center for Inquiry in Washington D.C., you met a
volunteer for CFI D.C.

° At the event, you asked for her business card. Later, you followed her as she was leaving and asked
her if she was “of age.”

° Later, you emailed her to invite her to dinner.

° You planned to dine with her in the restaurant at the Washington D.C. hotel where you were staying.

° You told her to come up to your room first because you needed to finish some work.

° In your hotel room, you seemed in no rush to leave. You ordered a cheese plate, and later champagne,
despite her suggestion that you go down to dinner.

° You then made a comment about her eye makeup, getting very close to her face.

° You then lifted her by her arms, and pushed her onto the bed beneath you, forcibly kissing her and
trying to pull down the crotch of her tights.

° She struggled to push you off her.

° You said, “When | was in college | could never get a girl that looked like you.”

° When you pulled out a condom, she got out from under you. She said “I have to go,” and rushed out of
the room.

Incident 2:

° In an incident that occurred in fall of 2007 while you were a physics professor at Case Western Reserve

University, a student tried to talk to you about her plans after graduation. You mentioned to her how tough it
must be to have all the other physics majors asking her out on dates.

House of Noble Man
Oct 18, 2010 04:06:00 PM by Sarah Bailey

| love the extraordinary and intriguing exhibitions which one encounters around the edges of Frieze. 2009's The
Age of the Marvellous at One Marylebone (curated by AVA) was one such discovery - dark and theatrical - which
stayed with me all year...

This year's House of Noble Man (a collaboration between the Saatchi Gallery and Channel 4's New Sensations), is
another spectacular show of a very different flavour mounted in No. 2 Cornwall Terrace, a gleaming showcase of
super-prime real-estate. (| attended on the opening night and was treated to a tour of two other oligarch-ready
show mansions at No.6 and 11 Cornwall Terrace, by a dashing Knight Frank estate agent by the name of Darren
Daggers... Quite surreal, but, of course, an incredibly resonant statement about the current art market).

Back at No. 2 Cornwall Terrace, House of Noble Man curated by Victoria Golembiovskaya and artist-of-the-
moment Wolfe Von Lenkiewicz mixes work from the giants of modern art - Cezanne and Picasso - with some
dazzling and provocative contemporary pieces plus, of course, Channel 4's New Sensations discoveries.

| loved the filigree Cement Truck sculpture by Wim Delvoye (the Belgian conceptual artist probably best-known
for his work in the 90s involving the tattooing of live pigs), Rachel Whiteread's dolls house chess set and New
Sensation Elizabeth Jordan's dream-like kinetic installation, which she is showing in an upper bedroom. Of course,
there's nothing like a Frieze party to lure out London's finest exhibitions and | was very pleased to meet showgoer
Philip Levine, who uses his bald pate (bejeweled on this occasion as though he is wearing a Swarovski swim cap)
as his canvas. His next show, he informs me, is being sponsored by Gilette...

House of Noble Man is on until
Wednesday October 20, so do try and
see it. Entry is free, but you have to
book an appointment.

TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031186.txt,"﻿California woman accusing Donald Trump of raping her when she
was 13 years old to break her silence
The woman behind a potentially damaging lawsuit accusing Donald Trump of raping her when she was an
underage teen will break her silence today, her lawyer said.
The California woman, known until now as “Jane Doe,” will finally give voice to long-denied allegations
that the Republican presidential nominee sexually assaulted her in New York during a series of sex parties
hosted by alleged billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein in 1994.
The woman filed a lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme Court in June. She is scheduled to speak at a Los
Angeles press conference this afternoon.
She said she was 13 at the time of the alleged attacks.
Lawsuit accusing Trump of raping girl, 13, gets December hearing
“Immediately following this rape, Defendant Trump threatened me that, were I ever to reveal any of the
details of Defendant Trump’s sexual and physical abuse of me, my family and I would be physically
harmed if not killed,” the plaintiff said in an affidavit.
12 photos view gallery
The women accusing Donald Trump of sexual assault
She says that since Trump launched his campaign and received mass media coverage, she has been
“subjected to daily painful reminders of the horrific acts.”
A similar lawsuit by the woman was dismissed by a Los Angeles Federal Court in May.
A lawyer who was representing the woman at the time, Thomas Meagher, said the original suit, which she
filed without the help of an attorney, was dismissed because it cited statutes that did not apply to the case.
Trump campaign manager: There'd be no rape if women were stronger
Alan Garten, vice president and general counsel of the Trump Organization, has said the allegations were
“categorically untrue, completely fabricated and politically motivated.”
Epstein, who is also named as a defendant, has also denied the allegations. Epstein is alleged to have
preyed on dozens of underage girls in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but pleaded guilty to soliciting a
minor in just one case in 2008.
But the woman’s new lawyer, Lisa Bloom, said the case against
Trump cannot be ignored. She has even launched a GoFundMe
page to raise money to support Trump’s sexual assault accusers.
“My law firm will proudly represent any accusers sued by Donald
Trump and crowd fund defense costs, Bloom tweeted. “Can’t wait
to take his deposition!”
Billionaire perv Jeffrey Epstein must testify in victim's
lawsuit
Bloom is the daughter of noted women’s rights lawyer Gloria
Allred.

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011601.txt,"“What the hell is going on?” I replied, in a mix of a shout and a whisper,
since I knew the convoy was getting closer. But within a minute, we spotted the
lead Land Rover, which was soon past us on the way up to the ridge. It was
followed by two large American cars, with the Syrian officers, and then a
trailing security vehicle. It was too late. I was fuming. The convoy had passed
within a couple of yards of us, moving slowly because of the incline. But,
regaining my composure, | realized we’d get another opportunity, when the
officers returned from their inspection visit. We now knew exactly how the
convoy was deployed, and with any luck, the security men would be less alert
by the end of the day. Even better, it would be beginning to get dark, perfect
conditions for the ambush.

But as we were waiting, Amit radioed me with a question from from Dado
and Motta. “Where’s the armored car?” It’s still there, at the bottom of the road,
I told them. “But there’s nothing it can do.” Bibi and his team had it in their
sights. I considered not telling Amit what happened a few minutes later: a
Lebanese shepherd, with a half-dozen sheep, stumbled on us. One of Uzi’s men,
fluent in Arabic, tied the startled man’s arms behind his back, scattered the
sheep, and told him: “It’s fine. Another hour or so, we’ll be gone, and we’ll let
you go.” It turned out to be less than an hour. Forty-five minutes. During which,
not once but twice, Amit told us that Dado and Motta were worried: about the
armored car and now about the shepherd. I assured him everything was fine.
We'd do the operation. The guys in the armored car would be helpless. If all
went well, they might not even know we’d intercepted the convoy. The
shepherd, like us, was just waiting for it to be over so we could all go home.
Minutes later, Amit called again. He told us the convoy was on its way down.
But barely 60 seconds later, he said: “It’s off. Don’t do it. Dado told me to
repeat it twice so you’d understand: do not do the operation.”

When we got back to the command post, not only were Dado and Motta
there. Since Motta was within days of leaving to become Israel’s military
attaché in Washington, they’d been joined by his successor as head of the
northern command, Yitzhak Hofi. Three times, I suggested to Dado that we
speak without my officers present. I did not feel it was nght to have Uzi,
Mookie and Bibi hear me the generals how I felt. But Dado insisted there was
no reason for them to leave.

“This is a serious issue,” I said, trying to keep my emotions in check. “What
happened out there is unacceptable. An effective special-forces unit cannot
operate this way. For the second time in a week, you’ve made us stop an

is as extensive and well-funded as China’s. The ambition of Chinese activity in terms of

the breadth, depth of investment of financial resources, and intensity requires far greater
scrutiny than it has been getting, because China is intervening more resourcefully and
forcefully across a wider range of sectors than Russia. By undertaking activities that have
become more organically embedded in the pluralistic fabric of American life, it has gained a
far wider and potentially longer-term impact.

Summary of Findings

This report, written and endorsed by a group of this country’s leading China specialists and
students of one-party systems is the result of more than a year of research and represents

an attempt to document the extent of China’s expanding influence operations inside the
United States. While there have been many excellent reports documenting specific examples
of Chinese influence seeking,* this effort attempts to come to grips with the issue as a whole
and features an overview of the Chinese party-state United Front apparatus responsible for
guiding overseas influence activities. It also includes individual sections on different sectors
of American society that have been targeted by China. The appendices survey China’s quite
diverse influence activities in other democratic countries around the world.

Among the report’s findings:

e¢ The Chinese Communist party-state leverages a broad range of party, state, and non-state
actors to advance its influence-seeking objectives, and in recent years it has significantly
accelerated both its investment and the intensity of these efforts. While many of the
activities described in this report are state-directed, there is no single institution in China’s
party-state that is wholly responsible, even though the “United Front Work Department”
has become a synecdoche for China’s influence activities, and the State Council
Information Office and CCP® Central Committee Foreign Affairs Commission have
oversight responsibilities (see Appendix: “China’s Influence Operations Bureaucracy”).
Because of the pervasiveness of the party-state, many nominally independent actors—
including Chinese civil society, academia, corporations, and even religious institutions—
are also ultimately beholden to the government and are frequently pressured into service
to advance state interests. The main agencies responsible for foreign influence operations
include the Party’s United Front Work Department, the Central Propaganda Department,
the International Liaison Department, the State Council Information Office, the All-China
Federation of Overseas Chinese, and the Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with
Foreign Countries. These organizations and others are bolstered by various state agencies
such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the
State Council, which in March 2018 was merged into the United Front Work Department,
reflecting that department’s increasing power.

after notice and demand, may file a federal tax lien only against the QSub's or QRS's property
and rights to property. *

Another instance in which a DRE is recognized for federal tax purposes arises when the IRS is
seeking to collect a tax liability from the sole member of a SMLLC. In CCA 199930013, the IRS
Chief Counsel advised that the IRS could not levy on an LLC's assets, because under state law
the sole member of the LLC did not own the property of the LLC. The Chief Counsel stated that
the mere fact that an LLC is disregarded as an entity separate from its sole member (the
taxpayer in that case) for federal tax purposes does not entitle the IRS to disregard the LLC for
collection purposes. “® The Chief Counsel added that state law determines a taxpayer's property
interests for purposes of tax collection, “4 but the IRS could levy on the taxpayer's distributive
interest in the LLC and sell that interest or file suit to foreclose the federal tax lien against the
ownership interest. “8 In addition, depending on the facts of the case, the IRS might collect from
an LLC's assets on the basis that it is the alter ego of its single-member or pursuant to a
nominee or transferee liability theory. “2

TEFRA Rules.

Another exception to the general rule arises in the context of the Code's audit rules for
partnerships, which were enacted by the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982
(TEFRA). TEFRA radically changed the way in which the IRS audits partnerships for errors in
reporting partnership income. 22 TEFRA's basis is found in Section 6221, which provides that “the
tax treatment of any partnership item (and the applicability of any penalty, addition to tax, or
additional amount which relates to an adjustment to a partnership item) shall be determined at
the partnership level.”

Section 6231(a)(1)(B) excludes “small partnerships” from the TEFRA rules by excluding from the
definition of a “partnership” any partnership with ten or fewer partners, each of whom is a U.S.
individual, a C corporation, or an estate of a deceased partner. The small partnership exception
does not apply, however, to a partnership for a tax year if any partner in the partnership during
that tax year is a “pass-thru partner.”°* A pass-thru partner means a partnership, estate, trust,
S corporation, nominee, or other similar person through whom other persons hold an interest in
the partnership. =2

The issue that arises in this context is whether a DRE that is a partner of a partnership is
disregarded when determining whether the small partnership exception to TEFRA applies. The
IRS has looked at this issue on at least two different occasions and, in both cases, treated an
SMLLC as a separate entity. That is, the IRS determined that the SMLLC—not its individual sole
member—was the partner in applying the small partnership exception to the TEFRA audit rules. *2
Because the SMLLC was treated as the partner and was a “pass-thru partner,” as defined in
Section 6231(a)(9), the small partnership exception did not apply in either case.

In CCA 200250012, IRS Chief Counsel reasoned that the statutory language indicated that
Congress intended that the small partnership exception to TEFRA would not apply whenever, as
a factual matter, ownership in the partnership is held through another person, regardless of the
legal classification of that person. Rev. Rul. 2004-88 reached the same result, but the IRS
reasoned there that state law dictated the holding. The IRS based its holding on the fact that the
sole member of the SMLLC partner was not a partner of the partnership under state law; rather,
the IRS found that the sole member held his partnership interest in the partnership indirectly
through the SMLLC (i.e., was an indirect partner via the “pass-thru partner”),

Sharing of Partnership Liabilities under Code Section 752.

409 _ and presumably they will be conferring

But the CVRA already gives victims the right to confer with prosecutors
regarding the important topic of sentencing. It is important to emphasize that my proposal would require prosecutors to give all
relevant information to the victim; in other words, prosecutors would serve as a conduit to the victim, but not a controller of the

victim.

The Advisory Committee declined to adopt my proposal, opining that the prosecutor should remain the victim's source of
information regarding the sentencing process and the contents of the presentence report, and the prosecutor should have
discretion to determine what information from the presentence report should be imparted to the victim. 4!° This reasoning
clashes directly with the CVRA's guiding principle: that victims deserve their own rights in the criminal process. Congress
wanted victims to become participants with rights independent of the government or the defendant ... . 41! For this reason,
the CVRA allows the [*934] victim to assert rights independently of the government. 4!” Senator Kyl explained the victim's
right to independent action directly: [There is no authority for] the government's attorney ... to compromise or co-opt a
victim's right... . The rights provided in this bill are personal to the individual crime victim and it is that crime victim that has
the final word regarding which of the specific rights to assert and when. 413

One of the victim's independent rights includes the opportunity to make sentencing recommendations. 4!4 Congress's
command that victims be independent participants cannot be faithfully implemented if prosecutors control the information
victims receive. If allowed to do so, prosecutors could simply feed the victim information supporting the government's view,
while withholding information undercutting it. +15 Nothing in the CVRA provides any support for this approach. +!°

The Advisory Committee was also concerned that presentence reports are typically treated as confidential, because they
include a great deal of personal information about the defendant ... .. 4!” But this concern was easily handled by my
requirement that prosecutors pass along only relevant contents of the presentence reports. Personal information only
tangentially connected to sentencing issues would not be disclosed. And if personal information about the defendant were
directly connected to sentencing issues, then fairness entitles the victim to that information to formulate a sentencing
recommendation. After all, by the time of sentencing, the defendant has been found guilty, beyond a reasonable doubt, of
harming a victim. By committing a crime against the victim, the defendant has certainly forfeited some privacy interests -
including the chance to keep from the victim information relevant to sentencing. It is also important to recall that this
information is not truly confidential in the sense that no one else [*935] will see it. It has already been disclosed to the

probation officer, defense counsel, the prosecutor, and the judge.

415 The Advisory Committee's view that prosecutors should control what information the victim receives is so fundamentally at odds with the
animating principles of the CVRA that it makes one wonder where it came from. Interestingly the view seems to have originated in a small
subcommittee with a representative from the Justice Department but no crime victims rights representative. See CVRA Subcommittee Memo,
supra note 66, at 1 (noting that Deborah Rhodes, Counselor to the Asst. Atty. Gen. of the Criminal Division, served on the subcommittee
drafting this language).

416 At another point in its memorandum, the CVRA Subcommittee refers to /8 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(6), which provides that nothing in this

"
TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022844.txt,"﻿     	It’s an absurdly vast house, among the largest in Manhattan, but the dining room is windowless, creating a hermetic or stop-time sense, broken only by the household help ferrying in time-of-day-appropriate foods and beverages. 
In sweatshirt, draw-string pants, palm beach slippers, and half glasses, Jeffrey Epstein sits at the head of the table. He spends most of his day in the dining room, remote from the world, in front of a lap top and beside a row of reading glasses (there are a lot of them in case, apparently, he misplaces a pair, but being quite meticulous he never does) advising, or instructing, a startling collection of the rich and powerful, slotted in on an hourly basis. 
The apartness of Epstein’s dining room might seem to offer some buffer in this leveled, angry age for a super rich man who attends to even more fabulously rich men (and the occasional extremely rich woman). On the other hand, with the paparazzi often posted near by, the outside world seem dangerously close too. (Once I arrived for a visit and found several police cars blocking the street and thought the worst—they’d come for Jeffrey. But it was a security detail for a controversial head of state, also visiting him.)
His subject for the morning is “hyper wealth.” His subject is always some rarefied science or wealth, todays topic is how  capital will most likely react to the given global political, economic, and cultural moment. The otherwise baronial dining room is disturbed by an ever-present white board, on which he scribbles calculations and notes, conducting perhaps the world’s most rarified economics class, often to many of the world’s finance ministers and foremost economists. 
Epstein’s apartness or parallel life reflects much of the other-worldly characteristics of the wealth revolution that began in the late 1970s and that continued through the Wall Street boom of the 80s, the tech boom of the 90s—surviving, to often bitter attack, the banking crisis—and that has now seen the emergence of the international billionaire and oligarch class. He has quite turned himself into a hyperbolic representations of this wealth and hence, in a way, become accountable for it.
His own way to riches was to become a voracious  student of the new money, as well as one of its larger than life characters, as it grew to an unanticipated and disruptive scale. His stock in trade is not precisely the making of money, but the corollary issues that arise when money, at a heretofore unimaginable scale ,  in personal hands alters many basic economic and social principles. 
He recounts a dinner he had two nights before. It is, like much of what he does, a conspiracist’s fantasy. The six men at this dinner, all technology entrepreneurs, represented, together, over a  hundred billion dollars. 
“In the past, only governments had this amount of money,” says Epstein conversationally, but making a pedagogical point, “money at a reality altering scale. In fact, it used to be that the rich, reaching a certain point of philanthropy, merely hoped to help make the world a better place, now they want to change the world. Rockefeller and Carnegie were, as examples of social-engineering philanthropy, unique. They alone had such resources and will. Now you have legions of people who have to give away vastly larger amounts than Rockefeller or Carnegie had at their disposal, or might even have imagined. 
“Except that it’s actually hard to give away this kind of wealth, without the always accompanied , unintended consequences, that can cause more problems than you’re solving.” 
Epstein’s long-time business thesis is that the rich know  little about the essence of money. They may know about generating it in their own businesses, but the great sums that  result ,demand an entirely different sort of an intellectual discipline. The Forbes 400, says Epstein, not immune to still exhibiting  an amount of wonder, increased their wealth by over  $500 billion last year, meaning, in effect, that on average every Forbes-list billionaire increased their wealth by  more than a billion only in one year. And, points out the 62-year-old Epstein, they will almost all be dead in 40 years, most well before that, meaning $4.2 trillion, compounding everyday, will have to be eventually change hands. “So, to understand the future, what you have to begin to do is follow the money, not in Watergate-like terms backwards, as in who has gotten it, but forwards to where it will go and who will get it.”
Epstein can find himself echoing aspects of Thomas Piketty on the inequities of the accumulation of wealth (“the divide is between people with assets, which appreciate, and people without assets, who fail to advance—that is, of course, the miracle of compounded interest”), except for the fact that Epstein, knowing the rich, understands a curious point that Piketty doesn’t: “Nobody, nobody, wants to give it all to their children. Everybody now has the modern appreciation that one of the curses of great wealth is that it can make your kids weird .”
Epstein’s position in this private allotment of a decent fraction of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product is not solely  as a philanthropist but as a higher sort of banker or guru or brain—a rich whisperer—making him, in addition to rich himself, arguably, among the most influential people you’ve never heard of. 
Though, likely, you have heard of him, but not for his prowess with high financial abstraction, but for a scandal of such luridness that he is, for a great many,is the new  poster child of the lawlessness of privilege, and for a much smaller but elite circle, the poster child for what can happen when you become the target of a resentful world. He is that Epstein, according to the Daily Mail—among his most frothing-at-the-mouth antagonists—“one of America’s most notorious sex offenders.”

And yet the mighty and powerful, apparently evaluating the nature of disgrace on their own terms, beat a path to his door. It’s a fantastic conclave of influence in his dining room: financiers, billionaires, heads of state, economic ministers.
He surely represents the kind of insiderism that is mostly just a figment in outsiders’ fantasies. Except for the fact that, straining credulity, Epstein is for real. His is an ultimate sort of fantasy of power, wealth, and secrecy. (In 2004, when the then owners of this magazine put it up for sale, I was involved with a group trying to buy it—an effort in which Epstein volunteered to invest $20 million. New York was subsequently sold to another wealthy investor.) 
Without ever being asked to keep what I have heard there off the record, I’ve willingly done so, least I not be invited back. And, too, to protect him. Who would understand Jeffrey? Who could explain him? 
Certainly Epstein’s past encounters with the press (and in many ways with the masses) have been about as disastrous as any could be, helping to open a Pandora’s box of lifestyle vulnerabilities that sent him to jail on a prostitution charge in 2008. 
And yet here he is, in his 50,000 square foot mansion, dispensing advice to world leaders and business titans. 
Indeed, Epstein has been advising one the worlds largest foundations  on a new way to increase its already vast clout  by adding funds from other wealthy individuals that can use the foundation resources (the Gates Foundation now employs 1,200 people), but which can be directed to separate causes and goals. And it is some of the hyper wealthy that  at the end of the summer began prodding Epstein to begin a process of public rehabilitation.
Hence, as part of an effort to get “out in front” of the unfavorable notice that might greet the public association with him, Epstein agreed to several on the record conversation with me, in the hope, and promise of a second chance, , that, after five years since his release from jail  and relative peace, he might be able to leaven his reputation. And with the hope on my part of learning more about how and if the rich are different than you and me (although we can fairly dispense with the if).

Then, just before the New Year, Epstein forwarded me a heads-up email that Alan Dershowtiz, one of Epstein’s long time friends—they have a bickering brotherly relationship—and occasional legal advisors, had received from a reporter at Politico and forwarded to Epstein. The Politico reporter had been following Epstein-related court filings (there is a determined contingent of Epstein reporters) and found a new one added to an old law suit with some rather jaw-dropping claims.
Six years after the original suit, a Florida lawyer was now seeking to add new plaintiffs to the old case. This new filing was accompanied by allegations connecting a catch-all of bold-faced names associated with Epstein more than ten years ago, including Dershowtiz and Britain’s Prince Andrew, to a “sex slave” ring—indeed, that Epstein’s purported sex slaves had had sex with Dershowitz and the Prince at Epstein’s command. 
This seemed to me to be merely a desperate, even comic-book, filing—just a lawyer trying to revive a dead case. I responded to Epstein that I doubted this would be seen as credible by anyone.
Epstein, who sometimes seems to have an out-of-body attitude to his own fate and bad press, said he thought it might be “quite a show.”
Two days later, the Daily Mail, which has become the effective ground zero in the English language for anti-privilege, and moral opprobrium (the more salacious the better), and whose editor Paul Dacre has a long time feud with Prince Andrew, put the story on its front page. (Epstein also has a long relationship with the family of disgraced press baron, Robert Maxwell, another reliable target of the British press.) Flimsy and far-fetched court filings in the U.S. by settlement-hungry plaintiffs might be discounted by skeptical U.S. reporters, but, the U.K. media, constrained by onerous rules about legal proceedings in the U.K., promptly went into tabloid frenzy (even the normally sniffy Guardian, in full anti- royal and anti- billionaire fever, joined the tabloid show) and effectively exported the story back to the U.S., where Epstein’s connection to Bill Clinton, and, hence as a shadow over Hillary, became the news. 
“I told you so” said Epstein.

There is Epstein in his inner world, trying, quite ostrich like, not to look out. Little beyond his strict realm seems palatable or even in a sense familiar to him. He’s a foreigner out here. Not too long ago, I met him for lunch in the West Village, the first time in more than ten years, he said, he’d been out to lunch in a restaurant (a not particularly pleasant experience for him and we were done in  under 30 minutes). 
Then there is the outside world pressed to the glass, appalled and titillated by the monster inside the big house—a kind of Boo Radley of the Upper East Side. I have taken friends by the Epstein mansion, and the reaction to its other-worldly size in Manhattan is almost always the same: a gasp. Press accounts, seldom supplying new information, ever recycle and repeat the mysterious (and monstrous) billionaire mythology, with brief glimpses of him stepping out of the house (the same photos endlessly republished), and the assumption of depravity inside.
In fact, the life in the house, without wife or children or conventional domestic demeanor, in some way conforms to the most scripted fantasies: a life somewhere between Daddy Warbucks and Eyes Wide Shut.
The domesticity of the house, and the background of Epstein’s problems, centers around a group of young women who act as his support staff and companions. Some have worked for him for many years, marrying, having children, and continuing as part of his business and household infrastructure. One woman, on an afternoon when I was there, recently married, had just returned from an around the world honeymoon that Epstein had arranged for her. Some are his romantic interests. His present girl friend is in dental school. One former girlfriend, Eva Andersson Dubin, a Swedish model and Miss Universe finalist, became a doctor and married hedge funder Glen Dubin and together they finance the Dubin Breast Center at Mount Sinai Hospital. Most at one time will travel with him to his other floating residences—the ranch in New Mexico, a vast apartment in Paris, the Island in the Caribbean, the house in Palm Beach. 
This is so outside of conventional living or staffing or romantic relationships that it is hard to describe in a straightforward or straight-faced way. It sometimes seems part of Epstein’s implicit challenge: not just look at me, but can you even believe what you see? Or it seems he is just oblivious to what others are thinking. A willful and perhaps fatal tone deafness. 
But Hefnerian prurience can also be quite businesslike: poised young women in a mansion on the Upper East Side with various office responsibilities are really not that different from any of the art galleries in the surrounding neighborhood. 
Epstein’s young women mingle freely with his powerful guests, not so much as hostess or, in tabloid language, harem-like (or as “sex slaves”), but often as attentive students (that, of course, might be regarded as having its own fetish-like attraction).
Not long ago, Epstein invited me to sit in on a day of presentations to him in his dining room by various “quants.” Quant theory involves making investments based solely on mathematical and statistical models. This method can often have uncanny predictive powers. But the problem is it doesn’t scale very well—the market, having discerned a pattern of successful investing, quickly copies and discounts the advantages of the strategy, . Epstein’s effort was to identify, dissect and choose  a dozen or so promising algorithms (each quant is effectively hawking his secret sauce algorithm) and invest up to $5 million with each. I knew paltry little about this and so rather found myself identifying with the young women to whom Epstein was explaining the basic math and mechanics—out of my league, but grateful for the lesson.
The Epstein house/office is, by careful design, exclusive and club like, part hang out, part secret society. Along with the difficulty in explaining why, even after his jail term, the rich and powerful continued to beat a path to his door, it’s also notable in the fixed hierarchy of who comes to whose turf, that everybody, when they went to see Epstein, comes to him.
A week in late September, U.N. week as it happened, began, on Sunday, at Epstein’s house with a colloquial for billionaires—Gates, Mort Zuckerman, and Peter Thiel [TK].
Epstein, preternaturally responsive to both the price of oil and to the politics of the middle of east, entertained that evening a delegation from Qatar, including Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim, the foreign minister. Hamad, indeed, lives across the street in a similarly furnished house—he and Epstein have the same decorator. Epstein, in his relaxed and amused manner, kept prodding: “Why are you financing the bad guys? What do you get out of that?” 
The Qatarians, in some mild diplomatic discomfort, seemed most worried that their bid for the World Cup might be compromised by bribery allegations.
At 9:00 next morning, Epstein is joined for breakfast in the dining room by Reid Weingarten, who’s represented among other fat cats in trouble, Worldcom’s Bernie Ebbers and Goldman Sach’s Lloyd Blankfein and is one of attorney general Eric Holder’s closest friends. Weingarten, horse, with a cold, and dejected, is just back from a failed defense of former Connecticut Governor John Rowland. 
After a blow by blow of the trial, there’s a discussion of the Qartarian’s visit—Epstein is serving chocolate made from pistachios grown on the Sheikh’s farm—and speculation about who actually controls ISIS. 
“Why?” I asked Weingarten, when Epstein briefly steps out of the room, “do some many people keep coming back here, everything considered.”
“Why we camp out here? I guess because there’s no place like it.” 
Epstein summons in the next person cooling his heels in the ante-room. It’s a young man named Brock Pierce, a former child actor, and dotcom high flyer—a principle in a gaming company called DEN, a notorious dotcom burnout, with its own sex scandal—who is now a leading investor in Bitcoin. He describe himself as the “one of the most active investors in the field.”
And, indeed, is the first clear explanation I actually get about Bitcoin. It is so good that Epstein stops him and checks to see if his next appointment is here. And seconds later, Larry Summers, the former treasury secretary and President of Harvard, enters the dining room. Summers, off Diet Coke, digs deep into the Sheikh’s chocolates, focuses in on the Bitcoin investor.
“Okay,” he says, after listening for a bit, “I have opportunities here. But an additional feature of my decision problem roughly speaking is that the worst that could happen to you is that you could lose all the money you put into it. Whereas I could go from being seen as a figure of some probity and some intelligence to being a figure of much less intelligence and much less probity…”
“Well,” says Pierce in some dramatic understatement, “it is true that you are going to have some low quality characters playing early in the space…”
That evening, there is a small cocktail party, which includes the former Prime Minister of Australian, Kevin Rudd, and Thorbjørn Jaglandthe head of the Noble Peace Prize Committee, who offers an affable, but general scathing, critique of U.S. diplomacy (and a brief defense of Obama’s Peace Prize award) and to whom Epstein offers a ride back to Europe on his jet. 
The next morning, it’s Ehud Barack, the former Israeli Prime Minister and Israel, for breakfast. Barack is, over his omelet, able to defend both Obama and Putin. Then Kathy Ruemmler, who has just left her job as White House Counsel joins. She is already in the mix as a possible next attorney general, but, in fact, will withdraw after considering her options. 
Larry Summers wife, Elisa New, drops by. She teaches American poetry at Harvard and is putting together a proposal for a series on poetry that WGBH in Boston may produce and Epstein is advising on where she might go for added support (he also makes mince meat of her budget). 
There follows the former head of the UN Security Council, Hardeep Purie, and then head of the central bank of Kazakhstan, Kairat Kelimbetov. 
. Then Martin Nowak a Professor of Biology and Mathematics and Director of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard, the institute that Epstein has funded with $30 million. Part of Nowak’s research has to do with trying to “describe cancer mathematically.” Epstein preempts Nowak’s explanation (which I’m not quite getting): “Think of cancer the same way as you think of a terrorist group. The NSA has been able to thwart a great number of terrorism acts by intercepting communication signals from one terrorist to another. That same dynamic, a form of signal intelligence, of finding a terrorist in Europe, can be used to intercept communication between cancer sells. Cancer cells merely communicate in protean code rather than electronic code. If you can decode what the signals are saying you can jam those signal between terrorist calls—essentially wipe out their cell phones. Likewise if you can decode biological signals you can jam them too, that’s the holy grail.”
Then Richard Azel, a Nobel prize winner in physiology. Then Ron Baron who, in his Baron Fund, has $26 billion under management. Then Josh Harris the co-founder of Apollo Global Management ($164 billion under management) and owner of the New Jersey Devils and the Philadelphia 76ers.

Perhaps it’s just the ultimate feminist nightmare: Men (and a few more that a few women) continue to come to Epstein’s because—no matter their public bows to modern manners—they simply don’t care that he offends every aspect of reconstructed gender and political sensibilities. In private, it remains a man’s world—a rich man’s world.
Or, it’s a guilty pleasure. People who know Jeffrey exchange “Jeffrey” stories. “That’s Jeffrey,” says Mort Zuckerman, the real estate billionaire and publisher of the Daily News (ever vitriolic in its coverage of Epstein), with a twinkle in his eye and obvious enjoyment, to tales of Epstein escapades. It is an outréness that Epstein seems delighted to cultivate. In his Paris apartment, 10,000 square feet on the Avenue Foch, a neighborhood otherwise occupied by foreign potentates, there is a stuffed baby elephant in his living room—that is, the elephant in the room. (Epstein says too it’s a reminder of his genetic engineering initiatves  that are inspired by the fact that  elephants have 23 copies of tumor suppressor genes, never getting cancer in the first place.  while  humans have only 1.)  The single book on his bedside table is Lolita (he is, beyond the joke, a great Nobokov fan).
Or, in a more sophisticated view, it’s a two tier understanding of the world. There is a media version of the world, in which most of us live  and largely accept, and are certainly influenced by. And then there are those people who live in the reality and therefore know that the media version is mostly bunk. If the media trumpets  it, it is likely that some version of the opposite is true. I might guess too that for many of his visitors there’s an order of identification: there but for the grace of God. Any hyper-prominent person might, at any time, himself also run afoul of prosecutors, the political moment, the media, or the Internet hoi polloi. 
In this view, Epstein is a sort of Dreyfus of the rich.
And then there is the glue of wealth. Once, at lunch in the Epstein dinning room with Bill Richardson, the former Governor of New Mexico, and past Presidential aspirant, when Epstein left the room for a few minutes, I asked the obvious question, the one everybody asks each other, “How did you meet Jeffrey?” Richardson seemed surprised: “Jeffrey,” he said, as though stating what should have been perfectly obvious, “is one of the largest landowners in New Mexico.”
And then there is Epstein’s yet more structural explanation as to why after jail and with continuing tabloid infamy he can maintain his valued place. It comes back, not unexpectedly, to the nature or the needs of money:
“At a certain level of finance, almost everyone is attached to an  institutional . You are part of government,  you want to be in government, or you are connected to a major bank or other portfolio, or you have fundamental  relationships with distinct corporations or industries. Because of my  more colorful past, I have none of that. I have no restrictive  institutional ties which makes me in some sense one of the few wholly independent sources of information and truly independent  brokers. That’s the usefulness of disgrace.”
And then there is too, that he is right. Since I began working on this piece in September, Epstein predictions about the price of oil, yen, ruble, and euro have all born out. ((If I had invested $100,000 the way Epstein said I should in early September, by the end of January I would have made $TK million. Alas, I did not invest.)
And something else, which perhaps also surely accounts for Epstein’s continuing relationships with the rich and powerful: 
Most everyone who is now of a certain age and certain ambition and certain status grew up in, and found they were temperamentally suited to, the new age of wealth that started in the late 1970s. A meritocracy on steroids, or, as Vanity Fair would baldly and ingratiatingly dub it, the new establishment, an increasingly parallel world, a self-invented one, at further and further remove from the ordinary one. Epstein is just one version, albeit picaresque, as well as louche, of this shared story. 

He often tells, with some obvious marvel, his middle class to riches tale: born in 1953 in Coney Island, father works for the city’s Parks Department, mother a housewife.
 His sport, the captain of the math team at Lafayette High school.  HE goes on to Cooper Union where the tuition is free. He drops out after two years and begins taking classes at the NYU’s Courant Institute of Mathematics. Then, without a college degree, and  a sleight of hand, gets a job teaching math and physics at Dalton in 1974. (A few years ago, during a chance encounter with a former Dalton math department chairman, Margo Gumport, I asked her about Epstein. She said he was the most brilliant math teacher at Dalton in her 50-year career and that she had often wondered what had become of him.)
It’s his first exposure to the wealthy. They have, he concludes, just as many problems as the people in Coney Island, just different ones, almost invariably involving children ,divorce and money. “I found it as interesting as a physics experiment,” he recalled recently as we chatted about his life. “It did not really involve me. I could just stand back and watch the experiment unfold.”
Dalton fathers were attracted to him. Punch Sulzberger, the publisher of the New York Times, and a Dalton father at the time, tried to recruit Epstein to come to the Times. (Epstein recounts with astonishment ,a story of riding with Sulzberger in his wood paneled station wagon to the family’s country estate and Sulzberger talking to the chauffer on a phone from the backseat to the front.) 
In 1976, another Dalton father, asking “wouldn’t you rather be rich than be a teacher?” introduced him to Bear Stern’s chief Ace Greenberg, a conversation Epstein recounts as this:
Greenberg: “Everyone tells me you’re super smart in math and you’re Jewish and you’re hungry…so why don’t you start working here tomorrow?”
Epstein: “What?”
Greenberg: “If your supposed to be so fucking smart”- “don’t you understand English?”
Epstein: “Ok. Count me in.”
Hence, Epstein, like many in the late 70s, arrived on Wall Street.
As will happen to a generation of others, by the fortuitous luck of being on Wall Street at that point in time, Epstein is transformed by a new, much faster, form of upward mobility than has ever before existed. With an extreme  facility for mathematics as well as for getting along with rich men, he transforms at an even faster rate than so many others who are also being quickly transformed. 
He moves into the penthouse of a new building at 66th Street and Second Avenue—still in the shadow of the Maxwell Plum era when the 60s on Second was the glamour address—a building that was he says, as a fond memory, full of “actresses, models, and euro trash.” (It would shortly become the Studio 54 era, where Epstein, who has never had drink or taken any drugs, was a regular). 
If on one side of Wall Street there were the salesmen (the Wolf of Wall Street model), on the other side there was a new sort of finance type able to embrace a level of acute  financial abstraction.
“In the past,” says Epstein, “investing was all about reputations and relationships. You invested in a company on the basis of who was running it. Did they have integrity? Were they married? Good family men? It was a 50’s mentality. But in the mid 70s stock  options started to be traded on an exchange.  In essence, the first formally traded  derivatives. The movement of these instruments are not directly tied 1to 1  to the stock price. The world of investing began turning from relationships to mathematics . In a sense I didn’t really make money as much as I tried hard to create it.” This was an intellectual activity of a fairly high order.
Intellectual activity aside, he meets Helen Gurley Brown and she makes him Cosmopolitan Magazine’s Bachelor of the Month in 1980.
“What,” I ask, “was your social life like?”
“Well, I was a playboy.”
“That’s all? Not looking to get married?”
“No. Never. I never wanted to get married. I enjoyed sex. I adore women. I wanted freedom. I was attracted to the rich because of their freedom. But I wanted also to avoid their burdens. And I didn’t want to hide. I didn’t want to be a hypocrite. I wanted to be free. I was not remotely ambivalent about what I wanted: to be free. That was my reason to make money.”
His rise at Bear Sterns was a steep one. And he soon became the protégée of Jimmy Cayne (also hired by Ace Greenberg on a whim—he met him in a bridge game—who would go on to run Bear and to lose his fortune in Bear’s 2006 collapse). Epstein’s leave taking or ouster from Bear is the result of politics, envy, overreaching, or a securities violation, or…unclear. But, no matter, he leaves in 1982 with billionaire clients, including Marvin Davis, a real estate developer who owns Twentieth Century Fox, and Herb Seigel, a major media investor in the 1980s. Epstein is dating Morgan Fairchild, a television star in the new mega-rich-family soap operas, Dallas and Falcon Crest (plot lines from which Epstein might easily step). 
Now begins the Concorde phase of his life—and the Concorde phase of the 1980s. If the 80s are happening pell mell in New York, they’re happening at double time and catch up speed in London. Epstein is 30 years old and living, in Lifestyle of the Rich and Famous fashion (he befriends the show’s star, Robin Leach), at English shooting parties at country estates with Saturday night black tie dinners, where he’s meeting the over-the-top families of Europe. 
“I didn’t take it seriously,” Epstein recounts. “I was not caught up in it. I wasn’t trying to make a billion dollars. There was no ultimate goal. It was just fun to meet smart people, interesting people. But no long-range plans. Often no short-term plans either. I would head to Kennedy and, on the theory that most important events in one’s life are purely a result of  serendipity, I wouldn’t decide where I was going until I got there.”
	At the same time, he is developing a unique perception, or, at least a market differentiation: the hyper wealthy had signifcantly different problems than the very wealthy. Dealing with a billion dollars was different from dealing with $100 million:
“If you had a billion dollars I would think the last thing you should be worried about was money, in truth money, was what they most worried about. How to make more of it, how to give away more of it, how to protect you children from it, how to hide it from your wife or husband, how to minimize your taxes on it. The traditional wealth service structure, an accountant, and investment advisor, a personal lawyer, and an idiot brother-in-law, became hopelessly outdated as fortunes eincreased exponentially . 
	“You can’t spend a billion dollars, you can just reallocate it to a different investment classes. And you can’t give away a billion dollars without a vast staff, in effect going into the business of giving away money, yet another business you are likely not to know very much about”
	At just about this point in the narrative, the questions or the incredulity begins in social circles and eventually in the media. He begins to acquire the major symbols of riches but does this without position, public holdings, or transparent paper trails. How can a person have enough money to merit increasing attention, but no clear way of having gotten it? Epstein gets stuck in that tautology. He may be rich, but he is without institutional protection or bona fides. He isin  a questionable substrata of wealth. He’s a freelancer.
	That’s the rub: he doesn’t work for anyone. Without institutional credentials he’s…well, nobody knows what. 
	For a period, one part of his activities he says is recovering monies for countries looted by exiled dictators or military strongmen. If early in his career he might seem like a sort of George Peppard (there’s a physical resemblance) in Breakfast at Tiffany’s, a charming hustler, later he’s George Peppard in Banacek, a smart and astute operator.
Then, in his version, he’s representing a series of vastly wealthy people and families. He’s not just doing their bidding or their investing, he’s helping them to navigate the potententials of their wealth. They’ve satisfied their business dreams. Now there are the separate challenges and possibilities . 
In essence, as Epstein becomes more of a public figure the response to this description of his livelihood, is, in the media and in high social circles, “bullshit.” True, however , there is no clear alternate narrative. No one is accusing him of anything, accept, sometimes, guilt by association. (In addition to Robert Maxwell, who will be accused of fraud, there’s Steven Hoffenberg, briefly a New York high flyer, who went to jail for a Ponzi scheme, for whom Epstein acted as a consultant—along with, he points out, Paul Volcker.) But the characterization persist: if it’s not clear, it must be murky. Sure, Goldman Sachs partners and tech geniuses, they might have stratospheric wealth, but what to make of a Coney Island, Zelig-like no-namer? 
	In 1994, just at the moment when Prince Charles is on television acknowledging his love for Camilla Parker Bowles, Jeffrey Epstein is sitting with his arm around Princess Diana at a dinner at the Serpentine Galley in London (Diana is wearing her “revenge” dress that evening). Graydon Carter, into his second years as editor of Vanity Fair, is also at the dinner. Epstein’s rise and Carter’s rise are not, with a little critical interpretation, that different. Both are a function of the age of new money, both are helped by strategic relationships with the exceptionally wealthy (i.e. they are social climbers), both men have made themselves up. To say that Epstein, in the company of the Princess, sticks in Carter’s craw would be a big understatement. Epstein becomes one of the “what do you know about him” figures in Carter’s gossip trail—a story waiting to happen. A variety of the gossip that begins to circulate about Epstein—for instance, that he secretly films his guests—is seeded by Carter, who once advised me not to go to Epstein’s house or accept a ride in his car least I risk being blackmail. (“For what?” I asked Carter. “You can’t even begin to imagine,” said Carter.)
	Epstein is playing a cat and mouse game with his own growing wealth and influence. He is private and secretive, but grandly so. He joins the board of Rockefeller University. He’s suddenly on the Trilateral commission, that cabal of business people who fancy themselves, and who are fancied by conspiracy buffs, as running the world. He buys from his client Limited Founder Les Wexner the larges private house in Manhattan. (Rumors will continue for many years, that Wexner owns the house and Epstein is just squatting in it, paying taxes on it, —an 18-year squat.) He buys an airplane. He buys another. He expands his holdings in New Mexico. He begins a Zanadu refurbishment of his Caribbean Island. 
He befriends Bill Clinton in his new after-office life.
	And that’s quite the fatal pairing. 
	The post-Monica Clinton, now having pardoned the on-the-lam financier Marc Rich—at this point, before his own rehabilitation, Clinton really is the world’s ultimate sleaze ball—is suddenly being ferried around in the jet of…who exactly?
	The New York Post is the first to take formal media note of the Clinton-Epstein connection, hinting at a sex and money bromance. (“I suppose travel with Clinton changed the arc of my life,” Epstein tells me. “There were, I knew, lots of obvious reasons not to do it, but having the ability to spend 100 hours with a former president just doesn’t happen to many people.”)
The instinctively private Epstein is not just increasingly exposed, but clearly curious about the nature of exposure. 
	I met Epstein around this time. Epstein had become a more and more active backer of advanced scientific research and in 2002 he was taking a small group of scientists out to the TED conference in Monterey. The TED organizers invited various other TED participants, including me, to join the flight. A small group assembled at the private plane terminal, most of us unfamiliar with our benefactor, and as we headed in the direction of the discrete private plans we were gently pointed to our ride: Epstein’s 727. 
	It is some thoroughly updated drawing room set-up, all of us nervously ensconced in this luxury plane, waiting for our unknown host to arrive—and soon he does, tanned, relaxed, with wide open smile, accompanied by three young women. 
It would be unlikely, outside of a men’s magazine fantasy of the luxe life, that you could locate this in reality. Epstein’s sincere attentions, taking time with each of his passengers, seemed impossible to account for. The quiet of the plane, engineered into acoustic perfection, seemed spooky. Epstein’s three companions were witty, poised, helpful as well as powerfully alluring—as though stewardesses of bygone times.
(One more thing about this trip: Google founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, with their company still in its infancy, came out to see the plane on the Monterey tarmac and, with a few other Googlers, literally ran whopping from one end of the plan to the other. Then they described for Epstein, in what I can not now remember as a put on or entrepreneurial brainstorm, a brand extension in which they would market a line of Google bras with the Os as convenient cups. In fact, the name Google, they said, was invented out of the belief that men would focus on a word with two Os in it.)
	Not long after this trip, Epstein’s assistant called to invite me for tea at his house in New York, where Epstein, with what seemed to me little understanding of the subject, began to ask me about media—the upside, downside, and nature of media coverage. New York magazine was then soliciting him for a profile, as was Vanity Fair, who had assigned the British tabloid reporter, Vicki Ward, to the job.
	Both profiles—New York’s by Landon Thomas—pivot on the Clinton connection and detail the same quandary, how a man without clear institutional bona fides nevertheless achieves wealth and influence. Ward—who would more recently assert in the Daily Beast, that she was barred by Vanity Fair from writing about under-age sex evidence (a fact that could be read the other way: Vanity Fair, even looking to take down Epstein, did not find the evidence credible or supportable)—follows a rabbit hole of questionable contacts who might or might not have been the source or sources for Epstein’s wealth, but gets no closer to an answer, beyond confirming her own sense of dubiousness.
	Epstein, sensing that he might be exposing himself, tried to stop the process (Ward, often operatic about her journalistic exploits, says he threatened her), called Carter and said he was having second thoughts about being a public figure.
	 “Then you should live in a two bedroom apartment in Queens,” responded Carter.

	And then the troubles began. 
Epstein, in man-who-can-have-everything fashion, and without the remotest sense of observance or propriety—as though a kind of cultural autism—has, for many years, ordered up a daily massage following his workout sessions.
	“Often these were massage massages,” says Epstein matter of factly, “but sometimes these were happy ending massages, especially in Palm Beach, where there are many massage parlors, and strip clubs  —that do outcalls. There was no sex. An often there was no happy ending. Often I would be on the phone for the entire massage. There were however a lot of massages and a lot of girls, with one girl recommending others.”
	It is after Epstein’s round of publicity and widely touted association with Clinton, that the stepmother of one of the massage parlor girls, identified as “SG” in court documents, who went to Epstein’s house (most of the girls return to Epstein’s house many times) calls the police. The police interview the girl who then supplies names of other girls. Some of whom are younger than 18.
	In the end, the police track down 18 girls—nine who are under 18; the others in their 20s and 30s; one woman is in her 60s—a number of whom give statements describing scenarios not terribly different from Epstein’s description above, except each is laid out in clinical, lurid, and near-identical detail. A cold  Epstein demands that these allegedly unwitting juveniles (though they have come here for this very purpose) perform repulsive (or at least repulsively described) acts on him and then they return again. (Although the nature of the allegations will dramatically grow into threesomes and forced sexual encounters, nobody at this point alleges anything more than Epstein masturbating.) 
	Epstein vastly raises the stakes by calling Dershowitz, who flies into Palm Beach to put the local authorities in their place—alienating Palm Beach officialdom—and, doubling down on the profile of the case, brings in Roy Black the famous criminal attorney who defended William Kennedy Smith in his rape trial in Palm Beach.
	Here’s the narrative: the shadowy rich man, friend of the louche and disgraced President, at all times surrounded by a retinue of young and gorgeous female retainers doing his bidding, is now found to have gathered a network of wrong-side-of-the-tracks Palm Beach girls to provide him with weird sexual services. (It somehow reads weirder that he doesn’t have sex with them.) To boot, his former girl friend, Ghislaine Maxwell—the daughter of the disgraced Robert Maxwell—encouraged at least one of the girls to come to Epstein’s home (and forever more has become a fixture of further weird possibilities in this tale).
	Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter is reported to say: “This is bigger than Rush Limbaugh,” who, in a storm of publicity, has just been arrested in Palm Beach for possession of controlled drugs. 
	On one side are some of the nation’s most powerful defense attorneys (who, increasingly, seem more stumblebum than effective), on the other side, a round-up of hapless girls, with sensational tales of perversion and infamy (in the telling they are not so much sex workers, as Dickensian victims), relatively speaking giving the Palm Beach authorities the choice between utter capitulation to the powerful or standing on the side of the seemingly exploited and powerless.
	Still, with a cold eye, it also quite appears to be a straightforward tale of prostitution (however more or less kinky). And even though some of the girls are minors, age is not a distinguishing factor in a solicitation charge in Florida,  (in New York, for instance, at this time soliciting sex with anyone over the age of 14 is a class D misdemeanor calling for a $100 fine—the law has recently been changed to TK).
	In fact, the very  “SG” clearly tells the police that she lied about being 18 because otherwise she knew she would not have been admitted to the house (other girls will say they knew this is what they had to say, nevertheless not stopping them from saying it).
	The local sex crimes prosecutor, Lana Belhalevic, interviews all the girls and determines that the offense is solely related to prostitution—that there are “no real victims here”d.
Dershowitz, with chest pounding bravado, rejects a series of lower-level plea deals and Palm Beach District Attorney Barry Krischer takes the unusual step of empanelling a grand jury, which returns with a recommendation of a single count of soliciting a prostitute—a charge without jail time. (And Epstein can apply to have his record expunged after a year.) 
At which point, Reiter, the police chief, at odds with the District Attorney’s office, recruits the involvement of the FBI. This is of course the Bush-era FBI and Epstein presents quite the Clinton-connected scandal. Still, solicitation, even of a minor, is not a federal crime. The FBI hits on the novel interpretation that if Internet solicitation can be considered interstate commerce, so can telephone solicitation, permitting them to begin a deep dive investigation into Epstein’s friends, many of whom receive subpoenas and are threatened with prosecution.
It’s all quite in the eye of the beholder: On the one end, Epstein is paying for sex acts (Epstein paid $200 for a massage with or without happy ending), on the other, he is abusing teenage girls. It’s a catch-22: How can a girl not old enough to vote be a prostitute? And yet, many girls not old enough to vote are  without a doubt prostitutes. 
Compounding Epstein’s predicament, the world outside of his carefully constructed and controlled environment is someplace that he seems not just ill-equipped to handle but in which he seems to be blindly grouping about (i.e. he’s totally tone deaf). I visited him once during this time and found him weighing the conflicting advice of some of the most vaunted and egomaniacal lawyers (along with Dershowitz and Black, celebrity criminal attorney, Gerald Lefcourt, and Clinton prosecutor, Ken Starr) of the day—anyone with new advice, Epstein seemed to hire—as well as a catchall of the leading crisis managers, who he seemed to retain at will, all wrangling for fees and primacy. 
Certainly, the upshot of his dealings with the Justice Department seem to involve a through-the-looking-glass logic. The government threatens to prosecute him (with the possibility of a 10-year sentence) and various friends, associates, and lovers, or offers what seems to be unprecedented arrangement  in which Epstein’s lawyers (not federal prosecutors, but Epstein’s lawyers, in some ultimate act of self incrimination) have to go to the Palm Beach authorities and convince them to up the charges to an offense that will send him to jail and get him a sex offender status. Except that a solicitation charge won’t produce that result. Therefore he has to get them to agree to a procurement or pimping charge (even though he has paid money, not received it—the sine qua non of pimping). What’s more, in a unique, if not unprecedented arrangement, he has to agree to pay the legal fees of any of the girls who want to sue him—and, agree not to defend himself from their suits—forcing him to settle with each of the girls for what are reportedly high 6-figure sums or more. 
He’s sentence to jail in 2008 for 18 months and serves 13 (while Epstein is now frequently accused of somehow managing to cut short his sentence, almost all Florida prisoners serve only 70% of their officially sentenced time). 
Jail hardly ends the legal catch all. Epstein's butler, Alfredo Rodriguez, steals and tries to sell an alleged journal or calendar with Epstein’s activities—but he tries to sell it to an undercover agent. Rodriguez is sentenced to 18 months in jail on a charge of theft and of withholding evidence (it is not so much a journal as a list of phone numbers, which were apparently collected or saved by Rod Rodriguez; all of this stolen  material was  somehow subsequently included in a court filing by Edwards). Scott Rothstein, a lawyer whose firm represented additional girls in their suits against Epstein, also goes to jail for recruiting investors to pay for these suits on the fraudulent basis that settlements had already been reached. It’s the largest fraud in Florida history and Rothstein receives a 50-year sentence. 
Then, Brad Edwards, Rothstein’s former partner, sues the federal government in 2008 for abridging the rights of two of the original complainants under the Crime Victim Rights Act (giving victims the right to be consulted about the disposition of their cases) regarding the Justice Departments agreement not to prosecute in favor of the state action. In 2014, Edwards tries to ad Virginia Roberts, another of the original complainants, who has previously settled with Epstein, to the long-running suit. Roberts who was paid a settlement under the original terms of Epstein’s agreement—that he would pay attorney’s fees and not oppose any law suits against him—is now trying to overturn the agreement under which she was paid, and, with Edwards, further suing Epstein for $50,000,000.
Indeed, Roberts, with the Daily Mail being her prime outlet, emerges as the most vocal accuser—and, in fact, the some total of the current story and attention. 
That is, there is no story without her and what is being billed as her  memoir of her “sex slavery” with Epstein, written ten years after the fact. Along with the Dershowitz and Prince Andrew charges, Roberts puts, with rather some narrative detail, both Clinton and Al and Tipper Gore on the island—and in fact Clinton, apparently with the acquiescence of the Secret Service, flying in a helicopter piloted by Epstein’s girlfriend, an amateur pilot. Epstein’s lawyers say that not only have Clinton and the Gores never been to the Epstein Island, but this fantasy  is easily disproven by dsecret service records, which would seem to make the memoir opportunistic or hallucinatory fiction. 
The FBI, in a recent filing, has argued that Roberts should not be party to the suit against the government because she refused to cooperate with the government in its investigation in 2007, hence has no standing as a victim. (At the same time, the FBI included her on the list of 40 victims with whom it mandated Epstein reach a settlement.)
It is hard to find a more hyperbolic intersection of media and lawyers then in Epstein’s case. 
Edwards, over the six years of his law suit, tries to depose Clinton, Donald Trump, and Dershowitz—almost all of his targets coming directly from the original Vanity Fair and New York Magazine articles about Epstein.
In addition to Prince Andrew as a British hot button, first connected to Epstein through Roberts’ interview with the Daily Mail in 2010, Clinton takes on a new role as Hillary spoiler through his connection, real or imagined, to Epstein and sex slaves.
Almost everybody identified in any story about Epstein is approached by other media seeking to write about Epstein, often with financial incentives offered in exchange for a tale.
No new stories or even new details emerge. Every aspect of the current story is based on court filings describing events that may or may not have taken place prior to 2007. It’s as though a kind of ground-hog day of moral opprobrium, a desire to repeat and to savor a new the old details.
A recent Reuters story identified a charity that Epstein has not given money to in 15 years that said if he does give again, they would give it back.

The world cleanly divides, with Epstein (and friends) behind secure walls and the Mail and social media and upholders of new norms ever more incredulous and apoplectic that Epstein not only appears  free but prospers too. 	Although he has spent more than a year in jail and paid out what may be as much as $20 million, he yet seems somehow to have not been sufficiently punished—that worst sin of all. He is the unrepentant catch all of up-to-the-minute badness: the financier whose wealth is a product of Wall Street math rather than hard work; a rich middle-age white man who not only parades his wealth and entitlement, but has a Peter Pan complex to boot; an insistent Playboy in a correct and prudish world—someone who somehow didn’t get the memo about vast changes in mores and culture.  
When I suggested recently that one obvious way to blunt the animus would be to get married, he said he’d rather go back to jail.
He is Calvin Harris’s song, It Was Acceptable in the 80s, come to life.
This is all, of course, a Gatsby-like tale: An enigmatic, and strangely appealing figure, able to invent and inhabit his own world is a mystery to try to decipher. Of course Gatsby in New York Post and Daily Mail parlance would likely be just a freaky financier too.
And this story is, in its way, about the limitation of journalism, in which the most compelling parts of the tale—Epstein’s ambitions and impulses would be well suited to a long running cable drama—need to be sacrificed not just to moral certainty but to a rather preposterous fantasy of moral certainty.
Anyway, I hope I get invited back to Jeffrey’s house soon.

faculty to handle 60 courses with fewer than 20 students in each class,
you have a problem. Multiple sections of courses require multiple fac-
ulty and maybe even, God forbid, heavier teaching loads.

Simply put, if there are too many majors, all the specialty courses
will overflow and you might need twice the faculty to handle them.
The university is not going to let you hire twice the faculty in order to
handle them. Why not?

Tenure is why not. Once you hire tenured faculty, they stay for-
ever. Tenure is another one of those ideas that sounds a lot better than
it is. One of its downsides, and it has many, is that you can’t easily
hire new faculty when you need to. There may be a jump in econom-
ics majors this year, but who is to say that this will be true next year?
Universities move slowly.

So, the current economics faculty would have to teach more cours-
es. They simply do not want to do that. They want to go back to their
offices and do research and write books and consult with the govern-
ment or big business, should they call.

Voila!

Calculus.

That will keep the little buggers out. If that doesn’t work, advanced
calculus. Who cares if those courses have little relevance for econom-
ics? They can always say it might come up some day. (It might.) Or
they can say it teaches rigorous thinking. The real reason is to keep the
numbers down. This is also why biology and chemistry are required
courses for pre-med students, why statistics is required for psychology
majors, and so on. Most departments will not admit to this, but that’s
why those things are there.

You never see this kind of thing in departments that have too few
students. Too few students is the kind of problem that gets your de-
partment shut down. So, linguistics departments, which were started
when linguistics was in fashion in the 1960s, are always under threat
of shut down. They won’t be requiring calculus. But they would if
their situation changed. Instead, what they are doing is trying to ex-
plain why linguistics is calculus,

Huh?

When I arrived at Northwestern, undergraduates were required to
take a math course in order to graduate. There could have been any
number of reasons for this requirement—none of them having to do
with interests or needs of the undergraduates.

Shocking: Virginia Roberts' friends claim she was a money-hungry sex kitten’ who enjoyed her lavish lifestyle

The woman who has accused Jeffery Epstein of keeping her as a sex slave was actually a money-hungry sex kitten’
who enjoyed her lavish lifestyle, former friends have claimed.

Virginia Roberts is currently in the midst of a lawsuit claiming she was recruited to join Epstein's harem of underage
women in 1999, naming Prince Andrew and attorney Alan Dershowitz as two of the men she was made to service’.

But those who used to be close to the 31-year-old say she relished her role as his ‘travelling masseuse’ and never
acted like she was being held captive.

Philip Guderyon, who used to date Roberts and would drive her to Epstein's Pal Beach, Florida, mansion told the
New York Daily News: 'She was like the head b***h. She’d have like nine or 10 girls she used to bring to him.

‘She never looked like she was being held captive,’ he added. 'She and the other girls would walk out of there
smiling, with their little bathing suits on, like they had just come from the beach.

‘She'd have like $4,000. And then I’d take them all to the mall and they'd get their nails done.’

He also said while making thousands of dollars from the relationship, she would buy fancy clothes and drive around
in Epstein's Mercedes.

Crystal Figueroa, whose brother dated Roberts in the early 2000s, told the Daily News Roberts would ask if she
knew anyone 'slutty’ so they could be sent to Epstein.

In 2001 she was sharing a Palm Beach apartment with Anthony Valladares. He told the Daily News that she
bragged about going to the 'millionaire's house’ for a day or two, before returning with cash.

He did say that she tried to get out of the sex business, but was dragged back in.
Last month it was revealed Roberts accused two male acquaintances she was raped, bringing her credibility into

stay and fight the United States government in the courts.” That bit
of braggadocio would not be proven out.

Greenwald, Poitras, and MacAskill in their reporting did not
concern themselves with any of the mechanics of the largest theft
of top secret documents in the history of the United States. In the
entire filmed interview at the Mira hotel, for example, they did not
ask their source how he managed to get access to the documents.
Lam, however, asked him about how he widened his access. When
she asked him why he had switched jobs from Dell to Booz Allen
Hamilton in March 2013, his answer provided her with a real scoop:
“My position with Booz Allen Hamilton granted me access to lists
of machines all over the world the NSA hacked.” Snowden told her
that he deliberately went to Booz Allen Hamilton to get access to
the “lists” revealing the NSA’s sources in foreign countries. This
admission could further complicate his legal situation in Hong Kong
because it suggested that he meant to steal documents even before
he had known their content. In fact, to protect himself, he restricted
Lam from publishing this part of the interview until after he had

© departed Hong Kong. (It was not published until June 24, a day after ©
he arrived in Russia.) This condition indicated to Lam that as early
as June 12, if not before, he was planning on leaving Hong Kong.

His interview with Lam didn’t reveal how he had learned about
these “lists” before taking the job. Nor did he reveal to her what he
planned to do with these lists. He made it clear to her, however, that
he had not disposed of all his secret documents. “If I have time to go
through this information,” he said, “I would like to make it avail-
able to journalists in each country to make their own assessment,
independent of my bias, as to whether or not the knowledge of US
network operations against their people should be published.” So as
late as June 12, Snowden was still reading and assessing the files he
had stolen from the NSA four weeks earlier.

Poitras vetted the Lam interview. Soon afterward, she suspected
that she was being followed. That was likely, because by June 14 all
the intelligence services in Hong Kong knew that she was in contact
with Snowden.

“I was being tailed,” Poitras recalled in an interview with a Vogue

By the first decade of the 21* century, the NSA’s surreptitious efforts to render the Internet
transparent to US intelligence had earned it a new set of enemies. They were the previously-
mentioned hacktavists who were attempting to shield the activities of Internet users from the
intrusions of government surveillance. They employed both encryption and TOR software to
defeat that surveillance.

The NSA was not about to be defeated by the tactics of amateur privacy advocates. It did not
conceal that it was intent on countering any attempt to interfere with its surveillance of the
Internet. It built back doors into their encryption and worked to unravel the TOR scrambling of
their IP addresses. It made leading hacktavists targets. Brian Hale, the spokesman for the
Director of National Intelligence, disclosed that the US routinely intercepted the cyber signatures
of parties suspected of hacking into US government networks.

Following the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon and World Trade Center, the surveillance of the
Internet also became an integral part of Bush’ administration’s war on terrorism. In October
2001, Congress expanded the NSA’s mandate by passing the USA Patriot Act. Section 215 of
the act directly authorized the NSA, with the approval of the FISA court, to collect and store
domestic telephone billing records. The idea was to better coordinate domestic and foreign
intelligence about Al-Qaeda and other jihadist groups. The mantra in government after the 9/11
was to “connect dots.” Congress with this back essentially called for demolishing the wall by
domestic and foreign intelligence when it came to foreign-directed terrorism. The act effectively
made the NSA a partner with the FBI in tracking phone calls made from the phones origination
outside the United States by known foreign jihadists. If these calls were made to individuals
inside the NSA was now authorized to retrieve the billing records of the person called and those
people who he or she called. These traces were then supplied to the FBI. When a New York
Times expose in 2008 revealing that NSA surveillance has been extended to domestic telephone
used, Congress passed the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 explicitly allowing the NSA to
continue these practices if it obtained a FISA court order. Congress also sanctioned the NSA’s
supplying the FBI with the emails and other Internet activity of foreign Jihadists if it was
suspected of planning attacks in America. This put the NSA directly in the anti-terrorist business
in the United States. It also necessitated the NSA vastly increasing its coverage of the Internet.

The new duties also increased the NSA’s need to create new bureaucratic mechanism to
monitor its compliance with FISA court orders, Rajesh De, the NSA’s General Counsel at the
time of the Snowden breach, described the NSA as becoming by 2013 “one of the most regulated
enterprises in the world.” Grafted onto its intelligence activities were layers of mandated
reporting to oversight officials. Not only did the NSA have its own chief compliance officer,
chief privacy and civil liberties officer, and independent inspector general but the NSA also had
to report to a difference set of compliance officers at the Department of Defense the Office of
National intelligence and the Department of Justice On top of reporting to those officials, the
Department of Justice dispatched a team of lawyers every 60 days to review the results of “every

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018857.txt,"Improvements Description and Analysis 46

Overall, the quality, condition, and functional utility of the improvements are above average for their
age and location. The subject benefits from good access and visibility from both the waterfront and
the main thoroughfare of Smith Bay Road. In addition, the overall quality and condition of the subject
is above average for this market. Due to the small site size and large number of commercial tenants,
there is insufficient parking at the subject based on market standards.

Improvement Analysis — Marina

The marina currently contains 105 wet slips, although that number can vary somewhat depending on
the size (width) of the occupying vessels. Each designated slip is supplied with its own electrical outlet
and fresh water supply, as well as access to a refueling line. The individual slip sizes can vary based on
boater needs, but they can accommodate a variety of vessels, typically within the range from 30 to 79
linear feet for the standard slips, and 79 to 110 linear feet for the T-head slips. In addition, some slips
have an attached finger for easier access, which is considered more desirable.

Generally the jetties and slips are constructed of PVC pilings bored and filled with concrete and steel;
and wood plank surfacing. Many of the smaller slips are horizontally separated by wooden columns
used to tie up vessels rather than there being jetties between each slip.

The physical docks were constructed over several years, from 1991-1995, and are considered to be in
average condition. Ongoing renovations have been made to the docks throughout the years, with
upcoming expenditures included a complete resurfacing as well as re-facing the wooden skirts on
most concrete pilings. The docks consist of mostly concrete pilings and cross braces with some wood,
along with wooden skirts and wood decking surface. There have been no major renovations to slip
structure within the past five years.

The subject marina benefits greatly from its location in Vessup Bay, which is well protected and
positioned in a convenient area at the heart of Red Hook. In addition, this bay has a direct route to St.
John and the British Virgin Islands and has a depth that will accommodate vessels with a maximum
draft of 10 feet and a maximum vessel length of 110 feet. The subject is one of the closest commercial
marinas to both St. John and the BVI, and this convenient location is a major demand generator for
commercial charters as well as vessels based in St. John and the BVI which are often in need of a
fueling station. The quality and condition of the docks is considered to be average; however, the
services and amenities offered at this marina are considered to be above average.

Because Hong Kong had a vigorously enforced extradition agree-
ment with the United States, as mentioned above, it was expected
that Snowden would be taken into custody. But China had the final
say in any extradition decision. In fact, China had explicitly been
given the right of vetoing any extraditions for any reason in the
formal 1999 agreement between Hong Kong and the United States.
Because the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, had just met with Presi-
dent Obama in California, China also had an interest in avoiding
embarrassing public demonstrations on behalf of Snowden. Accord-
ing to a well-placed official in Hong Kong, China’s liaison office in
Hong Kong told the Hong Kong Authority in no uncertain terms
that Snowden had to be out of Hong Kong by June 23.

On June 19, Snowden had a meeting with Tibbo, the barrister who
would handle any eventual court case, and Man and Ho, the Hong
Kong solicitors who had been retained for him. It took place in a
small apartment where, according to Ho, they ate pizza while they
discussed Snowden’s options.

Tibbo wanted Snowden to remain in Hong Kong, allow himself

© to be arrested, seek bail, and fight extradition in court. Tibbo said ©
he planned to mount a powerful legal defense against extradition
by using a provision in Hong Kong’s extradition treaty with the
United States that protects fugitives from persecution on political
grounds. After he told Snowden that it would entail a long court
battle, Snowden asked him if he could avoid even being arrested.

Tibbo explained that Hong Kong courts, which closely follow
British law, would certainly issue an arrest warrant for him imme-
diately after the United States formally filed charges against him.
Those charges could come within hours, he reckoned. Soon after-
ward, Snowden would be temporarily jailed, and his computers,
electronic gear, and thumb drives would be seized and placed in the
custody of the court. Tibbo would immediately seek his release on
bail but could not guarantee an outcome because Snowden, who
had fled U.S. jurisdiction, might be considered a flight risk. If so,
Snowden could remain incarcerated during the long court battle.
During the litigation, Snowden would have a platform to make
his case against U.S. surveillance. Indeed, Tibbo’s strategy involved
building massive public support for Snowden’s cause. Once the U.S.

The women have objected to how U.S. prosecutors handled Epstein's case, and want authorities to reconsider a
plea deal that allowed Epstein to avoid much more serious federal charges and potentially longer prison time.
Epstein served 13 months of an 18-month sentence after pleading guilty to a single charge of soliciting prostitution
before being released in 2009.

It was not the first time Prince Andrew has faced media scrutiny over his friendship with Epstein. In July 2011 the
royal stepped down from his role as a U.K. trade ambassador after he was photographed with Epstein in New York.

Prince Andrew is the second son and third child of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. He is
fifth in line to the British throne behind his older brother Prince Charles, nephew Prince William, grandnephew
Prince George, and nephew Prince Harry.

The Sunday Mirror reported that Prince Andrew was on a skiing holiday in Switzerland, where he had been staying
with his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson and their daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.

In a further bizarre twist to the story, prominent attorney Alan Dershowitz, who is also named in the court
documents, told the BBC that he is planning legal action against the woman.

Before Kenneth Foster’ s death sentence was revoked at the last
minute in August 2007, he had read a book, We/come to the Terrordome,
and he wrote a letter to the author, Dave Zirin:
| have never had the opportunity to view sports in this way. And as | went
through these revelations | began to have epiphanies about the way sports
have a similar existence in prison. The similarities shook me. Facing
execution, the only thing that | began to get obsessive about was how to

Sports, as you know, becomes a way of life. You monitor it, you almost
come to breathe it. Sports becomes a way of life in prison, because it
becomes a way of survival. For men that don’ t have family or friends to
help them financially, it becomes a way to occupy your time. That’ s
another sad story in itself, but it’ s the root to many men’ s obsession
with sports.

Zirin writes, “It didn’ t matter if he was on death row or Park

the thought that thinking about sports took his mind--for a moment--

that lawyers provide assistance to indigent criminal defendants. Presumably, that same power extends to requesting assistance
for crime victims. +7 In light of all these facts, federal courts have the inherent power to request attorneys to represent indigent
crime victims.

An illustration of this power is found in a decision by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina in
United States v. Stamper. *8 In this rape case, a dispute arose over the admission of certain psychiatric reports concerning the
victim that the defense alleged demonstrated a pattern of making false allegations of sexual abuse. +? She requested
independent counsel to protect her privacy interests. 4©° After consulting with the victim, the court appointed counsel for her.
461 The court then allowed her counsel to participate in hearings regarding the evidence, including cross-examination of the
relevant witnesses. +6?

My proposed rule would simply confirm the existing discretionary power of the courts to appoint volunteer counsel
demonstrated in cases like Stamper. The rule is purely discretionary (the court may appoint counsel) and is limited to
situations where the interests of justice require appointment. The rule does not address payment for counsel, as this matter must
be left to subsequent appropriations from Congress. The court, however, can ask for volunteer counsel to assist victims pro
bono.

Finally, it might be argued that it is unnecessary to address this subject in a rule because the court's inherent authority to
appoint counsel exists even without a rule. Both courts and victims, however, will find it useful to have this authority close at
hand in the criminal rules. Rule 44 already covers the subject of appointing counsel for defendants in great detail, so adding a
Rule 44.1 addressing victims’ counsel is a natural corollary. In addition, prosecutors are obligated by the CVRA to advise the
crime victim that the crime victim can seek advice of an attorney with respect to the rights described in subsection (a)._ 4
This may frequently [*943] require prosecutors to help victims obtain legal counsel. Accordingly, a separate rule on this
subject is appropriate. For all these reasons, the Rules should be amended to recognize the court's authority to appoint volunteer
counsel to represent a crime victim.

Rule 46 - Victims’ Right to Be Heard Regarding Defendant's Release from Custody The Proposal:

I proposed that a victim should be given the right to offer views regarding the defendant's release from custody and that the
court should consider those views as follows:

(k) Victims’ Right to Be Heard. A victim has the right to be heard regarding any decision to release the defendant. The court
shall consider the views of victims in making any release decision, including such decisions in petty cases. In a case where the
court finds that the number of victims makes it impracticable to accord all of the victims the right to be heard in open court, the
court shall fashion a reasonable procedure to facilitate hearing from representative victims. 464

The Advisory Committee proposed no change to this rule. °° It did, however, propose a global rule that would give victims a
right to be heard at proceedings involving release:

Teaching Minds

They must be learn-by-doing curricula consisting of series of
projects inside coherent stories about life in some aspect of
the real world.

They must be delivered on the web. Students should work on
projects where the background and help are web delivered.
They would submit their work to mentors and receive
feedback online.

Mentors in the curricula would include parents, online
subject matter experts worldwide, local experts, and teachers
trained to be mentors. Mentoring, unlike teaching, is not
about providing information that can be found easily in
books but about helping students through a problem without
giving them the answer. Mentors point students in the right
direction and react to their work as it progresses.

Students should, on a regular basis (sometimes weekly,
sometimes more often), submit work products related to each
project for evaluation and feedback. Students would submit
their work many times to achieve increasing mastery and get
continuing feedback. There should be no competency tests,
only the continual monitoring of performance.

Each curriculum should be designed by a panel of experts in
a given field. The curriculum should provide a simulation of
what life might be like in that field. For example, students
might spend the year working legal cases, or starting a
business, or designing roads and bridges.

Students should be encouraged to work in virtual teams,
learning to deal with others to produce results.

Choice must be a staple of the curricula. There can be no
single set of standard requirements. Instead, students should
be able to select the curricula they wish to participate in.
Their records would list what deliverables they have created
in their chosen curricula.

Curricula must be designed around projects with clear,
meaningful, achievable goals. They must be designed
carefully so to incorporate all the key basic skills like reading,
writing, reasoning, researching, calculating, computing, and
so on, in a systematic and natural way.

Hot Book Rips Jeffrey Epstein's $50 Billion Dollar Ponzi Crime Covered Up By President Obama 
By Steven Hoffenberg 
Publisher/CEO 
Lisa Twardeau died at the dirty hands of billionaire Jeffrey Epstein's lies about the crimes he committed while working 
atTowersinvestors.com. 
Jeffrey Epstein looted Towers Investors of billions of dollars in ponzi crimes at the time Lisa became the wife of Steven Hoffenberg, 
who was Epstein's boss at Towers Investors. 
Epstein defrauded the Towers Investors with a cover-up after taking $2 billion from Towers and depositing it into the Epstein Hedge 
Fund Financial Trust Corp. 
Lisa Twardeau died when she was going to expose the fact that Jeffrey Epstein looted billions from Towers Investors by ponzi 
crimes. 
Now, from the grave, Lisa Twardeau slams arrogant ponzi crimes King Epstein in the tell-all book she wrote that reveals everything 
about Epstein and the Feds' cover-up with President Obama. 
The Feds are bad. They are covering up the Epstein ponzi crimes. The Lisa Twardeau book states that the FBI is violating the law 
with this cover-up. 
The book says President Obama told the Attorney General that Jeffrey Epstein was cooperating in an overseas banking crime, but 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031193 
the FBI can't arrest Epstein. These are all lies by the President of the United States. 
The book says that President Obama lied to cover up his relationship with Larry Summers who is on Jeffrey Epstein's payroll. 
The book could give reasons for the president to be impeached for obstruction of justice whereby the U.S. Attorney General will 
learn everything that is in the Twardeau book. 
Readers, stay with this hot story that reveals that a cover-up in America is taking place. 
The Richard Nixon story all over again is in the Lisa Twardeau book coming soon........

Media Magic: How a Democrat Pedophile 
Became a 'Trump Scandal' 
Strangely, the media have suddenly taken an intense interest in the case of pedophile and 
major Democratic donor Jeffrey Epstein. 
In 2005, the Palm Beach police were told by the mother of a young girl in West Palm 
Beach that her daughter had been brought to the Democratic donor's mansion and asked 
to have sex with him for money. This kicked off an intensive, one-year undercover 
investigation. 
The police sifted through Epstein's garbage and interviewed 17 witnesses, including the 
housemen, who told of sex toys and dildos left behind after the underage girls left. One of 
Epstein's procurers, a 20-year-old local woman named Haley Robson, who was paid $200 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029905 
for every teenaged girl she brought to Jeffrey, was cooperating with police, telling them 
she was like Heidi Fleiss. They obtained statements from five of Epstein's young victims, 
who said they'd been paid $200 to $300 to engage in various sex acts with ...

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011615.txt,"A few weeks later, my term as commander ended. The handover to my
successor, Giora Zorea, turned out to be more elaborate than my arrival, though
not at my instigation. With both Talik and Avraham in attendance, Dado
presented me with my fifth tza/ash. It was not for Beirut. Not for the operation
against the Syrian officers, or the unprecedented access our intelligence
missions were providing into Egypt’s military communications. Dado said it
was for all of the above. And not just for leading the unit of which I’d been a
part almost from the start. It was for my part in bringing it to maturity. When I
replied, I am sure everyone knew I was speaking from the heart in saying that
my every moment with Sayeret Matkal had been a privilege. And that this latest
commendation was an award for the achievements the whole sayeret.

Dado did me another good turn. As my stint as commander drew to an end, I
knew what I hoped to do next in the army: to use my tank training to work my
way up the command chain in the armored corps. But like past sayeret
commanders, it was assumed I would first spend time at the US Marine Corps
staff college in Quantico, Virginia. I had other ideas. I wanted to exercise other
parts of my mind, by doing postgraduate work at a normal American university.
Dado agreed.

I still had to get accepted. The first step was to take the post-graduate entry
exam, the GRE. There were two parts to it. The first involved mathematics and
abstract thinking, the second English language. If my fate had rested on my
English grade, I’d have ended up at Quantico. I finished in the 28 percentile.

But in the other part, I was in the 99.6 percentile. I applied to four universities:

Harvard, Yale, MIT and Stanford. Amazingly, I got accepted by all of them. I
chose Stanford, mainly because it allowed a far greater latitude in choosing my
program of study. Also, the weather.

In early August 1973, Nava and I joined my parents and hers on a sunny
afternoon in Mishmar Hasharon to celebrate Michal’s third birthday and say
goodbye. We were heading to Palo Alto, California, with every expectation of
two years of intellectual stimulation, new friends, new experiences and
something approximating a more normal family life. My “other” family, the
Israeli army, also had reason to believe a period of new possibilities lay ahead.
The threat of terror remained, of course. There had also been a brief bout of

pragmatically manage our differences now seems, in the current environment, both naive
and quixotic.

Promote Transparency

Follow-on congressional oversight will go far toward educating the Congress, the media,
and the public about these important topics. The issues are complicated and have no simple
solutions. Various specialists within and outside the US government should be consulted

in determining the full scope of the problem and what should be done.

Promote Integrity

Congress needs also to distinguish between issues that present a real threat to the United
States, such as Chinese espionage and Chinese-directed monitoring of Chinese students
on US campuses, and institutions such as Confucius Institutes, which, as we have noted
elsewhere in this report, can be better regulated by universities themselves.

Promote Reciprocity

In coming up with remedial steps, Congress must consider the broader bilateral relationship.
It is asked to weigh carefully the continued important positive elements in the US-China
relationship, the negative consequences that might arise from a confrontational approach

to China, and America’s need to protect and foster its strengths and interests.

A. Everything changed in my life, everything. I

ended up getting a job and I just stopped. I just

stopped. I don't know.

A. I just stopped because I have a son now and I
didn't feel like it was right. First off, I was a
stay-at-home mommy, okay. And what am I going to do,
bring my son over there to Jeffrey's, no, you know. So I
focused on my son. I had a beautiful baby boy that was
my pride and joy. I didn't care for anything else. I
didn’t care to tell friends. I dropped all my friends.
Like he asked me do I have any numbers, no, you know. If
anybody does call me, that's my mother. Like it was just
me and my baby boy and it's been like that ever since.

Financials: buy XLF Mar17 $22 call with $26 KO for $0.87 with full premium rebate on KO 
image001.png; Future of Financials Conference Takeaways.pdf 
Importance: High 
Our Financials Conference was this week and client attendance was up by 66% from last year. Yes, banks/financials 
might pull back at some point after this run-up but we would be buyers on any pullbacks and we continue to see further 
upside from multiple expansion and earnings growth. Our analyst raised her price targets by —11% across the board. The 
long term rotation from bonds and div stocks into sectors like financials is only beginning. 
Vol is higher on the week; what prices well now: 
Buy the XLF March 2017 $22 call with $26 Knock-Out (continuous) for $0.87, with a full premium 
rebate if knock-out occurs. 
This prices attractively given flat call skew and if XLF breaches $26 and this knocks out, at least you get your 
premium back. 
Please find our Financials report attached. 
Future of Financials conference hosted 90 public and private companies at our Future of Financials conference. We are 
raising our price objectives across most of our names. Three primary reasons why we think there is upside remaining 
after the recent rally: 1) an improved outlook on both activity levels and interest rates, driving revenue upside; 2) 
potentially lower regulatory burden, particularly as new supervisory leadership can come with the new administration; 
and 3) relatively lighter positioning in US financials vs. other sectors. (Erika Najarian)

Subject: RE: Financials trade for Monday 
We continue to see buyers of XLF today. Funds are underweight financials in all regions, valuations are 
reasonable, earnings are improving and financials tend to outperform when bond yields rise. 
Vol is higher today — refreshed pricing below. 
Buy an XLF 17March2017 call spread: 
• Buy the 105% call / sell a 110% call with a 115% at-expiry knock-in 
• Total premium: 1.86% 
Global Positioning in Stocks: Nigel Tupper notes the 4000 funds in our Positioning in Stocks analysis  
are more underweight Financials, on average, than any other sector and are underweight this sector in all 
regions of the world. If earnings continue to improve and yield rise, which is often the case in an upturn in our 
Global Wave, then the unloved Financials sector has the potential to continue to outperform. 
Global Quant Panorama: Bearish on Bonds stocks (which tend to move in the opposite direction to  
bond yields) tend to outperform our Bullish On Bonds when bond yields rise. The sectors that tend to 
perform best as bond yields rise are Energy, Tech, Materials, Banks, and Diversified Financials. Of these 
sectors, the laggards this year have been Banks and Diversified Financials. With a PE of 15.9x and a PB of 
2.0x, Global valuations are reasonable. Also, Risk is near all-time lows in terms of PE in most regions. Now 
that macro and earnings data have triggered the beginning of a rotation, Value becomes very relevant.

Subject: Financials trade for Monday 
It's not too late to buy financials as a medium term trade. They've run up a lot this week but we're getting 
endless calls from generalists asking which banks to buy — there is still more upside to the sector. Banks also 
provide some offset to your bonds if interest rates continue to move. Our financials sector specialist thinks XLF 
could have another 20-25% upside given its many levers to the Trump trade: less regulation, higher interest 
rates/steeper yield curve, higher vol, economic growth, etc. The regional banks are asset sensitive and more of a 
pure play on a rates move but we view the larger cap banks as having even more upside to the Trump Trade 
given the above points. 
Buy an XLF 17March2017 call spread: 
• Buy the 105% call / sell a 110% call with a 115% at-expiry knock-in 
• Total premium: 1.75% 
All eyes are on Sunday's 60 Minutes interview with Trump. Market is pricing that all regulations will be rolled 
back (very optimistic). Any hint that this is not true could lead to pullback on Monday. 
Note on tech: we're seeing FANG used as a source of funds with the rotation from growth into value. There's 
also the tax read-through: tech is already relatively tax advantaged @ 22%; Industrials are at 30%, Financials at 
29%. Next year, tech could benefit from a repatriation tax holiday but that is viewed as more of a Q1/Q2 trade. 
More thoughts on financials: 
With respect to the economy, the market is certainly indicating that there will be a large fiscal stimulus which 
may send US growth higher and that's a good thing for financials for a wide variety of reasons, from 
employment to wages to loan growth and credit quality (even if somewhat offset by higher rates). It does 
remain to be seen exactly how much of this expected policy actually gets done, but at the moment, investors are 
willing to take a certain amount of growth on faith. 
So those are positives for financials before we even discuss regulation. The move in the financials since the 
election would seem to indicate that investors have concluded that nearly every piece of financial regulation 
will get put into a shredder on day one of the new administration. The incoming administration has fueled that 
with comments about rolling back pieces (or more) of Dodd-Frank in particular. I can see making the case for 
that to the American public by saying that banks need less regulation in order to get more capital flowing into 
the economy to drive growth. Not only does that mean that the E is likely too low (meaning that the P/E is not 
as high as it seems) but it could help improve ROE's as well which could increase the multiple of that higher E 
investors are willing to pay. Note that while ROEs could go higher, it's unlikely that they can get back to the 
peaks...

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024932.txt,"individual or state, city or a company, is seen as unacceptable. It seems that seeing=2 Odistinct images of
successful Arabs and Arab countries disturbs some people. They would rather stick with the distorted images of
Arab stereotypes in their minds.

I need to stress here a very important perception. We are not growing in order to be a model for its highest
building in the world, best airport, and most luxurious hotel, and the largest seaport and man-made islands.
These landmarks and features are unique and famous all over the world. But the Dubai model is beyond that.
Dubai is an Arab city with scarce natural resources but with a clear vision of comprehensive development and
social needs. It is a city that succeeded through its investments in human resources, its unique geographical
location, and its trade expertise. This has enabled us to achieve unmatched growth and to become the focal
connection between the East and West. Dubai has proved as well the possibility of coexistence of different
cultures in an open and tolerant Arab Islamic environment.

Dubai’s model, which is part of the UAE model, lies in the success of the economy’s diversification, and in
sparking the interest of the Arab region and neighboring countries in the information and communication
technology, the e-government and the knowledge economy, and in facilitating access to the people in our region
to global best practices. Our international experiences in various areas are often on display through exhibitions,
conferences and other activities.

Dubai’s model also lies in proving the viability of investing in the region, of investing specifically in the
knowledge economy and in human welfare. It has also raised the citizens’ expectations in the region concerning
levels of good governance and transparency, and the quality of public services and state-of-the-art
infrastructure.

Dubai is about providing the highest international standards in education and health systems. It is a city with
entrepreneurial spirit that entered into international investment areas and bought assets in global ports, airports
and financial markets. Dubai succeeded in building a global financial center and entering into partnerships with
reputed financial institutions, and was able to compete globally in the areas of air and sea transport, and
charitable initiatives that were created to help developing the less fortunate countries.

These are some of Dubai’s model features, which has attracted the attention of the world, and enticed the
interest of the Arab region and its people, and inspired many people and motivated them. Is this the model that
our critics are targeting?

I asked my brothers and myself this question and I did not expect a reply, because we are accustomed in the
UAE to respond by work, not words. We believe in God and we have full faith and confidence in Him and in
our people and businessmen and the many other believers in Dubai.

Abu Dhabi is also witnessing an attack since it succeeded in leading a successful Arab union and launched
initiatives of a strategic and impo rtant nature such as “Masdar City.”. I know that the international media have
covered art initiatives in Abu Dhabi, including building an outpost of the Louvre. But one gets the impression
that even in such coverage of important initiatives, there’s invariably some reference or the other to discredited
stereotypes of the Arab Gulf. Now the focus is on Dubai, and again the stereotypes are being brought up. It
seems that any successful Arab model in economic development invites such negative treatment in the
international media

To be fair, we read recently a few balanced articles reporting on what is the UAE doing regarding the effect of

the global financial crisis on our region.
Al Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi

When I was in the army, this wasn’t an issue. Self-control, especially in high-
pressure situations, was a highly valued asset. But in politics, I think that it did for a
considerable time inhibit my ability to connect with the public, or at least with
the news media that played such a critical intermediary role. And it caused me
to be seen not just as reserved or aloof, but sometimes as cold, or arrogant.

I did get much that I value from my parents. From my mother, her
boundless energy, activism, her attention to detail, and her focus on causes
larger than herself — her belief that politics mattered. Also her love for art and
literature. When I would come home from the children’s dormitory to my
parents’ room — just nine feet by ten, with a wooden trundle bed to save space
during the day — there was always a novel or a book of verse sharing the small
table with my parents’ most single prized possession: their kibbutz-issue radio.

As achild, however, I spent much more time with my father. He was my
guide, my protector and role model. Like my mother, he never mentioned the
trials which they and their families endured before arriving in Palestine. Nor did
they ever speak to me in any detail about the Holocaust. No one on the kibbutz
did. It was as if the memories were scabs they dared not pick at. Also, it
seemed, because they were determined to avoid somehow passing on these
remembered sadnesses to their sons and daughters. Still, when I was ten or
eleven, my father did — once, inadvertently — open a window on his childhood.
Every Saturday morning, we would listen to a classical music concert on my
parents’ radio. One day, as the beautiful melodies of Tchaikovsky’s violin
concerto in D came through the radio, I was struck by the almost trancelike look
that came over my father’s face. He seemed to be in another, faraway, place.
When the music ended, he turned and told me about the first time he’d heard it.
It was on the train ride into Crimean exile with Itzila and Meir in the early days
of the First World War. The train took five days to reach the Crimea and
sometimes halted for hours at a time. Every evening, a man at the far end of
their carriage would take out his violin and play the second movement of the
Tchaikovsky concerto.

I have heard the piece in concert halls many times since. When the orchestra
begins the second movement — with the violin notes climbing higher, trembling
ever so subtly — it sends a shiver down my spine. I can’t help thinking of the
railway car in which my then four-year-old father and other Jews from
Ponovezh escaped the Great War of 1914. And of other trains, in another war 25
years later, carrying Jews not to safety but to death camps.

is headed down the path of autocracy, this does not suggest the futility of
change or of promoting democracy in Egypt, nor, say, that the Arab
Spring was a failure. Autocracy will not be a permanent fix for the factors
that nourished the Arab Spring. It will work for a while, maybe even a
decade, but eventually, repression will not be enough, and the
demonstrations will begin again. A little liberty is a dangerous thing—
especially when it bears fruit. The Arab Spring in Egypt may not have
brought about democracy, but that does not mean it failed. Egypt now
knows the impact mass action can have on its government. They have seen
not one, but two governments fall as a direct result of protests and popular
action. Egypt may be moving back toward a military dictatorship, but now
the people have a taste of liberty. No matter how repressive the military
establishment decides to be, the genie is out of the bottle.

79 N.Y.2d 289, 295, 582 N.Y.S.2d 378, 591
N.E.2d 222 (1992)). Conspiracy “requires
an agreement to commit a tortious act.”

quires that the defendant have given sub-
stantial assistance or encouragement to

i. Causation

Judge Robertson found his consideration
of Prince Sultan’s and Prince Turki’s FSIA
defenses did not present an opportunity
for a general discourse on causation since
Plaintiffs’ theory would stretch causation
to “terra incognita.” Burnett I, 292
F.Supp.2d at 20. This Court agrees with
Judge Robertson’s conclusion, but it un-
dertakes the causation analysis because a
similar review will be necessary in its con-
sideration of the Defendants’ motions for
failure to state a claim. See Part III
below.

Plaintiffs place great reliance on Halber-
stam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 (D.C.Cir.1983)
and Bowm v. Quranic Literacy Institute. &
Holy Land Foundation for Relief & Devel-
opment, 291 F.3d 1000, 1028 (7th Cir.2002)
(“Bowm IT”). Neither of these cases con-
cern the tortious activity exception to the
FSIA, but they do explain liability under

28. The court in Halberstam outlined the ele-
ments of aiding and abetting as: “(1) the
party whom the defendant aids must perform
a wrongful act that causes an injury; (2) the
defendant must be generally aware of his role
as part of an overall illegal or tortious activity
at the time that he provides the assistance;
(3) the defendant must knowingly and sub-
stantially assist the principal violation.’’ Hal-

the ATA and for aiding and abetting and
conspiracy.“ In Halberstam, the defen-
dant was found liable as a joint venturer
for a killing that occurred during a burgla-
ry at which she was not present. Halber-
stam, 705 F.2d at 488; see also Lumbard
v. Maglia, Inc, 621 F.Supp. 1529, 1536
(S.D.N.Y.1985) (““[T]hose who aid or abet
or conspire in tortious conduct are jointly
and severally liable with other participants
in the tortious conduct, regardless of the
degree of their participation or culpability
in the overall scheme.”). The court found
that the defendant’s intimate relationship
with the burglar and her assistance in his
other illegal ventures “defie[d] credulity
that [she] did not know that something
illegal was afoot.” Halberstam, 705 F.2d
at 486.

In Boim, the district court had denied a
motion to dismiss by U.S.-based charities
alleged to have aided and abetted interna-
tional terrorism. Bowm v. Quranic Litera-
cy Inst. & Holy Land Found. 127
F.Supp.2d 1002, 1018 (N.D.IIL2001)
(“Bom I”). The Seventh Circuit affirmed
the decision and held that the parents of a
yeshiva student killed in 1996 in Israel by
members of the military wing of Hamas
could prove that the defendants aided and
abetted their son’s murder under the ATA
if they could demonstrate that the chari-
ties “knew of Hamas’ illegal activities, that
they desired to help those activities suc-
ceed, and they engaged in some act of
helping the illegal activities.” Bowm I],
291 F.3d at 1023. The court explained
that “[floreseeability is the cornerstone of

berstam, 705 F.2d at 477. It described the
elements of civil conspiracy as: “(1) an agree-
ment between two or more persons; (2) to
participate in an unlawful act, or a lawful act
in an unlawful manner; (3) an injury caused
by an unlawful overt act performed by one of
the parties to the agreement; (4) which overt
act was done pursuant to and in furtherance

n July 28, the grand jury reached a verdict that floored
the Palm Beach PD.
The original plea deal that Krischer had offered to
Epstein had been bad enough. Now the grand jury was recom-
mending that Epstein be charged with just one felony count of
solicitation of prostitution.
There was no mention of underage girls. The original
accusation —four felony counts of unlawful sex acts with minors
and one felony count of lewd and lascivious molestation — had

simply evaporated.
It wasn’t enough to send Epstein to prison.

Epstein was allowed to surrender on a Sunday, when no one ~ j
would know he'd been arraigned. A few hours later, he was a

released on three thousand dollars bail.
The Palm Beach PD was not even notified.

from finding their voice. SAG voters begin seeing the film 2 and 3 times.

In January the Golden Globes voted on by about 88 foreign journalists gives Best Drama to “The Social

perceived as the Oscar winner.

Team Weinstein underestimates their hard work and is in shock when The King's Speech wins the PGA jin

wins the DGA and the actors win the SAG Ensemble. The BAFTAs reinforced the lead. They are now the front

The Daily Mail announces Her Royal Highness, Queen Elizabeth has enjoyed a private screening of “The
King’s Speech” and is moved by the film. With no proof the Queen has actually seen the film, the
Weinstein Company sends out a global press release thanking her Majesty for the endorsement. They also
acknowledge Prime Minister David Cameron’s private Christmas screening.

On Oscar night, it isn't until Hilary Swank surprisingly yells out Hooper's name for Best Director that
Harvey's gang finally realizes they are getting the Oscar for Best Picture. The King has spoken.

Cairo. I tell him I'm rooting for Annette and love her film “The Kids Are All Right”. Warren tells me
“The Social Network” will win.

The sheer volume of phone traffic shows the frequency of Epstein’s massages, many of which were

The day after his attempt to pressure the Washington Post, he asked Greenwald to drop
everything he was doing and immediately fly to Hong Kong. He had, it will be recalled, already
sent Poitras an enciphered file, and told her she would get the key once she and Greenwald
followed his instructions. Presumably, he wanted Greenwald’s story and the video done in Hong
Kong before he became a suspect. If they had immediately flown to Hong Kong that May, it still
might have left Snowden an escape window.

As Snowden found out, when dealing with journalists, things do not always go as planned.
Greenwald, although agreeing to come to Hong Kong, waited in New York for two days while
the Guardian editors completed their due diligence. Poitras waited with him. As a result of this
delay, Snowden’s clock ran out. Greenwald and Poitras did not arrive at his hotel in Hong Kong
until June 3° It would be only hours before he became a prime suspect. “It was a nervous
period,” Snowden recalled. Although he bravely told the Guardian, “there was no risk of
compromise/” That claim was, at best, wishful thinking on his part.

By this time, he was no longer invisible. Not only had he registered at the hotel under his true
name and provided his credit card, but he was he in contact with three high-profile journalists,
two well-known hacktavists and, as he suggested to Gellman, a foreign diplomatic mission. Even
if Snowden had failed to persuade the Washington Post to publish a coded identifier, the mission’s
interest would likely be piqued when the newspaper published it first story on June 5. Even if
adversary intelligence services had missed Snowden and his archive of NSA documents earlier in
May, they would not neglect the availability of such a prize after the NSA stories broke in the
Guardian and Washington Post on June 5. Greenwald even went on TV in Hong Kong,
revealing to every interested intelligence service, in the unlikely event that that they did not
already know, that a defector from the NSA was in Hong Kong.

Now there was no point in keeping his identity a secret. On June 9 Poitras released the
famous video showing Snowden a secret NSA documents, At this point, Snowden shone so
brightly as a beacon that every player in the in the intelligence game would realize that Snowden
was a pawn to be captured.

Snowden still was able to fog over his travel plans, at least in the media, by telling reporters
that he intended to remain in Hong Kong and fight extradition in court, but certainly the Russian
officials whom he contacted knew he had other plans. They had even relayed his request to go to
Russia to Putin. His movements were also no secret to sophisticated intelligence services. In an
era in Hong Kong ii which cell phones emit their GPS location every 3 seconds and CCTV
cameras scan many street intersections, it is not easy to conceal one’s whereabouts. In
Snowden’s case, his photograph was constantly on television, posters and giant billboards. Even
if he threw away his own phone, his retinue of lawyers and helpers could be tracked with ease.

China, who’s President, Xi Jinping was meeting President Obama for the first time in Rancho
Mirage, California on June 9, would have certainly been keenly interested in the unfolding
Snowden affair. After all, Obama had publically put on his agenda that week calling Xi to task for
Chinese cyber espionage. Such a charge was undermined by Snowden’s globally-publicized
accusation that the United States was engaged in massive cyber espionage. In any event, as US
intelligence verified, China had, almost immediately after the release of the video, instituted a full
court press of Snowden in Hong Kong. Its security apparatus presumably had the means to
monitor his room as well as those of Poitras and Greenwald. From that moment on, it is not
likely that any communication or movement, Snowden made during his next 18 days in Hong
Kong would escape its scrutiny.
